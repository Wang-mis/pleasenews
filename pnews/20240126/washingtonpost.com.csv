As a former Buffalonian, my heart goes out to Bills fans this week. Send kicking and news tips to: cristiano.lima@washpost.com. Below: Meta makes changes to comply with European rules, and a major retailer faces a facial recognition lawsuit. First:
A wave of misleading robocalls in the New Hampshire primary mimicking the voice of President Biden is rekindling calls for artificial intelligence regulations ahead of the 2024 general election.
As my colleague Meryl Kornfield reported Monday, voters in the state received calls ahead of the tally “from what sounded like a digitally generated voice impersonating President Biden that advised them not to vote.” The robocall told primary voters that it was “important that you save your vote for the November election.”
The office of New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella (R) said the “message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications” and that his office is investigating it as an apparent “unlawful attempt to disrupt” the primary and “suppress New Hampshire voters.”
The robocalls spotlighted how digitally altered or AI-generated media could be used to undermine the 2024 elections and reignited calls by officials for federal action.
“It’s very clear that of all the potential problems posed by generative AI — deepfakes are the most immediate cause for concern,” Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.) told The Technology 202.
Clarke and other lawmakers have introduced a bevy of bills in the past year to tackle concerns that AI could sow discord during U.S. elections:
Federal law already bans campaigns from “fraudulently” misrepresenting themselves “as speaking or writing … on behalf of any other candidate or political party” in a damaging way.
Advocates have called on the Federal Election Commission to go a step further and make explicit that those rules apply to AI, but it remains to be seen whether the agency will act. Its chairman recently told your host that the FEC will “resolve” the matter “by early summer” — in other words, well into election season.
“We cannot wait until the fall to do this. This is already happening,” Klobuchar told MSNBC on Monday, adding that robocalls as seen on Monday have “the potential to destroy democracy.”
The fake Biden robocall marked just the latest instance that a suspected AI-generated clip stoked fears or sparked debate on the 2024 campaign trail.
The Republican National Committee last year released an ad bashing Biden in his own voice that it said was generated with AI, drawing rebukes from Democratic campaign officials.
A super PAC backed by Silicon Valley insiders, meanwhile, last week released an AI-driven chatbot touting the campaign of long-shot Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips, as Meryl and Elizabeth Dwoskin reported.
It marked “one of the first known uses of artificial intelligence in a political campaign,” they wrote. (OpenAI, whose technology was used to power the bot, later suspended the tool’s developer.)
A Democratic congressional candidate in Pennsylvania has also used an “artificial intelligence volunteer” to ring up voters and campaign, as Politico reported.
In the absence of congressional or federal regulatory action, dozens of states have introduced measures to address concerns about AI-generated content in campaigns, according to the advocacy group Public Citizen, which is pushing for new regulations in the space.
Meta announced on Monday that it will allow users to unbundle their accounts across Facebook, Instagram and other services before the European Union’s new competition rules come into force in March, The Verge’s Jon Porter reports.
“The changes mean that E.U. users will be able to use many of Meta’s services without their information being shared between them,” according to the report. “People will be able to use Facebook Messenger as a stand-alone service without a Facebook account, for example, and if they’ve previously linked their Facebook and Instagram accounts they’ll be able to unlink them.”
The changes, which will apply in the E.U., the European Economic Area and Switzerland, arrive ahead of the bloc’s landmark Digital Markets Act rules, which require major tech companies to make many of their products interoperable with other services.
A case of violent prison abuse underscores the dangers posed by law enforcement’s use of facial recognition technology, my colleague Drew Harwell reports.
Attorneys for Harvey Murphy Jr., 61, say he was “sexually assaulted in jail after being falsely accused of armed robbery due to a faulty facial recognition match,” Drew writes. He was “beaten and raped by three men in a Texas jail bathroom in 2022 after being booked on charges he’d held up employees at gunpoint inside a Sunglass Hut in a Houston shopping center, according to a lawsuit he filed last week.”
Murphy was arrested after Macy’s facial recognition technology led the store to claim he had robbed both the Macy’s store and Sunglass Hut.
However, according to his lawyers, at the time, “Murphy was in a Sacramento jail on unrelated charges, nearly 2,000 miles away. Hours after his sexual assault, prosecutors released him with all charges dropped.”
Murphy is now suing Macy’s, Sunglass Hut’s parent company, and three other people, and seeking $10 million in damages. “The assault left him with ‘lifelong injuries,’” he says, according to the report.
Even though retailers deploy the technology more and more, its “accuracy is highly dependent on technical factors — the cameras’ video quality, a store’s lighting, the size of its face database — and a mismatch can lead to dangerous results,” the report notes.
Just last month, the Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement with Rite Aid in a separate suit about facial recognition misuse, in which the pharmacy chain said it would not use the technology for five years.
Apple has paid Russia a $12.3 million fine after the country’s competition watchdog found the tech giant abused its dominance through its app store, the Financial Times’ Anastasia Stognei and Michael Acton report.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) announced Monday that it received the payment after a court ruling in November found that Apple barred app developers from letting users know they could pay for purchases outside of its app store.
“The payment will go directly to the Russian budget, boosting the Kremlin’s coffers at a time when President Vladimir Putin’s government is raising funds to support record defence spending on prosecuting the war in Ukraine,” according to the report.
Apple and the U.S. Treasury did not immediately return requests for comment, the FT wrote.

The recall covers 2023 Model S, X and Y vehicles equipped with Tesla’s full self-driving technology. The rearview camera issue was discovered when the company received complaints in December, according to a timeline released by NHTSA. There are no injuries or deaths associated with the problem, according to the agency.
Regulators said the company has already released a free over-the-air software update to remedy the problem, with owner notification letters to be separately mailed March 22.
This is not the first Tesla software issue identified as a potential risk by regulators. The company over the years has issued multiple recalls related to its software, most recently in December, when it recalled about 2 million vehicles.
Recalling almost every Tesla in America won’t fix safety issues, experts say
It’s the latest bit of bad news this week for Tesla. The company’s stock price swooned Thursday after chief executive Elon Musk failed to address investors’ concerns related to price cuts and other business issues. The company has repeatedly cut prices to keep sales volume up, contributing to a 38 percent increase in deliveries, but revenue has hardly increased.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday."

I can never seem to get enough of them, which is why I find this recipe — which provides an entire pan full — so enticing. In it, mounds of grated parmesan cheese are baked to form crunchy golden disks beneath tender, lightly smashed broccoli florets. The cheese acts as a savory platform for each piece of broccoli, staying a bit pliable where it touches the vegetable, and forming a deep brown, crunchy matrix around it.
The parmesan layer is essentially a type of Italian frico, typically served as an appetizer or snack, where mounds of grated cheese are baked or cooked in a skillet until they become cracker-like crisps. After drooling over several social media videos which employed frico as a base layer for different vegetables, such as potatoes, sliced squash or Brussels sprouts, I couldn’t resist giving it a whirl with broccoli. As you can see from this recipe, it is a simple way to elevate the vegetable to a wow-inspiring side dish.
Get the recipe: Crispy Parmesan Smashed Broccoli
The broccoli is blanched first, until it is just tender but still bright green, which takes just a couple of minutes. Then it’s patted dry — an important step so excess moisture doesn’t interfere with the cheese crisping up later. You can cook the broccoli ahead and store it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, but in that case I suggest plunging it into an ice bath after draining it to stop the cooking. You could also substitute frozen, thawed broccoli florets, or use a different vegetable such as cauliflower.
Then you place small mounds of grated parmesan cheese onto a parchment-lined sheet pan, put a piece of broccoli on top of each, and use the bottom of a glass to smash the broccoli a bit, flattening it somewhat into the cheese. After a brushing of olive oil, and sprinkle of garlic powder and pepper, it goes into the oven. (No salt is needed because the cheese adds enough saltiness.)
After just about 8 minutes the cheese becomes brown and crisp, like a halo around each broccoli floret. A 10-minute rest in the pan allows it to crisp further and makes each one easy to scoop up from the pan with a spatula. It’s a side dish that goes well with just about any roasted protein, and is a treasure for crispy cheese lovers — providing plenty of crunchy, golden, savory-ness for everyone at the table.

0ELWEJ7DPH_PG6DW4XZ4HUQJBS,How soon could Trump have the nomination wrapped up?,Amber Phillips,"January 24, 2024 at 6:50 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/trump-primary-nomination-republican-haley/,"Donald Trump is on track to make this the shortest primary season in recent presidential history.
Just two states have voted so far. But he has won both, and a look at the math and polling in the states to come suggests that Trump could win the nomination by mid-March — even though former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley says she is staying in the race, and voting goes through June.
The last time the nominee in competitive primaries was evident so quickly was in 2004. In recent elections, the race for the nomination in both parties has been drawn out until May or even June.
Trump is on track to win the Republican presidential nomination mathematically, by securing enough delegates to be the party’s nominee, and politically, by having everyone assume there are no viable competitors left who can beat him.
Here’s how quickly he could win — and what could go wrong for him.

There are 2,429 delegates awarded in the Republican primaries. To secure the nomination, a candidate needs to win 1,215 delegates, which is exactly one more than half the total.
So far, only 62 have been awarded, but half of them have gone to Trump.
“If you look at the calendar and the number of delegates awarded, the earliest time mathematically someone could get to 1,215 is March 12,” said Nicole Schlinger, an Iowa-based Republican consultant.
1/5
But that would require winning every single delegate, and not even Trump can wrap up the nomination that quickly. That’s because in many states, the second-place winner gets delegates, too.
For example, South Carolina Republicans will award all their 50 delegates to the winner. But Iowa and New Hampshire have a proportional system. Iowa gave 20 of its 40 delegates to Trump because he got about half of the vote in last week’s caucuses. In New Hampshire, Trump won more than 50 percent of the vote and got 11 of the state’s 22 delegates.
So the likelier outcome for Haley is that by staying in the race, she just delays Trump’s win.
Trump’s campaign predicted before voting even began that he could win the nomination by March, especially with a strong performance on Super Tuesday, March 5, which is when nearly 900 delegates in more than a dozen states are awarded.
Tracking the 2024 Republican delegate count
It could soon get harder for Haley to credibly argue she should stay in the race. She didn’t win what may be her friendliest primary state on the calendar.
“This is it. This is her only shot,” said Republican strategist Sarah Longwell, speaking of Haley in the New Hampshire primary before the results were in. “She has to win in New Hampshire for there to be any race.”
“It’s not mathematically over by any stretch,” said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, “but politically it could be over pretty quickly.”
Other Republican strategists thought Haley could make it a race if she came within a few percentage points of Trump in New Hampshire, followed by a similar margin in South Carolina’s primary at the end of February, and on and on. But at some point, she has to start winning states to overtake Trump in the delegate count. Her time could be running out.
“She can hang around until Super Tuesday,” one strategist said. “After that, she’s done.”
Haley could have donors urging her to stay in the race for several just-in-case reasons. Because as anti-climactic as this primary seems, it could take some wild, unprecedented turns.
Trump has  quite a few legal perils ahead. He could be on trial in the spring, during the busiest part of the primary season, on dozens of felony charges, some of them related to his efforts to hold on to power after losing the 2020 election. Some polls suggest that a conviction for election-related crimes could turn off some of his voters, but a conviction probably won’t come during the primary season.
He’s also 77, which would make him the second-oldest American president ever, and he has had a few mental slip-ups lately — all the more magnified given his attacks on President Biden’s age. Trump appears to be in good health, but both he and Biden are old enough that their mental sharpness and physical fitness are of concern to voters (although Biden’s more so than Trump’s).
And the Supreme Court could weigh in any day now on whether Trump can be on a ballot at all, given his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
All of this could prompt the kind of seismic shift in the Republican field that Haley needs to win. But as one Republican strategist put it, hope is not a great campaign strategy.
Trump and Biden won their respective New Hampshire primary elections. Here are the results, biggest takeaways and what exit polls showed.

Who is running? The top contenders for the GOP 2024 nomination are former president Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was dropping out just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. For the Democrats, President Biden is running for reelection in 2024.

0I3ISIACYD_HAOCJ96KXOR734R,Kharkiv’s air defense struggles to halt nonstop Russian missiles,Siobhán O'Grady,"January 25, 2024 at 10:27 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/25/kharkiv-air-defense-russia-missile/,"NORTH OF KHARKIV, Ukraine — The 59-year-old air defense unit soldier had just started his shift in a patch of snowy woods near the Russian border early Tuesday when a bright light blazed across the horizon.
He grabbed his radio and barked an urgent message: “I see flashes and hear outgoing booms!”
The soldier knew they were ballistic missiles, launched from inside Russia. But there was no time to stop them — and no weapon in his unit’s arsenal that could.
Seconds later, the missiles crashed into Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, flattening a residential building and destroying other civilian infrastructure. Ten people, including a child, were killed, and dozens of others were wounded. Some victims were trapped for hours under the rubble.
“I understood they would fly and hit people, and that I couldn’t do anything to prevent it from happening,” said the soldier, who spoke on the condition that he be identified by his call sign, Grandpa, in keeping with military rules. The pain of that helplessness, he said, was a feeling he “couldn’t express in words.”
Russia hit Kharkiv, which sits just 19 miles south of the border, three times on Tuesday: first at 4 a.m., then just after 7 a.m., and again close to 10 p.m. Twice, the city’s air raid siren warning civilians to take shelter went off only after the explosions had begun.
The barrages, which Ukraine said were combined attacks launched in part from S-300 systems inside Russia, were the latest in a series of recent strikes that appear aimed in part to exploit weak points in Ukraine’s air defense systems. The second of Tuesday’s three salvos, which Grandpa witnessed during his shift, was a combined attack that also hit Kyiv and the southeastern Dnipro region.
The missile strikes show that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to destroy Ukraine rather than allow the country to pursue an independent, democratic future in the European Union. They also show that Ukraine still does not have enough air defenses even after the West supplied Kyiv with an array of systems including NASAMS, Iris-Ts, Gepards, Stingers and more.
The use of such systems came under scrutiny Wednesday, after Russia accused Ukraine of shooting down a military transport airplane in nearby Belgorod, which Moscow said was carrying dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Ukraine has not denied downing the plane but officials said they had not confirmed that POWs were on board.
For Russia, Kharkiv makes for one of the easiest targets. The city is so close to the border that even modern air defense systems like the American-designed Patriot, which Ukraine uses in Kyiv, would struggle to respond in time to high-speed missiles moving on a ballistic trajectory. The proximity to Russia’s launch sites means the time between launch and landing typically is less than one minute.
In Ukraine’s northeast, fears rise of second Russian occupation
Grandpa belongs to the 113th Territorial Defense Brigade, in a unit tasked with protecting the skies north of Kharkiv city. To do so, his unit relies on a Soviet-era ZU-23-2, a trophy weapon seized from Russian troops who left it behind when they retreated from the nearby city of Kupyansk in September 2022.
The mobile system, which is mounted to the back of a truck, can strike only targets that travel below the speed of sound. These include the growing number of drones launched each day from Russia, such as Iranian-made Shaheds and explosive FPVs, or first-person-view drones. Some of those weapons are aimed at troops stationed north of the city, an area Russia stormed and occupied early in 2022. Others target Kharkiv itself, which Russia never managed to seize.
Recently, however, Moscow seems to have set its sights once again on Kharkiv and the surrounding region, which it abandoned during Ukraine’s lightning-fast counteroffensive in September 2022.
Makhno, 38, commander of the air defense unit, said that in the past month, a growing number of diversion groups — made up of five to 20 Russian troops at a time — have crossed the border into Ukraine to stoke fear in border communities and seize prisoners who might have information about Ukrainian troop movements and shift changes.
Russian forces have also struck the city repeatedly while reinforcing their troop positions from other angles, including east of Kupyansk. In the past four weeks alone, missile strikes in Kharkiv destroyed two hotels and damaged hundreds of buildings. The first strike on Tuesday also hit a gas pipeline and a school. Attacks like these are why students who attend school in person in this city now do so in makeshift classrooms built in train stations underground.
Kharkiv’s subways are now classrooms as school starts under Russian attacks
“We have a lot of fear and anxiety,” said Larisa Kulakova, the main preschool education specialist in Kharkiv. “The city is getting shelled more and more.”
On Tuesday afternoon, at a military position between Kharkiv and the border, troops in the brigade’s air defense unit — dressed in white snowsuits to blend in with the wintry landscape — paced around, preparing to respond to more incoming strikes. One stood in the bed of the truck, peering through binoculars for incoming drones and missiles.
“The position is constantly tense,” said Makhno, whose call sign is a nod to a famous Ukrainian revolutionary who died in 1934.
Belgorod, in western Russia, hit hard as Ukraine retaliates for airstrikes
Delays in arms deliveries from partners in Europe and the United States, he said, have put his troops — who have fought in eastern Ukraine since 2014 — on the back foot. “The world is wasting time deciding ‘Should we give them weapons, should we not?’” Makhno said. “We need to be two steps ahead of the enemy.”
Another soldier, who goes by the call sign Strilok, or Shooter, said that when missiles are headed for the city, “we definitely feel we can’t do anything.” The best way to stop the strikes, he said, would be to use a U.S. High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, to hit the launch sites in Russia. But Washington, which provided the systems, has barred Ukraine from using them to hit targets within Russia — a limitation Strilok called “absurd.”
As Makhno’s troops scanned the sky, rescue workers just down the road in Kharkiv waded through the remains of the apartment complex a missile hit that morning. Anxious friends and relatives of the missing stood by, hoping for miracles in freezing temperatures and clouds of smoke.
In Kharkiv, ambulance crews await shelling — and a new year of war
In neighboring apartment blocks, survivors dragged their belongings out of their shattered homes as volunteers arrived to help board up their windows. Sasha Terekhovich, 33, woke up to the first round of strikes on Tuesday and moved from her bedroom to her living room couch — a decision she said saved her life. One of the missiles from the next round crashed into the building next to her, blowing all her windows into her home.
“In Kharkiv, if something is headed here, it’s going to hit,” she said.
Around 12:30 on Tuesday, a 60-year-old man named Viacheslav sat crouched outside the wreckage of the apartment block, waiting for news about relatives. His wife’s ex-husband, Valera, and Valera’s wife, Yulia, lived on the first floor. The two couples are close; they share children and grandchildren. For the first 17 minutes after the strike, they could see that Valera and Yulia’s phone numbers still appeared as “online” on messaging apps. Then they disconnected.
Hours passed with no news. Viacheslav’s stepson checked nearby hospitals for his father, with no luck. Viacheslav’s wife called for an update. “They’re digging through the rubble,” he told her.
Hours later, workers pulled a body out of the wreckage and placed it in a black plastic bag. Relatives of the missing gathered around. One woman, searching for friends from the fourth floor, held a lock of hair and an earring as potential clues. Another woman, in a red hat and jacket, told a police officer that her daughter and granddaughter were still missing. She described them, and he took her information to connect her with the morgue.
The body in the bag was a woman, the officer, Maxim Melnychenko, 43, said. “She was boiled,” he said. “We couldn’t show them her face because it’s too disturbing.”
She’s 16. The war in Ukraine wrecked her city — and her childhood.
As dusk set in, rescue workers, who had gently sifted through debris to look for survivors earlier, began digging more aggressively. Hours later, powerful explosions struck the city again. More civilians were wounded. More rescue workers rushed to the scene.
Again, the air defense unit north of the city saw the missiles headed to Kharkiv. Again, there was nothing they could do.
The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.
The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.
The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

0OWNM046KZ_9WJUACXJU6HG7SJ,"As GOP rivals collapse, Wall Street warms to second Trump term",Jeff Stein,"January 24, 2024 at 12:52 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/24/trump-wall-street-donors/,"Wall Street executives who had pined for a GOP alternative to Donald Trump face a stark dilemma after Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary appeared to affirm that Trump is on his way to becoming his party’s presidential nominee for the third consecutive election.
By the end of Trump’s first term, many of the biggest names in corporate America and high finance were openly criticizing Trump over his denial that he lost the 2020 election and his subsequent role in fueling the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. But with Trump likely to face President Biden again this year, some business titans have publicly softened their opposition in recent days, potentially signaling a desire to work with Trump if he lands back in the White House.
Companies backed Trump for years. Now they’re facing a reckoning after the attack on the Capitol.
Trump advisers have begun reaching out to some of the top donors to Ron DeSantis after the Republican Florida governor suspended his campaign Sunday, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private talks. Although former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has a fundraiser scheduled with top donors in Manhattan for Jan. 30, some Trump advisers are optimistic that some of her wealthiest backers could also be up for grabs after she lost the first two Republican primary contests, the people said.
“You have many Republican donors who thought they’d cut their last check to Trump getting ready to open their wallets again very quickly,” said one GOP strategist, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations. “There may be stages of grief, but they’ve largely already cycled through them by now, and it’s just a matter of time and scale for how they come in for Trump.”
1/5
Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as a Trump spokesman and is now managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, said the recent World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland, showed that Wall Street is already warming to Trump. Scaramucci is now a Trump critic.
“Based on my observation of the executives at Davos, public interviews and private conversations, my view is that the Wall Street people think Donald Trump is going to win. So the resistance is already softening,” Scaramucci said. People on Wall Street “are preparing for another Trump presidency and some are quietly liking it because they see it as another phase of deregulation and pro-business growth ideas, but you have to be careful what you wish for.”
The choice facing top donors reflects the broader challenge facing corporate America: Executives and wealthy backers alike are torn between what they see as the pro-growth economic policies of Republicans and what they regard as the potential dangers of another Trump term, including massive new immigration restrictions, a global trade war and the destabilization of democratic institutions. The relationship between corporate America and the GOP hit a low point after the Capitol insurrection, and many influential business leaders denounced Trump.
Wall Street leaders, however, appear to be tempering their criticisms now with Trump emerging again as a credible contender for the White House, in what strategists widely interpret as an attempt to smooth over the previous tensions between the business community and the former president. In Davos, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon criticized “negative talk about MAGA” and said demonizing Trump supporters was a mistake, as he praised aspects of Trump’s first-term record.
“Just take a step back, be honest: He was kind of right about NATO, kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well; tax reform worked. He was right about some of China. I don’t like how he said things about Mexico, I don’t like — but he wasn’t wrong about some of these critical issues,” Dimon said of Trump. Dimon was discussing Trump’s view that  NATO member countries besides the United States should pay more as part of the military alliance.
Largest donor to DeSantis presidential bid considering switch to Trump
In 2018, during Trump's first term, Dimon sometimes took a harsher line as he flirted with his own presidential bid.
“I think I could beat Trump … because I’m as tough as he is; I’m smarter than he is,” Dimon said then. “And by the way, this wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money; it wasn’t a gift from Daddy.”
Other business leaders have sounded similar notes.
In 2022, Steve Schwarzman, chief executive of the massive private equity firm Blackstone, said, “It is time for the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders, and I intend to support one of them in the presidential primaries,” according to CNBC.
At Davos this year, however, Schwarzman declined to rule out supporting Trump.
“I think we have to see what happens,” he said.
Executives on Wall Street and elsewhere in corporate America benefited from many aspects of the Trump presidency. The president in 2017 signed legislation that cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and lowered some individual taxes for the highest earners, and Trump’s administration also advanced a deregulatory agenda that business groups widely lauded.
But those benefits were offset by other policies, including Trump’s expensive tariffs on China — largely maintained by Biden — and a whirlwind global trade policy. Trump is threatening to dramatically expand those disruptive trade policies, discussing putting 10 percent tariffs on $3 trillion in annual imports. (Most of the costs of such tariffs are typically paid by companies trading with China or by consumers through higher prices, not by the Chinese government or Chinese firms directly.) He is also proposing mass deportations of immigrants if elected, another measure likely to meet strong resistance on Wall Street and in corporate America.
Even so, corporate America might gain more from Trump. He has eyed cutting the corporate tax rate again, and many executives oppose the Biden administration’s efforts to raise the corporate rate to 28 percent and impose a new wealth tax on billionaires.
Behind closed doors, Trump eyes second round of corporate tax cuts
“People in business will fall in line with whoever is the next president, and in the case of Trump, you saw that with Jamie Dimon’s views,” said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an economic consulting firm.
Sri-Kumar cited the tough stances taken by the regulators appointed by Biden to lead the Federal Trade Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission: “There has been a lot of regulation from the FTC and SEC over the last four years, and those are more of a concern for businesses than immigration, which is more of a long-term issue.”
On questions of upholding democracy, Kumar added: “If you’re responsible to your shareholders and your shareholders judge you on your profitability, that can come from a more or less democratic administration.”
Trump promises to stop inflation. But would his plans actually help?
Some analysts argue that Trump is good for investors, even if a renewed trade war could drag on growth.
“Investors know President Trump was good for markets last time and is quite likely to be good for markets next time,” said Stephen Miran, who served as a senior adviser for economic policy in the Treasury Department during Trump’s administration. “As long as you create an overall economic policy mix that will boost the economy and compensate for any drags in one part of the policy agenda, overall the economy could do quite well.”
Stocks performed well under Trump, but they have also soared under the Biden presidency, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high earlier this month amid strong signs of economic growth for this year.
For now, it remains unclear precisely how many of the big donors to DeSantis or Haley will migrate to the former president. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, a top donor to DeSantis and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie — who also suspended his presidential bid as Trump surged — declined to comment on whether he would donate to Trump, as did hotel magnate Robert Bigelow, who donated $20 million to a DeSantis super PAC and has publicly suggested he could flip to Trump.
“Some business leaders will say, ‘Isn’t it bad to have a wildly unstable society, and bad for profits if we pull out of NATO and embolden Russia’s ambitions in Ukraine?’” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “But I think Wall Street is overall going to be very reluctant to speak out against Trump. There’s going to be some whiplash.”

0TT50QCBFO_CX96VE25BO1V0X8,Florida removes sociology as core course option for public colleges,Praveena Somasundaram,"January 25, 2024 at 10:33 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/25/florida-sociology-core-course-removal/,"Florida will no longer allow a sociology course to count toward students’ graduation requirements at state universities, replacing it with a class that officials say will teach “factual history” in a decision critics say was fueled by political motivations.
The 17-member Florida Board of Governors, which oversees public universities in the state, on Wednesday removed a “Principles of Sociology” class from its list of approved core course options, despite outcry from some sociology professors. The board replaced the sociology requirement with a course called “Introductory Survey to 1877,” which members said will provide a “historically accurate account of America’s founding, the horrors of slavery, the resulting Civil War, and the Reconstruction Era.”
When asked about the change, a spokesperson for Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. referred The Washington Post to a December tweet in which he claimed sociology had been “hijacked by left-wing activists and no longer serves its intended purpose.”
State universities, he added in the tweet, would “focus on preparing students for high-demand, high-wage jobs, not woke ideology.”
The American Sociological Association said in a statement Thursday that it was “outraged” by the change, which it argued stemmed from “a gross misunderstanding of sociology as an illegitimate discipline driven by ‘radical’ and ‘woke’ ideology.” The organization, which had previously written a public comment against the change, urged the Florida Board of Governors to reinstate sociology as a core course, saying the subject is “at the core of civic literacy.”
“Failure to prioritize the scientific study of the causes and consequences of human behavior is a failure of Florida’s commitment to providing high-quality civics education and workforce readiness,” the American Sociological Association said.
Most of the Board of Governors’ 17 members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate to serve seven-year terms. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) appointed a majority of the current board members.
Wednesday’s decision, which applies to the state university system’s 12 schools and more than 430,000 students, is the latest in a series of changes to Florida classrooms, which for years have been subject to restrictions on what can be taught about race, racism, history, sexual orientation and gender identity at both the K-12 and college levels.
The state has seen several high-profile fights over allegedly “woke” courses that conservatives claim reflect the ideological priorities of the political left. Many of these conflicts first centered on K-12 offerings.
Last year, Florida refused to accept a newly created Advanced Placement course on Black history, with a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education saying it “lacks educational value and is contrary to Florida law.” DeSantis blasted the class as “woke.” Florida also rejected a host of math and social studies textbooks for alleged references to prohibited subjects, including “critical race theory,” a legal framework examining systemic racism which has become a conservative catchall for politically motivated teaching about race.
In August, the state disallowed all AP Psychology classes because they violated some of Florida’s new restrictive education laws — although, after days of confusion, Florida’s education commissioner reversed the decision. And at one point, DeSantis threatened to rid Florida of all AP classes across the board, citing frustration with the College Board over courses the governor deemed left-leaning.
The removal of sociology as a core course option was first proposed in November. The Florida Board of Governors opened a two-week public comment period that month before voting to approve the change this week.
Jukka Savolainen, a sociology professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, who wrote an op-ed that Diaz referenced in his tweet about the social science being “woke,” said the board’s move was unsurprising given Florida’s political landscape.
Savolainen acknowledged in his op-ed a rift between sociology scholars who “are openly activists” and others who have stayed solely committed to the “science side.” He told The Post after the board’s decision that while he doesn’t support the move, he is concerned about activism becoming more commonplace in his field.
On Wednesday, students at Florida State University, where the Board of Governors meeting was held, gathered to protest the group’s decision to replace the sociology requirement.
Genesi Licona, a Florida State student who took the introductory sociology course, told WTXL: “It just allows me to look at every other one of my classes with a deeper understanding of why we do what we do as humans.”"
0Y8N604492_4V9NXVKM120PEN0,What a hand-cranked drill just revealed about the West’s ‘megadrought’,Dino Grandoni,"January 24, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/24/west-drought-trees/,"For the past several summers, Karen King crisscrossed the western United States in search of trees.
Using a hand-cranked drill, she bored into towering spruces high in the Rockies, Sierra Nevada and other mountains to unsheathe blocks of wood. She wanted to learn about the region’s past dry spells — to understand the current “megadrought” gripping the region.
“Your left bicep is a lot larger than your right bicep by the end of the summer,” said King, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. “I’m not kidding.”
All that hand-cranking paid off in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. She and her colleagues found the West’s two-decade drought is inextricably linked to climate change, adding to the evidence that human-caused emissions are reshaping the region in profound ways.
The study is part of an emerging field of tree-ring science squeezing more information than ever out of wood to understand past climates and prepare for what is to come as humans keep pumping heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.
“Our findings now demonstrate that the record-high temperatures driving recent ‘hot droughts’ are indeed unique and the human fingerprint on these events implicates us in their intensity and their consequences,” said Kevin Anchukaitis, a professor at the University of Arizona who co-wrote the paper with King.
As a tree grows thicker and taller each year, conditions outside its bark make indelible marks within. Scientists like King — called dendrochronologists — study tree rings to decipher the climates of ages before formal record-keeping, when trees were the sole sentinels.
During especially warm summers, cells of spruces and other trees build dense cell walls to retain water. By measuring the density of that dark “latewood” formed toward the end of the growing season, researchers can infer the high temperatures of ancient summers.
So King and her colleagues sampled cores from dozens of high-elevation spruces, hemlocks and firs from British Columbia to New Mexico. The emergence of the coronavirus in 2020, when King was finishing a PhD at the University of Idaho, didn’t slow her down after the campus closed.
“It was actually a blessing in disguise,” King said. “We got in the car, and we just drove around and collected cores all summer.”
“It was a really cathartic way to deal with the pandemic,” she added. “We were social-distancing in the middle of nowhere.”
Back in the lab, scientists shone a blue light on  samples to measure the wood’s density. The data, coupled with other data from x-ray scans of tree cores, allowed them to reconstruct summer-high temperatures dating back to the year 1553.
For years, researchers have known human-caused warming is making the current megadrought in the naturally drought-prone western United States worse. Past research on tree rings, which reconstructed soil moisture levels, found the region hasn’t been this dry for this long since the 16th century.
But until now, what was less clear was the role of temperature in past dry spells. Were they due to excessive heat, or just a lack of precipitation? “We were unable to disentangle the potential role of temperature in past megadroughts, which were severe events that occurred naturally,” Anchukaitis said.
In the new study, the team found that lengthy droughts in the past, such as a 22-year one that hit the region in the late 16th century, were not necessarily hotter than normal.
By contrast, the team found the period from 2000 to 2020 to have been the warmest two-decade span of the past half-millennium across much of the West, including the Southwest and Pacific Northwest. In the Great Plains, the period ranks second behind the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression.
“Modern megadrought conditions are in fact warmer and more influenced by warming temperatures than in the past,” King said.
So far, the megadrought’s consequences have been severe.
One of the region’s arteries, the Colorado River, which serves 40 million people, is in crisis after reservoirs fell to dangerously low levels, prompting the Biden administration to step in to conserve water. This summer, Phoenix recorded the hottest month ever observed in an American city, with hospitals treating victims burned by pavement.
Brad Udall, a water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University, noted the new research confirms past work showing the current “hot drought” is historically unusual.
“This study provides yet another depressing look at how and why human-caused climate change is affecting the American West. In short, high temperatures create more intense droughts,” said Udall, who was not involved in the study. “My simple advice for Western water and land managers: Buckle up. The fires and droughts of the last 20 years are going to get much worse, given current greenhouse gas emission trends.”
For King, the crisis today is all the more reason to probe trees for clues about past climates.
“Why study the past?” she said. “It’s the idea that we can learn from the past and use our observations of trends and values to understand future risk.”
She added, “That’s really the value of what we do.”"
1CHMP9N3CT_6FWZZ4VPXSRDA59,"On Roe v. Wade anniversary, Harris takes abortion fight to Wisconsin",Cleve R. Wootson Jr.,"January 22, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/harris-abortion-rights-wisconsin-roe/,"Vice President Harris is traveling to the battleground state of Wisconsin on Monday, the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court decision granting a constitutional right to abortion, to urge greater reproductive freedom as she centers herself in Democrats’ effort to galvanize voters worried about the erosion of reproductive rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.
Eighteen months after the Supreme Court overruled Roe, Democrats see the issue of abortion as central to President Biden’s reelection effort. A day after her Wisconsin speech, Harris will join the president, along with both of their spouses, at a campaign rally in Northern Virginia “to highlight the stakes of this election for a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions,” according to the Biden-Harris campaign.
Since the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decreed that abortion rights should be left to the states, Democrats have won a string of electoral victories, fueling the party’s hopes that the abortion issue will propel Biden to reelection despite his low approval ratings. Former president Donald Trump, who is seeking the White House for a third time, has taken credit for the Dobbs decision after he cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court by appointing three justices to the nine-member bench.
Democrats have sought to cast that decision as harmful to women and out-of-touch with everyday Americans, and they have warned that if Republicans retake the White House, America would lurch closer to more draconian restrictions, including a national abortion ban.
On Monday, a pair of dueling events in Wisconsin will underscore the divide and the parties’ competing efforts to mobilize voters on each pole. In Madison, the Republican-controlled legislature will hold a public hearing on a bill calling for a statewide referendum on a 14-week abortion ban. Seventy miles away, in the Milwaukee suburbs, Harris will blast such efforts to further restrict reproductive freedom.
The White House said Monday’s event will kick off a “nationwide reproductive freedoms tour” for Harris, with the times and places of her additional stops yet to be announced. She is expected to highlight the stories of women who have been harmed by the various abortion restrictions imposed by individual states since Roe was overturned.
Harris’s tour is the latest sign that Biden’s team increasingly sees the vice president as an important electoral asset, given her ability to reach audiences, including younger voters and people of color, whose enthusiasm for the president appears to be slipping. Last fall, Harris undertook a month-long “fight for our freedoms tour,” visiting colleges to talk about gun control and other issues.
Most Republican leaders continue to push opposition to abortion as a moral and political cause, though some acknowledge it has hurt them politically. Trump, who leads the polling for the GOP presidential nomination by a wide margin, has aired ads boasting that he “delivered” on abortion and lived “up to his promise” in overturning Roe, but he has not called for a national ban or embraced sweeping rhetoric that could alienate centrist voters.
Harris has honed her abortion message over the past 18 months, warning that the Supreme Court decision is an example of Republican overreach into American lives that will intensify if voters do not stop them at the ballot box. Young voters “just witnessed the highest court in our land take a freedom from them to make decisions about their own body, such that they will have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers,” the vice president said Thursday during remarks at the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
Harris’s supporters say her passion for reproductive choice is organic and closely intertwined with her career in public service. She is the first female vice president, and her Black and Asian identity may be particularly resonant given that abortion restrictions disproportionately affect minority women.
Within the White House, Harris has had more freedom to center herself in the fight for abortion access because of Biden’s discomfort with an issue where the politics of his party do not always mesh comfortably with his Catholic faith.
All this, Harris’s advisers hope, gives her a path to connect with an energized constituency in the 2024 election — and after.
In seizing on the issue, she has traveled to 20 states and held 50 meetings, according to her office, meeting with state legislators, attorneys general and health-care providers. More recently, she highlighted reproductive rights during her eight-state tour of college campuses, repeatedly linking the erosion of abortion rights with what she frames as other Republican efforts to curtail Americans’ freedoms.
“We are witnessing a full-on attack on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights,” Harris said on Jan. 6 in Myrtle Beach, S.C., at the annual women’s retreat of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the nation’s oldest historically Black denomination.
“Just consider: In states across our nation, extremists attack the freedom to vote. They have the gall to pass laws to ban drop boxes, to limit early voting, to make it illegal to offer food and water to people who stand in line for hours simply to exercise their civic duty and right,” she added. “In states across our nation, extremists pass laws that criminalize doctors and punish women who seek basic reproductive health care.”
Tracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat.
Abortion pills: The Supreme Court will decide this term whether to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Oral arguments are likely to be scheduled for the spring, with a decision by the end of June. For now, full access to mifepristone will remain in place.
Battles over access: Abortion access remains divisive politically and legally. In December, a pregnant woman in Texas lost her legal battle for permission to end her pregnancy. A Kentucky woman went to court asserting the state’s abortion restrictions violate her constitutional right to privacy.
Post-Roe America: With Roe overturned, women who had secret abortions before Roe v. Wade felt compelled to speak out. Other women who were seeking abortions while living in states with strict abortion bans also shared their experiences with The Post through calls, text messages and other documentation. Here are photos and stories from across America since the reversal of Roe v. Wade."
1HAOYJS9QG_64BLSZVYKLRWAKS,"Teamsters to meet with Trump, some members are furious",Lauren Kaori Gurley,"January 26, 2024 at 3:04 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/26/teamsters-trump/,"An upcoming meeting between former president Donald Trump and the Teamsters has rankled some of the union’s leaders and members, as Trump and President Biden compete for union support heading into the 2024 election season.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents about 1.3 million members including UPS and other transportation workers, said in a statement that union leadership and members will hold a “roundtable discussion” with Trump in Washington on Wednesday and invited Biden for a separate one the same day.
The meeting with Trump is the second this month for Teamsters President Sean O’Brien and comes a week after Biden secured a much-sought-after endorsement from the United Auto Workers.
The decision to meet again with Trump has drawn backlash from some left-leaning Teamsters members and leaders, though the union held talks with a presidential candidates across the political spectrum this December.
John Palmer, a Teamsters executive board member who received an invitation to the meeting, wrote a scathing letter Thursday to the union’s president, saying that he refused to attend and calling Trump a “known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.”
“This private back door decision will divide the union and weaken it at a time when we need to fight corporate America,” Palmer wrote.
Reached by phone, Palmer said that in past internal surveys, about half of Teamsters union members identify as Republicans, and that O’Brien “is appeasing them and convincing them he’s a viable choice. As a leader, your job is to tell members this person isn’t in their interest. … The idea that we would even talk to this man is offensive and repulsive.”
Chris Silvera, a leader of Teamsters Local 808 in New York City, said of the invitation to meet with Trump that he “does not support it because it is a meeting with the confederates.”
“There is nothing in Trump’s behavior that has indicated to anyone that he would be supportive of the labor movement,” Silvera said. “Let me put it this way, it’s as if I would travel to Rome to convince the Pope he should become a Muslim.”
Earlier this month, O’Brien met privately with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and posted a photo of the two posing together on social media.
The Teamsters endorsed Biden in August before the general election in 2020.
Some labor experts say that O’Brien could feel it’s important to get to know both candidates, because he was democratically elected by union membership in 2021 by running as a reform candidate who bucked traditions. He has taken his time to endorse, because he is aware that many of his members are Republicans and he promised them more involvement in union decision-making, they said.
“Our members want to hear from all candidates of all parties about what they plan to do for working people as President,” O’Brien wrote in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the union wants every candidate to understand that their “votes will not be taken for granted.”
Damian Kungle, a part-time UPS employee in Canton, Ohio, said while he’s “anything but a Trump guy,” he thinks it’s wise for the union to meet with any candidate who has a shot at winning. “Whoever wins at least we’ve had a conversation with everyone involved.”
Biden has received a stream of earlier-than-typical union endorsements this election cycle, including a June endorsement from the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest labor federation, and more than a dozen other unions. But a handful of influential unions, including the Teamsters, the American Postal Workers Union and the International Association of Fire Fighters, have chosen to continue to wield their endorsement as influence in Washington.
Biden has frequently touted his record with labor unions, while struggling at times to make inroads with working-class union members. His biggest wins for the labor movement include approving trillions of dollars in spending on infrastructure, semiconductor and climate packages that incentivize companies to hire union workers, as well as installing a labor advocate to lead the National Labor Relations Board, who has made it easier for workers to join unions.
Trump has also called himself “pro-worker,” positioning himself as an ally of the working class, while also supporting numerous policies that narrowed labor’s power. For example, he installed a leader at the National Labor Relations Board, widely opposed by unions, who weakened worker protections. Trump’s visit to Michigan during the UAW strike this fall featured a rally with autoworkers at a nonunion shop, while Biden joined striking workers on a picket line, becoming the first sitting president to do so.
Barry Anderson, a Teamsters union shop steward and machine operator in Yuba City, Calif., said he “understand[s] union leaders interviewing Democrats and Republicans, but if you’re going to vet someone from the conservative side, entertain those who have a history of being in a favor of labor. Donald Trump has showed consistently over his career that he’s against unions and the working class.”
The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment about whether the president had accepted the invitation to meet next week. The Teamsters also said it had extended an invitation to meet with Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley."
1OS5KQ4DRZ_G96M1YOHUG4ZJPV,Maine’s top court won’t weigh in for now on whether Trump can run,Patrick Marley,"January 25, 2024 at 9:26 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/trump-maine-ballot-court-ruling/,"Maine’s high court has declined for now to review whether Donald Trump can appear on the primary ballot in the state.
Wednesday’s ruling came two weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a similar case out of Colorado that contends that the former president is not eligible to run for office again because of his actions before and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision could resolve the issue for all states.
Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution bars from office those who engaged in insurrection after swearing an oath to uphold the Constitution. The amendment was ratified in 1868, and the clause was initially used to keep former Confederates from returning to power after the Civil War.
Trump’s critics have cited the measure in lawsuits that argue that Trump is banned from office because of the Jan. 6 attack. Colorado’s high court last month ruled that Trump should be taken off the primary ballot there, and a week later, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D) reached the same conclusion.
You asked: Can the 14th Amendment affect Trump’s eligibility to run in 2024?
Both decisions were put on hold while appeals proceed, so for now Trump’s name is slated to appear on the ballots for the March 5 primaries in those states. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the Colorado case Feb. 8.
Trump appealed Maine’s decision in state court, and a judge last week sent the case back to Bellows, saying she should issue a new decision after the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in.
Bellows appealed that ruling to Maine’s top court, which issued a decision Wednesday saying it was too early for that court to hear the case. The court can’t consider the case until a final decision has been issued by a lower court, and that hasn’t happened yet, the ruling said. There were no noted dissents.
Once the U.S. Supreme Court rules in the Colorado case, Bellows can issue a new decision based on whatever the justices decide. From there, the losing side can appeal to state court.
Trump and his allies have pushed back on the efforts to remove him from the ballot, saying he did not do anything that would prevent him from running.
In Iowa, Secretary of State Paul Pate (R) this month proposed legislation that would prevent challenges to candidates’ eligibility based on Section 3. The Des Moines Register earlier reported on Pate’s proposal."
1P8ETUH4EC_8WF9IRRCUQ0RIPF,"Detained Kentucky teens denied toilets, showers and clothes, suit says",Daniel Wu,"January 21, 2024 at 8:57 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/21/kentucky-youth-prison-abuse/,"Willow Neal was 17-years-old and seven months pregnant when she was sent to an isolation cell in the Adair Youth Development Center in Columbia, Ky., in November 2022, a new lawsuit alleges. She rarely left.
Neal was only let out of her cell five times to take a walk, and received just 12 showers during her month-long detention, isolation that went against the advice of her medical providers, according to the lawsuit.
In the cell next to Neal’s, 17-year-old Jamiahia Kennedy resorted to washing her body with her bra after being denied showers, according to the lawsuit. For two months, Kennedy was allegedly moved to a soiled padded cell without a bed or a working toilet.
Staff allegedly subjected other minors in the juvenile detention center to various abuses. One was held in an isolation cell without lights or running water, and another in a cell that had a Spanish version of the song “Baby Shark” playing on loop, the lawsuit states.
Neal and Kennedy, who are both now 18 and released from the detention center, described the alleged abuses in a class-action lawsuit filed Monday against the detention center, the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services and several employees who allegedly ignored repeated reports of poor conditions at the prison. The lawsuit adds to complaints the state’s juvenile justice system has faced over several years.
“It’s an open secret that the system has been completely dysfunctional for some time,” Laura Landenwich, an attorney for Neal and Kennedy who spoke on their behalf, told The Washington Post.
The Kentucky agencies named in the suit deny the allegations, said spokeswoman Morgan Hall, who added that the state “works tirelessly to provide safe and effective services to the juveniles in its care.”
“For any staff member who violates policy and procedure, corrective action is taken. We deny the allegations in the lawsuit and will defend accordingly,” Hall said.
The detention center houses around 40 minors at a time and holds pre- and post-conviction juvenile offenders as well as non-offenders in the custody of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, according to Neal and Kennedy’s lawsuit. The suit seeks damages for anyone who has been abused while held in isolation at the detention center.
Children detained at the center had restricted access to showers, restrooms and medical care, and were not provided educational instruction, according to the lawsuit. As punishment, staff allegedly withheld prescribed medications from detainees. Male staff conducted cell checks on girls detained without clothing, the suit alleged.
Neal passed through multiple foster homes and experienced abusive environments in foster care before being held at the detention center, Landenwich said. She was held at the center after being charged with stealing a vehicle, according to her attorney.
“She has been left to the whims of a system that is frankly, cruel,” Landenwich said. “ … No one’s been able to really effectively help her.”
While held in isolation, Neal, who had not yet finished high school, did not receive educational instruction and instead was given workbooks to complete, which conferred no school credit, the suit alleged. Neal, who was diagnosed with mental health conditions, did not receive mental health care or any prescribed medications while at the detention center, the court filings said.
Kennedy was allegedly only able to take 15 showers in the four months she was detained at the center. When she was transferred to a padded cell, she allegedly had her clothes cut off and was initially held without clothing or shower access for 12 days, the suit said. She also had medication withheld from her as a form of punishment, according to the suit.
Landenwich said the detention center’s pattern of mistreatment stemmed from chronic understaffing and poor training. It frequently operated with only five employees to oversee the facility’s 40 minors, according to the lawsuit.
Kentucky’s juvenile detention centers have long faced reports of mismanagement and neglect. In November 2022, a riot broke out at the Adair detention center, which left several youths and staff members wounded, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) in January 2023 pledged to raise pay for detention center staff — and arm them with pepper spray and Tasers. The state legislature in March approved two bipartisan bills that boosted funding for detention center salaries, facility upgrades and mental health care, including the establishment of a diversionary program that would send youths suffering from mental illnesses to facilities for treatment.
Landenwich said she is not convinced conditions have improved — and that any change would come too late for those who’ve already endured abuse.
Upon release from the center, Kennedy completed her high school education, got a job and is adjusting to a new start as an adult, Landenwich said. But Neal struggled with the lasting impacts of her detainment and lost custody of her child, who was born after Neal turned 18 and aged out of the foster care system, Landenwich added.
“She told me that she promised herself she’d never let her child get in the system,” Landenwich said. “And because she was so ill-equipped to care for the child, the state now has custody of her child and has put her in the exact same circumstance to suffer.”"
1QB0N9D8Y1_15620R6REVIW9FI,"ABilly Jones-Hennin, longtime advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, dies at 81",Harrison Smith,"January 24, 2024 at 8:26 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/24/abilly-jones-hennin-dead/,"At his first gay pride festival on the streets of Washington, ABilly S. Jones-Hennin stood fixed to the sidelines, a bystander nervous about joining the party even as he longed to participate. It was the mid-1970s, and Mr. Jones-Hennin, a Black bisexual who was born in the West Indies and raised in conservative Virginia, was wary of asserting his sexuality in public.
But as he watched the revelers flow by, holding hands and embracing, something shifted. “The parade showed me the numbers of people — of all ages and of all races and of all professions — who were like me. Different,” he recalled in a 1987 interview with The Washington Post. The festival, and the Pride celebrations that followed each June, helped him get to a place where “I can be me 24 hours a day.”
Within a few years of his first Pride festival, Mr. Jones-Hennin had become one of the region’s most prominent advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, especially on behalf of LGBTQ+ people of color.
He co-founded the first national organization for Black lesbians and gays, a group that began as a political coalition in Washington and Baltimore. He coordinated logistics for the first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, a 1979 event that drew an estimated 75,000 people, if not tens of thousands more. And that same year, he helped organize what is often described as the first LGBTQ+ delegation of color to go to the White House, where he and a dozen allies met with Carter administration aides to raise concerns about housing, health care and discrimination.
As conservatives organized against gay rights, Mr. Jones-Hennin “didn’t just lament what was happening,” said Victoria Kirby York, the public policy and programs director for the National Black Justice Coalition, an LGBTQ+ rights group. “He strategized, he organized and he got people who didn’t otherwise want to be in the same room together to be in the same room, knowing that was the only way we would reach liberation.”
Mr. Jones-Hennin continued his advocacy efforts for more than four decades, overseeing health programs in D.C. during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and shifting his focus to disability rights after his health declined in the late 1990s, when spinal stenosis began to limit his mobility. He was 81 when he died Jan. 19 at his home in Chetumal, Mexico, where he lived during the winter. He also had a home in Washington.
The cause was complications from Parkinson’s disease and spinal stenosis, said his husband, Cris Hennin.
A charismatic speaker with a flair for assembling coalitions that transcended divisions of race, gender and class, Mr. Jones-Hennin moved to the front lines of LGBTQ+ activism in 1978. At the time, Washington was predominantly Black, but the face of its LGBTQ+ community was White. Mr. Jones-Hennin had grown tired of being the only Black person regularly attending meetings of groups like the Gay Activists Alliance.
With a few like-minded activists, he co-founded the D.C. and Baltimore Coalition of Black Gays, holding the organization’s first meeting near Dupont Circle. The group evolved into the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays, with chapters in cities including New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, and championed what would later be called an intersectional approach to advocacy. Their tagline: “As proud of our gayness as we are of our blackness.”
“A gay identity and a Black identity were not compatible prior to that. You couldn’t bring it together,” said Gil Gerald, a co-founder who served as the group’s first paid executive director. (The organization fractured in the late 1980s and was succeeded by organizations like the National Black Justice Coalition.) “Gay was White. Black? Well, that was Black.” He called Mr. Jones-Hennin “the progenitor, the spark,” adding, “We found our voice through his organizing.”
Mr. Jones-Hennin said he was driven by two goals: confronting homophobia in the Black community and confronting racism in the gay community. He promoted the coalition while also serving as a logistics coordinator for the first national LGBTQ+ march on Washington, a grass-roots political rally that came together after the 1978 assassination of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, who was openly gay. The event featured speakers including the writers Audre Lorde and Allen Ginsberg, with a platform that called on Congress to pass comprehensive legislation protecting lesbian and gay rights.
“There were no resources, there was no money. It was just entirely spirit,” said Susan Silber, a Washington-area lawyer who worked the event with Mr. Jones-Hennin as a volunteer. (Decades later, she was a co-parent to two of his children.)
“We never knew if people would come because it had never been done before,” she continued. “We didn’t know if people would be willing to be visible. You couldn’t imagine it until it happened, and Billy was the one — along with one or two others — who made sure the buses got there.”
To ensure that African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and other people of color were represented at the march, Mr. Jones-Hennin spearheaded a “Third World” LGBTQ+ conference the same weekend. Held at the Harambee House hotel near Howard University, it was billed as the first national gathering of LGBTQ+ people of color.
Sessions bore titles such as “Consciousness Raising,” “Chicano Identity,” “Black Gays of the South,” “The Dynamics of the Prison System,” “Alcoholism” and “The Mature Lesbian.” Saturday night was disco night. Lorde served as the keynote speaker, although Mr. Jones-Hennin later admitted that he was so worn out from the planning that he missed her speech.
“When you’re at the front line of organizing — and even on the day of — you’re running around taking care of small details, dealing with the hotel, and dealing with the attendees and you’re trying to smile, and did I remember to zip up my fly? And do I have the right outfit on? Please!” he said in a 2007 interview with Metro Weekly. “You think I’m going to sit there and listen to a speech? I fell asleep. But I was in the room!”
Lannie Bess, as he was first known, was born in St. John’s, the capital of Antigua and Barbuda, on March 21, 1942. Adopted at age 3, he was raised in Richmond by parents who gave him the name Allen Billy Scott Jones. Eventually, after years of going by A. Billy S. Jones, Mr. Jones-Hennin decided to condense his name by adding an A to Billy.
His father was a physician, and his parents turned their home into a rehab and nursing center while raising 10 adopted children in all, according to Mr. Jones-Hennin’s family.
Mr. Jones-Hennin said he joined his parents at civil rights protests, demonstrating against segregated department stores in Richmond, and later attended the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights.
“The messages that day were as relevant to me as a gay person as they were to me as a black person,” he told the New York Times decades later.
By the time of the march, he had started to identify as a gay man, en route to adopting the term “bisexual” in an era when, he said, bisexual men were ostracized or overlooked within the gay community.
His parents were generally supportive, and after his father died his mother revealed that he, too, was bisexual. Mr. Jones-Hennin recalled in an oral history for Outwords, an LGBTQ+ archive, that when he came out to his father, he was told “that I needed to be aware of sexually transmitted disease, I should get married and have kids, and that I should be discreet — which was how he managed his life. I did that. I did marry a woman that I love very, very much and still do to this day.” (He and his wife separated after seven years.)
After serving in the Marine Corps, Mr. Jones-Hennin studied business and accounting at Virginia State College (now a university), graduating in 1968. According to his LinkedIn profile, he earned a master’s degree in social work from Howard in 1990.
By the early 1970s he had settled in the Washington area, living in Columbia, Md., before moving to the District. He became a founding member of the Washington chapter of the Gay Married Men’s Association, or GAMMA, which formed as a support group in 1978 after a fire broke out at the Cinema Follies, a gay theater, killing nine people who were trapped inside.
Through the group he met Hennin, his future husband. They soon started a relationship and married in 2014. In addition to his husband, of Washington and Chetumal, survivors include three children from his first marriage, Valerie Jones of Las Vegas, Anthony “TJ” Jones of Manhattan and Forrest “Peaches” Taylor of Atlanta; two children from his partnership and marriage to Hennin, Danielle Silber of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Avi Silber of Rockville, Md.; a sister; 10 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
Although he spent most of his career in Washington, Mr. Jones-Hennin lived on the West Coast for a brief period in the 1980s. According to a report in the Philadelphia Tribune, he was sentenced to one year in prison for embezzlement in 1985, after he was found to have taken between $14,000 and $57,000 from a San Francisco social service agency where he worked as an accountant.
“Billy’s work ethic and commitment to social change propelled an abuse of cocaine, which led to the embezzlement from his employer,” his husband said in an email. “As Billy was confronted by the pain and contradictions of his addiction, he became a strong advocate for people struggling with recovery from addiction.”
Upon his release, he returned to Washington and joined the Whitman-Walker health center, where he coordinated HIV/AIDS prevention and support programs for vulnerable groups, including sex workers and intravenous drug users. He later served as minority affairs director of the National AIDS Network.
Mr. Jones-Hennin worked as a researcher and technical director at Macro International, a Washington-based advisory firm that contracted with government agencies, while continuing his advocacy work. He co-chaired the National Association of Black and White Men Together, an anti-racism organization; helped found the Langston Hughes-Eleanor Roosevelt Democratic Club, a political group; and was part of an advisory committee that worked with the D.C. government on accessibility issues.
“I am activist till death do I part,” he said in the Metro Weekly interview. “Once it gets in your blood, you may step back but you can’t take it away.”"

Marimow,"January 22, 2024 at 3:04 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/supreme-court-texas-biden-border-razor-wire/,"The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration on Monday and cleared the way for U.S. Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire Texas officials installed along a busy stretch of the southern border until the legality of the barriers is resolved in court.
As is typical in emergency actions, the majority did not explain its reasoning for dissolving an order from a lower court. Four conservatives — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh — noted their dissents without explanation.
The case is one of several legal battles between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and the Biden administration over the governor’s border crackdown, Operation Lone Star. It comes at a time of rising tension over how to handle hundreds of thousands of migrants who have entered the country illegally in recent months.
Even though immigration and border security matters are generally the purview of the federal government, Abbott has mobilized thousands of National Guard troops and lined the banks of the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass with razor wire to try to block illegal entries.
The Supreme Court’s order reversing the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit on Monday does not address Texas’s more recent move to seize control of a riverfront park in Eagle Pass and deny the Border Patrol access to a section of the border there.
The Biden administration cited the takeover in asking the court to expedite its review of the case, but it did not specifically challenge the state’s action regarding park access. That element of the dispute remains unresolved.
The order on Monday was one of several recent actions by the high court affirming federal immigration authority.
“This is the Supreme Court siding with the federal government yet again on immigration, and the Fifth Circuit being overruled yet again,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) criticized the Supreme Court’s order. “The destruction of Texas’s border barriers will not help enforce the law or keep American citizens safe. This fight is not over,” Paxton said in a statement.
Luis Miranda, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the department welcomed the court order. “Enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility,” he said in a statement. “Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the State of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law.”
Border Patrol is not planning to use the order as a green light to remove the razor wire barriers if they do not present an immediate hazard, according to a senior agency official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ruling. The official said agents are trying to amicably resolve disputes related to access along the riverbanks.
Border agencies have been overwhelmed by the record volume of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Republicans have been highly critical of President Biden’s immigration record and tried to capitalize on the issue on the campaign trail, bolstered by polls that show voters trust the GOP more than Democrats to manage the border.
In addition to the wire barriers, the Texas governor has shepherded a new state law that would allow local police agencies to detain people they suspect of being in the country illegally and move to deport them — another law enforcement role historically reserved for the federal government, rather than the state. Both the Justice Department and the ACLU have sued Texas to block that law from taking effect.
Texas initiated the lawsuit against the Biden administration last year to prevent agents from removing or cutting the wire barriers, which the federal government says prevent the agents from reaching migrants who have already entered U.S. territory. Under U.S. immigration law, anyone who reaches U.S. soil has the right to seek asylum here.
A District Court judge sided with Texas, finding that the barriers limit illegal crossings, which impose costs on the state. But the lower court denied the state’s request to block Border Patrol agents from accessing the international border or disturbing the barrier while the litigation continued.
Texas appealed that ruling to the 5th Circuit, which issued a temporary order prohibiting Border Patrol agents from cutting, damaging or moving the barriers while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts.
The Biden administration then asked the Supreme Court to intervene on an emergency basis.
Federal officials say the sharp barriers have maimed and bloodied migrants at several locations and pose a hazard to U.S. agents. After border-crossers used blankets and other garments to try to protect themselves from lacerations while crawling under or over the barrier, federal authorities cut a path through the wire to allow safe passage.
The 5th Circuit order allows agents to cut the barrier in a medical emergency, but the Justice Department said the exception is essentially meaningless because it can take 10 to 30 minutes to cut through the thick layers of wire.
Adding to the urgency, federal officials said this month that Texas National Guard personnel had blocked Border Patrol agents who were investigating reports of drowning migrants from a section of the Rio Grande where the state had placed the barriers. The bodies of three migrants, a woman and two children, were found in the river by Mexican authorities days later.
Texas has told Border Patrol officials that agents who want to use the park’s boat ramp have to ask for permission, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.
Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar urged the justices to “restore Border Patrol’s access to the border it is charged with patrolling and the migrants it is responsible for apprehending, inspecting, and processing.”
In filing their response, Texas officials said they were unaware of the Border Patrol’s ongoing need to access the area and were investigating the claim. Paxton, the state attorney general, urged the Supreme Court not to intervene before the 5th Circuit has an opportunity to fully consider the case, which is scheduled for argument on Feb. 8.
“Defendants have claimed authority to destroy property that belongs to someone else based on their assurance that doing so is necessary to enforce federal immigration laws,” Texas Solicitor General Aaron L. Nielson said.
Maria Sacchetti contributed to this report.
Editor’s note: The date of the oral argument in the case before the 5th Circuit was moved back a day, from Feb. 7 to Feb. 8, according to an entry on the docket dated Jan. 23."

Wind gusts as high as 99 mph damaged property, blew down scores of trees, cut power to tens of thousands and brought significant travel woes. Rail service was closed across Scotland, and hundreds of flights were canceledor delayed. Many were diverted after difficult landing attempts in London and Glasgow.
In Dublin, shipping containers were knocked over by the wind. Among countless trees toppled in Northern Ireland, many were very old, including some made famous by the popular American television series, “Game of Thrones.”
The BBC reported that at least two people died in the storm from vehicle crashes involving fallen trees in separate incidents.
Isha may have heralded a return to the very stormy pattern seen earlier this winter in northern Europe. Another tempest is on its heels, named Jocelyn by Met Éireann, Ireland’s weather service.
Storm Isha is quite a beast... pic.twitter.com/4a452LwwgT
When Isha passed Scotland on Monday, its central pressure was 947 millibars, an extremely low value; typically, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. In the tropics, a pressure that low would be comparable to major hurricane, rated at least Category 3, although the two can’t be directly compared because of their different characteristics.
The storm strengthened quickly as it approached Western Europe and peaked as it swept over the British Isles, delivering damaging gusts across nearly all of Britain and Ireland.
A wind gust of 99 mph was recorded in Brizlee Wood, near the coast of northeastern England and just south of Scotland. According to the Met Office, other top gusts included:
The powerful winds followed the issuance of code red warnings for parts of the United Kingdom, in which the Met Office highlighted a “danger to life, structural damage and disruption.” It had previously warned people in the region not to sleep near windows.
Battering waves, coastal flooding and some damaged or destroyed oceanfront properties were also observed.
We hit the start of #StormIsha on landing at Heathrow Airport. Due to the wonders of the YouTube & specifically @BigJetTVLIVE, we were able to see what happened when our plane did a “go around” after aborting the landing. All very undramatic onboard, well done to the pilot! pic.twitter.com/EUF0c1z9Q9
Named Monday, Storm Jocelyn is a hurricane-force low-pressure area to the southeast of Newfoundland. Moving northeast, the storm is forecast to intensify into Tuesday before perhaps weakening somewhat on approach to Europe.
It is forecast to pass Ireland and Britain on Tuesday into Wednesday. Although Jocelyn is likely to be weaker than Isha, it is likely to unleash another round of high winds.
Code amber and yellow warnings are already in effect for parts of Scotland because of the risk of power outages and damage to buildings.
“Although this system will be a step down relative to Storm Isha, with the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn,” wrote Met Office chief meteorologist Steve Willington. “Wind gusts are expected to reach 55 to 65 mph across northwestern Scotland while there is potential for winds to gust to 75 to 80 mph in a few places, in particular exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal northwest Scotland early on Wednesday morning.”
The Met Office also predicts up to 1.6 to 2 inches (40 to 50 millimeters) of rain in southwestern Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northwestern England.
Isha was Western Europe’s ninth named storm of the winter — Jocelyn is the 10th.
For the last nine years, several different meteorological organizations across Europe have named winter storms.
Only storms that pose the risk of particularly dangerous conditions over a large area earn names. Typically, they result in amber and red weather warnings — the highest-level alerts.
The current storm season got off to a fast start, until a break in the first half of January. Isha ended that pause when it was named on Friday.
The 10 named storms so far are the most to date since agencies began naming them in the winter of 2015-16. Last winter was comparatively quiet; through this date, only four had been named.
The stormy pattern may continue for at least the next two weeks in Northern Europe and the British Isles.
This is probably a reflection of the North Atlantic Oscillation returning to its positive phase. The positive phase of this pattern is associated with storminess in the North Atlantic; it was last positive during December, when a barrage of storms swept the region.
As storms track toward northern Europe, they will tend to draw unseasonably mild weather over large parts of southern and central Europe.

1XHW7XFL3Y_V404456MFKMNJV2,"Opinion Trump accepts election results, outraging his base",Alexandra Petri,"January 24, 2024 at 3:06 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/24/trump-accepts-results-surprise/,"Somewhere, Rudy Giuliani is sobbing, sinking deeper and deeper into a puddle of tears and hair dye. A shadow crosses the face of Sidney Powell. A primary election happened, and Donald Trump just accepted it. As though tallying who got more votes in an election could possibly be used to determine who had won it. As though he were going to just participate in democracy now, as though nothing had happened.
Yes, Donald Trump got the results of an election and accepted them without a murmur. Indeed, he boasted about them. His supporters thronged X to tell the person with fewer votes that she had lost. As though winning fewer votes in an election were anything but an incentive to keep calling that election into question for years to come and making life hell for the election workers. As though you could tell whom people really wanted based on whom they cast their votes for. As though votes meant anything!
Supporters tried to puzzle out what had changed. What made this election different from the presidential election? Was it that it was in New Hampshire? No, that can’t be. New Hampshire went for Joe Biden in 2020. Trump won, yes, but that couldn’t be it, could it? It couldn’t be that he just was saying all those things before because he didn’t win, could it?
“Maybe this is going to start a wonderful trend of Donald Trump accepting election results,” one nonpartisan expert suggested timidly. “You start small, accepting a caucus result — barely enough votes to fill a stadium — and then you accept a New Hampshire primary, and, bang, before you know it, you’re accepting the results of all kinds of elections. The real trick, as I see it, will be getting him to accept the results of an election that he doesn’t win, so we can let the election workers come out of hiding and go about their lives normally without fear.
“It will be so wonderful to have him acting like a normal candidate rather than a would-be authoritarian who won’t take no for an answer! I hope this means he’s willing to just take part in the democratic process,” the expert went on, but at the word “democratic” everyone hissed angrily, and he had to leave the state.
Certain Trump supporters expressed deep despair as they watched their candidate’s bizarrely uncritical reaction to the vote. “If I wanted to live in a democracy,” grumbled one as he repeatedly failed to strike a match on his khakis to light a torch, “I wouldn’t be so adamantly pro-Trump.”
“I’m in this because I hate my local election officials,” someone else observed, stomping on a discarded Trump sign. “I want them to be afraid all of the time, not just if Donald Trump loses.”
“We don’t want to run the risk of living in a country where a majority of people can tell us what to do,” another supporter confirmed. “We should not be celebrating this. This just makes them think we agree with the premise. What’s next, accepting the peaceful transfer of power?”"

The higher gear of campaigning comes after Haley’s third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and at a critical juncture in the race as she has emerged as the only candidate remaining in the primary against former president Donald Trump.
It also comes after some Republicans were critical of Haley for not initially campaigning more aggressively during the final stretch before New Hampshire voters cast their ballots. On the eve of the primary, polls show Haley trailing Trump by double digits.
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R), who endorsed Haley, has shepherded her throughout the state. He told The Washington Post this month that he believes Haley can win in the final week of the New Hampshire campaign by connecting with voters all across the state.
Sununu planned Haley’s days with at least a half-dozen retail stops, intentionally trying to create a contrast between her approach and Trump’s style, which he described as that of an “rich elitist who flies in on his private jet” and “talks at people” before immediately flying back home.
“Nikki’s going to dozens of events all across the state connecting with voters one on one, he doesn’t do any of that,” he told reporters on Thursday. “[Trump] has no strategy other than to keep flying in, do his little country club style town halls, get on a plane, go back to Mar-a-Lago, wherever the heck he goes. Nikki’s here with the people, with the voters. And that’s how you drive that voter turnout, and that’s how you can get a win.”
On Thursday, Haley held a town hall in Hollis before stopping by Robie’s Country Store in Hooksett, a popular destination for presidential candidates where a plaque on the wall commemorated Jimmy Carter’s visit to the shop in 1975. Media attention on Haley grew in New Hampshire, and the store was so packed with journalists that it was near impossible to move.
On Friday, she was greeted at a store in Newfields by supporters singing her early birthday wishes. Then it was on to a bakery in Hampton before participating in a roundtable conversation at a charter school in Manchester, where she heard from students, parents and teachers.
Next she popped into a diner in Amherst at lunchtime, where she stopped by tables and took selfies before holding a press gaggle.
She’s managed to keep up her energy during the last few days of busy back-to-back stops in the state, focusing at each stop on connecting with attendees — while being trailed by a massive pack of reporters.
On Saturday, she started the day in Keene, where she spoke to a packed room at a country club, and then headed to Peterborough.
As it started to snow, she spoke at a “Politics and Pizza” event at Franklin Pierce University, and then stopped by a pub where she poured pints and was presented with a birthday cake. She turned 52 on Saturday.
Haley began Sunday with a stop at a diner in Derry before heading to a middle school for a rally. Then it was on to a bar to pour more pints and then a seafood restaurant, where she spoke to reporters and greeted voters there for lunch. A 5-year-old supporter at the event showed Haley a drawing she made of her, which Haley then autographed.
Then it was on to another seafood restaurant in Seabrook, where Haley broke the news to supporters that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had suspended his campaign; she also posed  with a live lobster. Haley then appeared at another bar with Sununu, where her daughter and son-in-law helped pour drinks, before going to a rally in Exeter.
The rally was Haley’s largest event in the state to date, and according to the campaign drew more than 1,200 attendees. Spirits were high, and her supporters threw shirts into the audience and danced across the stage before she was joined by Judge Judy.
On the last full day of campaigning in the Granite State, Haley began by urging voters to think about the stakes for the general election. She cites polls that show her doing better than Trump in a matchup against President Biden.
“Neither one of them is talking about the future,” she said.

The plans, disclosed to Congress in October and reviewed by The Washington Post, detailed the Pentagon’s intent to hold joint exercises this year with Sudan, Niger, Mali and other troubled African nations. Each is broadly prohibited under U.S. law from receiving American security assistance.
The documents, which have not been made public, account for millions of dollars in projected government spending. They revealed anticipated and ongoing partnerships with scores of foreign militaries, including about a dozen that have been condemned by the Biden administration and other governments for participating in coups or committing grave abuses, including extrajudicial killings and mass rape.
When pressed to explain why it partners with such countries, the Defense Department told The Post that at least six of the abusive militaries — those from Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger and Sudan — were no longer slated to participate in the exercises. It is unclear whether the Pentagon also will sever plans to train with other countries that have experienced military coups or whose human rights records clash with President Biden’s stated commitment to advance human rights and democratic ideals.
One defense official, who like some others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the situation, said the U.S. military “never had an intention” to train with countries facing restrictions. A second defense official characterized the list submitted to Congress as fluid, saying it is possible other countries’ participation could be canceled, too.
The about-face appears driven, at least in part, by criticism from members of Biden’s own political party who, upon learning of the Pentagon’s plans, implored the administration to change course immediately. It’s the latest instance of fellow Democrats challenging aspects of the president’s foreign policy, having questioned his administration’s steadfast support for Israel amid soaring civilian casualties in Gaza and whether he has the authority to wage a new military campaign targeting militants in Yemen.
On Wednesday, Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) appealed directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, seeking assurances that no troops associated with coup governments would be allowed to participate in U.S.-led exercises. “We further request,” they told Austin in a letter viewed by The Post, “that foreign security force units receiving assistance … are subject to [human rights] vetting, as required by law.”
The first defense official declined to explain when a decision was reached to bar the six African countries from participating in the training exercises, saying the impetus was “due to legal and/or policy restrictions.” Another government official said that, as of Dec. 20, when the Defense Department last updated lawmakers on its joint exercises, all six countries remained on the list.
Joint training exercises, which are not widely publicized by the Pentagon, receive little public scrutiny. When The Post reviewed the Defense Department’s unclassified notifications to Congress, it found participating militaries — labeled “friendly” foreign forces — from some of the world’s least free societies, according to Freedom House, a Washington-based nonprofit that tracks abusive regimes worldwide.
In statements defending the Pentagon’s practices, both the White House and the Defense Department emphasized what officials consider a distinction between defense training programs and other forms of military aid the United States sends abroad. These exercises primarily benefit the American military units that participate, helping to ensure “seamless” coordination should a crisis occur, said Lisa Lawrence, a Pentagon spokeswoman. She acknowledged the “potential political challenges” that can complicate such partnerships but suggested that the pros outweigh the cons.
“In some cases,” Lawrence said, “it is more effective to remain engaged with certain partners so the partner remains aware of U.S. ethos, values, and concerns and uphold human rights standards.” She said that in the absence of American military interaction, these countries could turn to U.S. adversaries to “fill the void.”
Central African Republic, for instance, along with its record of significant human rights violations, has partnered with the Russian mercenary group Wagner. Some in Congress have sought to brand the group a foreign terrorist organization. CAR personnel are due to participate in at least three exercises with American military units this year, the notification documents show.
Sarah Harrison, a former Pentagon official now with the International Crisis Group, said permitting American personnel to hone the proficiency of potentially “tainted foreign forces” exposes a “glaring hypocrisy” that discredits the Biden administration.
“Not only is it a stain on the U.S.’s reputation,” Harrison added, but some of these military partnerships belie a core tenet of the president’s foreign policy. “They have all the information about atrocities. They have information about coups,” she said of the administration, “and still put these countries on the exercise schedule.”
A White House official said the United States “has never hesitated to stand up for human rights and democracy, and will continue to do so with allies, partners and adversaries alike.”
The Pentagon documents submitted to Congress in October and again in December comprised a who’s who of human rights abusers. U.S. troops were slated for training next month alongside the Sudanese armed forces — whom Secretary of State Antony Blinken has decried for committing “war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing” and other atrocities amid the country’s resurgent civil war.
Forces loyal to Eritrea’s longtime dictator were slated for participation in three exercises, according to the documents. They have been accused of extrajudicial killings and rape, and torturing people held in the country’s network of gulags. Ethiopia’s forces, also implicated by the Biden administration in a host of crimes, were due to participate in “live-fire and maritime exercises, and special operations and cyber courses,” according to a description of one of the several trainings. Both countries’ participation was canceled because they are accused of human rights abuse and undemocratic behavior, the first defense official said.
This month, U.S. troops were scheduled to begin a six-month course with the armed forces of Niger — as they did last year — even though the State Department concluded a military coup had occurred there, requiring suspension of “most U.S. assistance.”
In the spring, two State Department-labeled coup states, Gabon and Guinea, along with Central African Republic, are due to join about two dozen other countries for Flintlock, a counterterrorism exercise led by U.S. special forces.
The State Department announced in October that it was suspending most U.S. assistance to Gabon. Officials previously raised alarms about human rights there, referring in a report last year to “credible” claims its leaders sanctioned torture and imprisoned political opponents. The department has said Guinea’s ruling military regime presided over abuses, too, citing reports of unlawful killings and torture.
Azerbaijan — which a Biden administration official described during a November congressional hearing as having “no chance of business as usual” with the United States until it makes progress toward peace with Armenia — is due to participate in 10 exercises with American personnel this year. The oil- and gas-rich autocracy was cut off from a separate line of U.S. assistance after it annexed territory claimed by Armenia.
Over the past few decades, Congress has passed laws and regulations meant to prevent American support for bad actors. Most prominently, they include Section 7008 of Congress’s annual appropriations bill, which restricts assistance to coup states.
A separate law prohibits the State Department and Pentagon from providing “any training, equipment, or other assistance to a unit of a foreign security force” if the U.S. government has “credible information that unit has committed a gross violation of human rights.” The legislation is known as the Leahy law, named for the former senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the driving force behind its passage.
“A key purpose of the Leahy law is to ensure the U.S. government and U.S. military personnel, as is the case here, are not tainted by or complicit with individuals or units of [abusive] foreign security forces,” said Tim Reiser, who drafted the law as Leahy’s foreign policy adviser. “We don’t want our diplomats or military personnel in these countries to be seen by the local population as partners with criminals.”
But the Leahy law has gaps. Notably, it requires that restrictions on U.S. assistance be applied to specific military or police units, something foreign policy experts say the government gets around by providing aid more broadly to a country. The administration exercises considerable discretion in how it applies the vetting, experts say. And ensuring compliance largely falls to Congress, where members must navigate an array of programs, some highly classified, run through multiple federal agencies.
A number of Democrats and Republicans who oversee military and foreign policy told The Post that they had not even seen the Pentagon’s joint exercises notifications, and were unaware of the extent to which the military intended to train alongside troops from restricted countries.
The Pentagon’s Lawrence, citing the law’s boundaries, said joint exercises whose “primary purpose” is to enhance U.S. forces’ capability “are not considered assistance” and do not require Leahy vetting.
Cardin and Warren state in their letter to Austin that such a view “ignores” the fact federal funds are underwriting the participation of problematic units in joint exercises, “as well as the obvious benefits to such foreign forces.” Leahy vetting should apply, they contend.
“Military personnel benefit from these exercises, but so do the foreign forces,” Reiser said, “because the point here is to build partnerships. To together, jointly counter whatever terrorist or jihadist or extremist threats exist in these countries. So it’s mutually beneficial. To say that it’s only for our benefit is nonsensical.”
Sarah Yager, Washington director of Human Rights Watch and a former Pentagon official, said there is little evidence joint military exercises lead to improvements in troubled societies. “We’ve had a bunch of coups,” she added, “so we’re pretty dubious that this actually provides a positive in this world.”
An essential question for the administration, Yager said, is: “Do we want to make human rights abusers better at what they do?” The U.S. government’s argument, she added, has always been “‘we’re mitigating what they do.’ And the human rights community’s argument has always been ‘you’re making them more savvy.’ And that is an ongoing tension that no one has been able to solve yet.”"

It was the second time Smith — who was convicted in the 1988 murder of Elizabeth Sennett — had been strapped to a gurney in Alabama’s execution chamber in Atmore. A 2022 attempt to execute Smith by lethal injection had failed, pushing the state to find an alternative method.
Though Alabama officials said execution by nitrogen gas was a painless and humane method, Smith’s attorneys and a slew of advocacy groups decried what they said amounted to using Smith as a test subject. The top human rights official at the United Nations warned that death by nitrogen hypoxia “could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”
Smith was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. local time."
2F3FU0KKBT_OD2B0DNYYO9PUB7,Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) says he is not seeking reelection,Erin Cox,"January 26, 2024 at 12:57 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/26/dutch-ruppersberger-maryland-retire/,"An earlier version of this article misstated Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger's age. It has been corrected.
Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) will retire after two decades in Congress at the end of his term this year, he announced Friday, ending a 38-year stint in public service.
Ruppersberger, who turns 78 next week, is best known for his work on intelligence issues. His departure adds to an unusually high number of open seats in Maryland’s congressional delegation, which has been dominated by veteran lawmakers.
“This was an incredibly difficult decision for me because, now more than ever, Congress needs thoughtful, end-game representatives like me — members who care more about constituents and our country and less about cable news hits,” Ruppersberger said in a statement. “But it is time to pass the torch to a younger generation of leaders and I am looking forward to spending more time with my family.”
Ruppersberger’s central Maryland district included some of the state’s highest-profile military installations, including Fort George G. Meade. He is a lawyer and was an assistant state prosecutor in Baltimore County before becoming a county council member in 1986, and later county executive in 1994. He’s married, with two adult children and five grandchildren.
In a statement, he said he was most proud of his constituent service work and noted that he ran for public office after a near-fatal car accident in the 1970s left him in the care of the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. He spent much of his career advocating for the institution.
He was at one point the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, where he served 12 years, and was among the first lawmakers to see photos documenting the death of Osama bin Laden.
He was an early advocate of ending the National Security Agency’s widespread bulk collection of U.S. citizens’ phone data. And in 2014, he weighed running to become Maryland’s governor but sat out the race, which ended with Republican Larry Hogan’s upset win.
Ruppersberger also served on the House Appropriations Committee.
Ruppersberger is Maryland’s third seasoned member of Congress to announce his retirement this year. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) is not seeking reelection after a half-century in public office, and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) is retiring after 18 years. His announcement comes just two weeks ahead of the filing deadline for the seat.
Born Charles Albert Ruppersberger III, the congressman legally added his lifelong nickname Dutch to his name so he could appear on the ballot that way during his inaugural 2002 run, according to the Hill.
“When I was born … the doctor came out and said to my father, ‘You have a big blond Dutchman,’” he told the publication in 2009. “So they started calling me Dutch, and when my mother and he would write letters, he’d ask, ‘How’s the Dutchman doing?’ I’ve been called Dutch all of my life.”
With few exceptions, Maryland politics have been dominated by Democrats for decades. Many, including Cardin and Gov. Wes Moore (D), offered tribute to Ruppersberger.
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said, “Maryland owes a debt of gratitude” to Ruppersberger. “I’ve been honored to work alongside him,” he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) credited Ruppersberger with “exemplary public service, including his work on behalf of our national security,” adding “he’ll be missed here in Congress but once Team Maryland, always Team Maryland.”
“From healthcare and protecting our environment to federal support and assistance for our most vulnerable residents and flood mitigation support, my dear friend Congressman Ruppersberger has been an invaluable partner,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) posted on  X.
Baltimore County Executive John “Johnny O” Olszewski (D) called Ruppersberger “an unwavering force for good across the Baltimore region, throughout Maryland, and across the country.”
“From his role as one of our leading voices on national security, to his tireless advocacy on behalf of our veterans and their families, to his stalwart support for the efforts of the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center which has saved countless lives — including his own — Dutch has changed both Maryland and our nation for the better,” Olszewski said in a statement.
Olszewski is among the candidates considering a bid for Maryland’s recently redrawn 2nd Congressional District, which includes Baltimore County and stretches north to the Pennsylvania line.
In a video that recounts his accomplishments in office, Ruppersberger cuddles a grandchild in one scene and in the next looks into the camera to tell constituents, “I’ve tried to serve you each and every day with the integrity and decency you deserve. And even after 21 years in Congress, I have never forgotten where I come from or who I work for. Because each and every day I work for you.”
Then, in a nod to the Baltimore football team’s Super Bowl prospects, he ended with a fitting Maryland salute: “Now, let’s go Ravens!”"
2G7XQC50QD_AL3NCTLGBPL1BVE,"Maryland bills challenge Big Tech over data privacy, ticket scalping",Katie Shepherd,"January 24, 2024 at 6:58 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/maryland-data-privacy/,"Maryland legislators on Wednesday joined a growing chorus of state officials demanding limits on the reach of Big Tech with two data privacy bills and legislation that would outlaw ticket scalping in the state.
Democratic lawmakers announced a package of four consumer protection bills that would attempt to protect Marylanders’ privacy and wallets by regulating the technology industry. At a news conference, party leaders and the measures’ sponsors acknowledged that technology is changing so rapidly that it is difficult to pass legislation to address emerging threats to public health and safety.
“And yet we have an obligation, a critical need, to protect people’s identities and their money,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said.
The two newly introduced data privacy bills follow examples set in states including California and Connecticut and take inspiration from more aggressive regulations in Europe. Like most states, Maryland does not have a comprehensive data privacy law. Only California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia have passed expansive provisions, according to a report from the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some other states have more narrow laws that curtail the activity of data brokers and internet service providers, and otherwise regulate online businesses.
But companies are collecting, storing, sharing and selling Marylanders’ personal and sensitive data without guardrails every day, Del. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), who sponsored two of the bills, said Wednesday.
“Most people don’t realize that when you download that free app, it’s actually not free. We are paying for it with our data,” Love said. “We are both the consumer and the product.”
The Maryland Online Data Privacy Act would create rules that require large companies to limit the consumer data they collect to only what is necessary for legitimate business needs. The legislation would set new expectations for large companies to keep consumer data secure from cybersecurity threats. In addition, it would enumerate a list of new consumer rights to view, correct, delete and even opt out of data collection.
“The passage of bills we are announcing today puts safeguards in place to guarantee that our most vulnerable consumers are protected, particularly when they are online,” House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County) said.
A second bill, dubbed the Maryland Kids Code, revives an effort from last session to implement new online protections for children. The proposal, sponsored by Dels. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Love, was modeled after Britain’s landmark Age-Appropriate Design Code, which requires strict privacy settings and significantly limits the collection of minors’ data. California became the first state to embrace stricter standards for protecting children online when it passed similar legislation in 2022. At least five other states have likewise considered passing measures to rein in the use of children’s personal information by major technology companies.
The Maryland bill would similarly stop companies from harvesting children’s personal data, including location information. Although the measure would not limit the types of content children can view, it would prevent apps and social media platforms from using their data to intentionally steer children toward any type of content.
“No parent would ever tolerate a stalker following their child to school or sitting at the park and watching everything they do,” Sen. Benjamin F. Kramer (D-Montgomery) said, speaking in support of the legislation Wednesday. “But right now, internet companies are tracking everything that our children do, watch, read, study, post and chat about on the internet.”
Legislators also introduced two additional consumer protection bills Wednesday: one aimed at ticket scalpers, and the other at unscrupulous door-to-door salespeople hawking retail energy supplies that end up costing some Marylanders hundreds of dollars a year.
Inspired by the national outrage over Ticketmaster sales for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour last year, Maryland legislators joined other states in taking aim at scalpers who have run up ticket costs to see megastars and local artists alike. They said Wednesday that Maryland venues had reported suspicious resale activity even for smaller shows, such as the local ballet’s annual production of “The Nutcracker.”
The bill would allow concert and event tickets to be resold at no more than face value, plus fees applied by a third-party service used to resell the tickets. The legislation aims to prevent scalpers from buying up tickets within minutes of a sale opening and then reselling them at huge markups. By requiring that tickets be listed at face value, the measure would remove the incentive to scalp, Sen. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel) said.
“The system is broken, and it only serves these bad actors,” she added.
The final bill in the consumer protection package would require retail energy salespeople to be licensed by the state and would ban deceptive marketing practices that hook customers on teaser rates just to raise the costs without notice."
2IX18TXQSN_RDEHBG1DHMW1QSB,Opinion Alcohol has many negative health impacts. Dry January offers a reset.,Leana S. Wen,"January 23, 2024 at 6:45 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/23/dry-january-alcohol-drinking-health/,"“Dry January” has been picking up momentum in recent years. Last month, a survey found that nearly half of adults 21 and older who drink alcohol reported being “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to take part in the month-long abstention from alcohol, with Gen Z respondents expressing the most enthusiasm.
These are promising statistics, because trying Dry January can lead to both short- and long-term improvements in health in four key ways:
1. Reducing drinking, even for a month, produces health benefits. A study from Britain, where the Dry January campaign started, found that 62 percent of participants had better sleep and 49 percent lost weight after a month without alcohol. Another reported improved insulin sensitivity and reduced blood pressure, and research from the Netherlands documented a change in a marker of liver inflammation after just 28 days.
These health benefits probably won’t sustain if people resume previous drinking patterns. But some might choose to continue cutting back once they experience positive effects. Indeed, in one of the British studies, nearly 3 in 4 maintained lower levels of drinking after Dry January.
2. Better understanding one’s relationship with alcohol could reveal a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use disorder — known colloquially as alcohol addiction or alcoholism — is the most prevalent substance use disorder in the United States. Nearly 29 million adults, or more than 1 in 10, meet the criteria for it. That means more people suffer from this condition than all other substance use disorders combined, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
Loss of control is an important element in the diagnosis. Leena Mittal, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, told me it’s a red flag if someone “has an intention to drink a certain amount and then is unable to stop at a certain point, or is drinking at times that aren’t acceptable in their life.” Another worrying sign is if that person is experiencing challenges in meeting work, caregiving and social obligations. A third is if they have physical manifestations such as sweating, restlessness and other withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking.
Despite the high prevalence, less than 10 percent of people with alcohol use disorder receive any treatment. People who find themselves unable to cut down on drinking for Dry January should contact their health-care provider. Treatment options range from inpatient care to outpatient talk therapy and 12-step programs. There are also three approved oral medications that can reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms.
3. Tracking alcohol consumption can make people aware of excessive alcohol use. This is especially helpful for people who don’t meet criteria for alcohol use disorder but whose level of intake poses health hazards.
More than 60 million adults reported binge drinking during the past month, which means they consumed five or more drinks on one occasion for men and four or more for women. About 1 in 4 who binge drink do so at least weekly.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 140,000 Americans die from excessive alcohol use every year. Some of these deaths are from car accidents, falls and other injuries sustained while intoxicated, though most are the result of chronic illnesses because of years of heavy alcohol consumption.
For example, alcohol-associated liver disease is the leading cause of liver transplants. And alcohol itself causes approximately 24,000 deaths each year from heart attack and stroke and is linked to at least six types of cancer.
Dry January is an opportunity to take an honest look at the frequency and amount that people drink. Those who are not intending to cut down can still track their consumption and compare it with national recommendations, which counsel women not to have more than one drink per day and men not to have more than two.
4. Being intentional offers introspection around why individuals drink. Mittal explains that Dry January offers space for people to “reflect on what is the role alcohol is having for them.”
Is there something else that is prompting them to drink? Are they experiencing depression and anxiety? Are they turning to alcohol as a form of self-medication? These are reasons to seek care from a primary-care provider or a mental health professional.
All these benefits apply to those who aren’t sure they want to commit to an entire month without drinking. The more lenient “Damp January” can similarly prompt people to probe their relationship with alcohol. And, of course, this doesn’t have to be done just in the month of January. Problematic alcohol use is a major health risk, one that many Americans might not know they have."
2J8B9KFQ3D_Q7PMX9LHR4PZKOS,What to know about Israel’s controversial ‘buffer zone’ in Gaza,Loveday Morris,"January 24, 2024 at 5:45 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/israel-buffer-zone-gaza-war/,"Israel’s announcement that 21 soldiers died in Gaza this week as they came under attack while rigging two buildings with explosives included an unexpected revelation — that the military was pushing ahead with a controversial plan to create a “buffer zone” along its border with Gaza by demolishing buildings in the area.
While officials had floated the idea on numerous occasions, Tuesday’s comments by the Israel Defense Forces were the first public confirmation that the strategy was in motion.
“It’s one of the additional efforts or layers of security that are being implemented after Oct. 7,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a spokesman for the IDF until earlier this month.
The United States has been vocally opposed to the creation of a buffer zone, saying there should be no permanent change to Palestinian territory. Human rights groups say the destruction of civilian homes and farms could amount to war crimes.
Here’s what to know:
The IDF said the soldiers killed Monday near the southern city of Khan Younis were part of a demolition crew that was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, causing the explosives to detonate and bringing the two buildings down on top of them.
“The forces were removing structures and terrorist infrastructure” about 650 yards from the border fence, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said, to “create the security conditions for the return of the residents of the south to their homes.”
IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the troops had died “in the buffer zone between the Israeli communities and Gaza.”
Before Oct. 7, Israeli border guards enforced a 330-yard buffer zone around the length of the 36-mile fence, though Palestinians could farm in the area. Israeli officials now argue that lax enforcement of the zone enabled Hamas to break through the border fence on Oct. 7.
How Hamas broke through Israel’s border defenses during Oct. 7 attack
In the months leading up to the attack, Israeli border units reported seeing people approaching the barrier with maps, appearing to study it for weak spots.
The military has declined to give further details on the buffer zone, including the depth of the area it plans to clear. “This is part of the imperative actions that are needed in order to implement a defense plan that will provide improved security in Southern Israel,” the IDF said in a statement Wednesday.
Conricus said his understanding is that the zone will extend just over half a mile from the border — more than double the size of the prewar buffer area. “In some areas it might be wider, in some areas it might be a little less,” he said.
A total of 2,850 buildings once stood in the planned buffer zone, according to Israel’s Channel 12, and the IDF has already destroyed roughly 1,100 buildings. The IDF declined to comment.
Israeli officials have been lobbying for the creation of an expanded buffer zone since the beginning of the conflict — providing another militarized layer between the enclave and the kibbutzim that were overrun by militants.
“At the end of this war, not only will Hamas no longer be in Gaza, but the territory of Gaza will also decrease,” then-Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Israel’s Army Radio on Oct. 18.
A few days later, Israeli Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a former intelligence chief, said the plan was for a “fire zone” where no Palestinians will be allowed to enter.
Videos of what appear to be IDF forces carrying out controlled demolitions of buildings, some near the border, have circulated for months.
In a video posted online Dec. 12 and verified by The Washington Post, Israeli soldiers can be heard shouting and clapping as a school in northern Gaza is blown up.
The school, which the IDF said was used as a Hamas outpost, was about a mile from the border fence. Satellite imagery from Jan. 20 shows damage to the school and nearby buildings, especially to the north and east.

Other videos posted online in mid-January and verified by The Post show the destruction of several residential buildings in As Sureij, an agricultural area in Khan Younis, about one kilometer from the fence. In one video, a drone rises above the rooftops, capturing the moment when roughly 10 buildings go up in smoke and flames. In another video, about 11 structures are demolished at once. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows the buildings completely flattened.

The IDF did not respond to questions from The Post about the videos or whether the demolitions were linked to the buffer zone.
The United States has consistently said the size of the Palestinian territories should not be reduced after the current conflict.
“So if any proposed buffer zone was inside Gaza, that would be a violation of that principle and something we oppose,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in December.
Israel has informed the United States that the buffer zone being constructed inside Gaza is only a temporary security accommodation to eliminate Hamas’s firing positions close to the border, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic communications.
Speaking during a visit to Nigeria on Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States had been clear in “our opposition to the forced displacement of people,” but added that it’s “appropriate” that security measures are taken so Israelis can return to their homes in the south.
“If there need to be transitional arrangements to enable that to happen, that’s one thing,” he said. “But when it comes to the permanent status of Gaza going forward … we remain clear about not encroaching on its territory.”
The IDF declined to comment on whether the buffer zone would be temporary.
Conricus said he expected it would be enforced for as long as there were militant groups present in Gaza. IDF officials have said the war against Hamas could last years.
Videos of IDF soldiers blowing up swaths of buildings in Gaza were included in South Africa’s recent filing to the International Court of Justice in The Hague that accused Israel of genocide.
“The scale of destruction in Gaza, the mass targeting of family homes and civilians … all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and is being put into practice,” said South African lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, referring to a video of 50 buildings being destroyed in the eastern Shejaiya district.
Israel has denied what it says are “false and baseless” claims by South Africa and has defended the demolitions as essential to dismantling Hamas’s infrastructure.
“Civilian properties are protected under international humanitarian law,” said Basel al-Sourani, an advocacy officer for the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. “These houses are empty, and nobody is in them. Why are they making these explosions other than part of their plan of forced displacement?”
Israeli’s prewar buffer zone had encompassed more than 40 percent of Gaza’s farmland, said Sourani, blocking farmers from their fields for over a decade. In 2006, a deal brokered by the International Red Cross allowed the Palestinians to return to their land.
“Now with this 1-kilometer buffer they are talking about, and I’m sure it’s more, what are we going to do?” Sourani wondered. His family farm, which includes some 10,000 olive trees and sits around a mile and a half from the border, has already been bulldozed, he said.
“Not a branch of an olive tree is left.”
Karen DeYoung and Jarrett Ley contributed to this report.
The ICJ will rule Friday on South Africa’s request that the court order Israel to suspend its military campaign. The court will not be ruling on whether Israel has committed genocide — a verdict that could take years.
Israel has stepped up its assault on Hamas in recent days as Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.

The win seemingly forecloses a path forward for his lone major opponent, Nikki Haley.
Trump led the former U.N. ambassador 54 percent to 43 percent, with 97 percent of expected votes counted. He also won a majority of the vote in the Iowa caucuses last week, carrying the state by 30 points.
Shortly after the race was called for Trump, Haley signaled that she won’t yet drop out, declaring: “This race is far from over.” Trump, taking the stage later, called Haley an “impostor” and appeared angry that she hadn’t bowed out, while saying, “I don’t get too angry. I get even.”
Below are some takeaways — including from a Democratic primary that President Biden appears to have won easily.
It’s not a novel take, but it’s true. If there was one state that appeared winnable for someone not named Trump, it was New Hampshire for Haley. And while she appears to have over-performed some late polling, she came up well short of a good argument for how this race might be competitive.
Early exit polls showed that nearly half of the voters who made up the state’s GOP primary electorate weren’t registered Republicans and 6 percent of the voters personally identified as Democrats. The electorate was also more educated, libertarian and supportive of abortion rights than that of virtually any other significant GOP contest.
Haley’s support drew disproportionately from the political middle — about 7 out of 10 Haley voters weren’t registered Republicans, and she won just 11 percent of “very conservative” voters — and that middle just isn’t as robust elsewhere. Independents can’t even vote in many other states’ primaries.
If you were making an idealistic case for Haley having a shot at least keeping things in doubt, you’d say she could have a strong showing in her home state of South Carolina on Feb. 24. But right now, the polls suggest that the state is only a little bit closer than a national race that favors Trump by more than 50 points.
A month is also a long time to keep a campaign rolling without much in the way of momentum or belief. We’ve seen how the official Republican Party has largely deemed Trump the presumptive nominee and rallied behind him, and that will surely continue in the hours and days ahead. That will apply pressure on Haley to fall in line if she wants to have a future in the party.
1/5
Perhaps the most striking finding from the early exit polls concerned how much voters’ feelings about the candidates affected their votes.
Trump voters, no surprise, cited strongly favorable views of him, with 8 in 10 expressing that motivation.
But for Haley, that number was far lower: only about one-third. Nearly 3 in 10 expressed some reservations about her, and 4 in 10 said their vote was mostly about dislike for the other candidates — or, more aptly, candidate.
This is a pretty searing indictment of any path to victory Haley might have had. If she can’t make voters get excited about her, she’s definitely not going to win in the many less-favorable states ahead. The GOP isn’t close to being anti-Trump enough to build a candidacy around that.

But when it comes to the general election, the result was also a remarkable commentary on Trump — the fact that so many voters who felt so meh about Haley turned out to register what amounted to protest votes.
New Hampshire is an unusual state. It’s less favorable to Trump than other swing states. He lost it by more than seven points in 2020, and a recent poll showed Biden taking 52 percent of the vote there despite just a 38 percent approval rating.
But if it’s at all reflective of how reluctant even a small portion of the GOP base is to vote for Trump, the former president has real work to do in patching things up after the primaries.
A few other findings that struck us from the early exit polls:
Haley’s argument for staying in the race effectively boiled down to the idea that Republicans can’t take a chance on moving forward with Trump because of his poor electoral track record.
“A Trump nomination is a Biden win and a Kamala Harris presidency,” Haley said, “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.” (Trump is actually 77.)
She also cited Trump’s “senior moments,” a growing theme for Trump’s opponents.
If you’re to distill this message, it sounds as if Haley aims to wait it out until Republicans happen upon a realization about Trump that they’ve stubbornly refused to embrace. But it’s a difficult argument to make when a strong majority of Republicans believe Trump didn’t actually lose the 2020 election in the first place.
Or perhaps Haley just wants to play wait-and-see. Part of the reason Trump’s opponents fought with one another so hard is undoubtedly because they hoped some future event — in one of Trump’s legal cases, for example — would eventually shake up the race.
But that eventuality appears as distant as ever. Republicans by and large see Trump’s legal issues as a reason to stand by him. And it’s not even clear when he will stand trial in any of his various cases.
The GOP primary wasn’t the only one in which a seemingly decisive verdict was rendered — not just for the state, but probably for the rest of the calendar.
The early results suggested Biden would win the Democratic primary overwhelmingly, despite not campaigning in the state and his name not appearing on the ballot over a primary calendar dispute.
Technically speaking, we don’t yet know how many votes Biden got, because the vast majority of ballots are write-ins that won’t be tabulated for a while. Fifty-fix percent have been allocated to him so far. But that plus the rest of the write-in votes led Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), 72 percent to 19.5 percent, and it’s likely that an overwhelming chunk of the other write-ins will go to Biden.
Democrat Marianne Williamson was taking another 5 percent.
The result isn’t hugely surprising, but it sent a strong signal that there’s little doubt about Biden winning the Democratic nomination again.
Future states in which Biden is actually on the ballot should allow for a better gauge of how many Democratic voters are dug in against him.

First, Donald Trump has led in polling consistently for months. And, second, outside observers have continually speculated about how he might lose that lead, only to see him not do so.
There are other differences — like that his lead in 2024 is far more robust than was his 2016 lead at any point — but that’s been the pattern. As Tuesday’s primary in New Hampshire approached, that lead stayed in force. Might the first primary of the cycle yield an upset that propelled a different candidate toward the nomination? Could polls taken at the beginning of January finally demonstrate that some obstacle was about to land in Trump’s path toward November?
With new Washington Post-Monmouth University polling added to other recent measures of the contest, it seems safe to offer an answer to that question:
No.

Those early January polls from Suffolk University (conducted for the Boston Globe and USA Today) and the University of New Hampshire (for CNN) showed a big split in support in the Granite State. The USA Today poll showed a 20-point gap; CNN’s had the difference at only seven.
The length of the lines on the chart below indicates how long the poll was “in the field” — that is, how long the pollsters were talking to likely voters.
This wasn’t as incongruous as it might have seemed, as I wrote at the time. If you include margins of error, both polls overlapped.
“If Trump’s support in New Hampshire is really 42 percent,” I wrote, “ … it’s within the lower bound of USA Today’s poll and the upper one from CNN.”
The chart below shows Trump’s support overall (vertical spoke, with support measured by distance from the center) and among different demographic groups in the CNN and USA Today polls.
An interesting mathematical experiment. But, since that point, a largely irrelevant one.
In the weeks since those differing polls came out, there’s been some significant convergence. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie dropped out of the race, with former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley gaining a large share of his support. But Trump added support, too. The next USA Today poll, conducted on Jan. 16 and 17, showed Trump up four points to Haley’s 10, while the next CNN poll showed Haley gaining seven points to Trump’s 11.
The two polls now had Trump at 50 percent, with Haley just under 40.
In two subsequent USA Today polls, Trump gained seven points to Haley’s two points, giving him a lead of 19 points. The Post-Monmouth poll, completed on Saturday, has an 18-point lead for the former president.
Those polls were conducted in between two key developments in the campaign: the withdrawal of entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy immediately after the Iowa caucuses and before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out. Most of the support both of them had earned in New Hampshire was expected to go to Trump; it seems obvious that much of Ramaswamy’s did.
There is a surfeit of other evidence from our poll that New Hampshire is firmly in Trump’s grasp. For example, Trump’s net favorability (the percentage of respondents who view him positively minus those who view him negatively) is plus-23. For Haley, it’s only plus-6. Her 10-point lead among those who aren’t registered Republicans is dwarfed by the much larger population of Republican likely voters, who back Trump by a more than 40-point margin.
In mid-December, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R), who endorsed Haley, predicted that she would not only win, she’d win in a landslide. She had seen a jump in support over the preceding weeks, which suggested the possibility of a further narrowing of the contest. And while New Hampshire’s history didn’t suggest a come-from-behind landslide was likely, it was not uncommon for there to be significant movement in the polls between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
It is not likely, though, that a double-digit deficit will vanish overnight, particularly given the DeSantis shift. Maybe Haley still beats the predicted results, offering at least a glimmer of hope moving forward. But, as I wrote last week, New Hampshire is probably her last obvious opportunity to upend Trump’s stroll toward the nomination.
Meaning that, in two days, this race is likely to simply be over.

313T1M5GXC_W9Q2MFVWESJZZ5J,Opinion Haley needs a New Hampshire win. The odds against it are growing.,Karen Tumulty,"January 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/haley-new-hampshire-win-odds/,"KEENE, N.H. — Throughout her campaign for president, Nikki Haley has begun her stump speech with a declaration that she is going to deliver some “hard truths.” And then the former U.N. ambassador spends the next half-hour or so doing pretty much the opposite, sticking to applause lines that go down like vanilla ice cream with Republican audiences.
But now, in the final days before Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary — which could be her last, best shot at a reasonably good showing against Donald Trump — Haley has at last begun to step up her criticism of the prohibitive front-runner.
She has questioned whether he is “mentally fit” to be president, blasted him for “trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us” and called him out for “too many lies.”
But Haley still says she would pardon the former president, in whose administration she served, if Trump were convicted of any of the 91 criminal charges he faces. And cringingly, she continues to lament that chaos follows him “rightly or wrongly,” as if there is a possibility that Trump himself is not to blame for it.
Matt Bai: Biden or Haley? For some Democrats, it’s about who can stop Trump.
It is true that Haley has a delicate line to walk here, given her opponent’s iron grip on the MAGA base and the recent example of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who tried a frontal assault on Trump and flamed out doing it.
Nor will she benefit from the surprise announcement Sunday by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that he is suspending his own, once-promising campaign and endorsing Trump.
The latest Washington Post-Monmouth University poll of eligible New Hampshire voters, released Monday but conducted while DeSantis was still in the race, found Trump holding a 52-34 lead over Haley, which is well outside the survey’s 4.2-percentage-point margin of error.
Though she has nearly doubled her support since November, only 46 percent of those surveyed said they now have a favorable view of Haley, which is 10 percentage points lower than in November; Trump’s favorability, meanwhile, has remained steady at 59 percent.
After finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Haley has placed her hopes on New Hampshire. It is a state known for its contrarian streak where voters unaffiliated with either political party — who constitute close to 40 percent of the electorate here — are eligible to vote in whatever primary they choose. With no real contest on the Democratic side, independents have the potential to be a major factor in the Republican race.
But it didn’t help her case when this self-proclaimed teller of hard truths — someone whose most admirable achievement as governor of South Carolina was removing a Confederate flag from the State House grounds — flubbed a question about the cause of the Civil War by failing to mention slavery.
Or that when CNN’s Dana Bash asked the only woman in the race how she felt about the front-runner being held liable for sexual abuse, Haley claimed she hasn’t “paid attention to his cases.”
Or that Haley has shrugged off Trump’s racist dog whistles about her Indian heritage. She has said she would “let the people decide” what he means when he falsely suggests the daughter of immigrants who had not yet become citizens when she was born is ineligible to run for president and brings up her first name, Nimarata (which she has never been known by), mockingly misspelling it “Nimbra.”
This, mind you, is a woman who has boasted on the debate stage that she wears 5-inch stilettos ""not for a fashion statement; they’re for ammunition.” But Haley’s campaign appearances tend to be cautious and scripted, and she rarely takes questions from her audiences.
Then there are some of her absurd promises. Were she president, she told a crowd here in Keene, she would tell Congress that if it didn’t produce a budget on time — something it hasn’t done in two decades — “you don’t get paid, period.” (One problem with that: Article 1, Section 6, of the Constitution stipulates that “the Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”)
From here, the contest for the nomination moves to South Carolina, which holds its GOP primary on Feb. 24. Without a burst of momentum out of New Hampshire, Haley faces the prospect of going down in a humiliating defeat in her home state.
In recent days, Trump won the endorsement of South Carolina’s junior senator, Tim Scott, who himself had been a rival for the nomination before dropping out of the race in November. At his rally in Manchester on Saturday night, Trump brought onto the stage a lineup of prominent Palmetto State elected officials, including Gov. Henry McMaster, who told the boisterous crowd: “New Hampshire is for Trump. South Carolina is, too. We’ll see you at the finish line.”
That, increasingly, is looking like it could be the hardest truth of all for Nikki Haley."
324Q59LW8D_D96FC2I879BJ9F6,Massive waves slammed a U.S. Army base. How it happened is mysterious.,Matthew Cappucci,"January 25, 2024 at 3:24 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/25/rogue-wave-marshall-islands-military-base/,"One or more probable rogue or sneaker waves slammed into a military site on the island of Roi-Namur in the South Pacific earlier this week, causing extensive damage and inundating structures with water several feet deep.
Viral video of the episode shows the forceful waves bursting into a dining hall, breaking down doors and causing several people to fall.
Roi-Namur is the second-largest island on the Kwajalein Atoll, which is made up of 97 small islands along a coral rim that encircles a small lagoon. Part of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Roi-Namur is home to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, as well as a small military facility.
The waves struck Saturday when the National Weather Service in Guam had issued a warning for high surf, but the magnitude of the waves appeared to catch its victims off-guard. One person was injured.
A statement from the U.S. Army confirms that “flooding from the waves damaged much of the unaccompanied personnel housing,” and notes that 80 of the island’s 120 inhabitants were evacuated elsewhere. Sixty people remained for recovery efforts to restore basic services.
“The dining facility, Outrigger Bar and Grill, the chapel and the Tradewinds Theater were moderately to severely damaged,” wrote the Army. “The automotive complex remains underwater.”
Debris also littered the island’s only runway, which FAA documents indicate sits at 14.4 feet above sea level. Recovery efforts will be slow until relief aircraft can safely land on the island.
“The efforts of the garrison and multiple mission partners, which is named Operation Roi Recovery, could take months to complete,” read the Army statement. “Aerial photos show extensive damage to Roi-Namur’s infrastructure, and multiple areas on the island are underwater.”
A strong low pressure system had been present in the North Pacific at the time. Though it was thousands of miles away, its influence on the oceans was geographically extensive. Weather models and the National Weather Service alike indicated the potential for 10 to 15 foot waves coming in on a swell from the north.
To answer whether they met the criteria for rogue waves, a few definitions must be established.
First, wave height refers to the difference between the crest, or peak, and trough, or dip, of a wave. A wave might be 15 feet from trough to crest, but that means it only reaches 7.5 feet above sea level, since the bottom of the wave is 7.5 feet below sea level.
A rogue wave is defined as a wave at least twice the significant wave height, which itself is defined as the average of the biggest third of all waves. It sounds like a lot of jargon, but the takeaway is this: rogue waves are twice as big as the tallest of the rest of the waves.
We can make a couple assumptions:
Therefore, rogue waves appear to be a plausible explanation. Alternatively, AccuWeather posits they may have been “sneaker” waves, which are unusually high waves among a group of smaller waves. They’re similar to rogue waves in that they’re very large and hard to anticipate. However, rogue waves are said to occur over the open ocean whereas sneakers strike shorelines. In this regard, Saturday’s event may have met the height criteria for rogue waves but more neatly match the definition of sneakers.
Rogue waves are poorly understood, difficult to study and virtually impossible to predict. While some have been measured and detected in recent years — like the 100-footer observed near Newfoundland during the passage of Hurricane Dorian’s remnants in 2019 — many are undetected.
Until researchers can obtain a long-spanning data set from multiple locations documenting essentially every wave over a lengthy time interval, scientists won’t be able to ascertain where there exist flukes or oddities in distribution of wave heights. Are rogue waves simply rare but expected extremes that are bound to happen? Or are there other mechanisms at play that create them? Scientists have several explanations for how they might form.
Regardless of their cause, rogue waves can be damaging and deadly. On Nov. 29, 2022, the Viking cruise ship Viking Polaris was hit by a rogue wave while navigating to Ushuaia, Argentina. One person was killed, and the Antarctic leg of the itinerary was canceled.
While understanding of rogue waves remains elusive, scientists may be gaining greater insights into how sneaker waves form. Last year, researchers at Oregon State University published a study finding sneakers that strike the Pacific Northwest coast are generated by far-off storms and conditions just right closer to the coastline.

He opens it out of curiosity and, of course, “I don’t know what I expected,” he says.
This was the New Hampshire Republican primary.
Former president Donald Trump won, of course. The polling said he would. His vise on the GOP said he would.
And with Trump, Ramesh Ponnuru writes, “the lie has won,” too. Ramesh concludes that the New Hampshire results — and indeed the whole primary process — proves that Trump’s “canny, though reckless, political tactic” of insisting that he never lost the 2020 election was the right strategic move, something we all already suspected with a knot in our stomach.
If that’s not a dead party, I don’t know what is.
Karen Tumulty writes that although Nikki Haley intends to press onward to her home state of South Carolina, “it’s time for the rest of us to quit pretending.” The Republican primary is over, and “Trump’s domination of the Republican Party appears complete.”

Rosenthal works on the Bill of the Month project at KFF Health News, which is rife with submissions like Uddin’s. That’s because, Rosenthal explains, the authors of the legislation meant to make preventive care free “didn’t reckon with America’s ever-creative medical billing juggernaut.”
So any scrap of additional care offered by a doctor just trying to be thorough? Expect billers to bill. Rosenthal writes that if it’s not going to enforce free prevention itself, the government at least owes patients the clarity of exactly what is and isn’t protected so that they can fight back themselves.

3FS576WETX_465THYTUSJ3TSO2,Search ends for Navy SEALs lost at sea on mission to seize Iranian arms,Alex Horton,"January 21, 2024 at 6:52 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/21/navy-seals-dead-iran-yemen/,"The U.S. military has ended its search for two Navy SEALs lost at sea during a mission to intercept Iranian weapons bound for militants in Yemen, officials said on Sunday, underscoring the risks to the United States of spiraling violence across the Middle East amid Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip.
U.S. officials said the two service members, identified Monday as Christopher J. Chambers, 37, and Nathan Gage Ingram, 27, had not been located during a 10-day search and rescue operation. “Their status has been changed to deceased,” U.S. Central Command said in a statement announcing the effort’s suspension. “We are now conducting recovery operations.”
The SEALs disappeared during a dangerous nighttime operation that occurred on Jan. 11 in the Arabian Sea near the coast of Somalia, an area known for piracy and weapons smuggling. Troops were dispatched from a floating base, the USS Lewis B. Puller, to inspect a vessel suspected of carrying illicit arms. As they attempted to board, one of the SEALs slipped from a ladder and the second, having witnessed their comrade fall into the water, dove in to help, officials have said. Both were swept away by the powerful swells.
A search and rescue mission was launched as other personnel boarded the suspect vessel. They discovered ballistic and cruise missile warheads, propulsion and guidance systems, and air defense components, military officials said, describing the equipment as an Iranian resupply of Houthi militants in Yemen.
The Houthis, who control large swaths of the country that is ravaged by years of civil war, have conducted more than 30 attacks on merchant vessels since November, significantly disrupting commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The group has framed its campaign as retaliation for Israel’s war in Gaza.
In response, the United States and its partners have rushed warships to the region, leading to numerous altercations and an intensified effort to intercept weapons shipments from Iran. President Biden and his national security team have sought to tread carefully, however, fearful that an overreaction or miscalculation could further embolden the Houthis and other Iranian proxy groups who have amplified their attacks on U.S. troops and interests throughout the Middle East.
In a statement Monday acknowledging the SEALs’ deaths, Biden called Chambers and Ingram “the very best of our country, pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans.” The loss, he said, was “profound.”
As the tragedy unfolded in the Arabian Sea, U.S. forces launched what has become a regular drumbeat of airstrikes in Yemen — numbering seven rounds so far, joined initially by Britain — to degrade the Houthis’ extensive arsenal of Iranian-made arms. U.S. military officials have made a direct connection between the weapons’ seizure at sea and the attacks emanating from Yemen.
After the missile components were discovered, the intercepted boat’s 14-person crew was taken into custody and their vessel — described as a dhow, a type of trading vessel sometimes used by smugglers — was sunk. The American boarding team had deemed it “unsafe,” officials said.
It remains unclear how Chambers and Ingram were lost so quickly. The mission was undertaken with drones and helicopters already in the air to provide surveillance, and the sailors were wearing flotation devices, according to a defense official familiar with the operation. The dhow’s crew, who were still being questioned on Friday, did not exhibit hostility, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the incident.
It is unclear whether the sailors wore other gear that would aid in a rescue operation, such as infrared lights or strobes, which U.S. troops often wear on missions so they can be easily identified by friendly forces.
Interdicting suspicious or adversarial vessels, known as a visit, board, search and seizure, or VBSS, mission is among the most difficult and dangerous operations undertaken by highly trained troops. They typically involve approaching the suspect vessel in smaller boats and using ladders and climbing tools to get aboard, which can be complicated by heavy seas.

Trump’s biggest boost in New Hampshire came from areas that helped power Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s third-place finish in 2016, according to The Post’s model. The former president drew about 90 percent of Cruz’s support — much of it coming from the state’s rural areas — showing how Trump has won over conservatives who were skeptical of him during his first presidential bid.
Notably, a similar trend emerged in last week’s Iowa caucuses, where Trump prevailed in the state’s evangelical Christian strongholds and rural areas that broke for Cruz eight years ago.
Trump did lose some of his 2016 base to his lone major opponent, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. But similar to what we saw in Iowa, his opponents have been unable to make a serious dent in his support. About 75 percent stuck with Trump, while just 20 percent defected to Haley.
Trump wins N.H. suburban voters, a previous weak spot
Trump was weakest among more moderate voting blocs of the GOP, but he still managed to siphon some support from the base that split among former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in 2016. He even got almost a quarter of the base that propelled then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich to a second-place finish that year.
In total, Trump picked up more than a third of the moderate vote from 2016, a critical chunk of the base that Haley needed to carry if she was going to overtake him. He also won a majority of support from the handful of candidates who finished in the low single digits in New Hampshire eight years ago.
Haley’s 2024 primary coalition, on the other hand, was much smaller than Trump’s and almost exclusively driven by parts of the state where voters are more likely to hold college degrees. This was also the case in Iowa.

New Hampshire was Haley’s best chance at a close race with Trump based on current polling. To win, she needed to do two things: consolidate the support from the fractured 2016 moderate lane while also making at least some modest inroads among more conservative voters.
She proved unable to do either on Tuesday.
Haley performed well with Kasich’s 2016 base, according to The Post’s model, winning about three-quarters of this bloc. But Haley’s overall 43 percent finish on Tuesday was slightly less than the sum of Kasich, Bush, Rubio and Christie’s margins eight years ago. Haley also took only a sliver of Cruz’s support from 2016, reflecting her struggle to win over other parts of the party, especially more conservative voters.
Despite not having a clear path forward, Haley has vowed to keep fighting for the nomination. “This race is far from over,” she said.
The Post used current and historical voting data from 237 cities, townships, hamlets and other Census-designated places in New Hampshire, as well as demographic data, to model how the state’s Republican electorate shifted between 2016 and 2024.

3QS04V9WRL_PDH4BLBGT7AJN2M,A bitter divorce battle could determine future of Trump Georgia case,Holly Bailey,"January 22, 2024 at 12:16 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/22/nathan-wade-divorce-file-unsealed-georgia-case/,"MARIETTA, Ga. — The future of the election interference case against former president Donald Trump in Georgia could hinge on a bitter divorce case playing out here in the suburbs of Atlanta involving the Trump case’s lead prosecutor, his estranged wife, and the testimony she is seeking from her husband’s boss and alleged “paramour,” Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis.
In an emergency court hearing Monday, a judge temporarily stayed a decision on the question of whether Willis can be called as a witness in the divorce case of Nathan Wade — the outside attorney she appointed to lead the criminal racketeering case against Trump and his allies. One of Trump’s co-defendants has accused the two of having an “improper, clandestine personal relationship” that has financially benefited them both, prompting calls for their removal.
But Cobb County Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson said he would revisit a requested subpoena for Willis after a hearing in the divorce case scheduled for next week that is expected to feature testimony from Wade. His sworn remarks could result in more embarrassing, if not legally damaging revelations. Neither Willis nor Wade has denied or directly addressed the accusations, which allies of Willis fear have already imperiled the case against Trump and 14 others who are accused of illegally conspiring to try to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.
Regardless of whether the judge in the Trump case disqualifies the prosecutors, Trump and his allies have seized on the allegations and are not likely to ease off their attacks. On Monday, Republicans in the Georgia Senate introduced a resolution that would establish a new investigatory committee with subpoena power to probe whether Willis was in a romantic relationship with Wade when she appointed him as a special prosecutor.
The resolution has not come up for a vote yet, but enough senators have already signed onto it to assure its passage. The resolution states that such a relationship “would constitute a clear conflict of interest and a fraud upon the taxpayers of Fulton County,” and that it would warrant Willis’s recusal from the election interference case and possible disciplinary action by the Georgia State Bar. It’s not clear what authority the Senate has to enforce any of those possible outcomes.

Wade is likely to be questioned under oath next week about airline tickets he bought for Willis after he was hired as a special prosecutor and allegations an attorney for Willis made in a recent court filing that claimed Wade’s marriage was “irretrievably broken” after Wade’s estranged wife, Joycelyn Mayfield Wade, “confessed to an adulterous relationship with (Nathan Wade’s) longtime friend.”
Andrea Dyer Hastings, an attorney for Joycelyn Wade, strongly rebutted Willis’s claim about her client in court Monday, describing it as “false.” She said it was “the first time in the 783 days that this case has been pending” that allegations of adultery had been raised against her client, and it came in a motion from Willis to block her subpoena. “I have questions,” she said.
Hastings told the judge that Willis’s claim that Wade’s wife had cheated on him undermined Willis’s main legal argument seeking to avoid testimony in the divorce case: that she had no “unique knowledge” about the breakup of Wade’s marriage.
“She knows detailed facts, allegedly, about their relationship,” Hastings said. She accused Willis of “trying to hide under the shield of her position” to avoid testimony in the case. “We’re not seeking her deposition as the district attorney of Fulton County. We’re seeking a deposition in her individual capacity as the alleged paramour of my client’s husband. So whatever her job is has nothing to do with whether or not she should have to sit for this deposition.”
But Cinque Axam, an attorney for Willis, insisted “the knowledge that she may or may not have” about Wade and his marriage “is not unique.” “You’ve got two parties in the case, one that is alleged to have some extramarital affair with Ms. Willis,” Axam said. “If that is the case, if that is true, (Nathan Wade) has that information.”
Addressing a crowded courtroom packed with dozens of local and national reporters, Thompson said he did not have “sufficient information” to determine whether Willis should testify in the case. “It seems to me that Mr. Wade would be the first and best source of information on what his income has been and how he’s been spending it, and that he would have firsthand knowledge of whether he’s engaged in an extramarital affair,” Thompson said.
But Thompson ordered records in the divorce file to be fully unsealed — granting a motion by Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for one of Trump’s co-defendants, Mike Roman, a longtime Republican operative and former Trump aide.
Merchant claimed that the records will back up her client’s allegations of an improper personal relationship between Willis and Wade that she has argued should disqualify them from the election case and lead to charges dropped against her client. The records unsealed Monday did not appear to include any documents that would substantiate claims of inappropriate behavior between Wade and Willis, but the docket did not include records obtained in discovery that have yet to be made part of the public record.
In an interview, Merchant said she was still going through the material and planned to issue subpoenas — including for records in the case that may not yet be public. “And we are looking forward to next week’s hearing, where Mr. Wade will have to testify under oath,” she said.
A coalition of media organizations, including The Washington Post, also filed a motion to unseal the records. On Monday, Hastings said her client did not oppose making the full records public. But Scott Kimbrough, an attorney for Nathan Wade, had urged the judge to keep the filings sealed for privacy. “What has happened since Jan. 8 of this year clearly shows the harm that is done,” Kimbrough said, referring to the day Roman filed a motion containing the explosive accusations but no evidence to back them up.
Thompson overruled the request, ruling that a previous judge broke Georgia law by not holding a public hearing on a February 2022 request by Wade and his estranged wife to seal the case.
After the 30-minute hearing, the Cobb County clerk began making dozens of filings in Wade’s divorce case public — including records previously reported by The Post that detailed the increasingly contentious back-and-forth between Wade and his estranged wife over his failure to meet discovery requests related to his finances. But the records did not include Wade’s detailed financial statements or other records Joycelyn Wade subpoenaed last fall from Fulton County and the Fulton County district attorney’s office related to her estranged husband’s hiring as a special prosecutor in the Trump case.
The records, uncovered as part of discovery, could emerge in future motions or be made public as part of the Jan. 31 evidentiary hearing in the divorce, where Nathan Wade is expected to testify. It’s unclear how quickly Thompson might rule on Wade’s wife’s request to question Willis — and whether a transcript or video of that potential deposition would be made public.
It has been two weeks since Roman alleged that Willis might have broken the law by appointing Wade as a special prosecutor and allowing him to pay for “vacations across the world” with her that were unrelated to their work on the case. On Friday, records emerged in Wade’s divorce case showing he paid for at least two airline tickets for Willis since he was hired in November 2021 to lead the Trump prosecution. It is unknown whether Willis paid him back. Over the past two years, the district attorney’s office has paid Wade’s firm more than $653,000. Roman is asking for the prosecutors to be disqualified and for the charges against him to be dismissed.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case, has ordered Willis to respond to the claims in writing by Feb. 2 and has scheduled a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing.
In her motion to quash the subpoena in the divorce case, Willis accused Joycelyn Wade of using the divorce case “to harass and embarrass” her and of colluding with others to disrupt the racketeering case against Trump and his allies. Willis’s motion pointed out the close timing between the subpoena and the filing from Roman.
“Joycelyn Wade is using the legal process to harass and embarrass District Attorney Willis, and in doing so, is obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecutions,” Axam, the attorney for Willis, wrote.
On Monday, Thompson told lawyers for both Willis and Joycelyn Wade that he did not want to take up Willis’s claim of obstruction — which is against the law in Georgia. “Stay away from that,” Thompson told Hastings, when she brought up the topic. “I don’t want to hear that today.”

3UVWIJHM3R_H0HD6V96CYV41R8,Israeli hostage families have ‘nothing to lose’ in push for new deal,Steve Hendrix,"January 24, 2024 at 1:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/israel-hostages-gaza-hamas-families/,"JERUSALEM — Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families. After three agonizing months of waiting for their children, parents and spouses to be freed, the hyper-organized community is growing more desperate, and more militant.
On Monday, a group of hostage advocates stormed two committee meetings of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, refusing to budge as they yelled at lawmakers, “You will not sit here while they die there.”
Over the weekend, a hunger striker joined a protest encampment in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private home in the coastal city of Caesarea. Another round-the-clock vigil — dubbed the “Time Has Run Out” encampment — occupies an intersection near his official residence in Jerusalem. Protesters poured a red liquid, symbolizing blood, onto the busy street Monday night.
A former Israeli hostage fears for the women she left behind in Gaza
“My fingers are blue, but it’s colder in those tunnels,” said Efrat Machikawa, blowing on her hands in the drizzly winter chill at the site Tuesday. In front of a half-dozen tents, others stood holding posters of those still held by Hamas, including Machikawa’s 79-year-old uncle, Gadi Moses.
“There must be a deal now,” she said of the captives marking time in the darkness beneath Gaza. “They are dying.”
At the start of their ordeal, many of the families felt torn between fear for their kidnapped relatives and support for Israel’s battle against Hamas. But they say something shifted last week when the country marked 100 days of war with no new momentum toward freeing their loved ones.
Some 132 hostages remain in captivity, although the Israeli prime minister’s office says 28 are believed to have died — either of their injuries or at the hands of Hamas. In December, three hostages were mistakenly killed by Israeli troops in Gaza as they tried to escape while waving white flags and shouting in Hebrew. Hamas has claimed, without evidence, that dozens of hostages have been killed in Israeli strikes.
In the early days of the war, “We couldn’t attack the government because the government was responsible for bringing our loved ones back,” said Shahar Mor Zahiro, one of the protesters who disrupted the Knesset on Monday. His uncle Abraham Munder turned 79 in Gaza.
Now, “society is cracking at the seams,” Zahiro said. “A lot of families took the gloves off. We have nothing to lose anymore.”
On Wednesday, protesters declared a “day of rage,” with nationwide events calling for the immediate release of the hostages.
For months, the families — with advice from a volunteer army of Tel Aviv-based publicists, strategists and graphic designers — have mounted large-scale demonstrations, met with officials and papered the country with hostage posters. Some, like Machikawa, have traveled abroad to drum up global awareness.
The campaign is credited with making the release of the hostages a top war goal, on par with the pledge to “destroy Hamas” made by Netanyahu and other leaders immediately after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks.
One hundred and five captives, mostly women, children and foreign nationals, were released in late November as part of a negotiated humanitarian pause between Israel and Hamas. Since then, there has been little visible progress toward a new deal.
After releases, an invisible divide separates Israel’s hostage families
As they wait for news, the families of those still inside have been further traumatized by the testimony trickling out from released hostages — harrowing accounts of people sleeping with dead bodies and sexual assault.
“I saw it with my own eyes,” former hostage Aviva Siegel told the Knesset on Tuesday, describing sexual abuse she said she witnessed in the tunnels. “The boys also go through abuse, what the girls go through. … They are also puppets on a string.”
The families’ anger has taken on more urgency as Israel shifts to a new phase of the war in Gaza, one expected to depend less on widespread bombing and more on targeted raids, likely to last for months or even years. The transition has opened new divisions over how long, and how hard, to keep fighting.
“There is a growing understanding that it might take much longer to dismantle Hamas, but the hostages don’t have a long time,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.
For months, the families’ demands have been fundamental — they want the government to free the hostages by the fastest means possible. “Bring them home now” is the most common slogan, and the name of the largest umbrella group of hostage relatives.
But more families are now coalescing around the demand for an immediate cease-fire, one that would open the way for a second negotiated deal with Hamas. Some have endorsed a controversial “all for all” agreement that would free the 8,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, some convicted of killing civilians, in exchange for the hostages.
Right-wing ministers in the Israeli government have rejected the proposal, saying it would feed potential fighters back to Hamas and other militant groups. Sixty percent of Jewish Israelis oppose such a deal, according to poll released Wednesday by the Israel Democracy Institute.
As some Israeli troops leave Gaza, a long-term strategy remains elusive
Israel’s military is already beginning to draw down some troops in Gaza, where the ongoing offensive has killed more than 25,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At least 9,000 militants have been killed, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Israeli officials say they have largely disabled Hamas as a military force in the northern part of the enclave and are making progress in the south.
But military leaders are adamant that it was combat that brought Hamas to the bargaining table for the first release deal, and that combat will bring them back.
“This pressure, and only it, has succeeded in returning many hostages,” Chief of Staff Gen. Herzi Halevi said in an address marking 100 days of war. “The Hamas leadership pins its hopes on a cease-fire and is convinced that this moment is near.”
Netanyahu has repeatedly and publicly rejected the idea of pausing the military assault until Israel achieves what he calls “total victory” — “eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.”
In private, though, he has signaled more flexibility, according to a person who works closely with the hostage families. Netanyahu told family representatives in a meeting Monday that Israel had presented a new proposal for a hostage deal to intermediaries, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the off-the-record meeting. He said Netanyahu did not describe details of the offer other than to say it would require Israel to “give as well as get.”
The prime minister’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Hostage families said they have learned to be skeptical.
“Our prime minister has been talking a lot for the last 109 days, but he doesn’t do anything,” said Machikawa, standing in front of the new encampment. Organizers say it will shadow Netanyahu until the hostages come home.
Itay Stern in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

It’s called Almeda — like the song praising Black culture by Solange Knowles — and it puts Danielle Harris in the driver’s seat, an open kitchen so close to diners they hear the sizzle of the fryer, the hiss of knives being honed.
Tom Sietsema’s 6 favorite places to eat in the DC area right now
Almeda’s address is 828 Upshur St. NW. Maybe you’ve been there before. The last occupant was Little Vietnam, which succeeded Magpie and the Tiger, which followed Pom Pom, Himitsu and Crane & Turtle. All those places had their moments; none made it past adolescence. When I look back, however, it was almost impossible to find a lesser dish on the Japanese-bent menu conceived by chef Kevin Tien and drinks maven Carlie Steiner at Himitsu, one of my top 10 restaurants in 2017.
1/3
One big difference from then and now: Almeda, which opened on Halloween and weaves the African diaspora with the chef’s personal history, has fewer seats than anything preceding it, a mere 18. A gleaming espresso machine takes up a patch of space once occupied by the elbows of diners perched on counter stools.
Another item of interest: fried catfish with spaghetti on the menu. Harris, 31, is a Black woman from Cleveland, where she says the pairing was part of youthful baby showers, cookouts and other gatherings. Why pasta? “Spaghetti fed a lot of people for not a lot of money.” Spoken like a true Midwesterner. The fish, meanwhile, channels the South with its buttermilk brine, zesty hot sauce and light coat of cornmeal.
At 15, Harris got her start in the industry as so many chefs do, as a dishwasher. She cooked in college and became a sous chef at 19. Since she relocated to the District in 2015, she’s been a corporate and private caterer, a manager at Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams, and a server at Tien’s late Emilie’s. In 2021, she rolled out Little Food Studio, a cafe across the street from Almeda. (The former business, which sold sandwiches, pastries and coffee, now produces wares for the restaurant’s daytime hours.)
A small workspace at Almeda means a menu of just 10 dishes. But every dish has a reason for being there, sometimes a compelling story attached to its inclusion. Consider the jerk pork tenderloin with pureed yams, an elegant dish that could easily be served on white linen. Harris first made the dish for a fundraiser at Fort Monroe, Va., an entrance port for enslaved people in the early 1600s and among the places they were freed after the Civil War, she says. Framed with lightly charred, slightly melting pearl onions, it’s a star in this little galaxy.
Vietnamese and vegetarian, Chay makes a splash in Falls Church
The “medium” plates deliver maximum flavor. One, a riff on doubles, is a shout out to street food and Trinidad: chickpeas jazzed up with cumin, ginger and fenugreek and piled atop a crisp-chewy saucer of fried plantains. “I like texture,” says the chef, whose tostones stand in for the traditional soft roti. Harris’s fact-checker is her 30-year-old pastry chef, Chinnel Watson, a native of Trinidad whose father was also a pastry chef. Tostone doubles “are my favorite thing” on the menu, Watson says of the snack staged with house-cooked pepper sauce. The other medium plate gathers beef ribs massaged with awaze, the Ethiopian sauce that gets its gusto from berbere. We’re talking fire and nice. Ruffles of lettuce act as wraps; a sprightly tomato salad helps fill them.
This is the uncommon restaurant where bigger is better — main courses outshine appetizers. Along with that jerk pork, there’s a whole chicken that leaves few techniques untried. The chicken gets brined, lightly smoked, roasted, fried, “everything but cooked in the ground,” said the chef when she came out of the kitchen to introduce it to my party one visit. The largesse, welcoming as a dinner bell, includes potatoes teased with aji amarillo and a bundle of crisp green beans.
The restaurant marks dishes that are meatless, gluten-free or include nuts. So helpful. A nod to West Africa, Harris’s vegetarian jollof risotto is a goody bag of soft charred cabbage, peanuts, red peppers, tomatoes and what tastes like a knob of ginger that a lot of diners can get around. One scoop begets another and another.
At D.C.’s best new Mexican restaurant, the cooking will thrill you
There are a couple items I could pass on. One is the pumpkin-mascarpone spread, part of the restaurant’s (toasted) bread service. Too much maple syrup in the dip makes me think I’m eating dessert. Another lesser moment is a pretty but tame poached “shrimp boil aguachile” served with thick, housemade masa chips that ought to go solo. Then again, I just ate at Mexican standard-bearers Cielo Rojo in Takoma Park and Amparo Fondita in Dupont Circle, and the bar is high for aguachile. At any rate, Almeda tells a more convincing story than its closest competition, the dashing but less consistent Bronze on H Street NE.
Harris went to school to study design but didn’t finish. She retains a good eye. Shiny new tabletops, sheer orange curtains and blue upholstery brighten the once-dark interior, and palm leaves, bigger than life-size, wave from the left wall. Regulars of the previous occupants will cheer the white restroom. (It used to be black. “You couldn’t see,” jokes the chef.)
The people who take your orders and drop off your food are a nice bunch, even if they sometimes fret aloud when not everyone in a party walks through the door at the same time. “Do you know when they’ll be here?” asked a worried server when I showed up alone a few minutes ahead of my first reservation. I get it. Punctuality and turnover are crucial to a small business in particular.
The best prelude to the bill, which includes a 20 percent service fee, all of which goes to hourly workers, is Watson’s slender, rum-fueled and (yes!) gluten-free brownie. Decadent but not cloying, the fudgy bar arrives with butterscotch and a savory yucca-ginger crumble on top and pink-purple tufts of whipped hibiscus tea on the side. More of the pastry chef’s handiwork is available during the day, when Almeda reprises Little Food Studio by offering cookies, scones, coffee and other items until early afternoon.
Back when she was washing dishes, the young Harris promised herself she’d be a chef by 30, says the owner.
Nice dream. Better reality.

Even as Egyptian women are starting to call it out, they are facing a perhaps unique obstacle, a repressive government that often considers such complaints to be a form of unacceptable criticism. In some recent cases, government authorities have taken legal action against women.
In other instances, like Shamy’s, the women are subjected to a vicious backlash that brands them as terrorists or extremists. These campaigns against the women seem to be modeled on the tactics used by the government to target political opponents and critics.
Shamy is believed to be the first Egyptian woman to file a police report against her superior, a man who works for an influential newspaper aligned with the government. After she filed the report, she was targeted by an online smear campaign, which included accusations that she is a member of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, considered by the government to be a terrorist organization.
“May broke the barrier of fear and this will encourage more women to speak out against sexual harassment,” said Intsar El Saeed, her lawyer. “But the challenge we are facing now is to not allow them to politicize the case and drag it away from the sexual harassment issues.”
Restrictions on speaking out
In July, Egypt’s parliament passed a law granting the government sweeping powers to regulate social and traditional media, permitting President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi’s widening security clampdown on free speech and dissent to deepen.
Then, last month, the government handed human rights activist Amal Fathy a two-year jail sentence for posting a 12-minute Facebook video detailing her allegations of sexual harassment at a bank and decrying the government’s failure to protect women.
Authorities said Fathy “was spreading false news” to undermine the country’s image and suspended her sentence only after she paid a hefty fine. But she is now facing a separate trial after the government accused her of being a member of a banned “outlaw group.”
The watchdog group Amnesty International blasted the verdict as an “outrageous case of injustice,” adding that Fathy’s case “highlighted the vital issue of women’s safety in Egypt.” Najia Bounaim, Amnesty’s North Africa campaigns director, said Fathy was “not a criminal and should not be punished for her bravery.”
This summer, a Lebanese tourist was sentenced to eight years in prison after she described in a Facebook video the sexual harassment she endured while on vacation in Egypt. A Cairo court found her guilty of spreading false rumors harmful to society, among other charges. Only after an international uproar threatened Egypt’s tourism industry was the woman’s sentence cut short last month and she was allowed to leave Egypt after paying a heavy fine.
Sexual harassment has long been a problem in Egypt. A United Nations survey in 2013 found that 99 percent of Egyptian women reported having experienced it. And last year, a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey found Cairo to be the world’s most dangerous megacity for women.
The abuses continue despite a law adopted in 2014 criminalizing sexual harassment. Sissi himself vowed to take a stand against sexual violence and protect women’s rights.
Since then, however, lawyers and activists say they are seeing more women report sexual assaults, whether on social media or in local media. Police and prosecutors are more willing in some cases to investigate their claims in a timely manner, said activists and lawyers.
The #MeToo movement in the United States, they added, has prompted more public discussion. Last month, a woman posted a video on Facebook showing a man pestering her to have a cup of coffee with her, sparking a discussion on social media on what constitutes sexual harassment.
“What’s happening in Egypt is that people are becoming more and more aware of sexual harassment and how much of an epidemic it is here,” said Shamy’s lawyer, Saeed. But she added that while there “has been a lot of progress in the last few years, there is still a lot more to accomplish on this front.”
Harassment at work
Shamy had worked for seven years for Youm 7, a privately owned newspaper and website. Over the summer, she said, one of her bosses, Dandarawy el Hawary, started to make comments that made her uncomfortable.
“I was verbally harassed multiple times,” said Shamy, tall and soft-spoken. “And when it turned into physical harassment I decided to speak out against it.”
Shamy, on her lawyer’s advice, declined to specify the nature of the assault until after the investigation. Shamy said she was not raped.
“He’s not supposed to touch me in anyway,” said Shamy, who is married.
Hawary, in an interview, denied the allegations, saying there is “not a single evidence against me, not even a weak one.”
“How can you criminalize one man and support an alleged victim?” he added. “I agree with you we all should support the victims of sexual harassment, but you have to have proof they are victims.”
Shamy initially filed an internal complaint, but she said it became clear the newspaper was “very passive” in dealing with her allegations. Shamy then filed the police complaint, which triggered an investigation by Egyptian prosecutors.
Since the news of her complaint leaked online, she’s been under attack. Some on social media have claimed she’s having marital problems; others have sought to portray her as mentally unstable to destroy her credibility, Saeed said.
Activists are concerned that the backlash could stop other sexually assaulted women from coming forward.
“All of these are tools that make it harder for victims to seek justice,” said Mona Ezzat, director of the work and women’s program at the New Woman Foundation in Cairo.
Today, as Shamy awaits the findings of the prosecutor’s investigation, she makes every effort, she said, to avoid her accuser who still writes for the paper.
“We don’t talk,” she said.

4DH3T2TTVE_XGG9KK0C3MMW7GQ,Biden wins as write-in candidate in unusual N.H. Democratic primary,Meryl Kornfield,"January 23, 2024 at 10:41 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/biden-new-hampshire-primary/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Biden, absent from both the campaign trail and the election ballot in New Hampshire, nonetheless dominated the state’s Democratic primary Tuesday, fueled by a write-in campaign aimed at showing his strength despite the misgivings of many in his party.
With about 64 percent of the Democratic ballots counted, write-in candidates had taken roughly 73 percent of the vote — and the overwhelming majority of those were expected to be for Biden. The Associated Press projected Biden as the winner shortly after polls closed, though the precise tally of the write-in votes was not completed by late Tuesday.
Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) ran far behind with about 21 percent of the vote, and self-help author Marianne Williamson took roughly 4 percent in a rogue primary unlike anything the state has seen before. The results will not count in the Democratic nomination process, because the party has decertified New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation status and awarded that honor to the more diverse South Carolina.
Still, New Hampshire Democrats sought to put the best face on the outcome, arguing that their embrace of Biden will have a strong impact on the race even if it is unofficial and will deliver no delegates.
“Once again, New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary made history — and we are proud as ever,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said in a statement. “While Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson came up short tonight, we appreciate their robust campaign effort and thank them for running.”
While Phillips and Williamson mounted full-scale campaigns, Biden supporters — anxious that he not come in behind the insurgents even in an unofficial race — organized a robust write-in campaign, staging volunteers with signs at many precincts to urge Democrats to write in Biden’s name on the Democratic ballot.
Biden supporters were initially concerned that his voters would not turn out in large numbers due to the primary’s diminished status and the president’s decision not to campaign in the state. In addition, the Republican race — vigorously contested between former president Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley — appeared to attract many of the unaffiliated voters who could have voted in either primary.
Overall, New Hampshire Democrats found themselves in an odd position: angry at the national party for demoting their state, but eager to stay relevant, play a role in the national conversation and deliver a win for Biden. On Tuesday night, the president’s backers celebrated the victory, saying it showed the enthusiasm for Biden’s reelection.
“This wasn’t easy, it wasn’t always pretty, and it was certainly unconventional,” New Hampshire House Democratic Leader Matt Wilhelm told cheering volunteers at their watch party. “We rallied, we mobilized, and we delivered a win for President Biden.”
Still, Milhelm warned Biden supporters that their fight was far from over, as Trump was also victorious in the state and Democrats needed to prepare for a tough general election campaign.
At his own watch party nearby, Phillips congratulated Biden but minimized his win, saying he “absolutely won tonight but by no means in a way that a strong incumbent president should.” Phillips also congratulated Trump.
In contrast, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez in a statement said Trump’s win indicates he “has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election-denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party.”
Biden’s polls have shown him struggling against potential GOP opponents, but his campaign has argued that will change once he is in a one-on-one race with Trump, and Chavez Rodriguez suggested that is now imminent. “While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden,” she said.
Democratic operative Joe Caiazzo, who worked on the Biden write-in campaign, compared the result to the 2012 Democratic primary when President Barack Obama, also seeking reelection, won 80 percent of the vote with an organized campaign, his name on the ballot and no major Democratic opponent.
“I think what this proves is that there is incredible enthusiasm for Joe Biden,” said Caiazzo, who was the New Hampshire state director for the 2020 presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
The primary results were quickly called at about 8 p.m., just as the final precincts closed. Write-in votes for Biden were reviewed by election officials. The New Hampshire secretary of state’s office said before the vote that it would count any write-in vote for Biden as long as the bubble beside it was filled in and the voter apparently intended to write some form of Biden’s name.
Phillips said he will now head to South Carolina and Michigan to continue challenging Biden.
After a slow start in October, Phillips campaigned hard in the final weeks throughout New Hampshire, telling crowds that a strong result in the state could launch him to a new level of relevance in the race and force television networks like CNN and MSNBC to cover his insurgent campaign. Phillips’s policy differences from Biden are limited, but he has argued that Democrats — and the nation — need to turn to a younger generation. Biden is 81 and Phillips is 55.
“If we surprise, it’s a whole new race and a whole new day,” the congressman told a crowd in Nashua on Saturday. He defined a surprise as at least 20 percent of the vote, and he celebrated meeting his expectations Tuesday night.
His efforts were backed up by significant ad spending. Phillips’s campaign spent $2.8 million on ads in New Hampshire, while an outside group, We Deserve Better, spent $2.6 million on his behalf, according to AdImpact, a media tracking firm. In one ad, the congressman mocked Biden’s low profile in the primary campaign, comparing the president to the elusive Bigfoot.
On Tuesday, Phillips greeted voters outside polling locations, making his pitch up to the last moment. Several shook his hand and thanked him for participating; New Hampshire residents famously revel in their ability to see candidates up close and vet them before most other states.
But some adamant Biden supporters took Phillips’s challenge as an offense against the sitting president and party leader.
“Biden all the way,” 84-year-old Julie Swant shouted after Phillips tried to greet her. She pumped her fist, clutching a face mask in the air, and walked toward a group holding “Write In Biden” signs to stand with them.
“Ma’am, I still respect you,” Phillips shouted.
“But you don’t respect Biden,” she retorted. “That’s what I don’t like about you.”
Swant later said in an interview that she felt Phillips had unfairly attacked Biden for his age. “Wouldn’t we all love a 54-year-old president coming in? But Biden has done such a fabulous job,” she said.
Still, Phillips has found some success with New Hampshire voters frustrated with Biden’s lack of attention to their primary. As Mark Larochelle walked into his precinct, he had expected to vote for Haley, thinking he was an independent. But after being greeted by Phillips, he realized he was still registered as a Democrat, so he gave his vote to the man standing outside his polling location.
“For one, he was here,” Larochelle said in explaining his decision. “I wanted to go with someone who was on the ballot.”
Williamson, who ran for president in 2020 but withdrew before voting began, focused her campaign on the state, aiming to elevate a more progressive agenda in the race. But without the exposure of televised debates, she struggled to break through, spending only $263,391 on digital, cable and satellite ads, according to AdImpact.
Allies of Biden pushed back with a campaign to squash any opposition from the start. An independent group run by Kathy Sullivan, a former state Democratic official, spent $1.2 million in the closing week on direct mail and other advertising to encourage Democrats to vote for Biden. A long list of Biden allies came through the state in the final weeks, including Cabinet officials, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (D) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who is often mentioned as a possible 2028 presidential candidate.
In a sign that the Biden campaign believes the presidential race is now launching in earnest, two of the president’s top advisers, Mike Donilon and Jen O’Malley Dillon, are set to depart the White House and join his reelection campaign headquarters next month. The moves come after several Democrats, including Obama, encouraged Biden to bolster his campaign apparatus and empower more top-level decision-makers at his campaign offices in Wilmington.
Biden and Vice President Harris are also marking the campaign’s ramp-up with a focus on abortion rights, an issue that has appeared to significantly help Democratic candidates since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. On Tuesday, Biden and Harris appeared at a campaign rally in Manassas, Va., to deliver their message on reproductive freedom.
The New Hampshire race was jolted in the weeks before the polls opened by a cease-and-desist letter from the state’s attorney general, who charged that the Democratic National Committee’s claim that the contest was “meaningless” violated voter suppression laws. The letter raised awareness of the election among the state’s Democrats, probably increasing their participation, Buckley said.
“Regardless of whether the DNC refuses to award delegates to the party’s national convention based on the results of the January 23, 2024, New Hampshire Democratic Presidential Primary Election, that election is not meaningless,” the attorney general argued in the letter.
Write-in Biden organizers said that the DNC rules are “misguided” but that they wanted to show strong support for the president here in advance of other states’ primaries — and save him from any embarrassment that would ensue if he came in behind one of the nearly two dozen other candidates listed on the Democratic ballot.
Volunteers stood outside polling locations with signs to explain how to write in Biden’s name.
David Preece, a New Hampshire state representative and volunteer for the Biden write-in effort, stood outside a polling place here Tuesday morning, bumped fists with other Biden voters and said he expected a strong turnout among Democrats who appreciate the president’s efforts that brought the country out of a crushing coronavirus pandemic and boosted the economy.
“Biden is a moral man,” Preece said. “He’s a decent man, and it shows with him.”
As Phillips stood feet from him, greeting voters who walked into the precinct, Preece added, “And there isn’t with any other candidate.”"
4IQD0NTIMH_CHK49T4AWKYDJ9V,"French manicures, gold jewelry: The ‘mob wife’ aesthetic takes over TikTok",Rachel Tashjian,"January 23, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2024/01/23/sopranos-mob-wives-aesthetic-tiktok/,"The 25th anniversary of the debut of “The Sopranos” this month inspired a number of creative marketing efforts: a cast reunion at a Little Italy red sauce joint which is offering a Sopranos-themed menu through the end of the month, a new TikTok account with never-before-seen footage from the show, and screenings all over the country.
And of course, there is a new corresponding aesthetic. The Mob Wife Aesthetic, which many TikTok users have proclaimed since the beginning of the year, is this year’s new dominating trend.
“Clean girl is out, and mob wife aesthetic is in,” countless videos — including parodies and stitched commentaries — begin.
No longer are Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber, with their slicked back hair, glossy lips and neutral clothes, the ideal. Instead, Carmela Soprano, the wife of mob boss Tony Soprano played by Edie Falco, and Adriana La Cerva, the sexy and brash partner of Christopher Moltisanti played by Drea de Matteo, are the women to emulate. (Even Francis Ford Coppola weighed in on Instagram, explaining the concepts behind the two wives at the forefront of his “Godfather” trilogy.) Begin with black clothes, especially leather — “if you look like you’re going to a funeral, you know you’re doing it right,” says one explainer — throw on a fur coat and red lipstick and spiky boots and big sunglasses, plus a recognizable designer bag, and voilà.
Or shall we say, bada bing.
Heard we’re in our mob wife era #mobwife #mobwifeaesthetic #outfitideas #styleinspo #nycinfluencer
Much like the mob itself, the trend is rich with opulence — and, potentially, corruption. Some women claim this is cultural appropriation, blithely lifting trends from Italian women (and who took at least some of their style notes from the label-conscious and gold-jeweled looks of Black women in the 1980s and ’90s). Even more controversial, some users believe that this suspiciously ubiquitous “aesthetic,” which is so different from the “quiet luxury” conversations of 2023, is just another part of the marketing efforts to promote “The Sopranos.”
“It’s a testament to The Sopranos and its enduring impact on culture. As we celebrate the 25th anniversary this month, it’s no surprise that fans and creators have found inspiration from the series,” Jason Mulderig, a spokesman for HBO, said.
Juliet Polcsa, who designed the very memorable costumes on “The Sopranos” (which make up most of the moodboards for the trend), says she is unconvinced. “The stuff that they’re doing doesn’t really have anything to do with my work,” she says, laughing, adding that she is “flattered, nonetheless.”
“I think the biggest thing is, it’s not so much the clothing,” she says. “It’s more about the attitude. It’s this fierceness. With Carmela, there was a strength and attitude that she had. She was not a wallflower. She was a strong woman. I think that appeals to people.”
Sarah Arcuri, a romance novelist who has been posting on TikTok and Instagram about the “mob wife aesthetic” since October 2022, is a 29-year-old New Jersey resident who has been dressing in furs and animal prints for as long as she can remember. (When a creator first proclaimed in early January that “mob wife” had now replaced “clean girl,” Arcuri replied in her own video, “Okay, I’m here! I’ve been summoned! … I am here to usher you girlies into this new era” as she slipped gold bracelets and rings over her French manicured hands.)
#stitch with @kayla trivieri the OG mob wife aesthetic CEO is reporting for duty 🫡 who’s excited? It’s our time to SHINE! #mobwives #mobwife #mobwifeaesthetic #mobwifewinter #mobwivesoftiktok #2024fashiontrends
She sees the growing popularity of the look as a reflection of the resurgence of “full ’80s glamour, like fur coats and red nails and gold jewelry,” combined with an interest in “the Y2K housewives.” In other words, it’s a rejection of fast fashion and what she calls “the Kardashian influence, because we have all started to look and sound and do everything the same. This is such a fun way to be unique.”
The videos are so prolific that one TikTok user, Molly Levine, asked whether the phenomenon was “a plant” from HBO. “It’s so interesting because it coincides so perfectly with this anniversary,” she says in her video.
Levine says her post was partly in jest, though she is skeptical of how corporate and organic marketing have become so entangled. “On the internet now, everything is packaged really quickly,” Levine, a 26-year-old who works in product operations at Google, says. “Brands want to play into something, and everyone just helps more and more mainstream and package these trends.”
Other women see a different problem with the videos, which in typical TikTok style provide a primer that boils down a universe to a few key pieces and steps: They are reductive, and even appropriative.
“What you guys are doing is cosplay,” says one user, who then provides a kind of ethnography on which fur coat lengths to wear and when. One particularly compelling series comes from an anonymous woman, who calls herself “a former mob wife” and recounts her story, with photos from her early 20s, that ends with an alleged Drug Enforcement Administration raid on her house.
Other users have pointed out that this “is more of an immigrant aesthetic” — the style of someone who came to the United States and found wealth and opportunity and wanted to show it through expensive purchases, and which is written off by the style mainstream as tacky or tasteless.
But really, as Arcuri points out, this look is less about any particular garments than a way of being. If “quiet luxury” and “clean girl” were trends that encouraged women to remain calm, collected and tame, the mob wife encourages loudness, bossiness — “let’s be bold and do whatever we want,” as Arcuri puts it.
For “The Sopranos” characters, Polcsa engaged in what she calls “method shopping.” Rather than making costumes herself, she went to New Jersey malls and observed shoppers, putting herself in the mind-set of her characters and then shopping herself, which gave the show the kind of realism that its creator David Chase desired: “what David wanted was to be as real as possible.”
She primarily patronized the now-shuttered mall staple Cache for looks for Carmela, whom she describes as “very outfit-driven, almost like that was her hobby” and a “nouveau riche, suburban New Jersey housewife.” Cache “had the right attitude,” she says, in that “everything was very matchy, color-coordinated. If you didn’t have a fashion sense, it gave you one.” (To her credit, Arcuri says she has an extensive collection of old Cache pieces.)
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
Carmela’s French manicure, Polcsa recalled, was a defining quality — a sign of her life of McMansion leisure that is especially evident in an early episode in which she has her friend Charmaine, who runs a popular restaurant with her husband, Artie, cater a party, and Charmaine realizes through Carmela’s condescending summoning hand gestures that she is considered not a friend, but the help. “The nails were so crucial,” Polcsa says. “And we thought, ‘Oh, she probably spent her money on a boob job.’ So things were a little body conscious.”
Perhaps what defines Carmela’s style, then, is her desire to ingratiate herself into the typical American suburban life — workout clothes, kids in private schools, a big house with an open kitchen and a pool — but an insistence on doing it in her own way. She may be wearing a little suit to a meeting, but it’s pastel with a dramatic collar. (Again, this is the sort of narrative that TikTok trends tend to quash.)
Adriana, on the other hand, was more flamboyant; her most well-known look is a tiger-print ensemble worn when she is running her own rock club. “Dre could pull off more of the sexier stuff — [Adriana] was really just all about sex,” says Polcsa. “Whether you’re a mob wife or not, you wear your clothing to introduce yourself or arm yourself. It’s your calling card.”
Polcsa thinks that Chase’s obsession with realism is why it remains so popular, especially on social media: “I feel like the show in its entirety has held up,” she says. The clothing somehow doesn’t feel dated. It may be that fur coats, matchy workout clothes, gold jewelry and designer bags are classics in a world that, as Tony Soprano knew so well that it drove him to panic attacks and therapy, seems to be in such perpetual decline and even degradation."
4L7VM8GMR1_H6BTFDS3NVHLI73,How an Egyptian village became a target of the Islamic State,Sudarsan Raghavan,"November 27, 2017 at 9:34 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/how-an-egyptian-village-became-a-target-of-the-islamic-state/2017/11/27/359c79f0-d2fd-11e7-9ad9-ca0619edfa05_story.html,"CAIRO — Before their village became a killing field, it was a sanctuary.
Many of the 305 people slaughtered at a mosque in the village of Rawda on Friday had moved there to escape clashes between the Islamic State and Egyptian security forces elsewhere in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, witnesses said.
The village had become sort of a motherland to its mostly Sufi Muslim residents, who saw safety in numbers.
But in recent months, the militants had chased down the displaced to Rawda. They repeatedly ordered the Sufis to give up their rituals — or face death. The community reported the threats to the military, villagers said, but no added protection arrived.
So the residents erected four-foot-high sand barriers around the mosque and nearby roads in a futile effort to protect themselves.
“After the threats, we were expecting an attack, but not something so savage,” said Yussef Mustafa, 37, a government employee who lost three brothers in the assault.
The massacre in Rawda highlights the vulnerability of communities trapped in a conflict between Egyptian security forces and one of the Islamic State's most virulent affiliates. The attack, the deadliest in Egypt's modern history, is the latest sign of the government's inability to contain a spreading insurgency that is becoming more brazen and ambitious.
No group has asserted responsibility for Friday’s bloodshed. But the Islamic State affiliate known as Wilayat Sinai is active in the area, and witnesses said some of the attackers carried a black Islamic State flag.
Wilayat Sinai has long relied on the sympathies of disaffected Sinai tribes ignored by the government and drawn its leaders and fighters from local communities. But particularly striking in Friday's attack was that most of the victims belonged to a clan of one of the most powerful tribes in the Sinai.
That suggests an important shift for the group: Even though most of the leadership still hails from the Sinai, its membership now includes many more outsiders with no ties to the region, analysts and residents said.
Membership has been bolstered by returnees who fought with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in Syria and Iraq, according to Zack Gold, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.
“These outside fighters — even if Egyptians, they’re ‘foreign’ to North Sinai — don’t care about tribal interests and red lines,” he said.
Friday’s carnage was part of a broader shift toward sectarianism for the Islamic State branch, both in the Sinai and on the Egyptian mainland. While sectarian attacks have been a hallmark of militants’ tactics in Syria and Iraq, they have gained prominence in Egypt only within the past year.
In the past, the Islamic State attacked mostly soldiers and police. But more recently, the militants have targeted the country's Coptic Christian minority with devastating bombings of churches in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, as well as assassinations, forcing thousands of Christians to flee the Sinai.
“The Rawda mosque attack and other high-casualty incidents afford the Islamic State the media attention that it seeks, delegitimize the efforts of the Egyptian government and further the group’s global sectarian ambitions,” said Jacob Greene, a research associate at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.
Analysis: Trump says attack in Egypt proves U.S. needs border wall with Mexico. Is he right?
The Sufis of Rawda understood their precarious existence.
They believe in a moderate brand of Islam that promotes tolerance and pluralism. But the Islamic State and other Sunni extremists have long considered Sufism as heretical. In Mali, Pakistan and elsewhere, the Islamic State has targeted Sufi mosques and shrines.
In November 2016, the Islamic State kidnapped and beheaded Sulaiman Abu Haraz, a prominent Sufi cleric believed to have been 100 years old. The Islamic State accused him of practicing witchcraft. In a photo released by the militants, a masked man in black attire is seen wielding a large, curved sword behind the head of the cleric, who was associated with the Rawda mosque. One of Haraz’s students was also executed.
In an Islamic State magazine interview two months later, a senior militant commander in the Sinai identified Rawda, and the district where it’s located, as one of three Sufi areas the group hoped to “eradicate.” The commander said that Sufis deserve to be killed “if they don’t repent” and accused them of “collaborating with the oppressor.”
Egyptian military personnel passed through the area and at times conducted operations but never stayed. And they never came during Friday prayers, the main religious gathering of the week that always attracted hundreds of villagers, residents said.
Meanwhile, Islamic State fighters were moving closer to the village, which is on the northern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, west of the provincial capital Arish.
The conflict is a deadly game of cat and mouse — where Egyptian forces are fighting with tanks, armored vehicles and other conventional weapons, and Islamic State fighters stage hit-and-run attacks, mostly on army checkpoints and outposts.
Military operations had pushed the group out of the central Sinai and toward Arish. But in recent months, the fighters have moved west toward the mountains near Rawda, according to residents and local journalists.
Two weeks ago, an Islamic State member distributed leaflets in the village ordering Sufi scholars to stop “heretical actions,” according to two local journalists. “So the people closed the main road leading to the mosque,” said Mohamed Elhor, one of the journalists.
But villagers continued their daily lives.
As Egypt grieves after massacre, security forces ramp up strikes on militants
Khalid Soleiman, 22, and his large extended Sufi family arrived nearly two years ago after clashes broke out between militants and the military in the Bedouin town of Sheikh Zuweid, southeast of Arish. “It was unsafe to live there,” said Soleiman, who is studying to be a pharmacist.
Last Friday, he was on his way to the mosque for the traditional Juma prayer. Hundreds of men and boys had gathered inside and outside the building. Women were not present, as is typical in many conservative communities.
As Soleiman approached the mosque, more than two dozen militants arrived in several pickups. Some fanned out and gunned down panicked worshipers, while others entered the mosque to kill more. The microphone inside was on during the carnage.
“We could hear people scream,” recalled Soleiman, who hid behind a house. “I could hear the militants yell: ‘Kill them all. Young and old. Don’t spare anyone.’ ”
Soleiman tried to escape from the house. But as he ran, a bullet grazed his leg. He took cover inside a chicken coop of another house.
Some of the gunmen executed the wounded and anyone who tried to surrender. Others set cars on fire.
Most of the fighters, he said, had Egyptian accents. Some had reddish beards, he said, suggesting to him that they were foreigners. Roughly a half-hour later, the gunmen jumped into their vehicles and sped into the mountainsThe first body Soleiman found at the mosque was his uncle.
He would find the bodies of 17 more relatives.
By some estimates, at least a quarter of the male population of Rawda is dead.
“There is no future for the village,” Soleiman said. “Unless we wait for the children to grow up and start their own families.”

John Cornyn (R-Tex.) also questioned Trump’s ability to win a general election, arguing that the former president didn’t understand “that when you run in a general election, you have to appeal to voters beyond your base.”
Less than a year later, Cornyn joined a number of remaining GOP holdouts in endorsing and rallying around Trump after his decisive victories in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
“I have seen enough,"" Cornyn said in a statement Tuesday after it became clear Trump would win his second Republican nomination contest in two weeks. “To beat Biden, Republicans need to unite around a single candidate, and it’s clear that President Trump is Republican voters’ choice... I will be continuing to work to elect a Republican Senate majority and to elect President Trump in 2024.”
Cornyn was once among a minority of GOP senators on Capitol Hill who tried to shepherd Republican voters toward a new presidential candidate after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and a disappointing GOP performance in the 2022 midterms. But between retirements and electoral losses, and lawmakers who have come to embrace the unshakable leader of the Republican Party, that minority has dwindled. In the span of a month, a rash of Republicans have endorsed Trump amid primary season victories that have left only one of his GOP opponents — former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley — still standing.
House and Senate lawmakers across the ideological spectrum have issued statements ranging from glowing endorsements to milquetoast tweets of support after Trump trounced his opponents in Iowa and beat Haley by 11 points in New Hampshire. The fitful U-turns have become a familiar ritual for some establishment Republicans who have at first resisted Trump’s resurgence, only to switch course as his march to the nomination appears increasingly inevitable.
“The writing’s on the wall here; the primary is effectively over,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who was once a vocal Trump critic before switching his views when he ran for Senate. “I think the natural evolution of this thing will be Trump will be the nominee and everybody will support him.”
Lawmakers who were aghast after Trump encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol in a failed attempt to hold onto power after losing the 2020 election are now firmly back in his cheering section. They were again dismayed after a “red wave” in 2022 midterms failed to materialize, stunning Republican lawmakers who had bet on a large governing majority. Many Republicans and analysts attributed the disappointing performance, in part, to Trump-backed hard-right candidates who lost swing and Republican-leaning districts and states to moderate Democrats.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) publicly blamed Trump for the underwhelming performance, saying he ignored “candidate quality” when endorsing, and other senators questioned Trump’s ability to attract votes beyond his core base. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said at the time he hoped voters would have many other “options” to pick from for a presidential nominee.
McConnell declined to engage in the conversation about the presidential primaries on Wednesday. But Thune, who is a leading contender to replace McConnell as Republican leader, offered his tepid backing.
“I’ve said all along I’ll support the nominee,” said Thune. “So if he’s the nominee, I’ll do what I can to help the team with the presidency and the Senate and put an end to the Biden-Schumer agenda.”
Thune declined to say if Trump at the top of the ticket would help Republicans win back the Senate after many blame him for losses in 2018, 2020 and 2022. “The best thing [Trump] and all of us have going for us is that Biden is just in as much trouble out there.”
Now, the former president facing 91 felony charges is heading into the Nevada caucuses and South Carolina primary next month with the overwhelming backing of Congress, including onetime foes.
Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), whom Haley endorsed in 2022 against a Trump-backed GOP challenger, threw her support behind Trump this week after coming to Washington in 2021 with declarations of becoming a “new voice” for the Republican Party.
Mace was so angry at Trump during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that she discussed with aides the prospect of confronting the rioters so she could get punched and become the face of anti-Trump Republicans, according to former staffers familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
Mace — who also declared to her staff during the riot that she was a “never-Trumper” — made the comments while she was hiding with staff in her office in the Cannon House building as they watched rioters march through the Capitol on television. If there was video of her challenging rioters on social media, it could give credence to her anti-Trump position, these people said of Mace’s thinking at the time. Staffers pushed back against their then-freshman boss, citing guidance from U.S. Capitol Police. Mace eventually set aside the idea, according to the people.
Asked for comment, Mace did not directly address the episode. “What you write doesn’t pass for real journalism,” Mace said.
House Republicans have largely stood behind Trump, serving as his first line of defense after the Trump presidency. They’ve served as messengers for his unsubstantiated claims that the Democratic Party has weaponized the government against the former president, and prioritized an impeachment of President Biden and top Cabinet officials, in part to avenge his two impeachment trials. And his loudest supporters spent the past year pushing back against moderates who helped clinch the House majority, arguing that MAGA policies should be embraced to keep the majority next cycle.
“If the Republican Party does not engage in his policies and adapt to them, and take them on completely, Republican voters are going to abandon Republicans after President Trump is no longer on the ballot,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a key surrogate who believes Trump will “drag” moderate Republicans with him to reelection this year.
But privately, many Republicans remain worried that Trump’s influence could limit their ability to grow their fragile five-seat majority, after moderate Democrats flipped several Republican-leaning districts with far-right GOP candidates. Some believe Trump-endorsed candidates for the Senate or governor’s offices also dragged down some GOP House candidates.
Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee and has endorsed Trump, said the “top of ticket clearly will have some impact” this cycle and defended House Republicans’ chances to do well if Trump is the nominee. He noted Republicans were able to expand their ranks in 2020 when Trump lost and notched the majority in 2022. But many lawmakers believe they could have built a governing coalition and avoided ideological battles if more pragmatic conservatives won their primary races.
Hudson said the NRCC has not told candidates whether they should endorse Trump, nor has he had a strategic conversation with Trump about where his endorsement could help or hurt. The chairman noted that Trump may not even visit certain key districts, particularly in blue states such as New York or California where Trump could motivate Democratic voters, and stressed that candidate quality is crucial in those races.
Even so, two Republican campaign strategists — who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about GOP recruitment efforts — said their effort to recruit pragmatic Republicans to challenge far-right incumbents has not been as successful given that many do not want to run when Trump is at the top of ticket.
For the pragmatic lawmakers currently in office, the choice to back Trump is out of fear of persecution from his loyal base in the party, many members say. Many of the 17 vulnerable GOP House lawmakers trying to hold on to their seats in districts Biden won have aligned themselves with Trump.
One Republican familiar with the Trump campaign’s tactics added that his team has prioritized consolidating support by “going state to state to strong-arm [elected officials] to endorse him.”
“They’re getting behind him because he’s going to be the nominee and they don’t want to feel the wrath of not supporting him,” said the person. “And they’re saying, ‘if you don’t, we will remember this and come for you.’”
The Trump campaign declined to comment.
Rep. Brandon Williams, one of the most endangered New York Republicans, and Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) have endorsed Trump, arguing he is on the pathway to becoming the eventual GOP nominee and his policies are preferable to Biden’s.
Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) is another vulnerable member who did not hold back from criticizing the former president’s behavior after the 2020 election, and previously said he wouldn’t back Trump in a Republican primary. In June 2022, Bacon said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Republicans had to learn their lesson, particularly that “our president should have respected the conclusion” of the election. Trump, in turn, called Bacon a “bad man” and advised his followers to vote against him.
Now, as Trump appears on a glide path to the nomination, Bacon suggests he’ll back him.
“I’ll support our nominee and who primary voters select when all is said and done,” Bacon wrote to The Washington Post in a text message. “The choice will be between who can best secure our border, nominate the best Supreme Court judges, and promote energy independence.”
However, not all congressional Republicans plan to get in line.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who didn’t vote for Trump in 2020 or 2016, said she’s not going to endorse him. “I would prefer a different candidate,” Collins said. But she has not gotten behind another candidate in the presidential primaries.
Sen. Todd Young (R), who won reelection in conservative Indiana in 2022, has since been more outspoken in his opposition to the former president. He has recently insisted he has “no intention” of backing Trump.
“I’ve never felt a need to join the establishment, you know, and so if I’m an outsider, I embrace that,” Young said when asked about his colleagues who have backed Trump.
Some Democratic senators expressed dismay at how quickly their Republican colleagues were coalescing around a candidate facing criminal charges — including conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of a congressional proceeding — for his involvement in the plan to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
“These are people I know, these are people I respect, consider friends, to basically sell your soul,” said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), a moderate who has not ruled out his own third-party presidential run. “They know who he is. Donald Trump is not making any bones about who he is and what he will do. … I just can’t understand how people can accept that as the leader of the free world.”"
4ONR2VTOX0_8V5ST9QIEIKM7W3,Ring camera app won’t share footage with law enforcement anymore,Anumita Kaur,"January 25, 2024 at 7:37 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/25/ring-camera-footage-sharing-police/,"Ring, the video doorbell company, will no longer facilitate law enforcement requests for users’ footage, the company said Wednesday, shutting down a tool that critics have said threatens people’s privacy.
The company had partnered with hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the country in recent years, allowing them to request and download footage directly from users through private messages. Ring and law enforcement officials said the effort enhanced public safety. In 2021, following mounting criticism against the feature, the company made law enforcement requests public on its Neighbors app through the Request for Assistance tool.
Now, Ring is curtailing those partnerships. The tool will be inactivated “this week,” the Amazon-owned company said. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
“Public safety agencies like fire and police departments can still use the Neighbors app to share helpful safety tips, updates, and community events,” Eric Kuhn, head of Ring’s Neighbors app, said in a company blog post, which adds that agencies will no longer be able to use the app’s Request for Assistance tool.
Posts made by law enforcement agencies may still include requests for footage, but users would need to share that footage directly with departments. Ring did not immediately address questions about what led to the change.
Emma Daniels, a company spokeswoman, told The Post on Thursday that Ring is “focusing our resources on delivering new product and app experiences that better empower our customers to connect with each other, and stay informed by local government and public safety agencies.”
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said the move is a positive step in maintaining Americans’ privacy but called for further restrictions.
“Ring hopefully will altogether be out of the business of platforming casual and warrantless police requests for footage to its users,” said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with the group. “This is a step in the right direction but has come after years of cozy relationships with police and irresponsible handling of data.”
Guariglia added that Ring’s new policy will not stop police from attempting to get footage without warrants through users or through the company. Law enforcement agencies can still request footage directly from the company.
The company’s guidelines state that while it does not disclose customer information unless required by a warrant, on “rare occasions” it will provide information to police “on an emergency basis.” The company provided videos to law enforcement 11 times in 2022 under this exception, the Associated Press reported.
Guariglia said privacy advocates remain skeptical about what would qualify as an emergency in those cases.
“Ring users should also know that when police knock on their door, they have the right to, and should, request that police get a warrant before handing over footage,” Guariglia said."
4XGSYO803I_3911VL4LF9SYZ36,Another provider of cloud services says Russian intelligence hacked it,Joseph Menn,"January 24, 2024 at 7:44 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/24/hpe-hacking-russia-cybersecurity/,"The major cloud computing provider spun out of Hewlett-Packard said late Wednesday that it had been hacked by a suspected Russian intelligence team, the second such hack of a major U.S. internet company reported this month.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hewlett Packard Enterprise said it was notified Jan. 12 of a breach that allowed hackers to steal emails from its cybersecurity employees and some others.
The disclosure follows a similar report Friday from Microsoft, which said in an SEC filing that it had lost senior executive emails as well as those of security professionals. It said the hackers appeared to be looking for information on what Microsoft knew about them.
HPE did not say how the attack had been uncovered but said the intruders first entered its systems in May 2023, taking the contents of a “small percentage” of overall Office 365 mailboxes belonging primarily to its cybersecurity and marketing departments, among others.
HPE and Microsoft have large numbers of government and defense customers, and both blamed a group associated with Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service for the intrusions. The group was behind the massive 2020 breach that began with altered software at SolarWinds and that went on to get inside the computer systems of SolarWinds customers at nine federal agencies.
“HPE is a huge cloud service provider, plus with the recent announcement of the Juniper acquisition a massive networking player,” said Chris Krebs, chief intelligence officer at security company SentinelOne and the head of cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security in the last administration. HPE announced Jan. 9 that it would spend $14 billion to acquire Juniper Networks, which designs computer networking equipment.
“It’s almost like a portfolio play by the SVR to see who’s on to them and maybe look for SolarWinds-like opportunities to compromise various aspects of the supply chain,” Krebs said.
The tech companies’ SEC filings come after tightened rules for when hacking incident must be disclosed. Both companies said they had not determined whether the breach and fallout would have a “material” impact on their finances, suggesting that they were filing out of an abundance of caution.
The companies said they were working with law enforcement and continuing to investigate.
U.S. intelligence officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

In today’s edition …  Sen. Schatz will introduce an amendment to any defense supplemental urging the pursuit of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians … Trump’s and Haley’s 2024 primary coalitions, visualized … but first …
If your phone is blowing up with messages from friends who pay little attention to politics and are in disbelief that the election will again be a rematch between President Biden and former president Donald Trump, you’re not alone.
After just two nominating contests, the Republican presidential primary appears to be over.
Trump still has to win nearly 1,200 delegates to officially clinch the nomination, but former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley is probably not going to be a significant obstacle.
New Hampshire was Haley’s best shot. Of all the early primary states, it has the type of voters who fit Haley’s demographic: moderate and independent. She ended up in second place behind Trump, with the former president leading her by around 11 percentage points.
Haley did run strong in some of New Hampshire’s most educated towns.
But those margins weren’t enough to overcome Trump’s strength in the rest of the state.
“We’re going home to South Carolina,” Haley said last night, saying she’ll stay in the race until her home state’s primary on Feb. 24.
Haley is holding a rally in North Charleston, S.C., today. And she’s also expected to speak at an event in the Virgin Islands, which holds its primary on Feb. 8. (The U.S. Virgin Islands are also a lovely place to relax and unwind. Just saying.)
But Haley faces uphill odds in conservative South Carolina, so this could become one of the shortest contested primaries since the modern system began in 1976. Since then, all seriously contested primaries have had challengers make it to Super Tuesday, typically held in March (including New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley who persisted against Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 Democratic primary despite never winning a state).
Of course, this primary is different. Trump is pretty much an incumbent, having been president before, and commands a loyal following.
Trump, who is facing 91 felony counts spread across four criminal cases, successfully consolidated support among Republicans even as he consistently tells lies about the 2020 election, which he lost. Few of Trump’s challengers pushed Trump hard on his criminal charges and false election claims, and Haley was not among them.
Hence, the size of the electorate, especially the Republican base, that sympathizes with Trump is quite large and was too hard to overcome.
In the New Hampshire Republican primary, 51 percent of voters erroneously believe Biden did not win the 2020 election. Eighty-six percent of those voters backed Trump. In Iowa, two-thirds of Republican primary voters believe Biden did not win in 2020, according to entrance polls. They overwhelmingly backed Trump, too.
And the Republican establishment, which would have preferred another candidate, has begun to rally around him.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a former member of Senate Republican leadership, came out in support of Trump last night. Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.), who represents a district Biden won by more than seven points in 2020, came out for Trump (kind of).
Expect to see more of this in the coming days.
It was also a big night for Biden. He wasn’t on the ballot because the Democratic National Committee chose South Carolina as the party’s first official primary contest, but his overwhelming victory in a write-in campaign was an attempt to show strength despite flagging poll numbers. (Today, we could learn how people in the Democratic primary wrote in “cease-fire” for the war in Gaza as a form of protest.)
But the Biden campaign also views this as the start of the general election. “It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee,” Biden said in a statement last night.
His two closest advisers at the White House, Jen O’Malley Dillon and Mike Donilon, are moving over to the campaign, our colleague Michael Scherer reported yesterday, just as the polls in New Hampshire closed.
Biden has hit the campaign trail this week, holding a joint rally with Vice President Harris and warning voters that Trump could further erode access to abortion if elected.
Trump’s weakness are clear. He lost college-educated voters, those making more than $100,000 and both those who define themselves as independents and are registered independents in New Hampshire, according to exit polls.
But where those voters go in a general election is an open question.
On the Hill
Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) will introduce an amendment to any supplemental bill urging the pursuit of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. The amendment comes amid growing discontent among Democrats about Israel’s handling of the war in Gaza and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s statements that a two-state solution is not possible.
We are watching how many Democrats sign on to the measure. Also, there must be a border security agreement before any supplemental for Ukraine and Israel is taken up on the Senate floor. A deal does not yet exist.
Trump: “Trump’s biggest boost in New Hampshire came from areas that helped power Republican Sen. Ted Cruz’s third-place finish in 2016,” according to a statistical model created by our colleagues Lenny Bronner, Derek Hawkins, Luis Melgar and Diane Napolitano that uses precinct-level results from 2016 and 2024, as well as demographic data, to determine the likely share of voters a 2024 candidate picked up.
Haley: “Haley performed well with Kasich’s 2016 base, according to The Post’s model, winning about three quarters of this bloc. But Haley’s overall 43 percent finish on Tuesday was slightly less than the sum of Kasich, Bush, Rubio and Christie’s margins eight years ago. Haley also took only a sliver of Cruz’s support from 2016, reflecting her struggle to win over other parts of the party, especially more conservative voters.”
U.S. forces struck two Houthi anti-ship missiles early Wednesday morning that were about to launch into the Red Sea, U.S. officials said, as part of the effort to crack down on the rebel group’s maritime attacks.
It is the ninth round of strikes on Houthi targets by the United States since Jan. 11 and comes after U.S. forces carried out separate attacks in Iraq the same day. U.S. forces struck three sites in Iraq used by Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia. The strikes were in retaliation for a weekend attack that wounded a small number of American personnel, our colleague Dan Lamothe reports.

5HTPZ3UTP0_0WOW3IRCAQSMQSB,Casey Anthony trial: Final expert witnesses take the stand,_,"June 15, 2011 at 4:16 p.m. EDT",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/casey-anthony-trial-final-expert-witnesses-take-the-stand/2011/06/15/AGxbdNWH_story.html,"The murder trial of Casey Anthony is in its fourth week and nearing its close as final expert witnesses take the stand.  The AP reports:
Prosecutors finished presenting their case Wednesday morning against a Florida woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter.
Casey Anthony’s attorneys are expected to call their first witness Thursday, assuming the judge denies a standard defense motion asking for the case to be thrown out. The defense has claimed the toddler was not slain but instead drowned in her grandparents’ pool.
Over several weeks of testimony, prosecutors have laid out their case that Caylee Anthony was suffocated with duct tape, though a medical examiner testified the cause of death was undetermined. Only the “manner of death” was ruled to be homicide. If convicted, she faces the death penalty.
Prosecutors have built their mostly circumstantial case on 25-year-old Casey Anthony’s conduct and the lies she told about her daughter’s whereabouts.
They also have relied on forensics experts. They’ve talked about smells of human decomposition in Anthony’s car, searches on her computer, including for chloroform several times, and duct tape found on the girl’s skull. Caylee disappeared in summer 2008 and her mother did not report her being gone for a month. The child’s skeletal remains were found about six months later near her grandparents’ home.
The jury was dismissed Wednesday morning with strict orders not to discuss the case or watch newscasts during their hiatus. They will return Thursday morning.
Caylee was last seen in mid-June of 2008 and was reported missing on July 15. Her remains were found in December of that year in a wooded area near the Anthony home.
On Tuesday, FBI forensics experts finished testifying about the remains of Caylee Anthony. The AP reported:
The first witness of the day, fiber investigator Stephen Shaw, told jurors he analyzed the single hair found in Casey Anthony’s trunk and compared it to samples found with Caylee Anthony’s skull.
Shaw testified that he saw more evidence of human decomposition on the hairs taken from the child’s remains than on the hair found in the trunk. That suggests that if there were a body in Anthony’s trunk, it wasn’t there for very long.
He also said he found the same microscopic characteristics for the skull hair as the trunk hair, but could not say they definitely were a match.
But Perry ruled that prosecutors could not show jurors an electronic presentation of the hair analysis that would have been more detailed than verbal testimony and shown a visual representation of hair decomposition.
Perry said he found it troubling that the contents of the study were not shared with defense attorneys ahead of time. Jurors waited outside the courtroom for about 20 minutes while the issue was settled.
Defense attorney Jose Baez also later got Shaw to say on cross-examination that exposure to the elements could cause scientists to misidentify the presence of decomposition in hair.
FBI physical scientist Elizabeth Fontaine said that her examination of duct tape found at the crime scene didn’t yield any latent fingerprints. But she testified that she did notice the outline of a heart on one of the three pieces while examining it under ultra-violet lighting.

5KO9VF3A44_XBO0B8UJ4L23RVA,Trump delivers brief testimony in E. Jean Carroll defamation damages trial,Shayna Jacobs,"January 25, 2024 at 4:53 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/25/trump-defamation-damages-trial-e-jean-carroll/,"NEW YORK — A visibly angry Donald Trump took the witness stand in New York federal court Thursday, delivering a few minutes of testimony in a defamation damages trial against him before walking out of court in a huff, declaring, “This is not America.”
The former president’s much-anticipated testimony — in a civil trial brought by writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her — lasted about three minutes and did not offer much in the way of evidence, but the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination complained bitterly before and after testifying that the judge was being unfair to him.
The trial is meant to determine what, if any, additional damages he owes Carroll, who was awarded $5 million in a previous trial against Trump.
Coming on the heels of a resounding win in the New Hampshire primary this week, Thursday’s courthouse hearing highlighted the degree to which his legal troubles seem to have boosted, not hampered, his appeal to Republican voters. Trump also faces four separate criminal trials; he has denied wrongdoing in all cases.
1/6
Voting came up in court, too. Carroll’s team played a video deposition in which Trump called mail-in ballots “very dishonest” and said he didn’t know what happens to those ballots after they are mailed in. Watching himself say that on the screen, Trump turned to his lawyer in court and said, “It’s true.”
In that same deposition clip, Trump admitted that he sometimes votes by mail.
Trump employees in court Thursday included Walt Nauta, an aide and co-defendant in a federal classified documents indictment who was seen delivering a bottle of water to his boss, and Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, who was removed from the proceeding when it was interrupted by his ringing phone.
U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan had repeatedly warned Trump lawyer Alina Habba that if the former president testified, the number of topics he could discuss would be severely limited, based in part on rules of evidence and the legal findings from the previous trial.
“I want to know everything he is going to say” before he gets on the stand, Kaplan said sternly. Habba was asked to give a trial run outside the presence of the jury of what the testimony would involve, which the judge said had to be questions and responses that would not allow Trump to opine on the underlying issues in the case.
As the lawyers discussed the boundary lines of testimony, Trump muttered loud enough for some observers in the courtroom to hear.
“I never met her. I’ve never seen her before,” Trump said from the defense table, noting that he didn’t attend the first trial. Those comments immediately earned the judge’s wrath.
“Mr. Trump, please keep your voice down,” the judge scolded him. Trump didn’t heed the warning, and Kaplan reprimanded him again quickly, saying, “I’m sorry, Mr. Trump, you’re interrupting these proceedings by talking loudly while your attorney is talking and that is not permitted.”
Trump and his lawyer wanted him to be able to tell the jury in his own words that he did not sexually assault Carroll in a department store in the 1990s. But that issue was already settled in the trial last year when a jury found that Trump had sexually abused and defamed Carroll. Kaplan said he would not allow Trump to repeat his denials on the witness stand.
When Habba told Kaplan that Trump has denied the sexual assault, Trump said angrily: “Still do.”
“Unbelievable,” Trump muttered to himself. At one point, as he stood in the well of the court, Trump could be heard complaining bitterly to his lawyers, saying, “He shouldn’t be able to do this. This is a separate trial.”
When it was time to stop reviewing matters with the judge and start testifying, Trump lumbered slowly to the witness stand, walking past the nine-member jury without looking at them.
He raised his right hand, swore to tell the truth and quickly angered the judge again.
Though Kaplan had warned Trump and his lawyer to keep his answers brief, Trump said he denied Carroll’s accusation when she first made them because “I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.” Kaplan immediately ordered that statement stricken from the official record of the trial.
Trump was briefly cross-examined by Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, who conducted his 2022 deposition in the case.
As he left court, Trump muttered angrily, “This is not America,” a phrase he repeated, getting louder as he walked out of the room with a phalanx of lawyers.
The trial is scheduled to resume Friday and include closing statements.
Carroll, a former magazine columnist, accused Trump in 2019 of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s. Trump vehemently denied her allegations and has publicly assailed the writer, calling her mentally ill and accusing her of lying. She filed two lawsuits against Trump, accusing him of defamation in one case and sexual battery and defamation in another.
Carroll’s other lawsuit, accusing him of defaming her with his original denials, went to trial this month in a Manhattan courtroom.
This case, though, has a narrower focus than last year’s trial. Kaplan, who has overseen both trials involving Carroll’s lawsuits, ruled in September that the jury verdict in the first case demonstrated that Trump’s comments about Carroll were false. Instead of re-litigating the accusations, Kaplan said, this trial would deal with the damages question.
In an order before the trial got underway, Kaplan said Trump would not be allowed to offer “testimony, evidence, or argument” denying that he sexually assaulted Carroll. She testified during the trial last year that Trump violently attacked her during a chance encounter at Bergdorf Goodman, an upscale Manhattan department store, decades before he won the White House. Despite saying he would face her in court, Trump ultimately never attended that trial or testified.
Trump has shown a willingness to lash out in court against his adversaries. Closing statements were delivered this month in a separate civil case accusing Trump and his business of financial fraud. The former president launched into a courtroom monologue denigrating the case and its judge, who had sought — unsuccessfully — to impose restrictions on his remarks."
5UUQDJ9TBW_SS4UDPVRNC64BP0,"Charles Fried, legal scholar who bridged law and ethics, dies at 88",Brian Murphy,"January 25, 2024 at 9:19 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/25/charles-fried-solicitor-general-dies/,"Charles Fried, a legal scholar and ethicist who explored questions of morality and law but also engaged in self-examination of his own views, including backing constitutional abortion rights decades after he argued against them as solicitor general during the Reagan era, died Jan. 23 at 88.
The death was announced by Harvard University, where Dr. Fried began teaching law in 1961. No other details were immediately made public.
In legal and academic circles, Dr. Fried became a powerful voice as a gradualist who favored court decisions that built upon, rather than upended, existing laws and systems — despite once urging the Supreme Court to strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling on the constitutional right to abortion.
In the political world, he was part the conservative GOP establishment that stood against former president Donald Trump and, at times, aligned himself with Democrats. In December, he wrote a defense of Claudine Gay, then the Harvard president, who resigned in January amid allegations of plagiarism and fallout from her testimony to Congress about how to confront reports of antisemitism on campus linked to the war in Gaza.
“If I were a university president pressed to answer yes or no whether the student speech in question would subject the students to discipline,” Dr. Fried wrote in the Harvard Crimson, “I would have to reply that, yes, it depends on the context.”
For more than a half century, Dr. Fried’s lectures and books peered into many corners of the law and legal theory — from probing the philosophical groundings of attorney-client relationship to making the case that any type of government-sanctioned torture is amoral and illegal.
Yet his deepest influence came from work that sought to stress-test constitutional principles and the Supreme Court’s role in interpreting them.
Dr. Fried became one of leading proponents of an idea known as “constitutional doctrine” that, in its broadest view, represents a code of legal ethics and standards that would leave little room for politics in deciding cases. He increasingly raised alarms over “legal realism,” the concept that the courts must take into consideration prevailing social interests and public policy.
“The ambition of the law goes further: each legal decision should be referable to a rule or principle,” he wrote in his book “Saying What the Law Is: The Constitution in the Supreme Court” (2004), “it should be justifiable not just by the good that it does but as part of the fabric of the law.”
His views took on added resonance because of his time in the crosscurrents between politics and the Supreme Court, serving in the Reagan administration from 1985 to 1989 as solicitor general. Selecting Dr. Fried raised many eyebrows in Washington. Despite his credentials as a professor and author, Dr. Fried had not tried a case in court in 24 years before he assumed one of the highest positions in the Justice Department. (He was previously deputy solicitor general.)
“Oral arguments are still the hardest part of my job to get used to … I feel nervous every time I argue before the Supreme Court,” he told The Washington Post in 1985, six months into the job.
He argued more than 20 cases before the high court as solicitor general, including losing a 1986 case in which the Supreme Court, on a 5-4 vote, upheld a court-ordered plan that required half of state trooper promotions in Alabama go to Black officers. (Dr. Fried argued for the government that the promotions should be less than 50 percent Black and reflect the state’s racial demographics.)
In 1989, he unsuccessfully argued for the reversal of Roe in the case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services over a Missouri antiabortion statute. He was no longer solicitor general, but the Justice Department asked him to lead the case because his replacement was not yet appointed.
In a November 2021 essay in the New York Times — about seven months before the Supreme Court overturned Roe — Dr. Fried appealed to save the landmark ruling. He said the decision was bigger than abortion and provided the framework for legal battles such as expanding LGBTQ+ rights.
“I made these points in good conscience, drawing on a mix of history, precedent and what I saw as the interests of the rule of law,” he wrote of his earlier attempt to strike down Roe.
“To overturn Roe now would be an act of constitutional vandalism — not conservative, but reactionary,” he added.
The comments were part of his political evolution, which played out in speeches, interviews and op-ed pages. Dr. Fried took on a self-appointed role as a conscience of conservatives dismayed by the growing right-wing grip on the Republican Party.
Dr. Fried was active in the 2008 presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) but then publicly broke ranks and announced that he planned to vote for Barack Obama. Dr. Fried thought McCain’s choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate was too dangerous “at a time of deep national crisis.”
During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in 2011 on the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, Dr. Fried was asked by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) for his opinion on critics’ claims that demanding citizens to have insurance is equivalent to forcing them eat vegetables.
“That would be a violation of the 5th and the 14th Amendment, to force you to eat something,” Dr. Fried replied. “But to force you to pay for something? I don’t see why not. It may not be a good idea, but I don’t see why it’s unconstitutional.”
Dr. Fried made public endorsements for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. Trevor Potter, president the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit group where Dr. Fried served on the board, said Dr. Fried’s experience as a young boy fleeing antisemitism in Europe in the late 1930s gave him a deep affinity for “the rule of law.”
“He saw what happened when a settled system is radically overturned,” said Potter. “This informed his views all his life.”
Charles Anthony Fried was born April 15, 1935, in Prague. His father was a factory owner and industrialist, and his mother was a homemaker. The family fled in 1939 with Nazi forces occupying parts of Czechoslovakia and antisemitism on the rise. They arrived in the United States in 1941 after spending nearly two years in Britain. The family settled in New York.
“I am a refugee,” Dr. Fried said in a 2023 Harvard Law forum, referring to the European Jewish diaspora from World War II.
He graduated from Princeton University in 1956 with a degree in modern languages and literature, and then studied jurisprudence at the University of Oxford, getting a bachelor’s degree in 1958 and master’s degree in 1960. He returned to New York and received a law degree from Columbia Law School later in 1960, and went on to clerk for Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II.
After Ronald Reagan’s election as president in 1980, Dr. Fried served in advisory roles in the administration and was a special assistant to the attorney general from 1984 to 1985. A decade later, in September 1995, he began a nearly four-year term as associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts while teaching constitutional law at Harvard Law School.
Outside of government, he argued several major cases before the Supreme Court, notably Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in 1993 in a case alleging birth defects linked to an anti-nausea medication, Bendectin. The case, in which Dr. Fried was hired to represent Merrell Dow, established standards for the use of expert and scientific evidence in federal courts.
Among his more than 10 books were treatises on how moral and political philosophy can be applied to contemporary law, including “An Anatomy of Values” (1970) and “Right and Wrong” (1978). In his 1991 book, “Order & Law: Arguing the Reagan Revolution,” Dr. Fried discussed his goals and struggles as solicitor general and his appearances before the Supreme Court.
Survivors include his wife of 65 years, Anne Summerscale, and two children, Gregory and Antonia.
Dr. Fried liked to share insider tips from his appearances before the Supreme Court. Few questions often meant the justices had likely already made up their minds, he said. Being grilled was always a better sign.
“It’s not a professor with nine students,” he recalled in a 2013 interview. “It’s nine professors with one student.”"
5XFC98AIN7_PJDBGE9SDRLDN9L,Opinion Economic illiteracy and unseemly xenophobia hit the U.S. Steel deal,George F. Will,"January 26, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/26/vance-rubio-hawley-protest-steel-deal/,"The crisis du jour, according to some febrile senators, is a Japanese corporation’s intention to buy America’s 573rd largest U.S. corporation (as this is written, its market capitalization is smaller than that of Casey’s General Stores). The U.S. corporation for sale has fewer employees (22,470) than Dave & Buster’s (a chain of restaurants with games).
Three excitable Republican senators, all self-described conservatives, have temporarily suspended their vigilance against socialism to exhort the Biden administration to prevent this market-directed efficiency in capital allocation. The senators — Ohio’s J.D. Vance, Missouri’s Josh Hawley and Florida’s Marco Rubio — say that if Nippon Steel, the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker, purchases U.S. Steel, the 27th-largest, U.S. national security will be imperiled.
Vance says U.S. Steel is a “critical piece” of the U.S. “defense industrial base.” But this corporation, which is just the fourth-largest U.S. steel producer, will still produce steel, but more efficiently. And Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in 2017 that just 3 percent of domestic steel production is required for defense purposes. And Japan, one of the most important U.S. allies, will become more so as a collaborative producer of an important commodity. And, by the way, Nippon vows to keep U.S. Steel’s headquarters in Pittsburgh.
J.D. Vance: America cannot afford to auction off its industrial base
Rubio, whose campaign donors include domestic sugar producers, and who says sugar import quotas protect America’s “food security,” says the sale of U.S. Steel is a “poignant metaphor” for America’s “deindustrialization.” Nippon, however, intends to modernize, not liquidate, U.S. Steel.
A Vance-Rubio-Hawley letter to the Biden administration derides U.S. Steel for acting to maximize shareholder value, and says Nippon’s “allegiances clearly lie with a foreign state.” No, Nippon’s allegiances are to its shareholders, who it thinks will prosper if U.S. Steel also does in alliance with Nippon. Bruce Craig expects this. In a letter to the Wall Street Journal he said:
“I am a steel metallurgical engineer with more than 50 years consulting on large industrial projects around the world, some of which require very high quality steels. I have also been through many of the Nippon Steel mills and U.S. Steel mills. Without exception Nippon has some of the highest-quality steel-making technology of any steel producer in the world. U.S. Steel on the other hand ranks far below many of the other high-quality mills around the world. America would benefit by having Nippon Steel upgrade the quality of our steel-making.”
Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, calls it “outrageous” that U.S. Steel is selling itself to a “foreign nation.” But Nippon is not a nation. Like U.S. Steel, it is a publicly traded private corporation, some of whose shares probably are owned by U.S. individuals and pension funds. As Reason’s Eric Boehm notes, Nippon, which has been operating in America for 40 years, already owns two U.S.-based steelmakers, Standard Steel and Wheeling-Nippon Steel.
Time was, U.S. Steel symbolized American bountifulness. (As did A&P grocery stores. Remember them? Didn’t think so.) But U.S. Steel peaked early. Brian Potter, who writes the Constructive Physics newsletter, says that when U.S. Steel was formed in 1901, it was the world’s largest corporation, and the nation’s first billion dollar corporation — its $1.4 billion valuation was more than twice the size of the federal budget. By 1971, however, U.S. Steel was no longer world’s largest steelmaker. It chose to become a ward of government. It sought protection from foreign competition through government “industrial policy” — protective tariffs, import quotas, subsidies, “Buy American” mandates, etc. — rather than through modernization.
Predictably, its industrial muscles atrophied. Potter says: “As far as I can tell, no major steelmaking technology over the last century came out of U.S. Steel.”
Vance, Rubio and Hawley pose as protectors of workers (steelworkers are 0.05 percent of the non-farm labor force), but Nippon says it will keep U.S. Steel’s union commitments. The senators seem somehow threatened by foreign corporations’ investments in the U.S. economy. This, even though, as National Review reports, these investments are, cumulatively, larger than the German economy. And these investments come here to finance Americans making things here. Matthew J. Slaughter, dean of Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, recently noted in the Wall Street Journal that Japanese companies employ more than 963,000 Americans.
Economic illiteracy, mixed with foggy nostalgia and unseemly xenophobia, is a familiar populist cocktail served by demagogues to the gullible. Do you remember the 1989 angst when Mitsubishi’s purchase of Rockefeller Center supposedly somehow signaled Japan’s ascendancy over a declining America?
In 2000, a U.S. company bought Rockefeller Center. So, politicians manning the nation’s ramparts to fend off foreign investors can breathe a bit easier."
65DR87CPOG_12A2U461AT2CP8M,Lawmakers warn that Biden must seek authorization before further strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels,_,"January 26, 2024 at 12:06 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/yemen-houthi-red-sea-congress-biden/1dea769e-bc6d-11ee-b176-fe5fd794e716_story.html,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of lawmakers is raising concerns over a series of recent U.S. military strikes against Yemen Houthi rebels, urging the Biden administration to get congressional authorization before taking further military action in the Middle East.
In a letter to President Joe Biden on Friday, a coalition of nearly 30 House members expressed their strong opposition to what they described as “unauthorized” American strikes that have further escalated the biggest confrontation at sea the U.S. Navy has seen in the Middle East in a decade.
“As representatives of the American people, Congress must engage in robust debate before American servicemembers are put in harm’s way and before more U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent on yet another war in the Middle East,” the letter, led by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, stated. “No President, regardless of political party, has the constitutional authority to bypass Congress on matters of war.”
The lawmakers, who hail from the far-right and far-left of their respective parties, represent a small but growing faction in Congress that is skeptical of the nation’s increasing involvement in the Middle East in recent months.
The White House, for their part, has defended the multiple rounds of airstrikes it has taken in partnership with the United Kingdom since early January in response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.
Since the beginning of the year, Biden has written several times to Congress stating that the strikes have complied with the 1973 War Powers Act. That law, passed during the Vietnam War, serves as a constitutional check on presidential power to declare war without congressional consent. It requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action and limits the use of military forces to no more than 60 days unless Congress authorizes force or declares war.
But lawmakers, including a bipartisan group of senators, have said that decades-old statute does not give the president the “blanket authority” to take military action simply by notifying Congress within 48 hours.
The letter from Khanna and Davidson asserts that the notification only stands if the commander-in-chief “must act due to an attack or imminent attack against the United States.” They said the escalating tensions in the Middle East do not rise to that level.
“We ask that your Administration outlines for us the legal authority used to conduct these strikes, and we urge your Administration to seek authorization from Congress before conducting any more unauthorized strikes in Yemen,” the lawmakers wrote.
Biden has stated that the U.S. would continue the strikes against the Houthis, even though so far they have failed to deter the group from further harassing commercial and military vessels in the region.
When asked by reporters last week if he believes the strikes are working, Biden said, “When you say ‘working,’ are they stopping the Houthis? No.”
He added, “Are they going to continue? Yes.”"

Now, that development is the demise of the DeSantis campaign. At one point, Ron DeSantis was the only candidate who seemed to seriously threaten Donald Trump’s stranglehold on the reins of the Republican Party; he even led Trump head-to-head in a bunch of polls. But that was a long time ago, and now he’s out.
The Florida governor ended his campaign Sunday. That means a GOP field that featured five major candidates less than two weeks ago is down to two. And the head-to-head race between Trump and Nikki Haley means the New Hampshire primary Tuesday could deliver a decisive verdict.
Perhaps most significantly, though, it could provide the clearest distillation to date of where the GOP stands in the battle between Trumpism and traditional Republicanism — and just how dominant the former is.
The end of DeSantis’s campaign has invited plenty of looking back. Few campaigns have featured such promise and so steadily petered out. DeSantis had virtually limitless resources, yet he proved to be an awkward candidate selling a vision that voters had little use for.
In some ways, it calls to mind another Florida governor who led in early primary polls and floundered in the face of Trump: Jeb Bush in 2016.
But the new battle lines in the 2024 nominating contest provide something that 2016 campaign never really did: a one-on-one matchup between Trump and traditional Republicanism.
Sign up for The Campaign Moment newsletter
The effort to defeat Trump in 2016 was marred in some ways by the failure to isolate a single alternative. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Ohio governor John Kasich both stuck around until early May, dropping out within a day of one another.
The idea that distilling that race to two candidates earlier might have changed the result was overblown. But nobody ever really got the chance to press a binary choice between Trumpism and a more traditional brand of conservatism.
We now have that — in spades — with Haley versus Trump. More than perhaps any candidate in either 2016 or 2024, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador exudes the 2000s-era Republican Party and Reaganism. She’s hawkish on foreign policy, relatively pragmatic, talks seriously about cutting spending (even Social Security), and isn’t so consumed with provocation and owning the libs.
It’s basically as if the 2016 campaign actually came down to Trump against a Bush.
The problem for Haley is that it seems clear what voters will choose. The party has drifted away from what were once standard conservative positions — on issues such as trade, foreign policy and entitlements — that practically defined it in the 2004 election. While Ronald Reagan had long been Republicans’ clear choice for greatest recent president, Trump is now nipping at his heels.
The reason Haley provides such an important test case is not just because she’s the first to get Trump one-on-one, but also because she has largely stuck to these old-style Republican positions in the process. She has kept on talking about raising the Social Security retirement age (for young workers). She has made passionate cases for standing by Ukraine, even as the GOP base has headed in the opposite direction. While DeSantis tried to marry a more traditional-seeming candidate with “America First”-style owning the libs, Haley has stuck to her vision.
Haley will in all likelihood come up well short. She is polling best in New Hampshire, and she still trails Trump there — including by double digits in the most recent Washington Post-Monmouth University poll. The most recent national poll testing a head-to-head race between her and Trump showed Trump leading by more than 50 points. Virtually all surveys suggest DeSantis supporters will break for Trump.
But the margins will be extremely instructive when it comes to just how much the modern Republican Party has shed its old skin.
There is little doubt that DeSantis timed his exit — after finishing second in Iowa — to avoid some potentially embarrassing losses that could hamstring his future aspirations. Despite his campaign’s failure, DeSantis remains in good standing with the Republican Party and even with Trump’s base, which he could build on if he runs in 2028.
But at least for now, it appears hard feelings remain. DeSantis “kissed the ring” in endorsing Trump on Sunday, but he didn’t exactly linger there.
DeSantis’s scripted four-minute video featured a mostly perfunctory endorsement of Trump. He didn’t really praise Trump, instead casting this as the result of Trump’s big lead in the polls, his pledge to support the party’s nominee, and how Trump is better than President Biden.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”- Winston Churchill pic.twitter.com/ECoR8YeiMm
DeSantis also made rather conspicuous allusions to how Trump’s presidency was “stymied” by his opponents — the logical extension being that Trump couldn’t overcome them — and to his disagreements with Trump on the pandemic. DeSantis even saw fit, for some reason, to mention Trump’s “elevation of Anthony Fauci.”
(That last one was a late flash point in the campaign.)
The lack of enthusiasm hasn’t yet let to a large backlash, but former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon on Monday labeled DeSantis a “9-year-old petulant child.”
We wouldn’t expect DeSantis to emulate Cruz’s approach and pursue a vendetta against Trump after dropping out. The course of things in the GOP make clear that embracing Trump is necessary for any ambitious Republican’s future. Perhaps DeSantis worried what it would look like to effusively praise Trump just a week after deriding how transactional it is for Republicans to kiss Trump’s ring.
But this dynamic is certainly something worth watching.
The Iowa caucuses provided a reality check when it comes to just how much election denialism pervades the GOP; nearly two-thirds of caucus-goers said Biden’s 2020 win wasn’t legitimate.
And perhaps no bigger chasm looms over the New Hampshire primary, as a nugget from the new Post-Monmouth poll shows.
The poll shows fewer voters there subscribe to Trump’s false stolen election claim; 51 percent say Biden won due to voter fraud, while 42 percent say he won fair and square.
But look at how those voters break down: Trump supporters say 82 percent to 11 percent that Biden won because of fraud, while Haley supporters say 87 percent to 8 percent that Biden’s win was fair and square."

Still, the street vendor also wishes that the longtime autocrat had never been removed. Like many Egyptians on Tuesday, Salim had mixed emotions about Mubarak's passing.
“I know that people revolted against him for all the right reasons,” the 24-year-old said. “But after living under our current conditions, I think people have more appreciation for him.”
“If Mubarak was a thief, then what do you call the ones who came after him?”
From the archives: With peace, Egyptians overthrow a dictator
Across Egypt, emotions ran the gamut in the wake of the death of Mubarak, 91, in a Cairo hospital after surgery. There were relief and muted glee that the man who had repressed the Arab world’s most populous nation for three decades, and who was ousted in 2011 during the massive Arab Spring uprisings that rocked the region, was dead.
There were also sadness and grief. Some Egyptians called him a father figure and a war hero for his role in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Others were indifferent to his death, for Mubarak had been ailing and sidelined for years.
What they collectively evinced, however, was that they viewed his passing through the prism of today’s Egypt — and that has improved the former autocrat’s image even among some of his staunchest detractors.
Today, Egyptians are living under another authoritarian leader, President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, whose regime is widely considered more repressive than Mubarak’s. And the vast majority of Egyptians are worse off than they were under Mubarak’s own erratic economy.
“Mubarak will be remembered by Egyptians in probably a very polarizing fashion,” said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “For his fans, he was a war hero, but the regime Mubarak built meant repression and economic dysfunctionality. And that all led to the 2011 revolutionary uprising, which ultimately led to his ouster.
“That’s Mubarak’s legacy: the uprising and the factors that led to it. The uprising is over, but the factors remain and have intensified.”
On Tuesday, Egypt’s military, which deposed Mubarak in 2011 amid the populist revolt, referred to the former air force officer as a war hero in a tweet. A military funeral is scheduled for Wednesday after noon prayers at el-Mosheer Tantawi mosque, one of Cairo’s most well-known mosques. Sissi, a former military general himself, announced three days of mourning for Mubarak.
Even as the military planned a glorious send-off, state-run and pro-Sissi media noted that Mubarak’s regime was marked by corruption, wasteful spending and failed infrastructure projects, and that he manipulated the constitution and elections in his favor.
Timothy Kaldas, a nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington, said such coverage is an attempt by the Sissi government to undermine any fond remembrances of Mubarak. But Sissi, Kaldas noted, also has been accused of the same misspending and much worse repression.
“In trying to deter nostalgia for Mubarak, they’re reminding ppl of [Sissi’s] flaws,” Kaldas tweeted.
Egypt protests over viral videos alleging taxpayer funds stolen to build lavish hotel and palace
Mohamed Fawzy, a 32-year-old engineer, said he was “ecstatic” when Mubarak was “forced to step down.” Today, he admits that he is worse off economically and that he worries about issues such as water scarcity. But he blames Mubarak for his woes.
“We revolted against injustice, his plans to force his son on us and police brutality,” Fawzy said. “In a way, he is a direct accomplice in the situation we are facing now. He created a state of political voidness. . . . There was no politics under Mubarak, no one was on the political scene but him, and this is what has left us where we are now.”
Mona Seif, a human rights activist, said she was not “as joyful as I would have thought I’d be” about Mubarak’s death. She added that it “doesn’t change the injustice he started or alleviate the repressive oppression we are dealing with now.” Her brother, fellow activist Alaa Abd-El Fattah, was jailed under the Mubarak regime and is currently detained by the Sissi government.
“The first image I had in my head when I heard the news of Mubarak’s death was of me banging on the Tora prison door, wanting to share the news with Alaa,” Seif said.
To Sabah Abdellatif, 60, a retired teacher, Mubarak’s passing felt “like losing a father figure.” Even though she didn’t approve of Mubarak’s repressive tactics and economic decisions, Abdellatif is willing to reassess the former president’s legacy. “He must have faced other pressures,” Abdellatif said. “I can now see that. We are saddened by his death.”
Other Egyptians said they wished Mubarak had never been toppled. Under Sissi, strict austerity measures have led to rising prices, subsidy cuts, deepening poverty, unemployment and a lack of opportunities — the very factors that triggered Mubarak’s downfall. While the economy is showing some signs of improving, the benefits have not trickled down to most Egyptians.
Ahmed Andeel, 39, a sales manager, said that under Mubarak, he would have spent 50 Egyptian pounds a day to feed his family. Now, 1,000 pounds doesn’t pay for half their groceries. “My biggest shock was when Mubarak was removed,” Andeel said. “I am wholeheartedly against any revolution in any country. My life under Mubarak was better. My life was much simpler and safer.”

Far from the battlefields of the Middle East or Ukraine, a very different war is being waged over the future of American foreign policy. In rallies in New Hampshire this week, former president Donald Trump blasted his last remaining rival in the race to be the Republican candidate in this year’s election, Nikki Haley, as a “warmonger” beloved by “globalists,” adding that he alone could “prevent World War III.”
For now, at least, it looks like a winning argument. Trump was the victor in Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary. Sure, it was not quite the overwhelming victory his team would have liked, with the former South Carolina governor Haley now saying she intends to stay in the running until the summer. But after an earlier win in Iowa that took out Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, many analysts view the Trump campaign as nearly unstoppable.
If so, it would reverberate not only in November’s presidential election, but around the world. On Tuesday, the London-headquartered but globalist-friendly Financial Times wrote that it was a battle between “clashing visions of America’s place in the world,” with Haley a more “traditionally Hawkish Republican” and Trump exhibiting “more isolationist streak that has been gaining traction on the right of American politics.”
Haley has leaned into foreign policy to criticize Trump. She has accused the former president of having a “bromance” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sending “love letters” to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un after the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier who was imprisoned by Kim’s regime.
But this isn’t a simple battle between a hawk and an isolationist. Under Trump, Haley served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for two years. She unexpectedly resigned from that position in October 2018 — but as The Washington Post’s Michael Kranish wrote last week in an assessment of her time in diplomacy, she waited years before coming out to criticize Trump’s record.
Her time at the United Nations was often spent publicly praising Trump’s foreign policy. In September 2018, just before leaving office, she offered an implausible defense of an address by Trump to the U.N. General Assembly that set spontaneous laughter among the assembled world leaders. “They loved how honest he is,” Haley told Fox News.
Haley faces growing pressure from Republicans to drop out of presidential race
The divide between a Trump foreign policy and a Haley one is more subtle than either would admit. As she has admitted, Haley was as much a novice to foreign policy in 2016 as Trump was. “I don’t even know what the United Nations does! All I know is everyone hates it,” she told an intermediary to Trump, according to her memoir.
While Haley led aggressive policies against U.S. rivals like Syria and North Korea, she did so at a moment when Trump himself was playing the hawk — most obviously in the successful push for U.N. sanctions in 2018 that coincided with Trump’s threats to Kim, whom he dismissed as “Little Rocket Man.” By the time that relations between Washington and Pyongyang were warming, she was already heading out the door.
As Kranish writes, during her time at the United Nations, Haley led the charge to cut off U.S. funding to the U.N. agency that provides support for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. That move brought her into conflict with other administration officials including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who partially blocked it, but it proved popular with Trump and funding was cut after Tillerson was forced out.
For someone who often speaks about her achievements in the U.N. system, Haley isn’t much of a multilateralist, promising last year to defund the system as “much as possible.” She embraces some conspiratorial Trumpian rhetoric, describing the World Health Organization as “bought and paid for by the Chinese.”
While Haley hasn’t always aligned with Trumpian foreign policy, some would argue that often Trump didn’t either. Writing in the Daily Mail this week, former British prime minister Boris Johnson argued that a second Trump presidency could be “just what the world needs” precisely because Trump’s isolationist rhetoric was often at odds with his actions.
Johnson points toward the Trump-ordered strikes against the Syrian regime after it used chemical weapons or the targeted killing of Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, as evidence that Trump was willing to strike at Western enemies. When it comes to Ukraine, Johnson noted that military aid to the country significantly expanded during the Trump administration compared with the Obama administration.
Johnson’s views may be wildly optimistic, but there is also a throughline that connects much of Trump’s foreign policy with that of the Biden administration. It was President Biden, for example, who pulled the United States out of Afghanistan; his administration has kept the U.S. Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem and courted Arab autocracies like Saudi Arabia.
Inside the breakup of Haley and Trump’s partnership over her U.N. role
Where Trump breaks with his rivals is not his isolationism, but his embrace of autocracy. Biden has pushed a global democracy message, even if there are criticisms of how well this has worked. Haley has taken a parallel approach in her campaign, warning that Trump would “buddy up” with “dictators” like North Korea’s Kim, Russia’s Putin or China’s Xi Jinping.
Trump still doesn’t hide his affinity for strongman leaders. During a rally in Manchester, N.H., this past weekend, he praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, an autocratic leader who amassed power through control of the media and changes to the constitution. “He is a very great leader, a very strong man,” Trump said. “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong.”
Whatever impact this has on his foreign policy pales in comparison to the weight it carries at home. Trump still falsely claims that he won the 2020 election and has led revisionist claims about Jan. 6 defendants, calling them hostages and quoting Putin that the arrest of insurrectionists shows the “rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy.”
But Trump’s derision of democracy is Haley’s problem, too. It hobbles her claims that she would fight back against autocrats as president. She may criticize Trump’s fondness for dictators now, but she served under the man and only spoke out against his attacks on democracy after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol.
In a profile of Haley published in 2021, only a few months after that assault, Politico’s Tim Alberta asked a question about the former U.N. ambassador that still resonates today: “If she so badly misread Trump — a man whose habits and methods she had ample opportunity to study up close — then how can she be trusted to handle the likes of Vladimir Putin?”"
6I5ULU2D7J_NPTRAI90JCZOBQ6,"Opinion Yes, North Korea is preparing for war — in Ukraine and the Middle East",Josh Rogin,"January 25, 2024 at 1:58 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/north-korea-war-ukraine-gaza-russia-hamas/,"A recent series of erratic moves by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is leading many in Washington to speculate that he is preparing for war on the Korean Peninsula. But there’s another, more plausible explanation for the despot’s behavior — that he is focused on helping his friends in Russia (and Iran) win the wars they are already in. For the West, that is the newest and fastest-growing threat from the country.
Getting inside the mind of any dictator is a challenge — and Kim is among the most hermitic. So North Korea experts have been left to draw their own alarming conclusions from his recent behavior. Just last week, Kim told his own parliament North Korea was abandoning efforts to reunify with South Korea, a project his father championed. Then, to drive the point home, he literally demolished the monument to reunification that stood for decades in Pyongyang.
On top of that, Kim is regularly firing cruise missiles in the direction of his neighbors, deployed a military satellite successfully for the first time and, according to newly released satellite imagery, has started operations at a new nuclear reactor. Some prominent North Korea experts read those tea leaves and conclude Kim is getting ready for battle.
“We believe that, like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,” the respected North Korea scholars Robert L. Carlin and Siegfried S. Hecker wrote earlier this month.
Kim’s turn away from diplomacy with Washington and his abandonment of reunification with South Korea are signals that his fundamental worldview has changed, these experts argue. That seems right. But the two experts might be jumping to the conclusion that Kim is preparing his people and his military actually to fight.
More likely, Kim’s fiery rhetoric and increased threats are meant to distract both the West and his own people from his real priority: to advance his blossoming partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin. By raising tensions with Washington and Seoul, Kim can justify his use of North Korea’s money and industry for its weapons business rather than feeding its people, Stimson Center senior fellow Jenny Town told me.
“It creates a nationalist purpose for restarting their military industry and funneling resources back into their military manufacturing,” she said. “You don’t start a war when you are sending vast amounts of munitions and missiles to another country to help them fight a war.”
Ever since the war in Ukraine began, Moscow and Pyongyang have been growing closer. Last September, Kim and Putin met in Russia’s Far East to tour space launch facilities and eat crab dumplings. North Korea’s foreign minister was in Moscow last week. After the meeting, North Korea’s state media said Putin was invited to Pyongyang and called him “the Korean people’s closest friend,” a passive-aggressive dig at Beijing.
“We are no longer dealing with North Korea in isolation,” said Town. “We are now dealing with North Korea in partnership with the Russians.”
Both countries have denied that North Korea is transferring arms to Russia, but the evidence is piling up. In 2022, North Korea began sending more than a million pieces of ammunition to help Russia kill Ukrainians, according to U.S. officials. Lately, Kim has upped his transfers to include advanced weapons.
On Jan. 4, the Biden administration said North Korean ballistic missiles were fired by Russian forces on Ukrainian targets multiple times, calling it a “significant and concerning escalation in the DPRK’s support for Russia.” In a Jan. 10 U.N. Security Council meeting, the South Korean government said Pyongyang was using Ukraine as a “test site” for its illicit missile program.
In return, Russia has protected North Korea from any accountability and in fact seems to be now helping it advance its illicit weapons programs. Russian assistance might explain why North Korea is making so much progress lately on its military satellite and advanced missile systems. More broadly, the growing Russia-North Korea alliance is slowly but surely degrading any U.S. claim that either country is isolated by Western sanctions.
Even worse, every time a North Korean weapon kills a Ukrainian, that’s a sales pitch for Pyongyang’s weapons industry to any aggressor with cash on hand. Considering the long relationship between North Korea and Iran, it is no surprise North Korean weapons are reportedly also being used today by Hamas. With demand around the world skyrocketing, North Korea’s weapons manufacturing business could refill Kim’s coffers.
Amid all this, it’s unfortunate the U.S. government doesn’t seem to have any creative North Korea policy besides finger wagging. The Biden administration has bolstered ties with (and between) Japan and South Korea, but alliance management is hardly sufficient. At the very least, the State Department should appoint a North Korea special representative to replace Ambassador Sung Kim, who retired last month.
What’s clear is that Russia, North Korea, Iran and China are all working together to ramp up their capacity to fight in Ukraine and the Middle East for years to come. Leaders in Washington and Brussels can’t even promise support for Ukraine into next month. Until the West acknowledges how all these conflicts are connected, it will be impossible to craft a comprehensive response."
6J02WRERO0_K2NJG3V1DQBE5PK,"Texas border dispute breeds loose talk of civil war, resistance on right",Aaron Blake,"January 26, 2024 at 5:40 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/texas-border-dispute-breeds-loose-talk-civil-war-resistance-right/,"You don’t need a deep dive into the history books to find an example of how talking cavalierly about violent clashes and resisting the federal government at a contentious time can lead to dark places.
Three years ago, Republican politicians and pro-Trump influencers likened efforts to overturn the 2020 election to 1776 and invoked militaristic rhetoric like “combat.” It turned out a bunch of people took that literally, launching the first large-scale attack on the U.S. Capitol in 200 years.
Despite that relatively recent cautionary tale, some people are offering a similar framing for a tense dispute between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and the Biden administration over the southern border.
Repeatedly in recent days, Republicans and conservative media have alluded to the prospect of the situation forcing soldiers to choose between loyalty to their state and loyalty to their country — even proposing that matters could turn confrontational and violent. Some have invoked another civil war.
The comments have increasingly referenced a situation in which President Biden would try to federalize the National Guard. (A few current and former Democratic members of Congress have called for such a step, after Abbott signaled that the Texas National Guard would continue laying razor wire along the border despite the Supreme Court saying federal authorities can remove it. The White House has shrugged off such calls to federalize the Guard.)
Timeline: An increasingly tense dispute between Texas and the federal government
A Newsmax host on Thursday mentioned Guard members potentially refusing to be federalized — essentially disobeying their commander in chief — and asked, “Does that put us on course for a force-on-force conflict?”
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) didn’t exactly deny the possibility, going so far as to suggest that the Guard would be standing on principles in resisting.
“This is a powder keg worth of tension,” Stitt said. He noted that these are “still Texans” and added, “I think they would be in a difficult situation to protect their homeland or follow what Biden’s saying. I think it would be very interesting.”
Stitt echoed the comments Friday morning on Fox News, saying that Guard members were “trying to obey their boss” but that they disagreed with the administration’s policies and handling of the border.
Steve Doocy to Got. Stitt: ""Have you thought this through? If you send you Oklahoma National Guard down there, and a bunch of other states send them down there, all Biden has to do is federalize all of them ... your National Guard could be working for Joe Biden."" pic.twitter.com/WXBT0XSq6u
Stitt added in another media appearance on Friday that Biden would put Guard members in a “tough situation” by asking them to “obey what they know is a very, very foolish policy.” He said they might have a “hard time” doing it.
Earlier this week, after the Supreme Court ruled against Texas, Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) tweeted that “the feds are staging a civil war, and Texas should stand their ground.”
Fox News and Fox Business hosts have also played up the possibility of a conflict.
Martha MacCallum cited “a confrontation, potentially, between federal agents and the Texas National Guard.” Stuart Varney on Friday said the dispute “could mean a direct clash at the border between federalized troops and the state authorities.” Greg Gutfeld on Thursday cited a possible civil war multiple times, apparently jokingly. “Hypothetically, civil war is coming. It’s coming,” he said. “We have 24 states on Texas’s side, that leaves 26 [on the other]?”
Like Gutfeld, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had some fun with the possibility. He promoted a satirical article titled, “Ted Cruz Grows Out Mutton Chops In Preparation For Civil War,” adding: “Fact check: true.” Cruz responded to a critic of the tweet by saying, “Democrats have ZERO sense of humor.”
Around the same time, Cruz posted a mocked-up flag featuring razor wire over the words, “Come and take it.”
The slogan and the styling of the flag evoked the Gonzales flag. That flag was flown in 1835 at the battle that touched off the Texas Revolution, in which residents rebelled against the government of Mexico.
Come and take it. pic.twitter.com/1VMfEoSoRN
Cruz is an avid troll on X, formerly known as Twitter. And it’s easy to play all the talk off as joking and deride your opponents for being humorless, as he has.
But there are those who take the situation seriously as a challenge to Texas sovereignty. Abbott is taking actions that, while not actually violating the Supreme Court’s order — the order said that the Department of Homeland Security could remove the wire, not that Texas must stop using it — are certainly provocative and invite a power struggle. DHS recently accused Texas of denying U.S. Border Patrol access to a part of the Rio Grande to investigate reports of migrants drowning. (The day after the Border Patrol was denied access, three migrants’ bodies were found — those of a woman and two children.)
Former president Donald Trump on Thursday encouraged other states to send their National Guards to help “protect the Safety, Security, and Sovereignty of Texas.”
While the White House has declined to weigh in on federalizing the Texas National Guard,  it is within the president’s power to do so. It would be an extreme and historic move, but President Dwight D. Eisenhower did it in 1957 when Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus used his state’s Guard to halt school integration.
The prominent conservative voices are essentially pointing to a scenario in which Guard members would either reject such an order or engage in some other kind of standoff with the federal authorities who would remove the razor wire.
This kind of talk is couched as merely gaming out a scenario and warning the Biden administration against inflaming the situation. But the thrust of it — especially in Stitt’s interview — is that the Guard would be standing on principle by resisting. He framed the choice as being between combating fentanyl and “terrorists” on one side, and appeasing “some administration that has a political agenda” on the other.
That’s a pretty stark framing. And if enough people internalize it, you could certainly see how things could get out of hand."
6YVD7PUB4X_XP4HXECRKRVTNMY,"Revenge, dishonesty and irony: Donald Trump distills his politics",Philip Bump,"January 25, 2024 at 10:25 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/trump-haley-donors/,"Truth Social is a weird place.
The social media site started by Donald Trump (or, really, by tech-savvy people working for him) is not formally oriented around Trump, but it is in practice. It is largely populated by Trump fans and allies who use the site to orbit Trump like asteroids circling the sun. Trump uses it differently, injecting rhetoric and framing into the national conversation.
Nearly every one of his posts triggers the same response from the site’s users: a flurry of pro-Trump, anti-Biden memes tacked on to Trump’s missive. It’s feudalistic; when the king emerges from the castle, the serfs compete to offer him their wares in the hopes that — glory be! — he might lackadaisically bless them with a reshare.
All of that, the context for the site, offers insight into how Trump approaches power. But one post in particular, offered up by Trump on Wednesday evening, was even more revealing.
Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip Bump
What grabbed the most attention was Trump’s announcement that he was excommunicating donors to former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley’s campaign from his political circle.
“Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to [Haley], from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp,” he wrote with his idiosyncratic punctuation and capitalization. “We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!”
It wasn’t hard to see this coming. Trump wants to be done with the primaries and understands that Haley, his only remaining opponent, needs financial contributions to press on. So he imposes what costs he can on doing so, a “permanent bar” from “MAGA camp.”
Such promises are often illusory in Trumpworld; Haley herself went from criticizing him forcefully in 2016 to being tapped to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations. It’s also an easy threat to issue when you’re running out the clock in a primary season. When the general election campaign begins and Trump is trying to raise nine figures to defeat President Biden, the apostasy of giving cash to Haley will be easy to forgive.
But step back a bit. This is Trump attempting to impose a penalty on those who defy him, to make democratic expression something for which one can be punished. He could simply wait for Haley’s inevitable concession. Instead, he’s lashing out at the insolence of not falling in line.
If you think he wouldn’t be happy to scale this up, you haven’t been paying attention.
Again, though, that was just part of the social media post.
Haley, he declared at the outset, “is very bad for the Republican Party and, indeed, our Country.”
Why?
Because, the former president wrote, “Her False Statements, Derogatory Comments, and Humiliating Public Loss, is demeaning to True American Patriots.”
If there is one thing Donald Trump will not abide, it is false statements, disparaging people or refusing to accept a humiliating public loss. When one thinks of the things that are least Trump-like, it’s dishonesty, rudeness and a failure to concede elections.
One would be forgiven for marveling at the lack of self-awareness in that phrase or to assume that he is being intentionally ironic. We might also wonder if this is another example of Trump trying to redirect criticism he faced against someone else, either to dilute the criticism or to “what about” it. Either way, it stands out.
In his post, Trump went on to suggest that Haley should be angry not at him but at her consultants. (Unlikely, given that Haley has outperformed every other challenger to the quasi-incumbent Trump.) And then one more insult.
“I knew Nikki well, she was average at best, is not the one to take on World Leaders, and she never did,” Trump wrote. “That was up to me, and that is why they respected the United States.”
We’ve been through this before, too. Someone who worked for Trump and received praise when hired or appointed is transformed, once they defy him, into a bumbling buffoon who relied on Trump to backstop their ineptitude.
Haley was picked to represent the country at the United Nations in November 2016. At the time, Trump’s team put out a statement praising the South Carolina governor.
“Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country,” it read. “She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.”
“You’ve been fantastic,” Trump said when she eventually resigned the post. “You’re my friend. And I just — on behalf of the country, I want to thank you for a great job.”
As hollow a sentiment as his more recent one.
But this is Trump in a nutshell. No permanent friends, only permanent interests: specifically, accruing power for Donald Trump. It’s all familiar — the disparaging of former allies, the threats, the complaints about things he does.
This, not any policy, constitutes Donald Trump’s politics.

6ZFE7W4IJ2_I4ZGS716MZQ6NPV,A reformed criminal wanted ‘one last score.’ He took Dorothy’s ruby slippers.,Praveena Somasundaram,"January 24, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/24/dorothy-ruby-slippers-memo/,"When Terry Jon Martin was asked to pull off a heist in 2005, he said no — at least at first.
A “mob associate” from Martin’s crime-filled past had called him in hopes that he would be up for a theft, which was his “criminal calling card,” according to a new court document. But Martin had not committed a crime in nearly 10 years, living a different life from the one he had been embroiled in for decades, and he declined, the filing said.
But then, the idea of adding “one last score” to his repertoire kept Martin awake at night, his attorney wrote in the memo filed Friday.
He called the associate back and learned about the plan — to nab the slippers Dorothy wore in “The Wizard of Oz.”
On Aug. 27, 2005, Martin broke the Plexiglas display at the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minn., to steal the famous slippers, the memo states. He accidentally left behind a single red sequin, spurring a nearly 18-year-old mystery about who had stolen the shoes and why.
In October 2023, Martin, now 76, pleaded guilty to theft of major artwork in the care of a museum. Dane DeKrey, his defense attorney, unveiled the motive behind the theft in Friday’s memo, in which he appealed for his client to be given a sentence without prison time.
The theft, DeKrey wrote, was a “criminal relapse.”
DeKrey told The Washington Post that the document is meant to give the court a “comprehensive story” ahead of Martin’s sentencing next week.
“His decisions can’t be viewed singularly or in a vacuum,” DeKrey said.
Janie Heitz, the Judy Garland Museum’s executive director, said that although she feels sympathetic to the tough life Martin had faced, the museum “never really bounced back” from the theft.
“Nobody was going to loan their Judy Garland memorabilia to us anymore,” Heitz said. “And so I think there were just a lot of opportunities that we missed out on because of the stealing of the ruby slippers.”
The museum had been open for two years when the slippers, which were on loan, were stolen in 2005.
Dorothy’s ruby slippers vanished 17 years ago. A man has now been charged.
Martin’s criminal record began much earlier than that, though, according to the memo.
When he was 16, he moved to Minneapolis after a challenging childhood home in Hibbing, Minn., according to the memo. At 19, Martin began serving a three-year prison sentence for his first felony offense, the document adds.
He was released on parole but was later ordered back to prison. While there, his partner gave birth to twins.
The woman brought the babies to visit Martin in prison about a month later. But the twins died later that day when the woman’s car was hit by a train, according to the memo. Martin’s partner survived the crash, and they later had another child together, but the death of their twins left him “trapped inside a mind filled with rage and grief,” it stated.
After his release, the memo said, Martin “went off the deep end.”
He served prison time for multiple burglaries, before being sentenced to 15 years after stealing pills from a drugstore with the intent to sell them, according to DeKrey. He served nine years before his release in 1996, when he moved to Grand Rapids to live with his brother.
From there, Martin’s life started to look different — as if he had “finally put his demons to rest,” the memo said.
Then he got the old associate’s call.
If the call hadn’t come, the memo stated, Martin would never have wanted to pull off the crime.
“This of course doesn’t absolve him, but it does show that the slippers came to him,” the document said. “He didn’t go looking for them.”
When Martin agreed to steal the shoes, he had never seen “The Wizard of Oz” and “had no idea” about the slippers’ cultural significance, the memo states. At the time, there were four remaining pairs of the sparkly shoes that Garland wore while playing Dorothy Gale. The shoes had been insured for $1 million, but federal prosecutors said in May 2023 that their appraisal value was $3.5 million.
Martin kept the slippers for less than 48 hours, the memo states. He had planned to sell the red gems, but when he was told they weren’t real rubies, he handed the slippers off to the associate.
Martin never wanted to see the shoes again, he told the associate, according to the memo.
Neither Martin nor authorities saw the slippers for more than a decade.
Federal investigators only found them in 2018, during a sting operation in Minneapolis. But since then, officials have revealed little about how the slippers were recovered or what led them to indict Martin years later in May 2023.
To date, Martin remains the only person charged in the case. He has not identified the associate who recruited him.
About a month after pleading guilty in October, Martin — who is on constant oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — began hospice care, DeKrey said.
In Friday’s memo, DeKrey wrote that Martin is ready to accept his sentence and “move on with what little life he has left.”
“It’s easy to just think of him one-dimensionally as this thief,” DeKrey told The Post. “But as with everything in life, it’s so much deeper and fuller than that.”
A previous version of this article incorrectly said that the Judy Garland Museum was in Michigan. It is in Minnesota. The article has been corrected."
70AXZNP1WE_M4E355HS9K4RP9R,Survey: More than 1 in 5 female undergrads at top schools suffer sexual attacks,Nick Anderson,"September 21, 2015 at 4:10 p.m. EDT",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/survey-more-than-1-in-5-female-undergrads-at-top-schools-suffer-sexual-attacks/2015/09/19/c6c80be2-5e29-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html,"More than 20 percent of female undergraduates at an array of prominent universities said this year that they were victims of sexual assault and misconduct, echoing findings elsewhere, according to one of the largest studies ever of college sexual violence.
The survey from the Association of American Universities drew responses from 150,000 students at 27 schools, including most of the Ivy League. Armed with extensive data on the scope of the problem at their own campuses, leaders of big-name universities said they are mobilizing to confront sexual assault as never before.
Yale University President Peter Salovey said he found “extremely disturbing” results indicating more than one-quarter of undergraduate women at the elite school in New Haven, Conn., were victims of sexual assault and misconduct.
“The prevalence of such behavior runs counter to our most fundamental values,” Salovey said. “It threatens individual students, our learning environment and our sense of community.” Other university leaders, speaking virtually in unison, said the results sounded an alarm that must be answered.
Researchers acknowledged the possibility of an overstated victimization rate because there was evidence that hundreds of thousands of students who ignored the electronic questionnaire were less likely to have suffered an assault.
Read the full AAU report on sexual assault and sexual misconduct
But the results add to growing indications that sexual assault is disturbingly commonplace on college campuses, especially among undergraduates living on their own for the first time. Although colleges already are on high alert about the problem — in part because of a White House task force formed last year to combat it — the survey findings underscore the seriousness and breadth of sexual assault’s effects and how difficult it will be to curb them.
See data from individual schools and their responses to the results
The AAU survey provides a wealth of insights about the prevalence of specific types of assault at a cross-section of public and private research universities. Among them was the stark finding that 11 percent of female undergraduates said they had experienced incidents of penetration or attempted penetration, half of them saying it happened by force. These incidents would fit the definition of rape or sodomy.
Others said they were victims of unwanted touching or kissing that could be defined as sexual battery.
“The leaders of our universities are deeply concerned about the impact of these issues on their students,” Hunter R. Rawlings III, the AAU’s president, said. “Their participation in this and other climate surveys is an important part of their efforts to combat sexual assault.”
The AAU’s findings are roughly consistent with a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation national poll, published in June, that found that 1 in 5 young women who attended a residential college during a four-year span said they were sexually assaulted.
Read more about the Post-Kaiser poll, about conflicts over consent and about survivors telling their own stories.
Other recent studies also have found similarly high victimization rates. But some Justice Department crime data show that women in college are less likely to be victims of rape or sexual assault than those who are not students.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan told The Post last week that the number of students who experience sexual assault is “unacceptably high” and that it has been for decades. Duncan said the nation must confront the widespread prevalence of sexual assault in college.
“It is shockingly bad, but it is the truth,” Duncan said. “We can either hide from that reality or not.”
KC Johnson, a Brooklyn College history professor who tracks college sexual assault and due-process issues, said he is skeptical of the findings.
“If you take this data literally, it would suggest a violent crime rate at most campuses higher than in any city in the country,” he said. “Which I think is somewhat dubious.”
Johnson said he was puzzled by survey results that showed many victims of forced, non-consensual penetration didn’t consider the incident serious enough to report to authorities. “We’re talking about college students at elite institutions,” he said. “They understand what sexual assault is.”
Participants in the AAU survey included a range of public and private schools, and the share of undergraduate women who said they had been sexually assaulted during their time on campus varied: It was 19 percent at the University of Texas at Austin, 24 percent at the University of Virginia, 26 percent at Harvard University, 28 percent at Yale and 30 percent at the University of Michigan.
“These deeply disturbing survey results must spur us to an even more intent focus on the problem of sexual assault,” Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust said in a letter to the university community. “That means not just how we talk to one another about it, not just what we say in official pronouncements, but how we actually treat one another and live our lives together.”
“One sexual assault is too many,” said University of Texas at Austin President Gregory L. Fenves. “It is essential that we foster a campus that does not tolerate sexual assaults while strongly encouraging victims to come forward and report incidents.”
Other participants were Dartmouth College (the only non-AAU member); the California Institute of Technology; Brown, Case Western Reserve, Columbia, Cornell, Iowa State, Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue and Texas A&M universities; Washington University in St. Louis; and the universities of Arizona, Florida, Minnesota-Twin Cities, Missouri at Columbia, North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Southern California and Wisconsin at Madison.
The only Ivy League school that did not participate was Princeton University.
The survey, conducted by the social science firm Westat, asked about individual experiences with sexual assault as well as perceptions on campus about the issue. Nearly all students at the 27 schools were canvassed in April and May, with confidentiality guaranteed. Nineteen percent responded, a lower rate than the survey team had hoped to attain.
Among the key findings:
●Victimization rates varied widely from school to school. The share of undergraduate women who said they suffered sexual assault and misconduct ranged from 13 percent to 30 percent among the 27 schools. Overall it was 23 percent.Those at private universities were slightly more likely to be victims than those at public universities.
●Five percent of undergraduate men said they experienced sexual assault and misconduct, echoing a finding from the Post-Kaiser poll.
●Of students who said they were victims of physically forced penetration, or attempted penetration, about 25 percent said they told university authorities or law enforcement. Of those who said they were victims of physically forced sexual touching or kissing, 7 percent reported the incident. The dominant reason for why students who didn’t tell authorities: They said it wasn’t serious enough. “That will stimulate a lot of discussion,” said Bonnie Fisher, a professor at the University of Cincinnati and a Westat consultant. “We as researchers don’t know a lot about this — it hasn’t been measured in the past.”
●Sixty-three percent of all students said they believe a report of sexual assault or sexual misconduct would be taken seriously by campus officials. Fifty-six percent said it was very likely or extremely likely that the safety of those reporting sexual assault and misconduct would be protected by university officials.
David Cantor, vice president of Westat, said the survey is one of the first of its kind to enable comparisons across institutions. He also said it is notable that the survey distinguishes between different types of attacks (penetration versus touching and kissing) and different situations (force versus incapacitation).
“Providing this level of detail is fairly unique among the campus climate surveys,” he said. That was done “mostly by the request of the universities, to try to differentiate between incidents clearly quite different in nature.”
The survey also is one of the first to gauge incidents in the context of the standard known as “affirmative consent,” which calls for both people in a sexual encounter to communicate their active and ongoing agreement. California last year became the first state to enact a law requiring universities to include affirmative consent in student-conduct policies. Many schools nationwide have moved in that direction.
The survey found that 11 percent of undergraduate women experienced penetration or oral sex without their “active, ongoing voluntary agreement.” This rate ranged from 5 percent to 21 percent among the 27 schools.

And now Steele was writing to say that it was time, at 61, to stop hiding and begin living as a woman. Steele would be using she/her pronouns but hadn’t yet settled on a name, and was hoping for understanding from family and friends on what would surely be a slow and awkward and terrifying and joyous journey.
“Instead of an a------, I’ll be a b----,” Steele wrote, in the letter that Ferrell reads aloud, chuckling, in the new documentary “Will & Harper” — which premiered Monday at the Sundance Film Festival to multiple, explosive standing ovations. If rumors are true, Apple TV Plus has been circling and could make it the biggest documentary sale in Sundance history, even bigger than “Boys State,” which sold to Apple and A24 in 2020 for a record $12 million.
Steele has always loved a road trip, showing up to small towns in the middle of nowhere America, and it was Ferrell’s idea that they embark on one together, on film. It would give the comedian a chance to reacquaint himself with his friend of 30 years and to ask all the impertinent questions he wanted to ask, such as what made her transition, and does she still like terrible beer? (Old Milwaukee is Harper’s champagne of brews.) And it was also a way to provide support for Harper as she reentered places she once loved to go, like dive bars and Midwest dirt-racing tracks, in a new body, with excitement and insecurity about how she had be seen, and a deep sadness for how long she had taken to come out, and concern for her physical safety in parts of the country where she never had to think about such things before. “I know I love America,” Steele says in the documentary. “I don’t know if it loves me.”
What follows is a movie that’s so sweet and funny, so generous and gentle about explaining trans-ness to older generations, that it feels like it should be shown in schools and toured around the country as a vital, lifesaving tool.
When the two friends first met, no one on SNL quite knew what to do with Ferrell’s weird energy. “They thought Will Ferrell was a dud,” Steele says in the film. But the two of them had an immediate kinship. In the film, they meet up with their SNL family along the way, such as Tina Fey, Seth Meyers, Tim Meadows, Will Forte and Molly Shannon. Calling up Kristen Wiig to check in on the theme song they asked her to write for them becomes a running gag. (“Harper and Will go West / Just a couple old friends and a couple of brand new breasts …”)
In between the many jokes and bits, though, are poignant moments in which Steele opens up about the shame and the pain she’s been feeling for so many years, and the many other road trips she took across the country while wearing a dress in her car, only to have to change back into men’s clothes whenever she stopped for gas or the bathroom, out of fear of being found out. Ferrell is comic relief and a catalyst for conversation, but a lot of times he’s just listening and trying to understand. “I felt like we were going to be a part of this and treat it with integrity, and that I owed it to Harper to be open and emotionally available to whatever was going to happen,” he said in the Q&A.
But that doesn’t stop him from making plenty of crass jokes (that Steele finds very funny), such as, “Do you think you’re a worse driver now that you’re a female driver?” or “Did you go to Nordstrom Rack more when you got your new rack?”
And somehow within all this is a heartening portrait of America. There are bad moments, such as when they unknowingly take a picture with a politician who had just signed an anti-trans bill, or a time when Ferrell’s celebrity and instinct to be a ham puts Steele dangerously on display (Ferrell cries in the car the next day, feeling like he’s failed his friend). But there are also many more moments that give you hope in humanity, like when Steele makes a trepidatious first solo trip into a dive bar in Oklahoma with a “F--- Biden” sign on the wall and gets welcomed by a tableful of new friends.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
During filming, director Josh Greenbaum said, they had decided to just let the two friends riff off one another; the only real plan was when Steele mapped out the places they would go. They wound up with 215 hours of footage, but gags such as Ferrell eating from “puddle bunny,” a chocolate bunny that melted on their dash, only made the end credits.
What did make it into the film was a moment when Steele gets into a hotel pool in a bathing suit, and Ferrell, as a show of support, breaks out a Speedo from his extensive collection to support her. “I thought, ‘Well, Harper’s taking a big risk of swimming in a bikini here for the first time,’” Ferrell said. “But when I watched it on film, I took a bigger risk. She looks elegant and sporty, and I look like an endangered sea mammal.”
At the forefront of their minds, though, was always the kind of impact a film like this could have. It took Steele two to three months to say yes, but she felt galvanized watching anti-trans bills get passed all over the country. “It is still quite awful. It’s ramping up. And I have this friend who has made movies that appeal very broadly to a lot of people. That was the deciding factor, like, ‘Oh, I can abuse this relationship for the good!’” Steele said, laughing."
780ACG9AI2_R8T35ONIMQMCLGA,Building Museum exhibit brings the world of children’s books to life,Fritz Hahn,"January 25, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/25/building-museum-childrens-books-exhibit/,"Think back to your favorite books of childhood — the ones you checked out of the library again and again, or the ones you begged a parent to read to you again and again. Or, parents, take a look at the books strewn across your living room and piled on your child’s nightstand. Which of them, do you think, teach readers how to interact with the built environment of a city, or about the basics of architecture and homes?
Probably more than you realize.
This week, the National Building Museum unveiled a semi-permanent exhibit called “Building Stories,” which the museum describes as “an immersive exploration of the world of architecture, engineering, construction and design found in the pages of children’s books.” It’s expected to stay open for 10 years.
Good thing, because “Building Stories” is the rare example of an exhibit that will equally enchant children and their book-loving grown-ups.
There are some obvious inclusions among the books celebrated by the exhibit: One is Virginia Lee Burton’s “Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel,” which the museum’s Cathy Frankel called a “catalyst” for the exhibition during a preview for the media. “Harold and the Purple Crayon” is another, given how the title character creates and manipulates a world of his own. “The Noisy Book” by Margaret Wise Brown is the story of a dog exploring a city based on sounds. (We’ll get to that more famous tome of hers in a moment.) Richard Scarry’s vibrant “What Do People Do All Day?” and the winter landscapes of Ezra Jack Keats’s “The Snowy Day” belong.
Nadja Spiegelman’s 2015 graphic novel “Lost in NYC: A Subway Adventure” is much more recent than these older works, but it deserves a spotlight for the way it depicts movement vertically through the levels of New York, from the street to the subway platform, as well as on maps.
In all, the exhibit’s four galleries contain 150 books representing 28 countries, according to Aileen Fuchs, the president and executive director of the museum. There are even more selections available on open shelves, courtesy of the D.C. Public Library, meant to be read in cozy reading nooks throughout the exhibit.
The path through the four rooms starts with the foundations — the alphabet, alphabet blocks and pop-up books — and its theme is laid bare in a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson, which dates to the Victorian era but will be evocative of any child with a Lego set: “What are you able to build with your blocks? / Castles and palaces, temples and docks. / Rain may keep raining, and others go roam, / But I can be happy and building at home.”
One wall features a display of 26 alphabet books from countries including Japan, Switzerland and the Canadian First Nations. D.C. receives a nice shout-out, thanks to “The Alphabet From the Sky,” a 2016 picture book in which RFK Stadium stands in for the letter O.
From there, each room introduces different concepts: the definition of home, as both a structure and an idea; how “scale play” with toys or dollhouses makes children more aware of buildings and environments; and, finally, how books connect children to the world writ large. The last room is especially engaging for younger visitors: Large soft blocks, resembling stylized letters, are the perfect size for constructing columns and forts and furniture. (They have words and images from illustrator Oliver Jeffers’s books printed on them, but the kids visiting last weekend seemed more interested in constructing walls than sentences.)
The exhibit might even change the way you think about classic children’s books. Brown’s “Goodnight Moon” is represented in multiple rooms, including a mock-up of the book in the first room and a work-in-progress process print in the second, alongside a copy of the finished product. Visitors might find themselves considering whether the secret of this beloved picture book is not just in the comforting repetition of saying good night to bears and chairs and kittens and mittens, but also in the environment of the great green room itself, with its fire and rugs and paintings shown from multiple angles, making children feel cozy and safe.
“It hit me in a way it never did before that home is the key theme in children’s literature,” said Leonard Marcus, the exhibit’s visiting curator. “‘Goodnight Moon’ is about having one place that is really their own,” with clothing, food, shelter and, importantly, a place where a child can dream. The concept of home, and what that looks like, pops up in “Where the Wild Things Are,” “The Wizard of Oz” and more modern books, like Tonya Lippert’s “Home,” a realistic look at children affected by homelessness.
Best museums for kids in Washington, D.C.
An entire section is dedicated to David Macaulay’s “Rome Antics,” a 1997 picture book depicting buildings of Rome as seen by a homing pigeon taking the scenic route through the city. The display shows how the book was literally built, from original concepts through jettisoned characters, with sketches and outlines, and a genius last-minute addition. In a way, it proves to be the perfect metaphor for the exhibition.
Older visitors are sent down memory lane by the maps of Hogwarts, the Hundred Acre Wood and Bilbo Baggins’s journey in “The Hobbit” displayed in glass cases, but there’s plenty for younger ones to actually do: There are models to touch, viewfinders and a “shrink ray” machine to look through, drawers at child height to be opened and rifled through. A theater-in-the-round uses projected images and readings to showcase selected books, including “The Snowy Day” and Faith Ringgold’s “Tar Beach.” Along one wall, viewers turn a knob to travel between the homes depicted in Giles Laroche’s “If You Lived Here: Houses of the World,” moving from cut paper collages of Southwestern pueblos to stilt houses in Chile to whitewashed Greek villages, skipping across a map reminiscent of those used in the Indiana Jones movies.
Visitors receive a sketchbook that acts like a passport — there are stamps to be collected — but is also an interactive guide. They’re told to use a die-cut circle in the middle of one page to focus and zoom in and out on objects, while kids are encouraged to draw a future city with their souvenir pencil, and talk about what they like and don’t like about the urban environment.
But the fact that this is an exhibition focused on children’s literature doesn’t mean it’s solely for children. Frankel, the deputy director for interpretive content, says the exhibit was designed to appeal to readers of all ages. “We’re straddling a fine line here,” she says, “wanting to attract an adult audience as well as a family audience, and recognizing that some of it is for a kid audience, and some is for others.”
Take, for instance, this excerpt from the panel explaining the genius of Lippert’s “Home”: “It makes understandable, for children and adults alike, the insecurities and fears that young people are bound to feel when confronted with the realities of living in a shelter or other makeshift temporary quarters. Lippert models effective coping strategies and an empathetic response to a society-wide issue that, she urges, ought to be everyone’s concern.”
That’s not meant for a 4-year-old who’d rather turn knobs or pull open drawers or scurry into a child-size mouse hole in the wall. To be fair, they might not even notice: The images from Lippert’s book are displayed higher than the average elementary-schooler’s head.
Frankel says the multi-age approach is also what makes the exhibit attractive for repeat viewing: “Our intent is that people come back over and over again, so we don’t expect people to take in the entire thing [in one visit]. It works as a whole, but each section works individually as well.” Children who view the exhibit at 5 years old, when they’re more interested in the interactive elements or building with the fabric blocks, will be attracted to different items and more complex content when they’re 8 or 13.
To encourage that sort of continued interaction with young readers, the Building Museum has launched the Building Readers Club, for children from kindergarten through eighth grade. The program includes free access to the exhibition and “club activities” at the museum four days per year, a monthly newsletter sent to parents with book suggestions and activities, and early access to “Building Stories” events. (Sign-up is available through nbm.org/building-readers-club.)
In the midst of our ever-changing landscape, it’s reassuring to know that Officer Michael still brings busy city traffic to a standstill for a family of ducklings, and that Peter will always wake up to the wonder of a fresh blanket of snow. And that for the next decade in D.C., children of all ages will be able to delve into the stories behind these beloved books.
“Building Stories” is open Thursday through Monday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the National Building Museum, 401 F St. NW. nbm.org. Admission is $10 for adults and $7 for youth (ages 3 to 17), seniors (age 60 and older) and students with ID."
7AZWSFNDCB_NKV6LK1BA8237V2,Haley’s calls for ‘consensus’ on abortion draw mixed interpretations,Dylan Wells,"January 23, 2024 at 12:54 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/haley-abortion-new-hampshire/,"EPPING, N.H. — After Nikki Haley recently fielded questions from reporters at a seafood restaurant here, she stopped to greet a diner who wanted to talk about the Republican candidate’s call for “consensus” on abortion at the federal level.
“There is no consensus on that; that’s the problem,” the woman told Haley.
“No, but that’s why we’ve got to quit demonizing that issue,” Haley then said, identifying areas she said are suitable for compromise such as access to contraception, banning late-term abortions, and ensuring that women who have abortions do not face jail time or the death penalty.
The woman again pushed back, asking about what is happening in Texas — where a federal appeals court recently ruled that Texas hospitals and doctors are not obligated to perform abortions — and her concern that doctors could go to jail for performing the procedure.
“We can’t do anything without 60 Senate votes,” Haley said, referring to the support needed to overcome any filibuster of abortion legislation. “We’re going to have to have a compromise to make anything happen,” she added before turning and exiting the restaurant.
In her long-shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, which is meeting a critical juncture here Tuesday in the first-in-the-nation primary, Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor, has stuck carefully to a position of compromise and few specifics when it comes to one of the country’s most polarizing issues.
Her vague stances have drawn mixed reviews and sometimes conflicting interpretations from voters and activists in the state. Some, including abortion rights advocates, have lauded and embraced her views. Others have challenged them or voiced confusion about where she stands.
Some here said they see her as a “pro-choice” candidate, others as one who is “pro-life.” Many agree that she seems more reasonable and less extreme than her rivals. Haley allies hope her posture will help her against-the-odds bid in a state where many Republicans favor abortion rights.
Democrats have found success in recent elections running as protectors of abortion rights and pointing to Republicans’ efforts to restrict access to the procedure. This week, which marked the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling, they pointed to Donald Trump’s nominations of Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the decision.
In a Republican Party that has struggled to navigate the politics of abortion since Roe — which had established the constitutional right to an abortion — was struck down in 2022, Haley is offering what some Republicans see as a blueprint for talking about the issue in the future. By avoiding specifics and instead highlighting her personal life experiences and repeatedly urging “consensus,” Haley has managed to appeal to voters on both sides of the issue.
Rachel Rowley, a sophomore at the University of New Hampshire, said she leans Democratic and supports abortion rights. She said she thinks Haley is personally antiabortion but favors abortion rights for others.
“She has great ideas, especially about abortion. That was a big one for me,” Rowley, 20, said while waiting for Haley to speak at a town hall in Rye, N.H., earlier this month. “She’s really focusing on areas that both political parties can knuckle down on and fix to make for a better America, and I think that’s such a different forward movement than any other politicians that we’ve seen in the past.”
Haley is in fact staunchly antiabortion. “I’m unapologetically pro-life,” she said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” adding, “I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice.” She reiterated that she would support a federal restriction on abortion but thinks reaching agreement on one would be nearly impossible.
“I’ve said I’m fine with a federal law. But the thing is, in order to get a federal law, you have to have a majority of the House, 60 senators and a signature of the president,” she said in the interview, adding, “No Republican president can ban abortions, any more than a Democrat president can ban any state law. What we can do is let’s find consensus.”
Maggie Keenan, a classmate of Rowley’s and a self-described independent who is more aligned with Democratic views, said at a Haley event that, while she is very against restrictions on abortion, she thinks Haley is willing to negotiate and does not worry about Haley imposing federal restrictions.
“She said she wants it to be a states’ rights issue. And obviously I would want it more of to be pro-choice at a federal level. But I like that … she’s not going to make it outlawed on a federal level,” said Keenan, 21. “That’s better than, like, getting rid of it.”
On the campaign trail here in New Hampshire, abortion is not part of Haley’s stump speech — she speaks about it only when asked by attendees. No abortion-related ads have aired in the New Hampshire primary, according to AdImpact.
While Haley continues to emphasize that there is a federal role to be played in abortion law, she has avoided many of the details at the center of contentious disagreements on abortion, including the specific number of weeks of pregnancy at which she would want to see abortion banned. Instead, she has focused on how her life and career informed her thinking and on the need to find common ground.
She’s invoked personal experiences as a mother who struggled to have children, as the wife of an adoptee and as a friend of a woman who was raped. She has spoken in broad terms about trying to “save as many babies as possible and support as many moms as possible.”
Some Democratic critics say that rhetoric masks a staunchly antiabortion record. As governor of South Carolina, Haley signed a bill in 2016 banning most abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill did not provide exceptions for rape or incest but did allow an exception to protect the life of the mother.
In the presidential race, some of Haley’s campaign literature promotes her as “Pro Life. Pro Gun. Pro Police.”
In April, she delivered a major policy speech on abortion at the headquarters of the antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. And in the days ahead of the Iowa caucuses, her campaign released an ad starring Marlys Popma, the former president of Iowa Right to Life who endorsed Haley in November.
But in interviews, many Democratic and independent voters at Haley’s events said they were willing to look past any concerns they have about Haley’s record or the possibility of a GOP president passing a federal ban — in large part because of the fact that Haley has spoken in more personal and cooperative terms than other Republicans.
That concerns some Democratic strategists, who fear that if she does beat the odds and become the GOP nominee, it would be more difficult to run on an issue they want to make central to their pitch.
Some antiabortion voters also cite Haley’s position on abortion as their reason for backing her. Marguerite Cail, a Republican who attended a Haley meet-and-greet in Londonderry, N.H., credited Haley’s stance on abortion as the reason she supports her — interpreting her position differently than voters like Rowley and Keenan.
“Coming from a very strong pro-life stance, I feel the same way she does,” said Cail, 50. “I think she’s reasonable about it. … It’s a sad thing if it happens, but it’s not that you want to put people in jail for doing it; it’s just something that you’d like to avoid.”
But others are more skeptical. Jason Hennessey, president of New Hampshire Right to Life, said he wasn’t sure where Haley stands on abortion. He declined to say which candidate he planned to vote for Tuesday.
“When I look at the records, I see Trump with his Supreme Court justices … moving the ball forward and not using our tax dollars to support the abortion industry,” said Hennessey, speaking for himself and not his organization. He added, “I guess I don’t know a lot about what Nikki has done.”

7CXCE0FSE9_XUJY4O0QKLKSGB4,What Biden’s latest actions on reproductive health mean,Sabrina Malhi,"January 25, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/01/25/contraception-emergency-abortion-access-biden/,"The Biden administration this week announced measures intended to boost access to contraception and emergency abortions, moves that represent Democrats’ latest effort to focus on reproductive health ahead of the 2024 elections.
The administration has scrambled to find ways to ensure abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned. About two dozen states ban or restrict abortion, and some hospitals and their staff have balked at efforts to provide emergency abortions. President Biden has insisted that federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency abortions, and the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue later this year.
Some patients and providers say they continue to encounter barriers to care since the Supreme Court’s decision in June 2022 to strike down Roe and overturn the constitutional right to abortion. Here’s what the administration’s steps would mean for consumers.
Most employer and individual health plans must cover contraceptives approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration without asking patients to pay out-of-pocket costs. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra sent a letter to health insurers reminding them to provide contraceptives at no cost.
Health plans and providers have also continued to complicate patients’ efforts to obtain no-cost contraceptives, the administration said. Federal officials this week cited an October 2022 report by House Democrats that analyzed barriers to contraception, finding at least 34 birth control products that required patients to spend out of pocket.
Some of those products were newer and offered clinical advantages, such as a vaginal ring that lasted for a year rather than a month like other products, or a progestin-only birth control pill that patients could take at different times throughout a day, rather than the same time every day.
The Department of Health and Human Services provided hypothetical examples of ways in which insurers could deny or complicate access to certain medications, including age restrictions, imposing burdensome requirements and requiring patients to pay out of pocket for certain services.
Federal officials announced they would launch a campaign to highlight existing protections for emergency abortions. This includes urging patients and health-care workers to report cases in which emergency abortions have been denied.
The Biden administration maintains that federal law requires hospitals to perform emergency abortions, including in states with bans or restrictions on the procedure, although Republicans and some federal courts have disagreed.
Health officials said they were creating a dedicated team to work with health-care providers to ensure compliance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law known as EMTALA that was passed nearly 40 years ago and requires that hospitals perform health-stabilizing treatment for all patients, even if that treatment is an abortion.
Abortion rights advocates have urged the Biden administration to more aggressively announce and enforce when hospitals and physicians violate EMTALA. Advocates argue that federal officials are doing too little in response to state abortion bans. They have cited the recent case of an Oklahoma woman who was told to wait in the parking lot until she became sick enough to qualify for an abortion under the state’s near-total ban, despite a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication. Federal officials rejected the woman’s EMTALA complaint and said the hospital did nothing wrong.
The administration has faced challenges implementing its strategy, given the oft-circuitous nature of EMTALA enforcement. There is a months-long process of determining whether a violation occurred, which involves investigations conducted by state health agencies in the antiabortion states where the events took place. Officials have said there are numerous opportunities for the process to break down, such as state workers who are confused by whether an incident constitutes an EMTALA violation — or are simply not inclined to aggressively pursue the complaint, The Washington Post previously reported.
Biden and his allies are eager to make abortion a defining debate in the 2024 election cycle, with this week’s announcements part of Democrats’ broader political push to focus on the issue.
About 3 in 5 voters — including 1 in 5 Republicans — say they trust Democratic politicians more than GOP leaders to handle abortion, according to polling conducted by KFF, a health policy research organization. The issue contributed to recent Republican defeats in Kansas, Ohio and other states that have favored GOP politicians.
Former president Donald Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, has said that Republicans should consider moderating their focus on abortion bans. “You have to win elections,” he said at a Fox News town hall in January.
Seeking to defuse the potency of the issue, Republican politicians have homed in on Biden’s personal views, noting that he is a practicing Catholic who raised doubts about abortion earlier in his career, and have argued that Democrats’ approach to abortion is too permissive."
7GG8ZSY2MQ_AM5CQ7YCS3TIXBF,West African bowls warm the soul at Hedzole in 16th Street Heights,Gabe Hiatt,"January 23, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/01/23/hedzole-review-jollof-rice-casual-dining/,"The jollof rice at Hedzole is so spellbinding, you may briefly experience a loss of speech.
During my first trip to the fast-casual counter in 16th Street Heights, I was completely engrossed in owner Candice Mensah’s version of the West African staple. The red rice is one of the building blocks for her Ghanaian American bowls, but it’s no bit player. Every individual grain is infused with the flavor of onion, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, curry and ginger. Every bite carries a hint of nutmeg and — if you ordered the oxtail — a sinus-opening punch of clove.
I had been chatty while placing my order with Mensah. But after peeling the lid off my disposable bowl, I went quiet. I was the only one in the restaurant that afternoon, so when Mensah asked how I was doing, I reassured her with genuine enthusiasm.
“I’m going in!” I said, popping my head up for just long enough to deliver the message before happily sucking the marrow out of a piece of oxtail as Mensah laughed from the open kitchen.
Two of the most comforting meals I’ve enjoyed this winter came at the narrow black tables in the space Mensah opened in April 2023, a step up from the pop-ups and farmers market stalls she’s been running for about four years. I’m not deeply familiar with West African food. My only sentimental attachment comes with recency bias. But at times that I felt myself flagging, after long bike rides up 14th Street NW in rain and the winter wind, Mensah’s cooking was a bone-warming, life-affirming pick-me-up.
Mensah, 45, will tell you she’s not trying to serve dishes the same way you’d find them in Accra, the home of both her parents before they moved to the United States and had her. She’s scaled back the spice level in some dishes, preemptively removing reservations from any clientele with preconceived notions about West African food. But making it too tame wouldn’t feel true to herself or her family’s culture, particularly with Hedzole’s jollof rice, groundnut soup or red red, a lively black-eyed pea stew.
“I can’t make it not spicy because that’s part of the enjoyment. … And I think with West African cuisine, it’s like salt to us,” she said.
The menu at Hedzole is a reflection of three main influences: Mensah’s mother’s home cooking, the American customer and the African diaspora. The tagline for Hedzole says “Pan-African soul.” Mensah stews oxtail, not traditionally a protein paired with jollof rice, as a nod to Jamaican carryouts; the Caribbean nation and Ghana have a deep cultural connection. Mensah avoids seasoning with allspice so she can serve a clove-packed version all her own. She’ll playfully take a dig at Nigerian jollof for using Maggi bouillon, a Swiss product, but she’s not drawing hard lines, either.
“People make claims about who has the best jollof rice, you know, is it Nigeria or is it Ghana?” Mensah said. “And honestly, we didn’t create any of those borders. And we’re all very interconnected.”
Perspective: I explored D.C. for the ultimate comfort food: Jollof rice
Each bowl at Hedzole starts out vegan with a choice of rice: jollof, coconut or a waakye (a mixture of beans and rice, which is tinted charcoal from the inclusion of black-eyed peas). Customers can then add a vegetable (kale or vinegar-dressed cabbage) and a sauce: tomato gravy; jerk barbecue; or spinach and agushie (ground melon seed) stew with shito, a thick Ghanaian hot sauce that Mensah’s mother, Constance Baddoo Mensah, prepares with habaneros and Thai chiles. If you want a protein, you can add stewed oxtails, stewed chicken or baked salmon.
My first visit brought the jollof and oxtails, served in a rich dark gravy with fried plantains and side of vinegar-dressed cabbage. I found more plantains in a cup of red red, adding sweet contrast to the spicy black-eyed peas cooked with tomato, palm oil and habanero pepper. Sobolo, a hibiscus-based drink, caught my eye with its purplish red color. I wasn’t prepared for the wallop of ginger and clove, but I kept sipping.
When I came back with a friend, we tried the groundnut soup. Peanut butter barely thickens the tomato broth to a latte-like consistency. I found myself picking up the pace with my spoon as my lips tingled. Part of the experience is also pulling bites of a ball of fufu that Mensah instructed me to let dissolve in my mouth. I savored the “swallow,” as the class of dumpling is called, allowing the cassava and plantain mash to dissolve in my throat with zero discomfort.
Born in D.C. and raised in Alexandria, Mensah loved watching PBS cooking shows with her mother. She wouldn’t describe her African parents as particularly strict, and she felt freedom in the kitchen that has carried over into her adult life.
Mensah, who previously worked in client relations in the health care IT sector, said she’d been talking about a move into a hospitality career for at least 10 years. She got serious about it in 2017, soliciting feedback on her recipes from family and friends. In 2022, after two years of farmers markets and festivals and a residency at the Urbanspace food hall in Tysons Galleria, she quit her job and went all in on Hedzole.
“It just got to a point where I didn’t care how great the salary was or what type of salary I could command,” she said. “It wasn’t fulfilling anymore.”
When her food business was just in the dream stage, Mensah said, she didn’t think she’d be the one cooking. Over time, she realized “I have to do it, because I don’t see anyone doing it the way I wanted to be doing it.”
She also thought she’d have to fuse more American soul food into the equation. More recently, she felt customers were ready to embrace African influences; the public’s tolerance for spice had grown. West African food has been labeled the next trend by media for years, and fast-casual innovations like ChopnBlok in Houston or Spice Kitchen in Brentwood, Md., have only accelerated that notion.
For Mensah, this way of cooking isn’t a trend; it’s her life. Her father just marked his 51st year of living in the United States. She said it’s important to recognize these cultures have been around “forever,” even if a growing appreciation for African art and music is now helping direct the spotlight toward food. Where her father’s generation may have felt a need to dress down and assimilate, she’s sensed a freeing shift.
“Even growing up, I always felt like I was African at home and Black outside,” Mensah said. “And now as an adult, I embrace all of those things. I’m all of those things all of the time.”

7GV9KSP0GD_XYGL9X1ZUU8UTU5,Trans candidates face challenges to get on Ohio ballots over ‘deadnames’,Anumita Kaur,"January 22, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/22/ohio-trans-candidates/,"Vanessa Joy completed the paperwork to run for a seat in Ohio’s state legislature using the legal name she’s held since 2022.
When she returned to the Stark County Board of Elections office in December, she recalled the thrill of presenting the slate of signatures from those supporting her candidacy. But that excitement turned to dismay this month when she was told she was disqualified from running after leaving the name she used before her transition — known as a deadname — off her election forms.
“I thought I was doing everything right. I should have been on the ballot if not for this law,” Joy told The Washington Post. “The law is so obscure and unknown in Ohio, it appears the boards of elections for other candidates didn’t even know that it exists.”
Joy is one of three transgender women whose candidacies for Ohio House seats have been challenged under a little-known state law that requires disclosure of previous legal names on election documents. While the law isn’t new, some advocates fear it’s being used to hinder transgender candidates, and regardless of intent, it has ensnared several such contenders this election cycle in Ohio, raising concerns that trans candidates elsewhere might face similar hurdles when running for public office.
Days after Joy’s disqualification, two more transgender women running for state office were told that their forms were also under review.
“Ultimately, what it is, is trying to ensure that transgender people don’t get into office,” said Shelby Chestnut, executive director of Transgender Law Center. “It’s using existing laws in an effort to try and limit, and call attention to, transgender candidates to keep them from running.”
Ohio statute requires that anyone running for state office list all legal name changes from the last five years on candidacy documents. But Joy, Arienne Childrey and Bobbie Arnold told The Post they were never informed of the requirement. (A fourth transgender candidate is running for an Ohio state Senate seat, but he has not had a legal name change and listed his deadname on his documents).
Joy, Childrey and Arnold said they would have listed their previous names if they had known of the law. The candidate forms don’t instruct applicants to list previous names, and the statute is not listed in the state’s 33-page candidate guide. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican who oversees the state’s elections, said through a spokesperson that the name requirement could be added to the guide in the future, but stands by the application of the rule this year.
Multiple experts, including Chestnut, told The Post that they could not recall a case in which the law had hindered previous candidacies. It’s not immediately clear what prompted Joy’s candidacy paperwork to be reviewed, but after her case arose, Arnold and Childrey were informed that their respective counties would review their candidacies as well. The outcomes in each case have been decided by the candidates’ local election boards, leaving a patchwork of results: Joy remains disqualified, and Arnold and Childrey remain on the ballots.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) is calling for a change to the policy, telling Cleveland.com last week that transgender candidates shouldn’t be kept off ballots for omitting their previous names on elections materials. The Ohio Secretary of State’s office said in a statement to The Post that, while there are no immediate moves to change the law, officials will examine ways to make the requirement clearer to candidates.
“The Secretary feels it’s important for people to disclose who they are and any former identities, so the voters know who is asking to be put on the ballot,” said Melanie Amato, a spokeswoman for the office.
All three candidates are Democrats; Joy was running in Ohio’s 50th district; Childrey is running in the 84th district and Arnold is running in the 40th.
The Stark County Board of Elections informed Joy on Jan. 2 that she would not be certified to run for office, citing the omission of her previous name on the forms.
She appealed the board’s decision on Jan. 5, arguing that she was not aware of the law and did not intend to mislead the public. The board rejected her appeal Jan. 9, officially disqualifying Joy from this year’s race for the House seat in her district.
Meanwhile, the Montgomery County Board of Elections notified Arnold on Jan. 8 that it would review her candidate documents. The board on Tuesday determined that Arnold did not intentionally deceive the public and that there was no reason to disqualify her, according to Arnold. Board director Jeff Rezabek told The Post that he has not seen this issue come up before.
“I am elated that they made that decision,” Arnold said. “This law, while it was necessary for the spirit of what it was created for, which is to keep nefarious people from changing their names to run for office, it’s almost discriminative in how it is applied to trans people. Because that’s not what we’re doing: we’re not changing our names for nefarious reasons. It is to better reflect who we are.”
In Childrey’s district, the Mercer County Board of Elections met for just about “five minutes” on Thursday and decided she could proceed with her candidacy, Childrey told The Post.
“We’re relieved for what happened with us, but it exposes what we said all along: how wishy-washy, how unclear things are in Ohio and frankly, how selectively enforced this is,” Childrey said, pointing to Joy’s local board still keeping her from running.
After learning of Childrey’s and Arnold’s outcomes, Joy appealed to the Stark County Board of Elections once more. “This leaves the Stark County Board’s decision to be the outlier by not allowing me to run,” Joy wrote Thursday to the board. “I respectfully request another reconsideration of my candidacy based on the rulings of the Mercer and Montgomery County Boards of Election.”
The Stark County Board of Elections issued a statement Friday standing by its decision to disqualify Joy. The board “is sympathetic to Vanessa Joy’s argument that the campaign election guide put out by the Ohio Secretary of State was not specific enough. However, our decision must be based on the law and cannot be arbitrarily applied,” it said.
It’s unclear how many states have a law like Ohio’s, said Sean Meloy, the vice president of political programs for LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, an organization that aims to elect LGBTQ+ people into public offices.
A record number of transgender candidates ran for office last year, and as that trend is on track to continue this year, Melov said he’s “very worried” that similar laws may be used to challenge transgender candidates nationwide. It may also be a deterrent to would-be trans candidates who are reluctant to surface their deadnames.
Childrey’s, Joy’s and Arnold’s campaigns for seats in the Republican-controlled Ohio House were called into question as almost half the states in the nation have passed laws targeting transgender people. In Ohio, lawmakers are considering multiple bills related to the transgender community, including an attempt to ban gender-affirming care for minors.
Joy, Arnold and Childrey said attempts to legislate transgender lives are what compelled them to run. What they view as a targeted application of an Ohio law to hinder their runs for office is alarming, they said.
“Do I believe that this law was written to target trans people? No, I do not,” Childrey said. “I believe that it’s become a convenient tool for some bad actors to latch on to, in an attempt to silence trans voices that are speaking out loudly.”
For Joy, it means that her candidacy is “dead,” she said. “I’m disappointed. But the next step is figuring out what to do with this law before the next election.”"
7J263MFIMT_NLE38QR6FWGZ4FU,U.S. war plans for Ukraine don’t foresee retaking lost territory,Karen DeYoung,"January 26, 2024 at 6:01 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/26/ukraine-war-plan-biden-defense/,"Still smarting from last year’s failed counteroffensive in Ukraine, the Biden administration is putting together a new strategy that will de-emphasize winning back territory and focus instead on helping Ukraine fend off new Russian advances while moving toward a long-term goal of strengthening its fighting force and economy.
The emerging plan is a sharp change from last year, when the U.S. and allied militaries rushed training and sophisticated equipment to Kyiv in hopes that it could quickly push back Russian forces occupying eastern and southern Ukraine. That effort foundered, largely on Russia’s heavily fortified minefields and front-line trenches.
“It’s pretty clear that it will be difficult for them to try to mount the same kind of major push on all fronts that they tried to do last year,” a senior administration official said.
The idea now is to position Ukraine to hold its position on the battlefield for now, but “put them on a different trajectory to be much stronger by the end of 2024 … and get them on a more sustainable path,” said the senior official, one of several who described the internal policymaking on the condition of anonymity.
Miscalculations, divisions marked offensive planning by U.S., Ukraine
The U.S. planning is part of a multilateral effort by nearly three dozen countries backing Ukraine to pledge long-term security and economic support — both out of necessity, given the disappointing results of last year’s counteroffensive and the conviction that a similar effort this year would likely bring the same outcome, and as a demonstration of enduring resolve to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Each is preparing a document outlining its specific commitments spanning up to a decade in the future. Britain made its 10-year agreement with Ukraine public last week, signed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. It outlined contributions to “Maritime Security, Air, Air Defense, Artillery and Armor” as well as fiscal support and access to its financial sector. France is expected to be next, with an upcoming visit to Ukraine by President Emmanuel Macron.
But the success of the strategy depends almost entirely on the United States, by far Ukraine’s largest donor of money and equipment, and coordinator of the multilateral effort. This spring the administration hopes to release its own 10-year commitment, now being compiled by the State Department with the blessing of the White House — assuming that President Biden’s $61 billion request for supplemental Ukraine funding is approved by a recalcitrant Congress.
The shaky ground on which that assumption currently rests — with House Republicans appearing to dig in ever deeper in refusing the money — has worried both Western allies and Ukraine itself.
“Definitely the leadership and the engagement of the U.S. in the long term, but also in this very important phase, is paramount,” a senior European official said. “The supplemental is a must-have to continue ... not only on the ground, but as a show of Western resolve ... to make [Putin] understand that he will not win.”
“We wouldn’t survive without U.S. support, it’s a real fact,” Zelensky said in a television interview last week.
According to U.S. officials, the American document will guarantee support for short-term military operations as well as build a future Ukrainian military force that can deter Russian aggression. It will include specific promises and programs to help protect, reconstitute and expand Ukraine’s industrial and export base, and assist the country with political reforms needed for full integration into Western institutions.
Not incidentally, a U.S. official said, the hope is that the long-term promise — again assuming congressional buy-in — will also “future-proof” aid for Ukraine against the possibility that former president Donald Trump wins his reelection bid.
As the White House continues to try to persuade lawmakers, a second senior administration official emphasized that the strategy doesn’t mean that the Ukrainians are just going to build their own defensive trenches “and sit behind them” all year. “There is still going to be swapping of territory” in small cities and villages with minimal strategic value, “missile launches and drones” from both sides, and Russian “attacks on civilian infrastructure,” this official said.
Rather than the massive artillery duels that dominated much of the fighting in the second half of 2022 and much of 2023, the West’s hope for 2024 is that Ukraine will avoid losing any more territory than the one-fifth of the country now occupied by Russia. Additionally, Western governments want Kyiv to concentrate on tactics where its forces have had greater recent success — longer-distance fires, including with French cruise missiles promised for delivery within the next few months; holding back Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to protect naval transit from Ukraine’s ports; and tying up Russian forces inside Crimea with missile strikes and special operations sabotage.
Zelensky insists that Ukraine remains on the offensive. Plans for 2024 are “not just defense,” he said in a recent video address. “We want our country to retain the initiative, not the enemy.”
But U.S. policymakers who have met recently with him in private say Zelensky has doubts about how ambitious to be in the coming year without clarity about U.S. aid.
“We get asked what’s our plan, but we need to understand what resources we’re going to have,” Ukrainian lawmaker Roman Kostenko said. “Right now, everything points to the possibility that we will have less than last year, when we tried to do a counteroffensive and it didn’t work out. ... If we will have even less, then it’s clear what the plan will be. It will be defense.”
“Nobody is taking offensive actions out of the equation,” said Serhii Rakhmanin, another member of parliament. “But in general ... it’s very hard to imagine a serious, global strategic offensive operation in 2024. Especially if we look at the general state of foreign aid, not just from the U.S.”
Even those who believe that Ukraine could eventually beat back Russia concede that 2024 will be lean and dangerous. “Most probably there are not going to be huge territorial gains,” Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said in an interview. “The only strategy is to get as much as you can to Ukraine to help them first of all to defend their own cities ... and second to help them simply not to lose ground.”
“We are a little taken hostage by time,” agreed Kusti Salm, permanent secretary of the Estonian Defense Ministry. “It’s just a question of whether we can walk through this valley of death.”
Along the front line, the Ukrainian military has started preparing accordingly, aiming to replicate Russia’s layered defenses of trenches and minefields in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region that hampered last year’s counteroffensive.
“Normal soldiers aren’t very interested in [Ukrainian] politics and foreign politics,” said a Ukrainian commander in the eastern Donetsk region, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “But when you feel for yourselves that it’s not enough, like now with ammunition, mortars, shells, that immediately triggers worry. You can fight, but you have to have something to fight with.”
U.S. policymakers say they expect the war will eventually end through negotiations — but also that they don’t think Putin will be serious about talks this year, in part because he holds out hope that Trump will win back the presidency in November and dial back support to Kyiv.
Trump, who has long touted a special relationship with Putin, said months ago that if he is returned to the White House, he “will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.” Zelensky, in last week’s television interview, called that claim “very dangerous” and invited Trump to Kyiv to share whatever plan he might have.
The long-term strategy to transform Ukraine for the future has its roots in a G-7 declaration of support last summer in which Western leaders promised to build a “sustainable” military force interoperable with the West, and to strengthen Ukraine’s “economic stability and resilience.”
Even so, the policy holds risks, including political ones, if Ukrainians begin to blame their government for stagnant front lines. Likewise, in Western capitals, officials are keenly aware that their citizens’ patience with funding Ukraine’s war is not infinite.
Amid the planning, Washington also seems to be readying the argument that, even if Ukraine is not going to regain all of its territory in the near term, it needs significant ongoing assistance to be able to defend itself and become an integral part of the West.
“We can see what Ukraine’s future can and should be, irrespective of exactly where lines are drawn,” Blinken said earlier this month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “And that’s a future where it stands strongly on its own two feet militarily, economically, democratically.”
In conversations with lawmakers, administration officials have emphasized that only about half of the requested $61 billion is targeted at the current battlefield, while the rest is directed toward helping Ukraine undergird a secure future without massive Western aid.
The U.S. document, according to U.S. officials closely involved in the planning, is being written with four phases in mind: fight, build, recover and reform.
What is needed most immediately for the “fight” phase is “artillery ammunition, some replacement of vehicles” lost in the counteroffensive, “a lot more drones,” said Eric Ciaramella, a former CIA intelligence analyst and now a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has consulted with administration officials. “A lot of electronic warfare and counter-drone technology — where the Russians have achieved an edge. They need more air defense systems to cover more cities.”
Although Ukraine is still anxiously awaiting the promised delivery of fighter aircraft and more armored vehicles this year, these are “expensive systems with single points of failure,” Ciaramella said. “I think the Ukrainians are realizing there is no silver bullet, having seen a million-dollar tank destroyed by a $10,000 mine” during the counteroffensive.
The “build” phase of the strategy is focused on pledges for Ukraine’s future security force on land, sea and air, so that the Ukrainians “can see what they’re getting from the global community over a 10-year period and ... come out of 2024 with a road map to a highly deterrent military,” the first senior administration official said. At the same time, some of the requested supplemental money is targeted at developing Ukraine’s industrial base for weapons production that, along with U.S. and allied increases, can “at least keep pace with Russian” production.
The plan also includes additional air defense to create protective “bubbles” around Ukrainian cities beyond Kyiv and Odessa and to allow key parts of the Ukrainian economy and exports, including steel and agriculture, to recover. Biden last fall named former commerce secretary Penny Pritzker as U.S. envoy to lead an effort to rebuild Ukraine’s economy and mobilize public and private investment.
Enticing foreign investment back into Ukraine will also require additional efforts to stem corruption, U.S. officials acknowledge. Zelensky has taken some steps, including firing and in some cases arresting allegedly corrupt military procurement officials and judges; other initiatives have been demanded by the European Union as it considers eventual E.U. membership for Ukraine.
But as conversations and planning for the future continue, not every Ukraine backer thinks this is the right moment to shift focus away from sending Ukraine what is necessary to confront the Russians as quickly and decisively as possible on the battlefield this year.
“Whatever strategy you use, you need all the weapons you can think of,” former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said during a visit last week to press Republican lawmakers to approve Ukraine funding.
“You cannot win a war by pursuing an incremental step-by-step approach,” he said. “You have to surprise and overwhelm your adversary.”

7LMOU394D7_HX5PPSRFLM2PB7Y,Mother of Oxford school shooter faces trial in historic prosecution,Kim Bellware,"January 22, 2024 at 8:14 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/22/jennifer-crumbley-trial-preview/,"Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the Oxford, Mich., teen who killed four students in 2021, heads to trial Tuesday in a high-profile case that marks the first time parents of a school shooter have faced involuntary manslaughter charges related to their child’s crime.
The Crumbley parents acknowledge that they bought their son a gun in the days before the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting at Oxford High School, but they are not accused of knowing about their son’s plan. Prosecutors say the parents gave their son access to a deadly weapon while ignoring his mental health struggles, including ones raised by his teachers on the day of the shooting.
James and Jennifer Crumbley have pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.
The parents were initially set to be tried together but were granted separate trials last year to ensure fair proceedings for both, their defense attorneys said in filings. They face historic charges in connection to the deaths of Hana St. Juliana, 14; Tate Myre, 16; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Justin Shilling, 17. In December, their son Ethan Crumbley was sentenced to life without parole more than a year after pleading guilty to two dozen charges, including one count of terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder for killing his schoolmates. Seven others were wounded in the shooting.
Jennifer Crumbley will be the first parent to stand trial while her husband, James, faces trial March 5 on identical charges.
The Crumbley trials are expected to be a bellwether for future cases involving charges of gross negligence against the parents of minors who commit deadly mass killings. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen D. McDonald made headlines in 2021 when she announced that she was charging the parents.
During a December 2021 news conference announcing the charges, McDonald said parents of mass shooters should not necessarily face charges in every case, but she called the facts in the Crumbley case “egregious.”
The day of the shooting, the parents had been summoned to the school to discuss violent images and messages their son scrawled on his homework — including a drawing of a gun and the words “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.” McDonald said the parents had a duty that day to tell the school that they had recently bought him a gun.
“The notion that a parent could read those words and also know their son had access to a deadly weapon, that they gave him, is unconscionable,” McDonald said, calling their actions “criminal.”
Neither the prosecution nor the defense have been allowed to comment on the case due to a gag order in place since 2022.
While the Crumbleys are not accused of knowing about their son’s plan, prosecutors have underscored the fact that they were the ones who purchased the gun for their son; the parents are accused of providing their son with a gun while ignoring his mental health struggles. The Crumbleys are also accused of negligence by failing to properly secure the gun at home, an issue that is expected to be fought over during the trials. The shooter has disputed his parents’ assertion that they locked the gun away. Michigan did not have a “safe storage law” in 2021. As of this year, the state requires people to secure firearms if a minor may be present.
If found guilty, the Crumbleys each face up to 15 years in prison.
While anger at the Crumbley family has swirled in the suburban Detroit community since the shooting, one person who is not blaming the parents is the shooter himself. He made a rare statement during his December sentencing hearing and referred to himself as a “really bad person.”
“We’re all here today because of what I did. My actions, what I chose to do,” Crumbley said. He absolved his parents of responsibility and asked the judge to give him the life sentence his victims requested."
7OSHNWH6OD_NDQ4KI0UGQGNTUE,"Senators challenge assisted living industry over wandering deaths, poor care",Christopher Rowland,"January 25, 2024 at 4:41 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/25/assisted-living-memory-care-death/,"The U.S. assisted-living industry faced scrutiny Thursday from a bipartisan group of lawmakers who pressed for answers about low staffing, high costs, and a lack of transparency surrounding poor care and the preventable deaths of elderly people with dementia walking away unnoticed from facilities — an all-too-common tragedy revealed by a Washington Post investigation last month.
The federal government does not oversee the industry.
The chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), called Thursday’s hearing citing The Post’s reporting. He said deliberations about potential federal regulations will continue and asked the public to send stories of costs and care to help inform the committee. Casey said Thursday’s hearing — which included testimony from an advocate, an industry representative and a loved one who called the committee to report bad care — was the start of the biggest review of assisted living by the Senate in 20 years.
“Unfortunately, what I heard today makes clear that we have a long way to go when it comes to guaranteeing the level of care that older Americans in assisted-living facilities deserve,” Casey said in a statement after the hearing.
Richard J. Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, testified that consumers can’t be assured they will get quality care without national standards. “It is time for [federal regulation] … so that when someone accesses dementia care, it means something, it’s not just a term of art,” he said.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the committee, agreed. She called for federal regulation of assisted-living facilities on a par with government oversight of nursing homes, which measures cost and quality and includes a website allowing consumers to look up staffing data and incident reports. She said the government needs to start by demanding quality and incident information from assisted-living operators.
“This has gone on long enough without federal oversight,” Warren said during the hearing. In a hallway interview after the session, she added, “It’s important we get these regulations in place before private equity has scooped up every assisted-living facility around the country and stripped it of the assets they have.”
Prospects for the introduction of legislation remain uncertain, however, much less the passage.
The largest assisted-living lobbying group in Washington, the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL), pledged after the hearing to “support collaboration and transparency among policymakers, providers and the public” and educate people about the benefits of state regulation. Argentum, another industry group, said its members receive high resident and family satisfaction scores under the regulatory system. Industry representatives have previously said federal regulation would damage the assisted-living industry and drive up costs.
Casey did not commit to any particular provision that could be considered by Congress. The ranking Republican on the committee, Sen. Mike Braun (Ind.), cautioned against federal regulation and said he favors state regulation and oversight. But he did advocate for a stronger government role in promoting transparency about costs and quality in facilities.
“If you don’t do a good job, you don’t welcome competition and transparency — you’re going to invite the federal government into your business,” Braun said in an interview after the hearing.
Assisted living has grown dramatically since the Senate issued a report two decades ago — only to opt against regulating the industry. Assisted-living facilities now have nearly as many residents as nursing homes.
The industry’s rapid push into more costly “memory care,” marketed to families desperate to find a safe haven for loved ones with cognitive decline, has concentrated residents with high levels of medical and behavioral needs in settings subject to varying levels of scrutiny, depending on the state.
The Post investigation revealed that assisted-living facilities are often ill-equipped to handle the job of protecting these vulnerable residents.
The Post documented 2,000 wandering incidents since 2018, with more than 100 of them fatal, including a handful of older incidents reported to the newspaper after publication. Since mid-December, when the investigation was published, at least two more residents with dementia perished after getting outside unnoticed — one in Oregon on Christmas Eve, and the most recent on Saturday, a man who was outside for about eight hours on a frigid night in Columbus, Ohio.
Argentum and AHCA/NCAL have said wandering deaths are extremely rare in the context of the millions of people who have resided in the last five years in the 30,000 member facilities across the country.
How your state regulates assisted-living facilities
Critics say higher levels of risk and dangerous incidents require a stronger response by the federal government after decades of inaction. A witness at the hearing, Patty Vessenmeyer, of Gainesville, Va., testified that her late husband received poor care in a memory-care unit in Virginia. TVs were blaring at odd hours, PVC pipe was left that could be used as a weapon, and the facility was understaffed, she said.
“They did not deliver. They definitely overpromised,” she said under questioning by Casey. “There just was not enough staff for them to get it done. They were friendly, wonderful people who weren’t trained, and they were overwhelmed.”
Julie Simpkins, a member of the NCAL board and co-president at Gardant Management Solutions, an assisted living operator, echoed industry talking points during the hearing and warned senators against pursuing uniform standards.
“When we talk about assisted living, it’s important to note that every state, every facility and every resident is different,” she said. “Efforts to standardize all assisted-living communities would be both unworkable and irresponsible for resident care.”
She said her “thoughts and prayers go out” to loved ones of residents who died after going outside but said the “overwhelming” number of assisted living residents have a positive experience.
The Post’s articles detailed low pay, chronic understaffing and spotty state requirements for training. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) questioned how the industry planned to fill the millions of caregiving jobs that will be required as baby boomers reach their 80s.
Thursday’s hearing came less than a week after the latest fatality reported to The Post. Surveillance video showed Robert Weaver, 74, peering out a window of the Cherry Blossom senior living facility in Columbus about 1 a.m. Saturday and then going outside through an exit door, according to his son, Troy. The low temperature was 6 degrees that night.
Weaver was not found until about 9 a.m. by facility staff, unresponsive on the sidewalk outside the building, according to police and county coroner reports. The retired delivery truck driver was wearing only his favorite Ohio State University sweatshirt against the extreme weather, his son said. First responders declared him dead at 9:22 a.m.
Troy Weaver said he moved his father to Cherry Blossom at the end of November because his symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease made it dangerous for him to remain at his rural farmhouse.
He said that even before his father died, he’d begun having concerns about his care. “When I went there on Jan. 9, the room smelled of body odor. He hadn’t showered for a few weeks and I was a bit shocked at that and I was a bit angry.”
Robert Weaver resided in a general assisted-living unit, not a secured memory-care unit. Industry representatives have said there should be a distinction between walkaway deaths at those different types of facilities, but the Post investigation found that state investigators issue violations for failures in both types of settings after fatal wandering deaths.
“I didn’t want him to be living alone. I wanted him to be safe,” Troy Weaver said. He said he was stunned Cherry Blossom staff did not notice his father wander outside in extreme cold and didn’t detect his absence for eight hours.
“This system needs regulation and people need to know our loved ones are safe,” he said. “If I’d have left him at the farm, living alone, I could at least understand how it happened.”
The Ohio Department of Health said it cannot comment on an ongoing investigation. Cherry Blossom, which is operated by the for-profit chain Continental Senior Communities, declined to discuss the incident, citing patient privacy laws, but said in an email that it is providing additional education for staff and cooperating fully with regulatory authorities.
“We are taking every possible step to find answers for the family and to help ensure that there is no similar occurrence in the future,” Cherry Blossom said."

The woman who died was reported to have consumed them at a party in Connecticut, the officials said. Attorneys representing the late Órla Baxendale, a British native who moved to New York to pursue a career as a ballet dancer, said she died of anaphylactic shock on Jan. 11 resulting from a severe allergic reaction after eating the mislabeled cookies. The cookies were made by the wholesaler Cookies Unlimited and sold by Stew Leonard’s, the attorneys said.
“Preliminary investigation has revealed that Órla’s death occurred due to the gross negligence and reckless conduct of the manufacturer and/or sellers who failed to properly identify the contents of the cookie on the packaging,” read a statement from the firm Gair, Gair, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackauf. “This failure in proper disclosure has led to this devastating yet preventable outcome.”
The real reason(s) food allergies are on the rise
The grocer and Connecticut health officials are warning people about Florentine cookies sold under the Stew Leonard’s house brand at the Danbury and Newington locations purchased between Nov. 6 and Dec. 31.
“Consumers with a nut allergy should immediately dispose of the cookies or return them to the point of sale and seek medical attention if necessary,” the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Food, Standards and Product Safety Division and the Connecticut Department of Public Health said in a statement.
Stew Leonard Jr., the grocery chain’s CEO, posted a video message Wednesday in which he said it was a “sad day” for his family and expressed sympathy. “I have four daughters. One of them is in her 20s,” he said. “I can imagine how that family feels right now.” He deflected blame for the alleged mislabeling, saying that the wholesaler from which his company purchased the cookies had changed its recipe and did not notify the grocer’s chief safety officer that the items contained peanuts.
But that wholesaler, Cookies Unlimited, claims that it did notify Stew Leonard’s of the switch from soy nuts to peanuts in the Florentine cookies. It provided a copy of a letter it said was sent to 11 Stewart Leonard’s employees alerting them to the change. “This letter is to inform you that the below listed items have had a change of ingredients and now contain peanuts,” reads the letter, which is dated July 11. Cookies Unlimited provided redacted email addresses of the employees it said it sent the letter to.
The company also posted on its website the labels it said it had used in all shipments to Stew Leonard’s after July 20. Those labels, for the vanilla and chocolate versions of the Florentine cookie, stated that the cookies contained peanuts.
Walker Flanary, the general counsel for Cookies Unlimited, said in an interview that officials from the New York Department of Agriculture visited the company’s facilities after the incident was reported. “They audited our processes,” he said, and found no issues. “As far as we are concerned, this is a labeling issue.”
“We are fully cooperating with the authorities regarding this heartbreaking event,” Cookies Unlimited said in a news statement. “This is a tragedy that should have never happened and our sympathy is with the family of this Stew Leonard’s customer.”
A Stewart Leonard’s spokeswoman declined to answer questions, including on whether the company’s employees had received the letter alerting them to the recipe change.
Baxendale’s attorneys could not immediately be reached, but their statement described her as a talented 25-year-old whose family was grieving. “She was a radiant and brave soul who pursued her dreams relentlessly, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of those who knew her,” it said.

Baxendale’s biography on the website for the Ailey School, where she studied, says the Manchester native joined the school as a scholarship student in 2018. She performed in New York Fashion Week and at New York’s Lincoln Center, it says.
The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection said its investigators are working with state and local public health officials in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, as well as with the Food and Drug Administration and Stew Leonard’s “to determine the cause of the error, as well as if any other products were affected and sold to other stores.”
“This is a heartbreaking tragedy that should never have happened,” DCP Commissioner Bryan Cafferelli said in the statement."
7X45BON04P_SD5GOR0PLVAI6JP,"Gochujang is a spicy, complex marvel that will amp up your recipes",Aaron Hutcherson,"January 26, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/01/26/gochujang-korean-chile-paste-recipes/,"Gochujang is a fermented soybean and chile pepper paste, and one of the building blocks of Korean cuisine. It has funk, salt, umami, spice and a hint of sweetness.
“It’s like hot sauce, Korean hot sauce, but it’s really not,” said Deuki Hong, a Bay Area-based chef and author of the upcoming “Koreaworld” cookbook. “Hot sauces and sriracha wishes they can do half the things that gochujang can do.”
I’ve been a fan ever since I first tried it years ago, and I often add to sauces for meats and to add flavor to stir-fries — but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Here’s what you need to know about the chile paste and how to make good use of it in your kitchen.
Gochujang, doenjang (soybean paste) and ganjang (soy sauce) are collectively referred to as jangs, the “foundations of Korean flavors and cooking,” Hong said, and they all start with meju (blocks of fermented soybeans). Most of us likely have a frame of reference for ganjang, and deonjang is commonly compared to miso — though Hong “hate[s] using the reference” because they have different flavor profiles. But there really isn’t anything out there that I know of that’s quite like gochujang, which is a mix of meju, gochugaru (dried Korean red chile pepper powder), glutinous rice and other additives that have been fermented further.

This fermentation is the key to the jangs’ flavor, and Korean cuisine’s characteristic flavor profile that Hong best describes as “depth.” “It’s a depth of flavor that brings that earthiness, that richness, but you can’t really pinpoint it out initially right when you taste it,” Hong said. “It’s so present in almost every Korean dish and eating experience that you almost don’t even recognize it.”
A hot sauce guide with tips for how to use 8 common styles
While gochujang is sometimes reduced to “Korean hot sauce,” the paste in its truest form is not meant to be used as a stand-alone condiment, but rather as an ingredient. Hong said “applying it in a marinade is a very low-bar way” to get familiar with what the ingredient can do. However, it’s important to note that gochujang often contains some form of sugar, which can burn easily when searing or grilling. Another easy introduction is to turn it into a sauce, and it can also be added to soups, stews, stir-fries and even desserts.
“It’s very complex,” Hong said, giving it a “malleability” to allow it to be used in a range of dishes. “You can put gochujang in a sweet application. You could also put it in a very spicy application. You can put it in a savory application.” There’s basically nothing it can’t do. But Hong cautions cooks to be judicious with its use, especially when just starting out. “A little goes a long way.”
Gochujang is sold in tubs, jars and squeeze bottles at well-stocked grocery stores, Asian markets and online. Heat levels will vary. “Brands have different flavors, but [they’re] all playing within the gochujang realm,” Hong said. “Maybe some are a little spicier, some are a little sweeter. But for our purposes, home cook purposes, it’s better not to confuse yourself with any of that.”
Gochujang gives a spicy, smoky and sweet boost to these 6 recipes
Beware that there are premixed sauces and marinades available as well, so make sure you look for the paste if you want the real thing. Once opened, gochujang has a very long shelf life when stored properly in the refrigerator, up to 2 years. As long it hasn’t dried out and there are no visible signs of mold or spoilage, it is still safe to eat.
“Go play around with it, get creative with it,” Hong said. “Don’t be shy. At the end of the day, it’s just food.”

885BBRZ5ZD_HOACAF88MSJNXLR,AI deepfakes of Taylor Swift spread on X. Here’s what to know.,Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff,"January 26, 2024 at 10:58 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/26/ai-deepfakes-taylor-swift-nude/,"Sexually explicit images of Taylor Swift that probably were generated by artificial intelligence spread quickly on social media this week, some of which were seen millions of times before platforms like X took them down, according to several news reports. The images, known as deepfakes, reignited debate over regulating AI.
Here’s what to know about the spread of the images, about deepfakes more broadly and about what governments are doing to stop them.
Deepfakes are lifelike fake videos or images created with face- and audio-swapping technology. They often go viral on social platforms and have improved at replicating a person’s voice. That’s happened as the tools to identify an AI-made image have struggled to keep up, making it more difficult for those platforms to identify problematic videos.
Celebrities have warned followers not to be duped by the deepfakes.
Easy access to AI imaging technology has created a new tool to target women, allowing almost anyone to produce and share nude images of them.
Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, AI is also giving politicians excuses to dismiss potentially damaging pieces of evidence as fakes generated by AI. That’s happening at the same time as real AI deepfakes are being used to spread misinformation.
There is no federal law that makes it illegal to create deepfakes nationally, though some lawmakers have introduced bills to try.
In Congress, Rep. Joseph Morelle (D-N.Y.) has introduced a bill called the Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act, which he says would make creating those types of videos a federal crime.
“The spread of AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift is appalling — and sadly, it’s happening to women everywhere, every day,” Morelle wrote Thursday on X.
In a news conference Friday, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration was “alarmed” by the proliferation. She said social media companies, she said, should “prevent the spread of misinformation and nonconsensual intimate imagery of real people.”
President Biden issued an executive order in October that a White House statement said would establish standards and best practices for detected AI-generated content. But it stopped short of requiring companies to label AI-generated photos, videos and audio.
The federal government, though, has been slow to act, some state lawmakers say. In response, states are trying to lead the way on implementing guardrails against AI, with some enacting measures to protect against the use of deepfakes in elections, including Texas and California. Georgia and Virginia, among others, have banned the creation of nonconsensual deepfake pornography.
Still, some argue that banning all types of the fake videos could violate the First Amendment, since the videos are “technically forms of expression,” according to the Princeton Legal Journal. Consensual fake pornographic videos, though, would not be protected under exceptions to the First Amendment that include libel, defamation and profanity, the journal wrote.
Some legal scholars also warn that fake AI images may not fall under copyright protections since they draw from data sets of millions of images.
Between December 2018 and December 2020, the number of fake videos detected online doubled every six months, according to Sensity AI, which tracks deepfakes. Sensity found that at least 90 percent of the videos were nonconsensual porn, most of which involve altered footage of women.
Researchers found that in 2023 more than 143,000 videos receiving more than 4.2 billion views were uploaded to the 40 most popular websites for faked videos as AI-generated porn ballooned across the internet, The Washington Post reported.
But as the technology has improved, detecting deepfakes has grown increasingly more difficult. Google’s policies prevent nonconsensual sexual images from appearing in search results, but deepfake porn can still show up on search engines. Some companies have created tools to try to detect if a video has been AI-generated, but those are not perfect.
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that humans and machines can identify the fake images at a similar rate, and that both make mistakes when doing so. Those researchers suggested humans pay close attention to people’s faces in images and videos they think could be fake, including an individual’s glasses, facial hair and the rate of blinking, which all might look abnormal.
The images of Swift spread widely on X, which dismantled much of its moderation shortly after Elon Musk took over the platform.
In a statement released overnight, X said it had removed the Swift images, though it did not identify her.
“Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,” the statement said. “Our teams are actively removing all identified images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them. We’re closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed.”
In response to The Post’s email requesting comment Friday morning, an automated message said: “Busy now, please check back later.”

He was 82.
Mr. Franklin had been in a hospice care since Jan. 8, said his wife, Lynn Franklin. He had been receiving treatment for esophageal cancer for two years.
Mr. Franklin’s work helped reset the boundaries of journalism on science and health by seeking to share his journeys of discovery. He let readers see what he saw and hear what he heard during the reporting. Data such as lab results and research findings carried an exigence of their own, serving as clues that explain what might motivate a physician’s actions or theories.
In a story headlined “Mrs. Kelly’s Monster,” winner of the Pulitzer in 1979 for feature writing, he explored the limits of medicine and the fragility of life. “The Mind Fixers,” a seven-part series on the dawn of molecular psychiatry and the mysteries of the brain, earned Mr. Franklin the 1985 Pulitzer for explanatory journalism.
The first installment of “Mrs. Kelly’s Monster,” which appeared Dec. 12, 1978, introduced the two central figures: Dr. Thomas Barbee Ducker, chief brain surgeon at the University of Maryland Hospital, and Edna Kelly, who had been living in pain and fear for nearly six decades with a tangled knot of abnormal blood vessels pressing on the back of her brain.
Ducker planned to operate. He hoped to ease the stranglehold of the blood vessels that could leave her paralyzed, blind or dead from a rupture. She was willing to try anything. It was time for either Edna or what she called “the monster” to prevail.
“Now, at 7:15 a.m. in operating room 11, a technician checks the brain surgery microscope and the circulating nurse lays out bandages and instruments. Mrs. Kelly lies still on a stainless steel table,” Mr. Franklin wrote.
“A small sensor has been threaded through her veins and low hangs in the antechamber of her heart. The anesthesiologist connects the sensor to a seven-foot-high bank of electronic instruments,” he continued. “Oscilloscope waveforms begin to build and break. Dials swing. Lights flash. With each heartbeat a loudspeaker produces an audible popping sound. The steady pop, pop, popping isn’t loud, but it dominates the operating room.”
Readers flooded the Sun’s switchboard, demanding to know when the second part of the story would run. That came the next day.
Mr. Franklin, in an almost minute-by-minute account, brought readers back into the operating theater. Ducker and the medical team struggled to reach an aneurysm that occurred during the surgery. They could not.
“It is 1:43, and it’s over. … The monster won,” Mr. Franklin wrote.
The story — along with Mr. Franklin’s “Writing for Story: Craft Secrets of Dramatic Nonfiction” (1986) — remain part of the syllabus in journalism schools and writing classes. In the end, Mr. Franklin said the reporting experience left him shaken.
“When you’re really doing it, when you’re what I like to call ‘in contact,’ which means you’re living in the story just like the reader’s going to, it’s very frightening,” he said. “Because it takes an awful lot of chutzpah. I’m as insecure as everybody else.”
His own sessions with a psychotherapist led him toward the project “The Mind Fixers,” which explored alternatives to psychoanalysis such as specialized drugs and other techniques to regulate on-off switches in brain function. “[Therapy] helped me recognize how my mind worked and what part of my mind was mine and what part was universal,” he said.
The series became the foundations for a 1987 book, “Molecules of the Mind: The Brave New Science of Molecular Psychology.” That was one of the seven books Mr. Franklin wrote or co-wrote ranging from explorations of cutting-edge medicine to chronicling experiments that included Army physician Walter Reed’s early-20th-century work in battling yellow fever.
Mr. Franklin and his co-author, University of Maryland pathologist John Sutherland, asserted in 1984’s “Guinea Pig Doctors” that Reed took credit for work done by a junior doctor who died after using himself as a test subject.
“It’s a hard road for people who are trying to write the true literature of what’s happening in society,” Mr. Franklin told the university’s College Park magazine in 2001. “Are rock stars really our heroes? I don’t think so. They have their place, but they shouldn’t be the big story. The main event is life.”
Jon Daniel Franklin was born in Enid, Okla., on Jan. 13, 1942. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was a journeyman electrician whose shifting job sites forced the family to uproot frequently.
In “Writing for Story,” Mr. Franklin recalled being bullied as a teenager and his father advising him that his best defense was words, not his fists. Later, his father bought him a used Underwood typewriter to begin his first short stories.
Mr. Franklin dropped out of high school in 1959 and joined the Navy, where he was assigned to the Navy’s All Hands magazine. He left military service in 1967 and enrolled in the University of Maryland under the GI Bill, completing his degree in journalism in 1970.
He was hired on the rewrite desk at the Baltimore Evening Sun (which closed as a separate entity in 1995 and some staff merged with its sister paper, the Baltimore Sun.) Mr. Franklin noticed in 1972 that the science beat was open. There were few takers, and he seized the chance.
“I am a science writer, but I don’t write about science,” he said in a 2004 interview with a Nieman Foundation website. “I write about people. The science is just the scenery.”
In 1986, beyond a brief later stint as science writer at the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Franklin shifted from the newsroom to academia. He taught at Towson State University, the University of Maryland, Oregon State University and the University of Oregon.
Mr. Franklin’s marriage to Nancy Creevan ended in divorce. In 1988, he married Lynn Scheidhauer. In addition to his wife, survivors include two daughters from his first marriage.
In 1994, Mr. Franklin and his wife established an early internet forum, WriterL, for discussions about literary journalism and story sharing.
The couple settled in North Carolina in 2003. One night shortly after they arrived, their poodle Sam was barking wildly at about midnight. The house was ablaze from an electrical fire. The dog roused them from sleep. They raced for safety, still wearing their bathrobes.
The fire became part of Mr. Franklin’s 2009 book, “The Wolf in the Parlor: The Eternal Connection Between Humans and Dogs.”
“Lynn reached across Sam, who was trotting between us, and took my hand. I squeezed her fingers,” he wrote. “Life would go on.”"
8CEKZTDRFJ_PE09EUB5QNPHGHR,Ukraine alleges Russian disinformation in downing of military plane,Siobhán O'Grady,"January 25, 2024 at 6:28 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/25/russian-military-plane-crash-ukraine/,"KYIV — Russia and Ukraine traded blame and pushed dueling narratives Thursday over the downing of a Russian military plane, which Moscow said was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were about to be exchanged and returned home to their families. Everyone aboard was killed, Russia said.
Ukraine has not confirmed whether POWs were on board. Nor has it directly confirmed that it shot down the Ilyushin Il-76 transport plane, which crashed Wednesday in Russia’s Belgorod region, just north of the Ukrainian border.
But in their statements about the incident, senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have not denied downing the plane, and some have emphasized Ukraine’s right — and urgent need — to target Russian military aircraft given Moscow’s ongoing invasion, constant airstrikes on Ukrainian cities and push to seize more territory.
Zelensky said Wednesday evening that he would insist on an international investigation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov replied with acid snark — accusing Kyiv of killing its own soldiers. He called the downing of the plane “a monstrous act … beyond comprehension,” and said Moscow would welcome an international inquiry.
“If he means an international investigation into the criminal acts of the Kyiv regime, then it is definitely needed,” Peskov told journalists.
Ukraine shot down Russian military jet, killing 74, officials say
Russia has repeatedly sought to thwart international investigations, including into the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a chemical weapon and the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine, for which two former Russian security service officers were convicted of murder in a Dutch court.
Zelensky in his speech Wednesday evening implied that Ukraine’s air force had shot down the plane, which crashed within striking range of Ukraine. Russia regularly launches deadly strikes from the Belgorod region into Ukraine, including Tuesday, when 18 Ukrainians were killed across the country.
The incident — and the conflicting narratives — raise an array of troubling questions for military and political leaders in Ukraine and Russia.
Regardless of whether Ukrainian POWs were on the plane, the incident appears to mark a grave intelligence failure on the part of Ukraine — which was not immediately able, or willing, to confirm who or what they believed was on board the aircraft.
The chief of Ukraine’s air force accused Russia on Thursday of intentionally spreading fake information “to discredit Ukraine.”
“Their clear goal is to diminish international support for our country,” Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk wrote on Telegram. “It won’t succeed! Ukraine has the right to defend itself and destroy the aggressor’s means of aerial attack.”
Russian officials, while pointing fingers at Kyiv, have not explained why a military airplane was in such a vulnerable position that it was shot from the sky — a grave breach of Russia’s air defenses, and one possibly indicating a break in protocol.
In Ukraine’s northeast, fears rise of second Russian occupation
Ukraine’s State Security Service, the SBU, announced Thursday that it had opened an investigation. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights, said on Ukrainian television that he could not confirm whether prisoners of war were on the flight, but he asserted that if there were videos or other evidence confirming such casualties, Russia “would have already used them.”
“We did not see any signs that there were so many people on the plane — citizens of Ukraine or noncitizens of Ukraine,” he said. Lubinets also called for international experts to investigate.
Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate did confirm that an exchange of prisoners that was set to take place Wednesday did not occur. It also asserted that Ukraine was not informed in advance by Russia of any transport plans for prisoners and had not been warned to safeguard the airspace over Belgorod.
“Belgorod wasn’t a point that was considered to be involved in the exchange process, and there was no such information from the Russian side,” said Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence. “The conversation was about Sumy oblast.” Sumy is the Ukrainian border region where the exchange was to occur at a border checkpoint.
Yusov said that the Il-76 transport plane was “a military plane that shouldn’t have been used for the transportation of POWs.” By contrast, Ukrainian officials have used civilian ground transportation to bring Russian POWs to the exchange point. (Regular air travel in Ukraine has been suspended since Russia’s February 2022 invasion.)
The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine was aware of the plans. In addition to the 65 POWs, Russia said, six crew members and three other individuals were on board the plane and were killed.
Such exchanges are typically planned in extreme detail down to the last minute of the swap, when prisoners may pass each other as they each cross back into the custody of troops from their home country. Both militaries must coordinate to ensure the safety of the area during the process and avoid accidental strikes on the point of exchange.
Earlier this month, during the most recent prisoner exchange — the largest since the beginning of the war, in which Russians handed over more than 200 Ukrainian POWs — Moscow officials informed their Kyiv counterparts verbally that the Ukrainian prisoners would be transported by air, Yusov said.
“This time, this kind of information or request didn’t take place by the Russian side,” he said.
Oleksii, 44, a Ukrainian soldier who was taken prisoner of war in the besieged port city of Mariupol in 2022, said that planes were used to transport him and other soldiers when they were exchanged and returned home. All Ukrainians on board the flight were blindfolded, he said. “If you had a hat, they would put it down to cover your eyes and fix it with a tape to make sure you could see absolutely nothing,” he said. “For those who did not have a hat, they used a bag.”
Oleksii’s journey began in the Russian-occupied city of Olenivka in eastern Ukraine. He then boarded a flight in the southwestern Russian city of Taganrog to Moscow, then flew to Gomel in southeastern Belarus before crossing into Ukraine at the border. He did not know the model of aircraft that was used but said roughly 200 blindfolded Ukrainian prisoners were on board. Because of the blindfold, he was not sure how many Russian officials chaperoned the group but remembers six or seven distinct voices of Russians on board the plane.
In all, the journey took 36 hours, he said, during which he was not able to use a bathroom, “which was another kind of torture.”
Russian air passengers face peril as planes show strain of sanctions
Adding to the swirl of recriminations on Thursday, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the Russian state propaganda channel RT, published a list of names and birth dates that she said documented the Ukrainian POWs on board. News outlets quickly reported that some of those named by Simonyan appeared to be prisoners released in previous swaps.
Beyond this, however, Russia so far has provided little evidence to support the claim that dozens of prisoners of war were on the plane. The state-run RT channel shared a 20-second clip from the crash site, showing scattered debris but no visible body parts. Another short clip released by RT purported to show one dead body, although the video is heavily blurred, making it impossible to determine what is actually pictured.
Russian officials and military bloggers have also glossed over the fact that if Ukraine indeed hit such a major target as the Il-76 plane, this would constitute a serious security lapse for the military and for Belgorod region, which is a key staging ground for attacks on Ukraine and a hub for resupplying Russian forces.
Some military experts pointed out that the plane was possibly on a path routing out of Belgorod. Russian officials said the Il-76 was on “a planned flight” to Belgorod from Chkalovsky air base in the Moscow region.
But according to analysis by Janes, the security intelligence firm, the plane’s flight path, as well as the crash site, “is well beyond any holding pattern or maneuver” to approach the runway of the local airfield.
“Therefore it can safely be assumed that the aircraft was not on an approach vector to land at Belgorod (unless it was directed to hold at a point at such a bearing and distance from the airfield, for tactical reasons),” Janes said.
Janes added that the aircraft was flying at a low altitude, which could have been “a tactical ploy to remain below the radar horizon of the Ukrainian defenses to the south, either in approach to Belgorod, or in a route out from Belgorod.”
All six crew members killed in the crash were assigned to Russia’s 117th military transport aviation regiment stationed in Orenburg and have been identified by regional authorities.
Zelensky in his somber video address Wednesday evening said he had gathered top military officials and spoken to them about their “use of the air force.” Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, he said, “is engaged in finding out the fate of all prisoners.”
Zelensky’s delay in commenting publicly on the crash until late Wednesday spurred some criticism in Ukraine. Lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko, posting on Telegram, said that officials stayed quiet because of “ratings and negativity. And they want to be involved only in the positive.”

The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.
The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.
The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

8CXKRF8DU5_DDG0P0JUWJPODYR,You asked: Can the 14th Amendment affect Trump’s eligibility to run in 2024?,Patrick Marley,"January 24, 2024 at 4:40 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/14th-amendment-trump-ballot-eligibility-2024-presidential-election/,"We hear from readers a lot wanting to know how the Constitution’s 14th Amendment could affect former president Donald Trump’s eligibility to run in the 2024 presidential race. Here’s what we know: A provision of the 14th Amendment could prevent Trump from running for office again. It’s up to the Supreme Court to decide the issue.
In 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the United States ratified the 14th Amendment to guarantee equal rights to those who had been enslaved. Section 3 of the amendment barred from office those who engaged in insurrection after taking an oath to uphold the Constitution. The measure was used initially to keep former Confederates from returning to power but was written broadly to account for future insurrections.
1/5
Trump’s opponents have cited Section 3 in lawsuits filed around the country that argue Trump engaged in insurrection before and during the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and therefore can’t run again. Colorado’s top court in December determined Trump was ineligible to appear on the primary ballot in that state but put its decision on hold as Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court. (Maine’s secretary of state also found Trump was ineligible to run, but a state court blocked her determination for now. Courts in other states so far have allowed Trump to run.)
The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Feb. 8 and is expected to decide the issue for all states. Trump has argued the attack was not an insurrection and has said even if it was, he did not engage in it. He has also argued Section 3 does not apply to the presidency and has maintained Congress, not the judiciary, should be the one to handle questions related to candidates’ eligibility for office.

8D93EUSGBP_1D4R59Z7R8T2S8D,The GOP sure looks like it wants to punt on border crisis to help Trump,Aaron Blake,"January 25, 2024 at 12:31 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/gop-sure-looks-like-it-wants-punt-border-crisis-help-trump/,"A little-noticed social media post last week featured a lament from Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), the GOP’s lead negotiator on a potential immigration deal.
“Only in Washington is our southern border political gamesmanship instead of a national security crisis,” Lankford said.
Only in Washington is our southern border political gamesmanship instead of a national security crisis.
It wasn’t clear whom Lankford was accusing of political gamesmanship. But it came amid a growing push from the right wing of his party, Donald Trump and his allies to kill a promising potential deal.
And a week later, Republicans have done a great job confirming that they won’t do anything on the border for one big reason: political expediency.
As The Washington Post’s Tobi Raji, Theodoric Meyer and Leigh Ann Caldwell report, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday privately offered a dour prognosis for a deal that would unite border security measures with funding for Ukraine’s war effort. In doing so, McConnell pointed to Trump’s apparent ascension as the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. (Trump, who won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, has called for Republicans to reject the bipartisan compromise.)
Punchbowl News and others reported that McConnell specifically cited a desire not to “undermine” Trump and the fact that the former president would like to campaign on immigration in the 2024 election.
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called it “appalling” that Trump “would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame [President] Biden for it.”
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told USA Today, “Is it really better to have 10,000 people crossing a day illegally or 5,000? Clearly it’s 5,000. So somebody who is trying to defeat legislation, all in the name of running for office? That is irresponsible.”
McConnell has since clarified that he still aims to forge a deal, Romney said Thursday — though it remains to be seen how hard he’ll push.
It’s been clear for a while that the politics of this issue would be tough, especially in a GOP-controlled House which has balked at what senators like Lankford are negotiating. The public details of the deal are sparse so far, but key aspects include toughening rules for those who show up at the border to claim asylum. A sticking point has been how to handle parole for migrants to temporarily enter the United States.
But specifically citing Trump and his campaign takes things to another level. The objections don’t seem to just be about the difficulty in passing something or that it would be insufficient in stemming the flow at the border, but about how it would play politically. This from a party that has played up the immediacy of what it labeled a national security crisis at the border.
The shift also comes, notably, after McConnell and other top Republicans previously stressed the opportunity at hand — and the necessity to get something done now.
Senate Republicans last week actually pushed back when some of their GOP colleagues and conservative talkers suggested that legislation wasn’t necessary or that they should wait until Trump took office in a year.
Lankford called it “by far, the most conservative border security bill in four decades.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called it a “historic moment” and assured the GOP that it “won’t” get a better deal with Trump as president. “To get this kind of border security without granting a pathway to citizenship is really unheard of,” Graham said.
The No. 2 Senate Republican, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), offered similar comments, calling it a “unique moment” and arguing that there’s “absolutely no way” to get such a deal under Trump unless Republicans get a 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority.
McConnell himself maintained that even full GOP control of Washington wouldn’t work, because “we probably would not be able to get a single Democratic vote to pass” the deal.
“This is a unique opportunity to accomplish something in divided government,” McConnell said.
The logical extension of those comments is that Republicans might be giving up doing something significant on the border: If it’s not going to happen under Trump, and you’re not going to do it now, it’s not going to happen, period.
And by sticking their necks out in favor of the push for a deal, they have made it look even more like political gamesmanship rather than national security concerns killed the agreement. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to dispute that Trump and some Republicans see political value in continuing the border crisis and declining to cut a bipartisan deal that could help Biden politically. GOP lawmakers are now talking openly about that.
A comment I keep coming back to on this is one from Rep. Troy E. Nehls (R-Tex.), who just came out and said it early this month: “I’m not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden’s approval rating.”
One way to look at McConnell’s comments is just an acknowledgment of the political reality that it was going to be tough to pass. Why even have the Senate pass something that the House won’t — and in the process, make it clear the House killed a deal that could have helped at the border?
But another is that it’s just sheer exasperation with Trump and an attempt to lay the failure of the deal at his feet. This is a man who has relentlessly attacked McConnell, launching racist attacks at his wife and even seeming to suggestively point to McConnell’s demise. Yes, McConnell would appear to be capitulating to Trump after all that, but he’s also effectively blaming Trump.
While walking off the Senate floor Thursday, McConnell was asked about Trump potentially killing the deal.
“It’s not anything new,” he replied."

I’m Fenit Nirappil, a public health reporter for The Washington Post. Even as the presidential primaries dominate the headlines, I always appreciate tips about overlooked issues in public health, like the burden of HIV in adolescent girls, which we discuss below. Please send your story ideas and tips to fenit.nirappil@washpost.com. Not a subscriber? Sign up here.
Today’s edition: A dispatch from New Hampshire on the health issues important to Granite Staters, who just gave former president Donald Trump a resounding win in the first-in-the-nation Republican primary. Why House Republicans are subpoenaing the Biden administration’s health secretary. But first …
How uncertainty about PEPFAR weighs on adolescent girls’ health
The future of the President’s Emergency Relief Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, remains up in the air after Congress missed a deadline to reauthorize it, and Republicans, as The Washington Post first reported in October, have delayed more than $1 billion in funding over concerns about inadvertently funding abortion services.
I spoke to Janet Saul, who recently retired after serving as PEPFAR’s director of gender and rights and coordinating DREAMS, an initiative launched in 2014 to prevent HIV cases in adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti. DREAMS stands for determined, resilient, empowered, AIDS-free, mentored and safe. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
H202: How does DREAMS fit into PEPFAR?
Saul: Our previous ambassador at large, Deborah Birx, saw a disparity in the data, that adolescent girls and young women were exponentially more likely to acquire HIV than their male peers. We clearly weren’t meeting their needs. We knew we needed a game changer, something very different because it was obvious business as usual wasn’t working for this population.
H202: Why are adolescent girls far more likely than adolescent boys to acquire HIV?
Saul: Limited educational opportunities, limited economic opportunities, as well as high rates of intimate partner violence, adolescent pregnancy and child marriage. When you look at who adolescent girls and young women have sex with, they tend to be young men approximately eight years older. They are more likely to have HIV than younger men and boys.
H202: So what does it take to prevent HIV cases in young girls?
Saul: In addition to condoms and PrEP [shorthand for pre-exposure prophylaxis], which are really important in HIV prevention education, we have programs to keep girls in school. We have programs to teach them skills for employment or for starting a small business and saving money. We have programs to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. Those become very critical for adolescent girls and young women because of the structural factors that place them at risk.
H202: What’s at stake for this program if PEPFAR isn’t funded?
Saul: Girls that DREAMS would be supporting to stay in school would have to drop out. Girls who are receiving PrEP to avoid HIV may no longer have access to those medications until someone else picks up providing that. DREAMS programming going away will have ripple effects far beyond just the girls engaged in the programs. It provides programs for adolescent boys and young men to understand different ways of thinking about and treating young women.
If you talk to adolescent girls and young women who have become employed and started their own business through DREAMS, they will very proudly tell you how they use their money not just for themselves, but to help their families put food on their table and to send their siblings to school. All of that would be gone.
Globally, 71 percent of new infections among 10-to-19-year-olds are in girls. DREAMS ending would put a big dent in our progress in ending HIV as a public health threat by 2030.
H202: What else do you want people to know?
Saul: As we all saw with covid and Ebola, infectious diseases don’t know any borders, so they can affect health worldwide as well as the world economy. Preventing HIV among adolescent girls and young women and other highly vulnerable populations is important and not just for those individuals, for their communities, their countries, but also the entire world. We can’t underestimate the global connections and ripple effects of good public health programming and the lack of good health programming.
KFF Health News’s Phil Galewitz sends us this dispatch from New Hampshire:
Yesterday’s events largely turned on voters’ feelings about former president Donald Trump, but health-care issues — access, costs, the Affordable Care Act and, especially for Democrats, abortion — weren’t far from mind, I found in interviews with more than 50 Granite Staters. Here’s a snapshot:
Democrats were more likely to cite health care as a top concern than Republicans. “Health care is my No. 1 issue,” said Ben Gilson, 90, a retired orthopedic surgeon. While he said he has excellent coverage and pays little in out-of-pocket costs, he worries many younger people struggle and wants to make sure the Affordable Care Act is retained.
Trump supporters frequently pegged illegal immigration as their most important issue. “The border is a disgrace,” said Art Sullivan, 75, a registered independent. Asked if health care is something he thinks about when comparing candidates, he said he has a Medicare Advantage plan that covers his bills and provides access to care.
And fans of Nikki Haley were focused primarily on defeating Trump. Elaine Kozma, 73, said health-care issues are vitally important to her as a cancer survivor. Haley won Kozma’s vote because she thinks she can trust her more than the former president.
In the end, Trump beat Haley decisively in the GOP primary, while President Biden won the Democratic contest as a write-in candidate. You can read Phil’s full report here.
House Republicans subpoena HHS secretary
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra yesterday for information on his agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.
The details: Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) ordered Becerra to release documents and communications related to the office’s vetting and placement of unaccompanied children with suspected gang or criminal ties found crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent letters yesterday to five third-party marketing organizations seeking information on their practices during the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period.
The letters — sent to the leaders of eHealth, GoHealth, Agent Pipeline, SelectQuote and TRANZACT — request details on how the firms use insurance agents, lead generators and other data to steer seniors toward certain Medicare Advantage plans.
Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley’s calls for “consensus” on abortion have drawn mixed views and sometimes conflicting interpretations on the campaign trail. They’ve also helped her appeal to voters on both sides of the issue, The Post’s Dylan Wells reports.
In New Hampshire, some voters said they see her as supportive of abortion rights, others as antiabortion. Many agreed the former South Carolina governor appears more reasonable and less extreme than her rivals.
Reality check: Haley is in fact staunchly antiabortion. But in interviews, many Democratic and independent voters said they were willing to look past concerns they have about her record or the possibility of a GOP president passing a federal ban — in large part because she has spoken in more personal and cooperative terms than other Republicans.
That concerns Democratic strategists, who fear that if she does beat the odds and become the GOP nominee, it would be much more difficult to run on an issue they want to make central to their pitch for President Biden’s reelection. Among Republicans, some see Haley’s messaging as a blueprint for talking about abortion in the future, as the GOP has struggled to navigate the politics of the issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

8FTM58J1WU_WDJUK80IJNADJP2,Israel steps up Khan Younis assault; pressure mounts over two-state solution,Loveday Morris,"January 22, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/22/israel-gaza-hamas-eu-two-state/,"Israel stepped up its assault on Hamas fighters in southern Gaza on Monday, sending terrified civilians fleeing from a designated safe zone, as international calls for a two-state solution intensified.
More than 25,000 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s military campaign, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said before a day of intense diplomacy in Brussels that Israel’s campaign is “seeding the hate for generations.” European foreign ministers met with counterparts from Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as representatives of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Arab League.
Borrell pushed for a “two-state solution process” but said he knows that Israel has “a different stand.”
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind?” he asked, referring to the Israelis. “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill … them?”
What is the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians?
As he spoke, Israeli tanks advanced in and around the city of Khan Younis — the hometown of Hamas leader Yehiya Sinwar — pushing westward toward the seaside area of Mawasi, designated by Israel as a humanitarian zone where people should seek refuge.
As fighting drew closer, some families in Mawasi packed up tents to flee  farther south. Cars and carts clogged roads leading to Rafah, near the Egyptian border, where more than 1 million displaced people are already packed.
The Israel Defense Forces confirmed to The Washington Post that it still considers Mawasi a “safer zone.”
In Khan Younis, Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra called the health situation “catastrophic and indescribable,” as one hospital was cut off and another was stormed. Israeli troops entered al-Khair Hospital in the city’s west and detained medical staff, according to the ministry.
The Post was unable to independently verify the report, and the IDF would not comment on the fighting around hospitals, saying only that it was carrying out operations in the city.
Nasser Hospital, the largest health facility still functioning in the south, was surrounded by Israeli forces, according to the ministry and journalists in the compound. They reported that a mass grave had been dug for 40 bodies that could not be moved out of the compound.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it had completely lost contact with teams in Khan Younis. As night fell, Gaza entered a “near total telecoms blackout” — the 10th since the beginning of the war, according to Netblocks, a cybersecurity monitoring group. Communications had just been restored Friday after an eight-day blackout due to damaged cables.
As the fighting rages, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is locked in an escalating battle with Israel’s Western allies about the political future of the Palestinian territories. A Palestinian state is an “existential danger” to Israel, he reiterated Sunday, vowing to continue to oppose it as long as he is prime minister.
What Netanyahu sees from the river to the sea
The notion of two states for two peoples is broadly supported in the international community, including by the United States, the E.U. and the United Nations.
“I think that we have to stop talking about the peace process and start talking more concretely about the two-state solution process,” Borrell said ahead of the meetings in Brussels, where he presented a 12-point plan to revitalize diplomatic talks.
The plan “aims to address the conflict and occupation that preceded the Gaza war and that, if left unaddressed, must be expected to lead to further wars,” according to a copy obtained by The Post.
“There is no credible comprehensive solution other than an independent Palestinian State living side by side with Israel, in peace and security, with full normalization and substantive development of security and economic cooperation between Israel, Palestine and the region,” it said. It called for the establishment of a “Preparatory Peace Conference” at “the earliest opportunity,” to discuss a lasting solution.
Middle Eastern countries represented in Brussels on Monday have also been working to end the conflict, with Saudi Arabia explicitly tying normalization of relations with Israel to a credible path to Palestinian statehood.
Ahead of the meetings, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz held up photos of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, saying he was in Brussels to discuss their return, as well as to build support for Israel’s efforts to dismantle Hamas.
He ignored questions about the possibility of a two-state solution, the Times of Israel reported.
Netanyahu on Sunday rejected what he said were conditions put forth by Hamas for the release of the more than 100 remaining hostages held in Gaza — including an end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip. Agreeing to these terms and leaving Hamas in place in Gaza would be “a mortal blow to the security of Israel,” he said.
“Only total victory will ensure the elimination of Hamas and the return of all our hostages,” Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that he had emphasized his position in a call with President Biden over the weekend.
War in Gaza is making childbirth a nightmare
On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told relatives of hostages that the operation in Khan Younis is “in full swing” and that “there are preliminary indications that we have reached the most sensitive Hamas locations.”
Imad al-Samri, a 58-year-old Gaza resident who had sought refuge on the al-Aqsa University campus in Mawasi, described evacuating with his family on Monday morning as shells rained down on the university building.
Samri and his family, along with thousands of other displaced Palestinians at the university, fled toward the precarious safety of Rafah, seeking refuge in tents.
“This night could be one of the most difficult nights,” he said. “We barely escaped.”
During the early days of its assault on the Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces demanded that residents move south into Khan Younis and Rafah for shelter. But Khan Younis is now the center of fighting, and Rafah is running out of resources as more and more desperate families arrive.
In another corner of Khan Younis, 31-year-old Muhammad al-Zarie, who was living with his brothers in a tent near the city center, spoke of the ceaseless echoes of strikes and shelling, resonating through the night and into the morning.
“We don’t know where we will go if they advance farther. Thousands of displaced people arrived in the morning, and there is no place for them in this camp,” he said.
“The army instructed us to head to al-Mawasi, and we are here, but this area is no longer safe.”
Morris reported from Berlin, Rauhala from Brussels and Balousha from Amman, Jordan. Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv, Niha Masih in Seoul, Kate Brady in Berlin, Miriam Berger in Jerusalem, and Hajar Harb and Annabelle Timsit in London contributed to this report.
The ICJ will rule Friday on South Africa’s request that the court order Israel to suspend its military campaign. The court will not be ruling on whether Israel has committed genocide — a verdict that could take years.
Israel has stepped up its assault on Hamas in recent days as Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

8HIYTYQF3V_TNI8IRPPF3DJVED,Egypt frees U.S. charity worker held for three years in pretrial detention,Heba Farouk Mahfouz,"April 16, 2017 at 11:19 a.m. EDT",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-frees-us-aid-worker-held-for-three-years-in-pretrial-detention/2017/04/16/8e1f59c0-22a0-11e7-836b-e91b113bf060_story.html,"CAIRO — An Egyptian court on Saturday acquitted a U.S. charity worker who had spent almost three years in pretrial detention for her work with an organization helping street children.
Police arrested Aya Hijazi, her husband and six others in May 2014 on charges of abusing children in her care and engaging in human trafficking, kidnapping, sexual exploitation and torture.
Human rights groups said the charges were fabricated. Hijazi’s detention came as part of a broader crackdown that has neutered independent civil society in Egypt.
The acquittal comes about two weeks after President Trump met Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi in Washington, the strongman's first visit to the United States since he came to power in a 2013 military coup.
With visit by Egypt’s Sissi, Trump administration signals sharp policy shift
On Saturday, the Cairo Criminal Court dropped all charges against Hijazi and her co-defendants and ordered their release. As Judge Mohamed el-Feqqi read his verdict aloud, the courtroom erupted. Dressed in white prison uniforms, Hijazi and her husband, Mohammed Hassanein, embraced inside the defendants’ cage as friends and family cried, cheered and chanted for joy.
“They were singing, ‘The sun of freedom has risen,’ ” said Tarek Hussein, an activist who attended the hearing.
Hijazi, an Egyptian American, and Hassanein, an Egyptian citizen, are co-founders of the Belady Foundation, which provided services for Cairo street children. Police raided the organization’s premises in May 2014, also detaining a cook, an artist who shared the premises and the children present at the time.
A forensic report by the public prosecutor later found no evidence that any of the foundation’s children had been sexually abused.
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and several U.S. lawmakers had spoken out about the case.
My sister has been jailed in Egypt for 900 days. When will the U.S. help free her?
Lawyers said Saturday that the state's witnesses had offered contradictory and inadequate evidence against the defendants. ""Even the child and his mother testified at court in defense of Aya and the others,"" said Taher Abol Nasr, Hijazi's attorney, referring to a child whom state prosecutors alleged the group had kidnapped.
Tens of thousands of Egyptians have been detained by security forces or have disappeared since Sissi led a putsch against Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in summer 2013.
State officials depict the crackdown as part of a war against Islamist extremists who threaten to destroy the country. Human rights groups and activists say the dragnet has extended to dissidents of all political persuasions.
The Trump administration has proposed massive cuts to U.S. foreign aid, but the White House has said it expects that the $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid to Egypt will continue.
""You have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me,"" Trump told Sissi during their meeting at the Oval Office.
State Department’s 28 percent cuts hit foreign aid, U.N. and climate change
Nongovernmental organizations in Egypt have faced growing pressure since late 2011, when authorities raided 17 pro-democracy and rights groups, accusing them of joining an international conspiracy against the country.
During Sissi’s presidency, that pressure has accelerated, and representatives of many of the country’s leading human rights groups have been arrested, subjected to travel bans or had their assets frozen.
""Aya Hijazi, her husband, and their colleagues are finally free, but the system that subjected them to a travesty of justice for nearly three years remains unchanged,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
Shouting above the din from his courtroom cage Saturday, Hassanein vowed to continue their charity work. ""We promised the children they won't return to the streets again, and this promise was hindered for three years. We will return and meet that promise,"" he said.

8J4A6NTW6M_AZ1OM567AXAWDES,Jan. 6 rioter got his sentence thrown out. Then his prison time doubled.,Rachel Weiner,"January 25, 2024 at 2:32 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/25/jan-6-sentence-misdemeanor/,"James Little successfully argued that his punishment for joining the pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol was illegal. His reward: 60 more days behind bars.
In a scathing statement from the bench, Judge Royce C. Lamberth said Thursday that he was worried about “further danger to our country” because of Little and others’ “shameless attempts ... to misinterpret or misrepresent what happened” on Jan. 6, 2021. While his audience was Little, a 53-year-old North Carolina truck driver, the judge also alluded to comments made by Republican lawmakers, including what he called a “preposterous” statement from Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) calling Jan. 6 defendants “hostages.”
“I have been shocked to watch some public figures try to rewrite history,” Lamberth said. “It’s up to the court to tell the truth. I hope a little truth will go a long way.”
Little was first sentenced by Lamberth in early 2022 to 60 days in prison and three years of probation after pleading guilty to illegally parading at the Capitol. But Little’s public defenders argued prison time and probation can’t be combined for a single “petty” misdemeanor charge. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed.
Read the judge's opinion
When the ruling came down in August, Little had already served his time behind bars and about half his probation, so he asked to be set loose. Instead, Lamberth sentenced him anew to two more months in prison, saying Little had shown no remorse or respect for the criminal justice system since the riot.
“This is a matter of right versus wrong,” Lamberth said. “Mr. Little cannot bring himself to admit he did the wrong thing.” Little, appearing by video from his home in Claremont, N.C., shook his head and rolled his eyes as the judge spoke, occasionally muttering to himself.
A Reagan appointee, Lamberth said that defendants who refuse to accept responsibility are common. “But in my 37 years on the bench, I cannot recall a time when such meritless justifications of criminal activity have gone mainstream,” he said.
A probation officer wrote to the court that Little failed to perform required tasks and displayed an “inability to fully accept responsibility for his actions” and “behavior consistent with entitlement.” When reminded of the $500 restitution he owed, the officer said, “Mr. Little voices invalid excuses and circles the conversation back to how he feels his voice is being silenced.”
Joshua Carpenter, representing Little in court, said there were some “miscommunications” and his client has since put a check in the mail.
Since his first sentencing, prosecutors noted, Little had also used Facebook to falsely claim FBI involvement in the Jan. 6 attack, describe himself as a “political prisoner,” and compare himself to Vietnam veterans “shunned ... by armchair soldiers of family and ‘Friends’ who weren’t there.” He also promoted a campaign baselessly claiming Democrats will try to “rig” the 2024 election.
In his own brief comments, Little told the judge that “even though it’s my constitutional right,” he would not attend any more political rallies. “I’m a little scared to, honestly,” he said. “I’m getting too old for this stuff.”
Lamberth responded that Little “has a First Amendment right to believe the 2020 election was stolen; he has the right to express that view too.” But, he said, freedom of speech “does not give anyone ... the right to engage in riotous behavior at the U.S. Capitol.” He pointed out that thousands of Donald Trump supporters watched the former president speak on Jan. 6 and committed no crimes afterward.
He said misdemeanor defendants like Little must understand that they could not have entered the Capitol if other protesters had not assaulted police officers: “Not everyone present that day was violent, but violence is what let them into the Capitol.”
The judge expressed particular ire that Little had referred to Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, as a “fellow persecuted and prosecuted J6 Patriot” on Facebook. “I happen to be the judge who had Mr. Chansley’s case, and I know that he was neither persecuted nor prosecuted improperly or unlawfully,” Lamberth said. The judge had a similar reaction when Chansley himself tried to withdraw his guilty plea by citing snippets of video footage from the riot that had been played on Fox News.
“I have been dismayed to see distortions and outright falsehoods seep into the public consciousness,” Lamberth said Thursday.
Lamberth is one of the toughest sentencers in the D.C. federal court for Jan. 6 defendants, going above government sentencing recommendations more often than any judge other than the judge handling Trump’s case, Tanya S. Chutkan.
About five dozen other Jan. 6 defendants were given similar split sentences, but not all appealed them. Some have asked for and received early termination of their probation. A magistrate judge in the courthouse recently ruled that giving a harsher punishment after a sentence has been deemed illegal would be a violation of the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy.
Carpenter said in court he plans a second appeal for Little on that issue.
The report: The Jan. 6 committee released its final report, marking the culmination of an 18-month investigation into the violent insurrection. Read The Post’s analysis about the committee’s new findings and conclusions.
The final hearing: The House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol held its final public meeting where members referred four criminal charges against former president Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department. Here’s what the criminal referrals mean.
The riot: On Jan. 6, 2021, a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. Five people died on that day or in the immediate aftermath, and 140 police officers were assaulted.
Inside the siege: During the rampage, rioters came perilously close to penetrating the inner sanctums of the building while lawmakers were still there, including former vice president Mike Pence. The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and videos to create a video timeline of what happened on Jan. 6. Here’s what we know about what Trump did on Jan. 6."

The trucks were festooned with flags sharing the various slogans that Trump’s political efforts have accrued over the years: “Make America great again,” “Trump won,” FJB, that sort of thing.
The trucks were well-stocked with Trump gear, which must have been disappointing to the various vendors setting up nearby. A coterie of people was unloading vans and erecting tables to hawk hats, shirts, signs, bumper stickers and flags aimed at tapping into the microeconomy that springs up around Trump events like hippie capitalists outside a Grateful Dead show. But that disappointment would have been softened by simply looking across the street where a few dozen people were already lined up to enter that evening’s event.
It was 11 degrees according to a nearby sign, and no one standing outside for more than 30 seconds would have doubted it. That included the guy on the sidewalk in front of the arena, waving first a “TRUMP WON” sign and then “TRUMP 2024.” It included, too, the people already rifling through the vendors’ ubiquitously red Trump-stamped scarves and hats.
Get-out-the-vote weekend had begun.

This, also abbreviated as GOTV weekend, is the term of art for the Saturday and Sunday before an Election Day, two days on which campaigns can expect that more people will be home — and therefore reachable by phone or at their doors — and that more people will be free to volunteer to engage in those activities. These efforts are generally called “field,” the direct-voter outreach that research shows can have a significant effect on influencing voters to support a candidate or, by GOTV weekend, convince them to go vote.
Since 2016, I’ve gone to New Hampshire on the weekend before the primary to evaluate which campaigns were more successfully reaching out as voting loomed. In that first cycle, for example, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) organization and volunteer support stood out, as it did four years later. But during each visit, professional operations were fielding and dispatching volunteers (at varying scale, certainly) and volunteers — and the vestiges of their efforts — could be seen while exploring Manchester neighborhoods: people walking between doors or the door-hangers with polling-place information they were leaving on doorknobs.
This year, that was not the case.
There was a campaign effort in Manchester that reeked of professionalism and experience, one that was polished and bore the hallmarks of people who knew what they were doing. It was, as you probably predicted, that of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), long-shot challenger to President Biden.
That is a joke, of course, given the low familiarity Phillips has with Democrats around the country. But his campaign headquarters along Elm Street, downtown Manchester’s central thoroughfare, looked the way a Hollywood set designer might outfit such a facility: street-level space in a handsome bank building, walls covered with posters and Phillips (or, as the campaign’s marketing team seems to prefer, “Dean”) gear — including jerseys bearing his name — and lots of young people bustling around with laptops and coffee.
Just … not that many volunteers. When I came in on Saturday morning, two staffers told me that they were preparing for an event that day. (The communications staffer they’d suggested I email first told me that the campaign was going to be sending out volunteers to walk but later said that they weren’t.) I did meet one young volunteer making calls; she’d volunteered for Phillips’s congressional office over the summer.
Events like the one that Phillips ultimately held on Saturday are not generally considered particularly useful for turning people out on Election Day. Targeted voter contact lets you try to influence specific voters — like people who only vote about half the time but would vote for your candidate — allowing you to add votes to your total in small increments. That’s the goal: not to turn an imminent loss into a landslide but, instead, to give a slight edge of a few percentage points in a close contest. A big event, by contrast, is meant to generally get people excited about the candidate, including people who might come in from out of state or people who won’t end up voting.
The big event in Manchester this weekend was Trump’s Saturday rally at the Southern New Hampshire University Arena, a pure visibility/energizing push. It was disruptive, with a massive police presence that shut down a chunk of the downtown area for most of the day. But Trump’s campaign also had smaller events at its headquarters located a half-block from police headquarters, a facility much more modest than Phillips’s — but far more crowded.
I arrived there on Saturday morning shortly after House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) had finished speaking. Walked in the door toward the back of the one-story building and was immediately unable to make much forward progress. It was cold, remember, and no one seemed eager to leave the narrow hallway where a harried staffer attempted to direct people. I was directed into a smaller inner room where another staffer was training people to make phone calls over the din of conversations from the still-packed main space, the most prominent feature of which was a floor-to-ceiling painting of Donald Trump’s Truth Social avatar: a stern-looking Trump with an American flag superimposed on his face.
But the campaign was doing what campaigns should do on the weekend before an election: lure people in and get them to make calls. It’s not clear how many of the callers had been enticed by Stefanik’s visit or were simply regulars (the harried greeter at one point recognized a person he referred to as their “top greeter”) but the point remains: People were encouraged during the event to do voter contact and some actually were.
Many of those working there were from out of state, given the license plates in the parking lot and the constant mentions of nearby Massachusetts. There were young guys in suits and ties and at least one older woman in a fur jacket. When I first came in, I overheard a conversation about the frustrations of having to have a percentage of housing reserved for low-income tenants.
This diverged from the crowd lining up for the speech, which leaned much more heavily toward the working-class, heavily bearded end of the spectrum. Outside the headquarters were SUVs and sedans; the parking lots starting to fill up near the arena had more pickup trucks focused.
My approach to evaluating how each campaign was conducting its voter outreach the weekend before the election was to simulate being a willing volunteer, figuring out where campaigns were accepting people and then showing up. Of the seven campaigns that existed at the start of the weekend, only Phillips and Trump had obvious operations welcoming volunteers. I found Democrat Marianne Williamson’s headquarters, on an upper floor of a building around the corner from Trump’s, and was advised by a volunteer to come back after 10 a.m. At 10, the door was locked. I saw a sign for the longest of long-shots, Ryan Binkley, that asked people “Who is Ryan Binkley?” without providing a URL for his campaign, which about sums up his campaign.
The other major Republican candidates, though, were surprisingly hard to track down. I submitted a volunteer request through Ron DeSantis’s campaign website and through the site for the super PAC supporting his campaign that had coordinated much of the operational work; I never heard back from either for reasons that now seem obvious — the campaign would cease to exist soon after the inquiry.
My submission through Nikki Haley’s site garnered a response — a generic one, ignoring what I’d said I wanted to do and instead focused more heavily on contributing money. Unlike DeSantis (who spent part of the weekend campaigning in South Carolina before presumably catching a flight to Florida), I knew Haley was holding events in some smaller towns near Manchester. I drove to one, hoping to learn more from the campaign staff or hear the closing-hours pitch from the candidate.
The former U.N. ambassador was holding an afternoon event in the town hall of Peterborough, N.H., a remarkably picturesque town about an hour west of Manchester. There were a few Haley signs lining the sidewalk; the room where she spoke had about 100 in the audience with television cameras behind them. It was all well-engineered, one element of the churning machine that is running a presidential campaign. But it was an unrewarding journey — a Haley staffer (again harried) pointed me back to Manchester and sent my information to his higher-ups.
There was no obvious effort to shift those attending events into volunteers, as was done by Trump’s team. At her earlier event in Keene, N.H., Haley had appealed to the audience to engage by bringing 10 of their friends to the polls; this, it seems, was her GOTV appeal. It’s an appeal that is about as passive as you can get; a room of 100 people bringing 10 friends gives you at most 1,000 more votes. Who would? If you had to, could you find 10 friends or family members who didn’t support your candidate and get them to come out and vote?
Marcia Trudeau, 80 (or maybe 82, she said), is an example of why one might view Haley’s exhortation skeptically. A Democrat, she lives in Manchester with her husband and (Republican) daughter, Anne. The lawn outside their house had a small handmade sign that read “PLEASE VOTE.”
Marcia and Anne were at the door when I knocked on Sunday morning. I was spending some time in (similarly cold) weather knocking on the doors of regular primary voters to determine how much they’d heard from candidates. At many doors, no one answered. At some, I received a curt “not interested,” which is not uncommon.
The Trudeaus answered. At one point during our discussion (with Anne in the background), Marcia said she was frustrated that she would “never convince” her family to vote the way she wanted to.
Anne, who declined to give her age, offered frustration at the campaigning. Her family, she said, had heard from “all of them.”
“It’s, like, obnoxious, all the fliers — everything. It’s just too much,” Anne added. The outreach was more than in past years, she said, though with fewer people knocking on their door.
Michael Hickey, 52, lived nearby. A Republican, he agreed that there seemed to be more outreach — calls, mailings and fliers being left at doors — than in recent years.
“The mailings certainly are up,” he said. “The phone calls have increased, not exponentially but definitely increased.” There hadn’t been anyone at his door recently; the undisturbed-until-I-arrived snow on his steps reinforced that.
Hickey said he planned to vote for Haley but said he was “kind of half-in, half-out when it comes to politics.” I asked if the election seemed more or less important than ones in the past and he offered a bit of a shrug.
“I would say the same,” he said. “I don’t get too excited about negative news.”
There are two ways to consider the lack of campaigning in New Hampshire on the weekend before the primary.
One way is to wonder whether New Hampshire — or other — primary fights simply don’t work the way they used to. Trump is sui generis and perhaps non-replicable; something suggested by DeSantis’s efforts to run a similarly too-good-for-my-challengers campaign. But perhaps door-knocking and phone-calling don’t land the way they used to and one can simply win in New Hampshire without them.
The other way is to admit that the Republican primary was over before it began. Trump’s wide national lead trickles down into the state, and there was never much reason to think that he would be derailed any more than he had been at any other point over the past eight years. DeSantis saw the writing on the wall and withdrew on Sunday.
It’s very possible that Haley did, too. We’ll see if she outperforms expectations on Tuesday, though the lack of outreach on GOTV weekend doesn’t suggest that she’ll squeak by Trump by the percentage points that a good field operation can add.
While I was talking to voters on Sunday, the Trump campaign was again welcoming a big-name surrogate to its headquarters, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.). Trump was headed upstate for another big rally that night in Rochester, N.H. Donald Trump Jr. was scheduled to visit on Monday. Trump’s heavy footprint in the state is a reminder of his resources and (particularly compared with his odd presence in 2016) his political experience. He is the establishment candidate, carrying high-profile endorsements around in his pocket like so many nickels and dimes.
Maybe that’s the explanation: Well before New Hampshire began readying for its primary, the 2024 race was simply a battle between two incumbents.

8RLF58O1O6_GRP372ZF5CMG41E,More elite universities settle suit over alleged ‘price-fixing’ aid policies,Danielle Douglas-Gabriel,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/24/colleges-price-fixing-financial-aid-settlement/,"Nearly a half-dozen of the nation’s top universities have agreed to pay a total of $104.5 million to resolve claims that they conspired to limit financial aid for admitted students, according to a Tuesday court filing.
The settlements, which are pending a judge’s approval, arrive two years after eight former students filed a class-action lawsuit against 17 elite schools, including most members of the Ivy League. The students claim the colleges and universities used a shared methodology to calculate financial need in a way that reduces institutional dollars to students from working- and middle-class families — describing it as a “price-fixing cartel.” The schools have denied the charges.
In all, eight institutions have reached settlements in the case. The schools named in the lawsuit worked together in the 568 Presidents Group, a collection of highly selective institutions that collaborated on aid formulas. The group, which formed in the late 1990s, dissolved after the lawsuit was filed.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs estimate that approximately 200,000 students have been harmed by the financial aid practice in the past 20 years.
To resolve the charges, Columbia University and Duke University have each agreed to pay $24 million, while Yale University and Emory University will pay $18.5 million each. Brown University will pay $19.5 million to settle the case, according to court documents.
The universities say they did nothing wrong and insist the lawsuit is without merit. Settling the case, they say, allows the institutions to avoid further costly litigation.
“We are pleased the litigation is behind us,” Emory spokeswoman Laura Diamond said in an email. “Our focus has been and always will be to make an Emory education accessible to all talented students, regardless of their financial resources, and we look forward to continuing that mission.”
The proceeds from the settlements will be pooled to provide cash payments to the entire class of affected undergraduate students, not just those who attended the universities that have settled.
The lawsuit initially named 16 defendants: Yale, Columbia, Duke, Brown, Emory, Georgetown University, the California Institute of Technology, Northwestern University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Notre Dame, Rice University and the University of Chicago. Johns Hopkins University was later added.
In August, the University of Chicago became the first defendant in the lawsuit to settle, agreeing to pay $13.5 million. The university provided information, including documents and a witness interview, that attorneys for the plaintiffs said assisted in their cases against the other schools.
A month after the first agreement was announced, Emory struck a deal, according to its year-end financial statement. Rice followed suit in October, settling for nearly $33.8 million, according to university financial records. A court filing in November showed that Vanderbilt reached an agreement in principle to settle the case, but the document did not provide monetary details.
“Though we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit,” Vanderbilt officials said in the agreement, “we have reached a settlement in order to maintain our commitment to the privacy of our students and families and keep our focus on providing talented scholars from all social, cultural and economic backgrounds one of the world’s best undergraduate educations.”
Vanderbilt said it spent $366 million on financial aid last year. The school fully covers undergraduate tuition for nearly every family with an income of $150,000 or less, with a financial-aid program that meets 100 percent of every admitted student’s demonstrated need without loans.
A spokesperson for Rice declined to comment on the settlement.
“It is past time for the presidents and governing bodies of the remaining defendants to stand up and do the right thing for their students and alumni, and resolve the overcharges to middle-class and working-class students,” said Robert D. Gilbert, managing partner at Gilbert Litigators & Counselors, which is representing the former students along with the firms Freedman Normand Friedland and Berger Montague.
Nine defendants, including Georgetown and Johns Hopkins, remain. All of the schools named in the complaint have denied any wrongdoing and have tried unsuccessfully to have the case dismissed.
In July 2022, the Justice Department intervened in support of the former students and asked the judge to allow the case to continue. Court transcripts from July revealed that the Justice Department and the New York attorney general’s office have also launched an investigation, which they declined to discuss.
With the recent string of settlements, the remaining defendants could have to pay out far more money to resolve the case, said John Lopatka, a professor at Penn State Law. Parties in an antitrust conspiracy case, such as this lawsuit, face joint liability. If the remaining defendants move forward with a trial and lose, they will be on the hook for all of the damages minus the settlement amounts from the other schools, he said.
“There’s a whipsaw effect in antitrust law,” Lopatka said. “As defendants drop out and settle, there are fewer remaining defendants who potentially are going to be left holding the bag.”
James J. Rodgers, a partner at the law firm of Dilworth Paxson and chair of the firm’s antitrust practice group, said the raft of settlements could also encourage the plaintiffs to seek more money from the remaining schools.
“The plaintiff’s bar does play hardball in this area,” Rodgers said. “Unless one or more of the holdouts have some kind of particular facts that give them a mitigation, I would expect those numbers to climb.”
The class-action lawsuit stems from a 1994 federal antitrust exemption that let colleges collaborate on financial aid guidelines. The exemption applied only if schools engaged in “need-blind” admissions, accepting students without regard for their financial circumstances. Such policies are designed to increase economic and racial diversity at prestigious schools. Some colleges have boosted financial aid offerings — including promises to eliminate the need for loans — to recruit more low-income students.
But attorneys for the former students alleged in the lawsuit that at least nine universities — including Georgetown, Penn and Duke — maintained admissions policies that still favored or considered a student’s ’ ability to pay when admitting them to certain programs. All of that behavior, the plaintiffs say, violates the antitrust exemption, which expired in the fall of 2022.
The now-defunct website of the 568 Presidents Group said member institutions collaborated to maintain a financial-aid system that brought “greater clarity, simplicity, and equity to the process of assessing each family’s ability to pay for college.”
But the lawsuit claims the methodology the group contrived placed too much emphasis on an applicant’s ability to pay in calculating the net price — what students pay after taking grants, scholarships and tax credits into account. The schools that adopted the approach, the complaint argues, artificially inflated the net price of attendance for financial aid recipients for years."
8VPEW4JNTC_S1BE8HJBJNB7VNU,Doomsday Clock at 90 seconds to midnight amid nuclear and AI threats,Adela Suliman,"January 24, 2024 at 8:17 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/24/doomsday-clock-90-seconds-midnight/,"The world remains the closest it has ever been to the symbolic hour of the apocalypse, with the Doomsday Clock set once again to 90 seconds to “midnight” for 2024.
Wars in the Middle East, Ukraine, a spiraling climate crisis and the rise of artificial intelligence are among the threats continuing to put human existence under pressure, according to the people who run the clock.
The clock, which has been used for seven decades, was created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 amid Cold War nuclear tensions — and is seen as “a universally recognized indicator of the world’s vulnerability to global catastrophe caused by man-made technologies,” the group said Tuesday.
“Make no mistake: resetting the Clock at 90 seconds to midnight is not an indication that the world is stable. Quite the opposite,” CEO Rachel Bronson said in a statement, a year after Russia’s war in Ukraine drove the same dire forecast in 2023. “It’s urgent for governments and communities around the world to act.”
What is the Doomsday Clock? Here's what to know
The Chicago-based nonprofit focused this year in part on the rise of AI, saying in a statement that sophisticated chatbots such as ChatGPT “led some respected experts to express concern about existential risks arising from further rapid advancements in the field.” It called for greater global governance of what it termed a “disruptive technology.”
It also said AI had “great potential to magnify disinformation and corrupt the information environment on which democracy depends,” as well as exacerbate misinformation on topics such as nuclear risks, pandemics and climate change.
“Military uses of AI are accelerating,” it added. “Extensive use of AI is already occurring in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, simulation, and training. Of particular concern are lethal autonomous weapons, which identify and destroy targets without human intervention.”
ChatGPT maker OpenAI calls for AI regulation, warning of ‘existential risk’
Other threats cited by the atomic scientists include the deterioration of nuclear arms reduction agreements as well as wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. The Israel-Gaza war has left tens of thousands of people dead, according to authorities in both places, and the conflict threatens to spill over in the region.
The Earth also experienced its hottest year on record in 2023, along with devastating floods, wildfires, and extreme-weather impacting millions of people globally, it added, which contributed to its decision.
Former California governor and executive chair of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Jerry Brown, likens the situation to being on the ill-fated Titanic ship.
“Leaders are steering the world toward catastrophe — more nuclear bombs, vast carbon emissions, dangerous pathogens and artificial intelligence,” Brown said. “Only the big powers like China, America, and Russia can pull us back. Despite deep antagonisms, they must cooperate — or we are doomed.” The Bulletin makes the annual decision in consultation with its board of sponsors, which includes several Nobel Laureates.
The clock was set at two minutes to midnight in 2019 and at 100 seconds to midnight in 2022. It was the furthest from “midnight” in 1991, when it was wound back to 17 minutes after the Cold War was officially declared over.
Science educator Bill Nye, who took part in the 2024 announcement, said it was “time to act.”
“For decades, scientists have been warning us of the dangers facing humankind. We could be facing catastrophe unless we better manage the technologies we’ve created,” Nye said.
Some have criticized the clock as fearmongering or questioned its usefulness. In a 2015 essay, a University of Oxford researcher in global catastrophic risk cast doubt on the clock as a measurement of “actual risk,” writing that it was more a reflection of the “strong feeling of urgency” about the risks among the team who operate it.
The group said there was always hope to prevent despair. “The Clock could be turned back,” the Bulletin said. It added that it felt particularly “inspired — in seeing the younger generations leading the charge.”
“Everyone on Earth has an interest in reducing the likelihood of global catastrophe,” they added. The group also pointed at leaders from the United States, China and Russia as global powers to “take responsibility for the existential danger the world now faces. They have the capacity to pull the world back from the brink of catastrophe. They should do so, with clarity and courage, and without delay.”"
90CXA0RL9Q_9QWL58DKKMKAAFJ,"U.S., British forces strike new Houthi sites in Yemen",Missy Ryan,"January 22, 2024 at 7:27 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/22/us-britain-strike-yemen-houthis/,"The United States and Britain conducted a new round of strikes on Houthi targets Monday, U.S. officials said, intensifying Washington’s confrontation with the Yemeni militants whose maritime attacks have posed a threat to global commerce.
The strikes, which were conducted with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, struck eight targets in Yemen, including an underground storage facility and sites linked to missiles and aerial surveillance, the nations said in a joint statement released by the Pentagon.
“Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea,” the statement said. “But let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.”
It was the eighth round of strikes on Houthi targets by United States since Jan. 11, and the second involving Britain. It comes as the Biden administration confronts a proliferation of violence across the Middle East against the backdrop of Israel’s war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.
The latest round of strikes was significantly smaller than sprawling, initial salvo against the Houthis that struck dozens of targets late Jan. 11 and early Jan. 12, but marked one of the larger engagements since. On many days, U.S. military officials have said they hit a couple of missiles that were poised to be launched at vessels in the Red Sea.
The ongoing military action underscores the Biden administration’s concern about the chilling effect that a string of more than 30 Houthi attacks on commercial and naval ships in recent months — which the rebels have framed as a response to Israel’s treatment of Palestinians — has had on global shipping around the Arabian Peninsula.
While U.S. officials hope to keep the current operation limited in scope, the Houthis’ defiance and vow to seek revenge raises the specter of a prolonged military campaign that could mark a setback to Biden’s goal of refocusing U.S. foreign policy on Russia and China.
The confrontation with the United States has served to elevate the profile of the Houthi movement, which took over large areas of Yemen nearly a decade ago and subsequently defied a years-long bombing campaign by neighboring Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have long accused Iran of providing weapons and training to the Houthis.
The Biden administration has sought to portray its actions as backed by a broad international consensus, pointing to passage of a resolution condemning the Houthi attacks at the United Nations and a series of joint statements supported by an array of partner nations. But many of Washington’s closest Arab allies have not expressed support for the recent U.S. strikes, and only Britain so far has taken part in the military action.
The United States is also spearheading a separate coalition to patrol regional waterways, dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian, and is conducting operations attempting to interdict weapons smuggling.
A senior military official, who like other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation, said the administration was attempting to limit the scope of its targets to those related to the Houthis’ ability to continue their maritime attacks as part of their effort to avoid escalating the situation further. He described the latest strikes as “more of the same.”
The official said that between 25 and 30 munitions were used in the operation, which included strikes from air-based, surface and undersea assets. The vessels launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, while aircraft participating flew from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, the official said.
Pentagon officials, who spoke after the strikes were announced, described the action as “self-defense.” President Biden has faced criticism from some Democrats who say he should have sought approval from Congress before attacking the Houthis.
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

9BGAPE8V7S_HMP6NYS7O195B0Q,"As some Israeli troops leave Gaza, a long-term strategy remains elusive",Shira Rubin,"January 23, 2024 at 8:38 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/israel-military-gaza-strategy-hamas/,"TEL AVIV — With Israel’s army beginning to gradually pull out of Gaza, its gains against Hamas are significant but incomplete, Israeli military and security officials say, and are threatened by the lack of a postwar strategy.
Though intense ground fighting continues in Khan Younis and other parts of the southern Gaza Strip, the Israeli military says it is moving away from large-scale bombardments and transitioning to a more focused campaign of targeted raids and assassinations, aiming to eradicate Hamas’s military leadership.
The war has leveled much of the northern part of the Strip and killed more than 25,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says 70 percent of the dead are women and children.
The Washington Post spoke to seven current and former Israeli officials and reservists about the progress of the war in Gaza and its ultimate aims. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military strategy.
“The war has damaged Hamas as a terrorist entity, but this is not a three-month mission,” a military official said.
At least 9,000 militants have been killed so far, according to the Israel Defense Forces, fewer than a third of the 30,000 fighters Hamas is estimated to command. The head of Hamas, Yehiya Sinwar, and his top lieutenants remain at large. The militant group does not release figures for its war dead, but a Hamas official dismissed the Israeli numbers. “I believe the Israelis are trying to embellish their accomplishments,” he told The Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with rules set by the group.
Launches from Gaza of Hamas’s relatively long-range rockets, numbering in the thousands at the beginning of the war, have all but ceased. Israel says it has destroyed thousands of weapons stockpiles, rocket production sites and tunnel shafts over three months of door-to-door battles. But without a “day after” strategy, officials say, these achievements could be fleeting.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to insist that the total elimination of Hamas remains the goal of the war. “This is not just a matter of hitting Hamas, this is not another round with Hamas — this is a complete victory,” he said Thursday. From the start of the conflict, military leaders have held a more pragmatic view, believing that, under current conditions, the group can be degraded but not destroyed. As Israel begins to scale down its operations in Gaza, that unspoken tension is spilling into public view.
Gadi Eisenkot, a former top army leader whose son was killed in Gaza last month, accused Netanyahu in a recent interview of telling “tall tales” about the war.
“A strategic achievement was not reached,” Eisenkot said. “We did not demolish Hamas.”
Twenty-one Israeli soldiers were killed Monday when Hamas militants fired a projectile at a tank near two buildings being rigged for demolition, the IDF said, causing the explosives to detonate — the deadliest single incident for Israeli forces in Gaza. Since the war began, 217 soldiers have been killed.
Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists Tuesday that the number of troops and the intensity of fighting in Gaza will continue to fluctuate.
“More reservists will be required in all the combat arenas, and therefore the IDF is operating by both freeing up forces and focusing our activities,” he said.
Israeli officials would not disclose how many troops are still in Gaza and how many have withdrawn. At least three combat brigades remain on the ground, according to an IDF statement released earlier this month. The Golani Brigade, an elite infantry unit, pulled out from Shejaiya, in Gaza City, last month.
Some soldiers have been repositioned along the northern border with Lebanon, where the threat of a broader war looms; thousands more have returned home, to jobs and families, which the government hopes will help revive Israel’s war-battered economy.
On Lebanese border, Israelis fear a new kind of war with Hezbollah
The military official said the ground and air operation in Gaza has effectively dismantled the majority of Hamas’s five brigades — composed of 24 battalions, each with up to 1,400 fighters. More than 100 commanders have been killed, the official said.
Seventeen of the 24 Hamas battalions have been disabled, Israeli officials said, mostly in the central and northern parts of the enclave, to the point where they more closely resemble small bands of guerrillas as opposed to proper military units. But officials acknowledge that thousands of militants remain.
“It changes from a structure to a heap, but a heap can still fight you back,” said Brig. Gen. Assaf Orion, a reserve officer who was on active duty after the Hamas attacks. “This doesn’t mean that Hamas is dead, but they certainly can’t do what they did on Oct. 7.”
Hamas’s tunnel network has been found to be far more extensive than previous IDF estimates, spanning more than 300 miles in the south alone, according to the military official. More than 5,600 tunnel shafts have been discovered by the IDF, according to a former security official briefed on the intelligence, and many have been destroyed. But the scope of the subterranean network, built covertly over many years, means it is unlikely to be fully dismantled.
The majority of Israeli assassinations in Gaza have targeted low-to-mid-ranking Hamas members — part of a strategy to strip the group of a “critical mass” of fighters, the former security official said.
Israel’s military “has become static,” he said, tasked with maintaining control over pacified areas rather than trying to gain more ground.
In Gaza’s north and center, the pace of war has slowed enough for some Palestinians to venture back to their devastated neighborhoods, though rebuilding is a distant hope. In the south, more than 1 million displaced people are huddled together near the Egyptian border. Disease is spreading, aid groups warn, and more than 90 percent of Gazans don’t have enough to eat.
War in Gaza is making childbirth a nightmare
Yet small cells of Hamas fighters, hiding in tunnels and the ruins of buildings, remain a lethal threat. After a barrage of rockets was fired from the enclave last week toward the southern city of Netivot, Israeli troops were able to swiftly surround the launch site in central Gaza and kill numerous fighters, according to a military official familiar with the operation — foreshadowing the kind of targeted raids and strikes that are likely to characterize the next phase of the war.
But how Israel can keep a weakened Hamas from rebuilding is an open, and vexing, question for military leaders. The entity that ultimately governs Gaza — whether the Palestinian Authority, as the United States advocates, or an international force, an idea that some Israeli officials have floated — will determine whether IDF troops can operate from permanent positions inside the enclave or respond from bases just across the border.
Remaining inside would amount to reoccupying Gaza, a goal supported by far-right politicians but fiercely opposed by Washington and by most Israelis, polls show. A long-term security presence, which would keep Israel responsible for Palestinian civilians and expose troops to constant threats, was dismissed as a “nightmare scenario” by most of the security establishment, according to the military source.
“We would be sitting ducks,” he said.
Operating from outside the Strip would be possible in practice but would require a security partnership with the ruling authorities, similar to Israel’s agreement with the Palestinian Authority in parts of the occupied West Bank.
“Mowing the grass” — the term for Israel’s past strategy of establishing temporary deterrence by reducing, but not eliminating, the capabilities of Palestinian militant groups — tends to become more hazardous over time, Orion said. He cited IDF raids in the West Bank, which have grown increasingly deadly for both sides over the past year as weapons have flowed into Palestinian refugee camps and armed resistance has surged.
“You see mowing the grass in the West Bank has become more demanding and more kinetic,” he said. “Gaza is a much higher level of challenge.”
Who will run Gaza after the war? U.S. searches for best of bad options.
Without a concerted international effort to limit the power of Hamas in postwar Gaza, the former Israeli security official said, the risk of its fighters regrouping will remain ever present.
“Hamas’s military, not its political elements, have been dealt with efficiently so far. But what will happen now in Gaza, and how Hamas will now react politically and militarily — how Hamas will revitalize its forces is yet to be seen,” he said.
Other critical security questions loom: Israeli military officials say keeping Hamas from rearming with outside weapons will require securing the Rafah crossing on the Gaza-Egypt border. Egyptian officials are already pushing back against an Israeli plan to maintain control over a buffer zone along the border, where smuggling tunnels have proliferated in the past.
There is also the pressing issue of the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza. Relatives of the hostages set up camp over the weekend outside Netanyahu’s private home, calling on the government to do anything necessary to secure their release. Last month, the IDF mistakenly killed three Israelis who escaped from their captors.
“If the state of Israel abandons its hostages,” then the 1,200 soldiers and citizens murdered on Oct. 7 “will have died in vain,” Hen Avigdori posted Sunday on X, formerly Twitter. His wife and 12-year-old daughter were held in Gaza for nearly two months before being released during a short-lived humanitarian pause in late November.
“There is no victory without the return of the hostages,” he wrote.
Hendrix reported from Jerusalem. Sarah Dadouch in Beirut contributed to this report.
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

9GXFC6TXHJ_D26HQKW5AGZM9SX,"Opinion The Republican primary is over. Get ready for the long, grim rematch.",Karen Tumulty,"January 23, 2024 at 10:55 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/23/biden-trump-2024-rematch-after-new-hampshire/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Shortly after the New Hampshire primary was called for Donald Trump on Tuesday night, his last remaining Republican opponent put on a brave face and stepped to the stage of a hotel ballroom filled with her disappointed supporters.
“This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go, and the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina,” declared Nikki Haley, who served as the Palmetto State’s governor for six years before being chosen by Trump to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations.
But it’s time for the rest of us to quit pretending. With Trump’s solid win here, the primary season is effectively over. A humiliation in South Carolina awaits Haley, unless she decides to end her campaign before its Feb. 24 primary.
What that means is that the battle is now between the former president and the current one — a rematch of two unpopular, geriatric men whom most Americans have said they do not want.
But Trump is indeed the opponent President Biden was hoping for. His campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, quickly put out a statement that said in part: “Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election-denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party.”
The slog between now and November will be long and grim and bitter. Add to that the unprecedented situation in which a major-party nominee is battling 91 criminal charges.
As former New Hampshire Republican chairwoman Jennifer Horn put it at an election-eve roundtable hosted by Bloomberg News, the election season that lies ahead will be “record anxiety-inducing for American citizens throughout the entire thing.”
There were only 22 delegates at stake in New Hampshire. But as the primaries move forward, Haley is not likely to find an environment more welcoming than the Granite State, where those who register as “undeclared” can vote in either party’s primary. Exit polls indicated that 65 percent of these independents voted for Haley; 74 percent of registered Republicans voted for Trump.
New Hampshire’s GOP primary electorate, which was poised to set a new turnout record, was also less tethered to the MAGA movement than the voters who participated in Iowa’s Republican caucuses last week.
Preliminary exit polls indicated that New Hampshire Republican voters were about evenly split on the question of whether Biden was legitimately elected or won by fraud; by comparison, two-thirds of Iowans surveyed as they entered the Republican caucuses said Biden did not win legitimately. In New Hampshire, only about half of Republican voters said they would consider Trump fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime; in Iowa, about two-thirds said so.
Normally, things don’t come to such an early end in a primary season in which there is not an incumbent president on the ballot.
But although only two small states have voted, Trump’s domination of the Republican Party appears complete. Its establishment has rapidly closed ranks behind him — something that would have been hard to imagine in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who were trying to overturn his reelection defeat.
Despite Biden’s sagging approval numbers, many Republicans fear that what they are signing up for is an electoral disaster, given that they lost not only the White House but also the House and the Senate on Trump’s watch. Yet Haley’s efforts to portray herself as a more electable alternative did little to shake Trump’s grip on his devoted followers.
Now, his campaign is eager to assert the prerogatives that come with his status as the presumptive nominee. It plans  to move quickly to take control of the national and state party machinery and to consolidate fundraising muscle.
Don’t expect Trump to follow the traditional playbook for  candidates who are moving from a primary to a general election footing and looking to broaden their appeal. Trump will not be toning down his belligerent, base-pleasing message of grievance and retribution as he turns his fire on Biden exclusively. Any repositioning is “not going to be so much a pivot as it is a slight turn,” one of his top advisers told me.
No, this is not the election that America wants. But given the ragged state of our politics, this looks like the best we are capable of coming up with."
9KE6XBY3R8_V8WJ48QIHOYC4XS,"Why do dogs wag their tails? Humans liked the rhythm, study suggests.",Kyle Melnick,"January 22, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/01/22/dog-tail-wagging-research-domestication/,"Taylor Hersh was watching a YouTube video of wolves a few years ago when the animal researcher noticed something curious. The wolves hardly wagged their tails.
It was a stark difference to the frequent wagging she saw in most pet dogs, which made her curious about what had changed in the roughly 35,000 years since dogs were domesticated from wolves.
Hersh and a team of European researchers began a study in hopes of answering one question: Why do dogs wag their tails?
Last week, the researchers released their findings: Humans likely altered dogs’ tail wagging without realizing it, researchers said in the Biology Letters journal.
The findings could flip the long-held belief that dogs are wagging their tails because they’re happy. Instead, Hersh and her colleagues suggest that dog tail-wags made people happy, so humans tended to select for that trait when welcoming dog ancestors into their lives and breeding the animal.
Tail-wagging is rhythmic, and previous studies have found that rhythms — everything from music to the sound of pounding horse hoofs — trigger brain activity that helps make people feel joyful. Humans, even subconsciously, might have enjoyed the rhythm of dogs wagging their tails, researchers said.
“They look almost like a metronome — tick tick tick tick tick,” Hersh, who was a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands during the study, told The Washington Post.
Since people associated dogs’ swishy tails with the animals being cheerful, it’s also possible that more tail-wagging dogs were selected as pets, researchers found. The owners might’ve assumed the movement meant the furry creature was friendly.
“We don’t have a time machine to go back and look at … what did we want out of dogs?” Hersh said. But, she added, “we can try to do the best we can with modern dogs and modern humans to try and reconstruct that evolutionary path.”
In February 2022, Hersh and her colleagues began studying dog behavior. Scientists have found that dozens of dogs’ traits and behaviors changed during domestication, including the appearance of their fur, ears, body size — and even their ability to make “puppy-dog eyes.”
But Hersh said researchers couldn’t find a clear answer from previous studies about why dogs wag the body part that extends from their spines. They pored over dozens of past studies on dogs’ evolution in an attempt to understand the movement.
One study found that dogs began wagging their tails more than wolves when they were as young as three weeks old. Another study found that dogs wag their tails faster and more often than other canines. Further research indicated that dogs use their tails to try to express their emotions to people.
Then Hersh read an American Scientist magazine article about a study observing domesticated silver foxes. The research found that foxes selected for tameness and friendliness ultimately wagged their tails more often than other foxes. The same must’ve been the case for dogs, she recalled thinking.
The authors of Wednesday’s paper said more research is needed to confirm their theories. Hersh, who’s now a researcher at Oregon State University, said she hopes to examine dogs’ brains, heart rates and other vitals to understand what the animals think and feel while wagging their tails.
The research can also shed light on what humans thought and preferred tens of thousands of years ago, according to researcher Andrea Ravignani, a co-author of Hersh’s study.
“It is a bit like finding prehistorical cave paintings from Homo sapiens or Neanderthals, which indirectly tell us that back then our ancestors enjoyed art or had symbolic reasoning,” Ravignani said in a statement to The Post. “In our case, what we know about how modern dogs wag their tails tells us that perhaps our ancestors 35,000 years ago already perceived the rhythmicity.”"
9KZUZPJ61F_Z5XB00U1T32RRTI,Man convicted of murder after killing woman who entered wrong driveway,Anumita Kaur,"January 23, 2024 at 9:39 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/23/kaylin-gillis-shooting-murder-kevin-monahan/,"A man who killed a 20-year-old woman in a car that mistakenly pulled into his driveway last year was convicted of second-degree murder Tuesday.
Kevin Monahan fatally shot Kaylin Gillis on April 15 after she and her friends accidentally pulled into his driveway in Upstate New York while looking for a friend’s house, The Washington Post reported at the time.
A jury found Monahan, 66, guilty of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment in the first-degree, according to Washington County District Attorney Tony Jordan, who prosecuted the case.
Prosecutors are seeking the maximum sentence for the murder conviction, which is 25 years to life. Sentencing is scheduled for March 1.
“Today was an important day for the Gillis family to have some sense of justice for Kaylin and for the kids who had to witness this horrible incident and try to save their friend and then endure the aftermath,” Jordan wrote in an email Tuesday evening. “It is our hope that today provides some closure to this phase of their recovery.”
Monahan’s defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.
Gillis and three others were driving around Hebron, a small town northeast of Albany, that Saturday night when they mistakenly drove onto Monahan’s driveway, authorities said. The friends quickly “realized their mistake” and began to back out of the driveway, Washington County Sheriff Jeffrey J. Murphy said in a news conference.
“They’re young adults, they were in the area looking for a friend’s house, it’s a very rural area with dirt roads, it’s easy to get lost, they drove up this driveway for a very short time, realized their mistake and were leaving when Mr. Monahan came out and fired two shots,” Murphy said.
One of those shots hit Gillis.
Gillis’s friends drove about five miles south to the town of Salem, where they were able to call 911. Emergency responders tried to save Gillis, but she was pronounced dead at the scene, according to authorities.
The killing was a part of a spate of incidents in the United States last spring, in which people were shot at after mistakenly approaching someone they did not know.
Two days before Gillis was killed, Ralph Yarl, a Black 16-year-old boy, was shot and injured in Kansas City, Mo., when he went to the wrong house to pick up his siblings. Andrew Lester, an 84-year-old White man, was charged with felony assault and armed criminal action. He pleaded not guilty.
Also on April 15, a man in South Florida shot the car of a 19-year-old delivery driver and his girlfriend when they accidentally drove onto his property.
And days after Gillis was killed, two cheerleaders were shot in Elgin, Tex. after one mistakenly got in the wrong car in a grocery story parking lot.
The string of incidents reinvigorated discussion about gun violence in the United States, where 18,854 people were killed by guns last year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Experts attributed the violence last spring to “a cocktail of factors” including the accessibility of guns, the way firearms are marketed for self-defense and “a growing sense among Americans, particularly Republicans, that safety in their backyard is deteriorating,” The Post reported.
Gillis, a graduate of Schuylerville Central School who loved animals and had a talent for art, “lit up any room she was in,” her obituary said. Before her death, she was looking forward to starting college in Florida to pursue her dream of becoming a marine biologist, said an update from her family.
“She was just beginning to find her way in the world with kindness, humor, and love,” the family wrote."
9TLLBA2BIO_VJ2H9OVWB1M06WL,Arena Stage’s ‘Mindplay’ tries to get inside your head,Thomas Floyd,"January 24, 2024 at 5:59 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2024/01/25/mindplay-review-arena-stage-vinny-deponto/,"Vinny DePonto’s affinity for analog is readily apparent throughout “Mindplay,” the mentalist’s spotty but ultimately enthralling feat of mind-probing prowess now at Arena Stage. A rotary phone rings to open the show, egging on an unsuspecting audience member to step onstage and answer. A slide projector offers an unlikely insight into another patron’s memory. And DePonto uses a cassette player to broadcast some of his own (not so) guarded anxieties.
That motif is fitting for a solo show — created and performed by DePonto and first staged in the fall of 2022 at Los Angeles’s Geffen Playhouse — about inspecting and understanding the mind’s wiring. In Arena Stage’s intimate Kogod Cradle, DePonto crosses audience-assisted exercises in mental trickery with a contemplative narrative about unraveling his own angst. While there were a couple of stumbles in the mind-cracking at Tuesday’s opening-night performance, and DePonto’s memory-piercing introspection doesn’t fully coalesce, “Mindplay” brings enough “How did he do that?” wonder to delight all the same.
Setting the stage for this exploration of how memories are formed, retained and compromised, DePonto welcomes his audience with a pointed prompt: “What’s on your mind?” In addition to being emblazoned across the stage curtain, the words appear on envelopes containing a card for theatergoers to fill out and drop in a fish bowl DePonto draws from throughout the show. (The performer takes a warm approach to patrons’ participation, but if you’re truly petrified of being called upon, just don’t submit your answer — or catch any objects floated into the audience.)
As DePonto clarifies off the bat, “Mindplay” is “unaided” — meaning that there are no actors or plants hidden among the crowd, and that the wire running up his neck is just a microphone and not an information-feeding earpiece. But DePonto does get a theatrical assist from Sibyl Wickersheimer’s set, which transforms from a lightly furnished office to an expansive maze of memory-unlocking safe-deposit boxes. With the help of Pablo Santiago’s dazzling lighting and Everett Elton Bradman’s crisp sound design, the interactive set becomes increasingly sentient, while splitting the difference between unnerving and amusing.
DePonto repeatedly impresses by plucking people from the audience, examining their minds via a couple of innocuous questions and revealing their thoughts with uncanny accuracy. Taking inspiration from Solomon Shereshevsky, a vaudevillian artist renowned for his powers of recollection, he rattles off entertaining mnemonic devices and uses a “memory palace” technique to recite Shakespeare on demand. And DePonto strikes a poignant chord when relaying the show’s emotional through line, of how the memory loss suffered by his grandparents drove him to sharpen his mind, even if those scripted segments feel out of tune with the performance’s more improvisatory elements.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
Under Andrew Neisler’s direction, DePonto also charms while weaving topical jabs at Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Elon Musk with dashes of quick wit and self-deprecation. (“Dating me sucks,” he quips after exposing one theatergoer’s subconscious.) Although his tricks tend to be more cerebral and less illusional, DePonto does deliver a few mesmerizing bits of stage magic — including one particularly head-spinning stunt toward the end of the performance.
DePonto (who co-wrote the show with Josh Koenigsberg) casually drops the most profound observation early on, when he sarcastically assures those fearful of his techniques that they can always step out early and return to an outside world free of such mental manipulation — alluding, of course, to the effects of advertising and other forces on our day-to-day decisions. For an intellectually driven magician, it’s fitting that the secret to his most telling moment is a simple truth.
Mindplay, created and performed by Vinny DePonto, written by DePonto and Josh Koenigsberg. Directed by Andrew Neisler. Set, Sibyl Wickersheimer; lighting, Pablo Santiago; sound, Everett Elton Bradman. About 90 minutes. Through March 3 at Arena Stage, 1101 Sixth St. SW. arenastage.org."
A4WAML9DRS_ONP3E3NKCEDOHS8,"No, office mandates don’t help companies make more money, study finds",Danielle Abril,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/24/return-to-office-mandates-company-performance/,"After more than a year of trying and failing to get its more than 5,000 workers to return to the office on a hybrid schedule, Internet Brands took a different approach.
The WebMD parent created a video in which its CEO and some of its executives addressed employees, strongly encouraging them to return to the office. The lighthearted song “Iko Iko” plays in the background, and at one point, executives dance in a montage to the tune.
“We’re not asking or negotiating at this point. We’re informing,” Bob Brisco, chief executive of Internet Brands, says in the video published in early January.
Some who saw the video on social media described it as bizarre and even cringeworthy. The company later pulled it from its public Vimeo account, but only after it went viral.
How’s the return to office going at your workplace? Drop us a line.
Almost four years since the coronavirus pandemic sent people to work from home in record numbers, U.S. employers are still struggling to get people back to the office. The power struggle between employees pushing for flexibility and employers trying to reel workers back has manifested in employee walkouts, corporate threats and even mass resignations. Now, new research from the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh suggests that office mandates may not help companies’ financial performances, but they can make workers less satisfied with their jobs and work-life balance.
The Internet Brands incident is the latest example of companies insisting that workers are more productive and employers more successful when workers are together at an office.
“We will not get back to the time when as many people will be happy working from the office the way they were before the pandemic,” said Mark Ma, co-author of the study and associate professor at the Katz Graduate School of Business. Additionally, mandates make workers less happy, therefore less productive and more likely to look for a new job, he said.
The study analyzed a sample of Standard & Poor’s 500 firms to explore the effects of office mandates, including average change in quarterly results and company stock price. Those results were compared with changes at companies without office mandates. The outcome showed the mandates made no difference. Firms with mandates did not experience financial boosts compared with those without. The sample covered 457 firms and 4,455 quarterly observations between June 2019 and January 2023.
Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that over the past year, as more companies have debuted or doubled down on mandates, the number of people working from the office hasn’t changed much. About 78 percent of workers ages 16 and older worked entirely on-site in December 2023, down from 81 percent a year earlier. Of course, some professions like tech workers, who often have more flexible work schedules, have much lower averages, with only 34 percent working entirely on-site last month compared with 38 percent last year.
“There are compliance issues universally,” said Prithwiraj Choudhury, a Harvard Business School professor who studies remote work. “Some companies are issuing veiled threats about promotions and salary increases … which is unfortunate because this is your talent pool, your most valuable resource.”
Still, some companies are going all in on mandates, reminding workers and sometimes threatening promotions and job security for noncompliance. Leaders are unlikely to backtrack on mandates once they have been implemented because that could be viewed as admitting they made a mistake, said Ma.
Goldman Sachs, one of the first companies to implement a five-day return to the office policy in June 2021, reminded workers who weren’t in compliance about the company’s mandate in August. Managers have discretion to include compliance in workers’ performance reviews, a company spokesperson said.
Workers know what’s expected of them, and that four days a week, office occupancy is back to pre-pandemic levels, the spokesperson said. It’s still working on improving Friday attendance. While some workers have publicly said the mandate is one reason for leaving the company, Goldman Sachs said it hasn’t caused attrition and plans to push ahead. Employees can ask for flexibility on a case-by-case basis with their managers, it said.
Other companies are still getting pushback. AT&T, for example, mandated more than 60,000 managers to return to offices on a hybrid basis starting in July as it consolidates its nationwide presence into nine core offices for managers.
Several AT&T workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said that the company’s move seemed aggressive. Two workers said the company didn’t offer relocation benefits even though some offices near workers were closing. It also asked workers who were remote pre-pandemic or were hired as permanent remote employees to work from the office, they said.
“It’s been hard for people,” said a West Coast AT&T worker. “I know a lot of folks who are just waiting to be laid off [as a result].”
Another AT&T worker said his office is overcrowded, and after commuting at least an hour to badge in, he’s sometimes turned back home due to space limitations.
“Because of what I perceive as hostile treatment of employees, it really feels like a push for attrition,” he said, adding that some workers feel less loyal to the company’s success. “I think they want people to leave so they can save on severance and unemployment.”
The atmosphere at the company is unhappy, another worker said. “People that I’ve witnessed to be top employees are just leaving because they can’t comply without uprooting their families or incurring huge expenses to comply with the mandate,” he said.
AT&T said relocation assistance is being offered based on a “common set of criteria.” However, during a virtual town hall Q&A session on Monday, chief technology officer Jeremy Legg told the technical services division that assistance is only being offered to a “small percentage” of workers, according to a recording of the meeting.
“I don’t expect everyone to like this,” Legg said about the mandate at the town hall. “It doesn’t surprise me that there are people that are upset.”
Employees are paying close attention to enforcement and looming threats of consequences.
Google workers who are part of the Alphabet Workers Union say that they don’t see widespread consequences for people who aren’t following the company’s three-day office policy that was implemented in 2022. Instead, they say it seems to be dependent on the discretion of the manager and department. However, if employees see compliance play a big role in annual reviews in February, the issue could quickly become a priority, union workers said.
Last summer, Google began enforcing its policy more strictly, including tracking badge swipes and suggesting that compliance would be part of performance reviews. Noncompliance could negatively affect a part of workers’ reviews called “teamwork attributes,” which covers topics such as collaboration and fostering inclusion and belonging, said Google spokesperson Ryan Lamont. That could ultimately play a role in the overall rating, which affects promotions and pay increases.
Rather than grappling with mandates as a means of boosting productivity, companies should instead focus on structuring their policies on a team basis, said Choudhury of Harvard. That means not only understanding the frequency and venue in which teams would be most productive in-person, but also ensuring that in-person days are structured for more collaboration. Requiring employees to work in-office to boost productivity in general has yet to prove itself out, he added.
“Return-to-office is just a knee-jerk reaction trying to make the world go back to where it was instead of recognizing this as a point for fundamental transformation,” he said. “I call them return-to-the-past mandates.”

A68ODMKBBJ_4V15DEJYTFTDUBS,Can Haley be like Ike? New Hampshire’s primacy began with 1952 upsets.,_,"January 23, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-1952-eisenhower-kefauver/,"In attempting an upset win against the Republican front-runner in Tuesday’s New Hampshire first-in-the-nation presidential primary, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is trying to be like Ike.
In the 1952 primary, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower began his climb to the presidency by topping “Mr. Republican,” Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio, a son of President William Howard Taft. Eisenhower’s victory and the surprise win by Democratic Sen. Estes Kefauver (Tenn.) over President Harry S. Truman that same day put New Hampshire’s primary on the map as a significant presidential contest.
After finishing third in last week’s Iowa caucuses, far behind a dominant Donald Trump and just behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley trails the former president in polling in New Hampshire. But recent surveys show her gaining ground there. A win or even a close finish would rattle the race for the Republican nomination.
Meanwhile, President Biden — like Truman initially — didn’t put his name on the New Hampshire Democratic ballot. He will run instead in the first official Democratic primary in South Carolina on Feb. 3, following a push by the party to elevate the more racially diverse state. But Biden backers are pressing a write-in vote for the president in New Hampshire, which could be an early indicator of voters’ support for Biden.
How Jimmy Carter put the Iowa caucuses on the political map
It all bears a strong resemblance to 1952. Eisenhower was in Europe as the NATO commander. Truman, who was pondering a third term at age 67, dismissed that year’s 13 primaries as meaningless “eyewash,” given that nominations had previously been secured at party conventions. He told reporters: “If I want to be nominated, I don’t have to go into any primary.”
But when backers moved to put him on the New Hampshire ballot, the president allowed it. “Before he consented to do so,” columnist Stewart Alsop wrote, “Truman was promised that he would win hands down, and that Kefauver would be taught a lesson.”
Kefauver, who had gained national fame leading televised Senate hearings on organized crime, saw an opportunity. Often wearing a coonskin cap like Tennessee hero Davy Crockett, the 48-year-old Kefauver jumped in with a personalized, handshaking campaign that has become the dominant style in the New Hampshire primary to this day.
In Plymouth, N.H., the tall, folksy senator “tossed snowballs at a GOP elephant, patted babies on the head and passed out copies of his books today in a good-humored door-to-door quest for Democratic presidential votes,” the Associated Press reported. Kefauver and his wife, Nancy, crisscrossed snowy New Hampshire in a borrowed Chevrolet sedan.
In Portsmouth, he walked into a gas station to shake hands with the attendant putting gas into a car. “Glad to meet’cha,” said the attendant, who then did a double take, the Portsmouth Herald reported. “‘Did’ja see that?’ he asked the driver of the car, ‘That was Senator Kefauver, the guy that was on TV. See him over there with the felt hat?”’ Truman didn’t campaign and often was at his vacation home in Key West, Fla.
Eisenhower, 61, got into the race following efforts by both Democrats and Republicans to “draft Ike.” In early January, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge (R-Mass.) announced that the general would run on the GOP ballot. Lodge said Eisenhower was in the presidential race “to the finish,” the New York Times reported under the headline, “Sure General Is A Republican.”
Eisenhower refused to leave his military duties to campaign, so backers launched a series of rallies. Leading the way were Lodge and New Hampshire Gov. Sherman Adams, “famous as the only governor who skis to his capitol office,” the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported.

More than 1,000 people turned out at the Sweeney American Legion Post in Manchester, N.H., to dance to a band and sing Irving Berlin’s song “I Like Ike.” A featured guest was the “strikingly attractive” movie star Jinx Falkenburg, the Boston Globe reported. “Falkenburg, her jeweled necklace flashing, a bright corsage heightening her lilac gown, thrilled the crowd by reading from John Gunther’s book on Eisenhower the letter Ike had written had the invasion of Normandy failed.”
Marty Snyder, Eisenhower’s World War II mess hall sergeant, was a frequent speaker. Snyder told a story of struggling to milk a cow French villagers had given Eisenhower when he heard a voice saying, “Marty, let me show you.” It was the general, once a Kansas farm boy, who “pulled up a three legged stool,” the AP reported, and “in short order had a full pail.”
Taft was the “biggest rock” facing the Ike supporters, an AP reporter in Concord wrote.
“In a word, the Republican sentiment for Taft is wide and deep at the grassroots level,” the reporter wrote. “People up here like him, and they feel they understand him. By contrast, they say, they do not know where Eisenhower stands on domestic issues or whether he is their kind of Republican.”
The 62-year-old Taft was the champion of conservative Republicans. With Truman down in the polls as the Korean War dragged on, the Ohioan was seen as having a good shot to defeat the president. But the senator had two failed presidential bids, and Eisenhower supporters pressed the theme on signs and fliers that read “Taft Can’t Win.” Lodge cited Ike’s military strength: “He stands between us and World War Three.”
As the March 11 primary neared, the general moved ahead in the polls. So Taft mounted a last-minute campaign motorcade through the Granite State. “He rode in a big cream-colored Lincoln sedan with a sign ‘Bob Taft Is Here’ on both bumpers,” the Washington Star reported. In speeches, he called for less government and less foreign involvement.
“The indefatigable Mr. Taft, nattily if conservatively attired, has made an impression during a three-day tour” that “included twenty speeches,” the New York Times reported. His campaign manager predicted victory.
Then the voting began. “Not until the full count was in today did the political bigwigs of both parties realize the staggering effect of the victories by Gen. Eisenhower and Senator Kefauver,” the Boston Globe reported. Two weeks later, Truman deviated from his prepared speech at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Washington to read a handwritten note stating, “I shall not be a candidate for reelection. I have served my country long, and I think efficiently and honestly. I shall not accept a renomination.”
After his win, Eisenhower, who had just returned from a secret military meeting in Germany, told reporters at the Paris airport, “Any American who is honored by so many Americans considering him for the presidency should be proud, or, by golly, he is no American.” In June, the five-star general retired and returned to campaign in the remaining primaries.
Eisenhower and Taft traded primary wins heading into the Chicago convention, where Republicans nominated Eisenhower on the first ballot. Kefauver lost the Democratic nomination to Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson, who was backed by Truman. Eisenhower, who picked Richard M. Nixon as his running mate, routed Stevenson in the 1952 election and again in 1956.
It all began in January 1952, when Eisenhower gave mixed marching orders to his New Hampshire primary organizers. He still refused to “seek nomination to a political office,” he wrote them from Paris, but he would honor “a clear-cut call to duty.”

Coren,"January 23, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/23/rest-day-climate-change-green-sabbath/,"Every Friday around sunset, I close my laptop. For 24 hours, my work is done. No email. No news. No social media. If it’s work-related, it waits.
What I try to do is — nothing at all. Or, rather, I spend time with people I love, usually outdoors. I swim or surf. I share a meal with friends and family. Sometimes, I just lie on my back in the park enjoying the sun.
It has rekindled a sense of joy I last felt when I was a kid with nothing to do, and gratitude for whatever miraculous series of events led me here to this moment.
For years, this one-day pause seemed untenable. For many, it’s virtually impossible to set aside an entire day for rest free from responsibilities to work and family.
But on the verge of burnout a few years ago, I began to practice a Sabbath. Giving myself permission to stop doing was hard. My brain betrayed my intentions, unconsciously leading me to flick open my phone, check work emails or scurry ahead to a Monday that hadn’t yet begun. Disconnecting took practice, and still does.
But as the weeks rolled on, I discovered a freedom I hadn’t known I’d lost. My Sabbath jolted me out of a daze.
For millennia, religions have regarded this ritual rest as a spiritual necessity. Yet clergy are now arguing that this practice, whether in a secular or religious context, can help redirect the world’s societies away from catastrophic climate change. In their view, it’s as essential to the future as any clean-energy technology or electric vehicle.
A shared day of rest, at a minimum, might slow the pace of consumption, curb emissions or ease the burden of so many people working weary weekends. But slowing down, even for a day, may also be at the heart of a cultural change convincing society that a more sustainable way of life is not only good for the planet, but also good for them.
Here’s how a green Sabbath may be the right idea for one’s soul, and the world.
The modern weekend is a recent invention. Established in the 1930s, it was the armistice between unions fighting for more time off and employers, who finally recognized that enshrining a two-day rest was better than enduring mass absenteeism during “St. Monday,” workers’ unofficial holiday after Sunday’s excesses.
But the human yearning for a weekly respite dates back at least 2,600 years. The concept appears in Christianity and Islam, both of which set aside weekly days for ritual, as well as Buddhism’s uposatha days and Japan’s roku sainichi, among others.
The first reference to mandated rest, however, probably appears in the Torah, where ancient Israelites were commanded to cease their toil from Friday evening until Saturday at sunset, a period known as Shabbat in the Jewish calendar, according to Jonathan Schorsch, a professor of Jewish religious and intellectual history at Germany’s University of Potsdam. This commandment led to interpretations banning no less than 39 types of work, among them sowing, baking, lighting a fire, sewing two stitches — and tearing to sew two stitches.
The ancient Israelites’ prohibitions were not a random assortment of activities, or a call for asceticism. It was the embodiment of a simple commandment holy enough to earn its place among the Top 10: Leave the world as you find it by keeping the Sabbath.
This period, says Abraham Joshua Heschel in his classic 1951 book, “The Sabbath,” is the “great cathedral” of Judaism, a temple built in time. “Technical civilization is the product of labor, of man’s exertion of power for the sake of gain, for the sake of producing goods,” Heschel writes. “... The Sabbath is the day on which we learn the art of surpassing civilization.”
Pope Francis argued much the same about Christianity’s Sunday in his 2015 “Laudato Si’,” an encyclical about caring for the natural world. Not resting is not just bad for the soul, he says, but it’s also bad for the Earth. The constant drive to produce and consume more is squandering natural resources, and it prevents us from treating the living world, and one another, with dignity and respect. The Sabbath forces us to consider how we spend all our days.
“Sunday, like the Jewish Sabbath, is meant to be a day which heals our relationships with God, with ourselves, with others and with the world,” Francis writes. “... We tend to demean contemplative rest as something unproductive and unnecessary, but this is to do away with the very thing which is most important about work: its meaning.”
For Rabbi Laura Bellows of Dayenu, an organization mobilizing the United States’ Jewish community to confront the climate crisis, the Sabbath has been essential to doing this work for the past 20 years. From Friday night until Saturday, she says she deliberately shuts off phones, email and screens, and avoids driving. Then she dedicates herself to connecting with things that give her and her community joy or pleasure in some way: being outdoors, singing, sharing a meal, attending synagogue and simply gathering with those she loves.
“Shabbat is one of the most radical things you could do,” says Bellows, who credits the ritual for avoiding burnout. “One of the reasons we have a climate crisis right now is a product of disconnection, the result of undervaluing life, especially nonhuman life. Shabbat is a time of remembering we’re not machines; we get to be human with all other life. That kind of connection is what powers environmental and climate movements.”
This kind of rest from work was once the law.
Sunday restrictions were once common across the United States. Sometimes known as “blue laws,” they prohibited things such as selling liquor, hunting and opening shops. Intended in part to encourage Sunday church attendance, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1884 that these also served a vital social mission to “protect all persons from the physical and moral debasement which comes from uninterrupted labor, … especially to the poor and dependent, to the laborers in our factories and workshops and in the heated rooms of our cities.” The decision was reaffirmed by the court in decisions during the 1960s: “Sunday is a day apart from all others,” wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren in one.
Over time, however, this rationale has fallen out of favor. Although some counties still mandate some businesses stay closed on Sunday, and 28 U.S. states still restrict some alcohol sales that day, many of these “obsolete and nonsensical” laws, as one American University legal scholar put it in 2022, have been repealed or struck down.
That’s not just because of the decline of religiosity in America. “The primary motivation has been economic,” writes political scientist Sara Zeigler. “With increased competition and people on the move around the clock, many businesses cannot afford to lose a full day’s revenues by remaining closed on Sunday.”
The concept has always been a demanding “time experiment,” argues Schorsch, even for the ancient Israelites. The practice was ridiculed from the start: Prominent Romans mocked Jews for “shameful sloth” on their Sabbath. And it demanded precious time away from fields and labor. One day was set aside each week for rest, and a sabbatical year every seven years meant sowing was forbidden and the fields lay fallow. After 49 years, a Jubilee year, as described in the Torah, meant all enslaved people to be freed, debts forgiven and lands returned to ancestral owners, a societal reset leveling out socioeconomic inequalities. (Historians question whether the Jubilee year was fully practiced, but evidence exists of kings issuing similar proclamations around 2,000 years ago.)
A universal period of rest and reset has reemerged again and again as a way to deliver a more just world. “It is a hard ask, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a worthy ask,” says Schorsch, who is advocating to bring it back.
In 2019, Schorsch founded the Green Sabbath Project to incite a “mass movement to observe a weekly day of rest” for the secular and religious alike. This is not a spa day, but a modern version of what the ancients practiced: avoiding work in factories and offices, or even in front of our laptops; opting out of driving or flying, or using engines of any kind for the day; putting off shopping; preparing food in advance; and ceasing incessant doing.
The immediate effect among millions of people, he calculates, could dial back emissions for at least one day a week with no new technology or spending. But the practice of doing nothing, he argues, can make people change the way they live year-round, by appealing to an ancient human ritual, rather than reason or even religion.
Schorsch, of course, is asking a lot, more than most might appear willing to do. It’s far from assured that emissions will fall as he predicts. But spiritual practices can explode into mainstream culture with profound consequences. Look at yoga. In the 1950s, the meditative practice from India was virtually unknown among Americans. By 2017, roughly 33 million adults were practicing it in the United States, or about 14 percent of that population, becoming firmly embedded in American medical, fitness and spiritual practices.
Nor is a day of rest an all-or-nothing proposition. Many are taking incremental steps toward an ancient wisdom, by observing a technology Shabbat, eschewing screens for 24 hours. Mexico City and Bogotá, Colombia, are handing over their streets to bicyclists and pedestrians every Sunday. In Bergen County, N.J., a Zip code boasting more retail sales than any other in the United States thanks to its four massive malls, residents have reaffirmed Sunday laws banning many retail sales, on the grounds of a healthier community.
Schorsch is now hoping to find more communities willing to undertake this radical experiment in time together. “Ultimately, as a society, we’re going to need to have ecological practices,” he says. “It’s not enough to impose laws. Do we solve [climate change] through technocratic solutions and policy, or do we solve it through new cultural, even spiritual approaches? One without the other is not going to be enough.”
There’s no right way to practice a day of rest. Mine is by no means perfect. My to-do list sneaks up on me. I fight the gravitational pull of notifications and alerts. I sometimes miss my deadline of Friday at sunset. But I find the rewards keep growing. Along the way, I’ve learned a few tricks to keep responsibilities and demands at bay, if only for a day.
I’ve found keeping a day of rest surprisingly difficult to do. But, for me, it seems to help make everything else possible, including writing a weekly column about what to do about our overheating planet."
AHDQKHBLM2_2W74VGKQRUM8QQH,Minn. trooper charged with murder in shooting of driver Ricky Cobb,Praveena Somasundaram,"January 24, 2024 at 9:22 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/24/minnesota-trooper-charged-ricky-cobb-shooting/,"A Minnesota state trooper who fatally shot a 33-year-old Black man after he took his foot off the brake during a July traffic stop has been charged with murder, officials said Wednesday.
Trooper Ryan Londregan, 27, is facing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, first-degree assault and second-degree manslaughter, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a news conference. During the shooting, which killed Ricky T. Cobb II, a reasonable threat “did not exist” before Londregan opened fire, Moriarty said. Her office’s decision to file the criminal charges comes after the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension finished its investigation of the incident in September.
Cobb’s killing sparked outrage from his family and community leaders, who called for Londregan and the two other state troopers who were on the scene to be fired. Londregan is the only trooper facing charges in the case, but all three are on paid leave, the Minnesota State Patrol said in a statement.
Christopher Madel, Londregan’s attorney, criticized the charges in a video statement released Wednesday in which he called his client a “hero.”
“Open season on law enforcement must end, and it’s going to end with this case,” Madel said.
Cobb, of St. Cloud, had been pulled over in Minneapolis at about 2 a.m. on July 31 for driving without his lights, officials said. One of the troopers at the scene said they learned Cobb was wanted for “violation of a protective order” in another county, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday.
Police shootings database: Search by race, age and department
The troopers asked Cobb to get out of his silver Ford Fusion, telling him they would explain why once he exited the vehicle, according to the complaint. Cobb stayed in the car, asking whether there was a warrant for his arrest, to which the trooper replied that there was no warrant but that he would “explain it all out when you get out of the car,” the complaint stated.
During the roughly one-minute exchange, Cobb kept his hands off the steering wheel and his car was in park, according to the complaint. Cobb repeatedly questioned why the troopers were asking him to exit his car before Londregan opened the passenger-side door and another trooper started to open the driver-side door, body-camera footage shows. At that time, Cobb shifted to drive and took his foot off the brake, the complaint stated.
The vehicle then briefly moved forward, according to footage from a trooper’s dash cam. Londregan drew his firearm, yelling, “Get out of the car now!” and then shot twice, hitting Cobb’s torso, according to the complaint. After Londregan fired the shots, he and the trooper next to the driver’s side door lost their footing as Cobb’s car continued moving forward, later hitting a concrete median a quarter-mile down the road.
Officials released body-camera video from the traffic stop in early August. At the time, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said a handgun was found in the back of Cobb’s car, but video did not show him holding it at any point during the exchange with the troopers.
Cobb’s mother, Nyra Fields-Miller, said after officials announced the charges against Londregan that her son was “defenseless” when he was shot.
“Nothing can ever make up for that,” Fields-Miller said in a statement. “But today’s decision is the first step toward closure and justice.”
During the news conference Wednesday, Moriarty, the county attorney, said state troopers are trained to carry out traffic stops safely. Troopers are only permitted to use deadly force when there is a threat of great bodily harm or death, she said, adding that this was not the case during Cobb’s traffic stop.
Col. Matt Langer, chief of the Minnesota State Patrol, described the case as a “sad situation for everyone involved.”
“We acknowledge the deep loss felt by Mr. Cobb’s family and friends,” Langer said in a statement. “We also recognize the gravity of this situation for the State Patrol and our troopers tasked with making difficult split-second decisions.”

AL7HW4I6E9_FQC0L218OO95V2D,Biden campaign to open office near White House,Tyler Pager,"January 26, 2024 at 11:59 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/biden-campaign-washington-office/,"President Biden’s reelection effort is opening an office near the White House as a workspace for recently departed presidential aides and a staging ground for campaign officials who have been traveling regularly to the White House from Delaware, according to three people familiar with the plans.
The office, which will be funded by the Democratic National Committee, will serve as a home base for Mike Donilon, who is leaving the White House to serve as the Biden campaign’s chief strategist, and an occasional office for Jen O’Malley Dillon, who is leaving the White House to become campaign chair. Other top campaign aides will use the site when they travel to Washington to meet with Biden and other White House officials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that are not yet public.
The creation of what is in essence a way station between the White House and the Wilmington, Del.-based campaign highlights Biden’s decision to keep most of his top aides with him at the White House, where they work on politics in their free time. It comes after Biden dispatched O’Malley Dillon and Donilon, two of his closest advisers, to the campaign earlier this week, nearly nine months after launching his reelection bid.
Top Biden aides to leave White House for reelection campaign
Allies of the president, including former president Barack Obama, had raised concerns about the structure of Biden’s campaign, in which Biden kept his closest aides at the White House and did not fully empower his campaign operation in Wilmington. The reassignment of Donilon and O’Malley Dillon aims to change that, but the creation of the new office suggests they often will not be far away.
Donilon and O’Malley Dillon are expected to move to the campaign full time early next month. O’Malley Dillon plans to commute weekly from Washington to Wilmington, Del., and spend most of the workweek at campaign headquarters, the officials said.
In addition, top campaign advisers — including campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks, deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty and communications director Michael Tyler — have been making regular trips to Washington for White House meetings with the president and others. The office will provide them a staging ground for those meetings, so they do not have to wait in the White House lobby or at nearby coffee shops, the people said.
A spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment.
Biden, Trump pivot to general election contest many voters dread
O’Malley Dillon ran Biden’s general election campaign in 2020 and has been a principal architect of the president’s reelection effort while serving as Biden’s deputy chief of staff in the White House. Donilon, who has worked for Biden for decades, oversaw Biden’s message and strategy in the 2020 campaign and has replicated that role at the White House.
Chavez Rodriguez, who is based full time in Wilmington, will remain the campaign manager.
Biden wanted his campaign to be headquartered in his hometown of Wilmington, even though some campaign officials worried about creating two unequal power centers as most of Biden’s top aides stay in Washington. It is traditional for presidents to locate their reelection headquarters outside Washington — Obama’s was in Chicago — to signal to voters that they remain in touch with the people and have not been captured by the nation’s capital.
The opening of the Biden campaign’s Washington office, however, reflects the reality that many of the president’s top aides remain in Washington and continue to work for the White House, using their free time to work on the campaign. Federal law prohibits using federal resources or workspaces for campaign work, and Biden’s aides have been holding regular meetings in the White House residence, where political business can be conducted. The new office will provide a place for these aides when they work on Biden’s reelection.
That group includes Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, Communications Director Ben LaBolt, Political Director Emmy Ruiz and senior White House advisers Anita Dunn, Steve Ricchetti, Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini."
ALFZLL1RF2_QKD6PGF9N54513S,They were ready to give up on Israel. Now they’re all in.,Steve Hendrix,"January 22, 2024 at 1:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/22/israel-pro-war-liberals-gaza/,"TEL AVIV — Last summer, the Shapiros gave Israel a deadline. If the right-wing government continued its push to take power from the courts — a campaign that the couple believed put democracy, women’s rights and LGBTQ+ progress in jeopardy — they would leave.
“We said, ‘Let’s give it six months,’” recalled Hanna Shapiro, a 35-year-old graphic designer. She protested the government almost weekly, pushing the strollers of two boys she didn’t want serving in the army of a country they saw drifting from their ideals of equity and justice.
Then came Oct. 7, when Hamas-led fighters streamed out of Gaza to rampage through Israeli communities. Authorities say they killed about 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, and kidnapped about 240 more.
Now, as the Israel Defense Forces devastate Gaza, rockets fly overhead and war looms in Lebanon, the Shapiros say they can no longer imagine living anywhere else.
“I feel more Israeli than ever,” said Shapiro, who immigrated here from Paris a decade ago. “Last year, I thought I don’t need to be Israeli; I can just be a Jewish woman somewhere in the world living my life.
“Now, I can’t pretend that I’m not part of these people.”
For thousands of liberal Israelis, Oct. 7 spurred an impulse not to flee, but to double down on a nation they had feared was heading toward autocracy and theocracy. Many Israelis overseas hurried home. Military reservists who had been boycotting their training raced back to their units. Democracy activists retooled the movement into a vast civil volunteer network.
Some of the progressive, secular, cosmopolitan Israelis who agonized over a political arena that ranged from right to far right are now describing themselves for the first time as Zionists, centering the country’s founding role as a global haven for Jews rather than its current positioning as a creative high-tech hub.
“Jewish people in Israel are dying for Jewish people in the rest of the world to have a Plan B one day,” Shapiro said. “We have to be here.”
A former Israeli hostage fears for the women she left behind in Gaza
After a year in which leaders warned of civil war, Israelis across the political spectrum have quickly unified around an external enemy. Two-thirds of Israelis back the military goal of eliminating Hamas, polls show. That support has barely wavered in the face of growing international condemnation — much of it from the left — of the deaths of more than 25,000 people in Gaza in Israel’s war on Hamas, most of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
Support for the war isn’t unanimous. Some 2,000 Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel marched through Tel Aviv last week to demand an end to the fighting. A typical sign: “Only peace will bring security.” Speakers included three survivors of Oct. 7.
Paradoxically in a time of war and danger, many liberals now report feeling better about Israel, at least for now. The percentage of left-wing Israelis who feel optimistic about the future nearly doubled in the weeks after Oct. 7, from 21 to 41 percent, according to the Israel Democracy Institute.
The pivot has been driven by familiar factors, sociologists said, including the initial rally-around-the-flag effect that all countries experience during war. But the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust tapped into deep cultural memories, even among secular Israelis, of pogroms and exile going back millennia.
Many have said their sense of welcome outside Israel has been challenged by a disorienting rise in antisemitism in places they had happily grown up, studied, worked, found community and sometimes marched for liberal causes. Videos of Israelis murdered and mutilated focused the sense of vulnerability — and identity — even among secular Israelis in ways that textbooks and grandparents’ stories never did.
“They became Jews overnight,” said Eva Illouz, a professor of sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “Suddenly, they get it. They feel themselves the object of world hatred.”
Asaf Ben-Haim, a 37-year-old doctoral student in archaeology in Jerusalem, grew up in central Israel hearing his Hungarian grandmother talk of fleeing the Nazis and his Iraqi grandfather of being chased out of Baghdad’s Jewish quarter.
They seldom went 10 minutes, he said, without referencing “the miracle of Israel.” But the concept of Israel as sanctuary didn’t fully register, as he enjoyed his progressive, cosmopolitan life: coming out as gay in the country’s open-minded middle class; living in San Francisco for three years while his husband studied at Stanford.
The couple returned in 2021 — in time to join last year’s protests against judicial overhaul. They decided on “red lines” that might send them back overseas: tilting the selection process for Supreme Court justices; rolling back gay rights.
He might be miserable living away from Israel, Ben-Haim thought, but at least he’d be free. He was among the first army reservists to declare a boycott on training until the government backed down.
But Oct. 7 brought his grandparents’ warnings to life. He was back in uniform within weeks.
The shock of the Hamas attack, he said, was followed by equally alarming aftershocks: Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank cheering the killing of Jews; the refusal of some of his own liberal allies to condemn the attacks.
He remembers statements by fellow academics that glossed over evidence of rape and torture. When he saw Black Lives Matter posts on Oct. 11 that featured a hang glider, one of the devices Hamas used to attack Israeli neighborhoods, labeled “I stand with Palestine,” he thought of the BLM shirt in his closet and the marches for racial justice he’d joined in California.
“It should be easy to say both that the occupation [of Palestinian territories] is bad and Hamas did horrible things,” he said. “They do not contradict each other.”
Shai Rapoport, 33, moved to London almost four years ago to study art. He felt at home in London’s cultural mix, and joined fellow expats protesting the Israeli government. After Oct. 7, he said, he felt a chill from his liberal and Muslim friends. Then outright hostility.
Now he’s moving back to Israel, wars and all. “I felt that people who were once my friends have become my aggressors,” he said from London. “Here, I feel terribly alone.”
Criticism of Israel has grown with new images daily of bloodied children and broken rubble in Gaza, where an estimated two-thirds of buildings are believed to have been destroyed or damaged. Women and children account for 70 percent of the dead, according to Gaza health officials, in a campaign that military analysts say has been one of the most destructive in modern history.
Each of the liberal Israelis interviewed for this article said they deplored the killing of so many Palestinian civilians. Each said they still supported the goal of an independent Palestinian state if it can exist without threatening Israeli lives — a view that three-quarters of left-leaning Israelis continue to share. But all said they could not think of an alternative to all-out war against militants who have embedded themselves in the civilian population and pledge to attack again.
“I think the massacre of October 7th has created a very simple mentality: It’s either them or us,” Illouz said.
But for those who logged hours protesting the government, newfound dedication to Israel doesn’t equal support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his coalition. In this, it is the larger public that has swung their way: More than two-thirds of all Israelis now say that they want Netanyahu out of office.
Politics are slowly coming back. The frequent rallies pushing for the release of hostages have been joined in recent weeks by demonstrations against Netanyahu.
Shapiro has filled her free time in the past three months at hostage protests and volunteering for the civil society groups that grew out of the democracy movement. She raises money and visits the family members of hostages and soldiers and Israelis displaced from the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, where the risk of war with Hezbollah militants is heating up.
She remembers the anguish she and her husband felt last year, fearing that the Israel they loved was morphing into something they couldn’t endure, that they “would be nomads, like Jewish people always have been.”
Now, despite the chaos, the contradictions, the danger — “My biggest fear is really Hezbollah” — all thoughts of leaving Israel are gone.
“It’s a crazy place to be,” she said. “But it isn’t just my community anymore. It’s my family.”
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

It’s clear that abortion will help define the 2024 political cycle, with Democrats running on the issue — and some Republicans running from it.
Think of the past week as the starting line.
On Wednesday, Senate Democrats held an event where they vowed to fight antiabortion legislation. On Thursday, House Republicans passed a bill to strengthen funding for crisis pregnancy centers, which steer women away from abortions. On the National Mall on Friday, demonstrators at the March for Life called for new limits on abortion pills and urged skeptics to rally behind Trump, who delivered key wins to the antiabortion movement during his four years in office.
And today, President Biden and his team are announcing a slew of new actions intended to ensure access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortions at hospitals, seizing on the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade — the landmark Supreme Court ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion before it was struck down in 2022.

One of today’s efforts — ramping up enforcement of the federal emergency-care law — is of particular interest to me and my colleague Caroline Kitchener, as we’ve written several stories about how the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, is playing into abortion fights.
The Biden administration has said the law requires hospitals to provide emergency abortions nationwide, including in the 21 states where the procedure is limited or banned. Republicans have challenged that interpretation; the Supreme Court will hear the issue later this year.
That clash between the federal and state bans has left patients and doctors caught in the middle. Caroline and I wrote last year about how physicians were begging for guidance from their hospitals about how to navigate the dueling laws, fearful of punishment and unsure how to proceed.
But how EMTALA is actually playing out for abortion has been fairly secretive. It’s unclear how many patients have actually filed complaints about denied abortions — or how aggressively the Biden administration has followed through on its vow to enforce the law. Officials have declined repeated questions citing the confidential nature of their investigations and the ongoing litigation headed to the Supreme Court.
The Biden administration has publicly announced only one case, involving a patient who had sought care in Missouri and Kansas, where it determined that hospitals had violated the law in denying an abortion. Caroline and I wrote last week about abortion rights advocates’ frustration that the federal government didn’t punish an Oklahoma hospital that turned away a woman seeking an emergency abortion.
After following up with women in high-profile abortion cases and digging through federal databases, we were able to find — and have federal officials confirm — that two hospitals in Florida were also penalized for turning away a woman seeking an abortion.
White House officials have yet to provide key details about the EMTALA initiative being announced Monday. But a top official suggested it would address some of the outstanding questions around the Biden administration’s use of the law — namely, more emphasis on getting patients to file complaints, more encouragement for physicians and more enforcement.
“This new public education effort will include the launch of new, accessible and understandable resources about a patient’s right to care under EMTALA, as well as training materials for health-care providers,” Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House Gender Policy Council, told reporters last week.
Klein added that federal health officials were creating a “dedicated team of experts” who would help ensure that hospitals and health workers comply with EMTALA “so that every patient receives the emergency medical care that is required by federal law.”
Elephants never forget. But does Trump? — The former president last week again proclaimed that he “aced” a cognitive test in the White House by identifying animals such as a giraffe, tiger and whale.
Just one problem: The test never had that grouping of animals, its creator told Dan and Ashley Parker. (The test never featured a whale at all.)
Trump’s continued focus on his results from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or MoCA, has been a source of public amusement and derision. For instance, the former president bragged on Fox News in 2020 that he did “amazing” on the test, claiming he was asked to repeat back a sequence of words to his doctor: “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.”
It’s perplexed physicians who say Trump is distorting a test intended to measure whether a patient has cognitive impairment. And it’s led to misleading media coverage about the MoCA, said Ziad Nasreddine, the Canadian neurologist who invented the test.
In an interview, Nasreddine walked through the test’s design, including the years of research that went into the selection of questions and its intent to assess different parts of the brain.
For instance, the test always includes one animal that is fairly well-known and easily identified, such as a lion, and other animals that are less well-known and harder to pronounce, such as a rhinoceros. Other parts of the test, which gauge skills such as concentration and calculation, are harder. And it would never have related words such as “camera” and “TV,” Nasreddine said.
Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley escalated her attacks on Trump’s mental fitness over the weekend after he appeared to confuse her with former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, The Post’s Dylan Wells reports.
“Don’t be surprised if you have someone that is 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That’s just human nature,” Haley said yesterday on “Face the Nation.” “I don’t know what happened, but it’s enough to send us a warning sign.”
Trump, 77, made the mix-up during a campaign speech on Friday night, where he repeatedly accused Haley of failing to provide proper security during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He also reiterated a claim that he offered to deploy 10,000 troops to quell the crisis, which has been debunked in Congress.
More from Dylan:
Nikki Haley continues to hammer Trump’s mental fitness, saying “when you’re 80, that’s what happens. You’re just not as sharp as you used to be…We need to know that the person that’s going to be in this office has the stamina to be at the top of their game.” pic.twitter.com/HA4OcJvqA7
📅 Welcome back! The Senate is in session this week, while the House has skipped town for a 10-day break.
On tap today: Vice President Harris will kick off a multistate reproductive rights tour with a visit to the battleground state of Wisconsin, where she is expected to criticize a proposal by state Republicans to ban abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy.
And at the White House, President Biden will convene the fourth meeting of his Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, where he will be joined by several physicians who have practiced in states with abortion bans.
On Tuesday: Voters will hit the polls in New Hampshire for the first primary election of the 2024 presidential cycle. We’re watching the Republican match, which will test Trump’s front-runner status in a state where he is most vulnerable and Haley is strongest.
Meanwhile, in Virginia, Biden and Harris will make their first joint campaign appearance of the year at a rally focused on reproductive heath issues. They will be joined by first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff.
On Thursday: The Senate Special Committee on Aging will hold a hearing on assisted-living facilities in response to a Post investigation that found nearly 100 people have died after wandering away from the facilities since 2018.

AM8SPR0442_QSPCLECNOPZVHCZ,Murder charges filed against Illinois man accused of killing wife and 3 adult daughters,_,"January 23, 2024 at 6:15 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/01/23/shooting-domestic-police-illinois-family-tinley-park/67b8a60e-ba17-11ee-b176-fe5fd794e716_story.html,"TINLEY PARK, Ill. — Murder charges were filed Tuesday against a suburban Chicago man accused of killing his wife and three adult daughters in what police have described as a domestic-related shooting.
Maher Kassem, 63, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and made his first court appearance Tuesday. Police allege he shot four family members after an argument at their home Sunday morning in Tinley Park, which is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Chicago.
Killed in the shooting were Majeda Kassem, 53; twins Halema and Zahia Kassem, both 25; and Hanan Kassem, 24. The couple also had two adult sons, including one who also lived at the home.
“Words can’t describe how deeply saddened I am at this horrible tragedy,” Mayor Michael Glotz said in a statement Tuesday. “A mother and her three daughters are gone, murdered in an act of senseless domestic violence.”
Funeral services were held Tuesday at a mosque while friends held an online memorial fundraiser to build a mosque in honor of the women. The family is of Palestinian descent and Muslim.
A day earlier, mourners arranged flowers upright in the snow outside the home and left small stuffed animals. Friends and neighbors noted Majeda Kassem’s passion for cooking and how all three daughters were intelligent devoted students.
Samah Qasmieh, a Chicago State University professor, taught Halema, who was a third year student.
“I just envision her in her bedroom studying for the exam they have Tuesday, doing nothing wrong at all,” Qasmieh told The Chicago Sun-Times as she stopped by the home Monday to pay respects.
In court, prosecutors said the argument was about money and the couple’s 19-year-old son, who was unharmed, was home and witnessed some of the events unfold. He went downstairs when he heard arguing, according to prosecutors.
The daughters were each shot in the head, while their mother was shot more about half a dozen times, according to prosecutors.
A judge ordered Maher Kassem remained detained until his next court hearing set for Feb. 16, calling him a safety risk to his son and the public.
“If he gets his hands on a gun again there’s no telling who he might shoot,” Cook County Judge Linzey Jones said.
Kassem’s attorney, Daniel Johnson with the Cook County public defender’s office, had requested Kassem be confined to his home and placed on electronic monitoring, according to The Chicago Tribune. Johnson did not immediately return a message Tuesday from The Associated Press seeking additional comment.
Authorities allege Maher Kassem called police and said someone had been shot at the home. Officers arriving at the home found the four deceased women in the home’s lower level. Police took Kassem, who was not injured, into custody shortly after and recovered a gun believed to have been used in the shooting.
Prosecutors allege Kassem made comments to police implicating himself in the shooting, including, “I’m going to jail.”
Tinley Park police called it the deadliest shooting in the village of about 55,000 people since 2008 when five women were killed at a Lane Bryant clothing store at a strip mall in the suburb. The murders remained unsolved."
AOL5M6ZPJZ_AJ44G36F324M21W,"A Local Life: Ross Merrill, 67: Painter and National Gallery’s chief of conservation",Matt Schudel,"February 7, 2011 at 8:49 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/national-gallerys-chief-conservator-began-as-artist/2011/02/05/AB3kZ5E_story.html,"Ross Merrill never set out to be one of the world’s great art conservators. Instead, he set out to be one of the world’s great painters.
He began painting as a child in Texas, where he developed a love of the outdoors that would remain an important part of his life and his art. He had a natural flair for landscapes, which he preferred to paint “en plein air,” or outdoors among the elements.
Over the years, Mr. Merrill had a steady career as an artist and painting teacher, but his early dreams of being the next Vincent Van Gogh or Edward Hopper never quite worked out.
“I had the arrogance of youth,” he told The Washington Post in 1995. “I thought the world would recognize me as a great painter and come to my doorstep, but somehow that just didn’t happen, and the insecurity of an unstable income finally got to me.”
He went back to Texas to work at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth. Before long, he found a new way to make a name in the art world.
“Someone showed up with a damaged painting,” he told The Post, “and I fixed it for him, simple as that.”
Mr. Merrill later trained to be an art conservator and began a career that brought him to Washington in 1981 as the head conservator of paintings at the National Gallery of Art. Two years later, he became the museum’s chief of conservation and built the department into one of the most respected groups of its kind in the world.
“What he did was amazing,” Mervin Richard, Mr. Merrill’s successor at the gallery, said last week. “He’s one of the great conservators of the 20th century.”
Mr. Merrill, who was 67 when he died Dec. 15 of multiple myeloma at his home in the Mount Vernon section of Fairfax County, led the conservation department for 26 years.
In that time, he expanded the staff from 15 people to 55, with different groups specializing in the preservation and repair of paintings, photographs, textiles, works on paper, sculptures and other objects. He also established a research department that made science a central part of the museum’s efforts to understand the secrets of art.
Mr. Merrill spent much of his time managing his growing department, but few people had his expertise when examining the finer points of a painting. In 1995, he concluded that a 17th-century painting in the National Gallery’s collection was not the masterpiece it was thought to have been. After a close analysis of paint chemistry and the weave of the canvas, he determined that the painting long attributed to Nicolas Poussin was, in fact, by another artist copying the French master’s style.
In 1991, Mr. Merrill helped restore a monumental canvas from 1858, “Lake Lucerne,” by the German American painter Albert Bierstadt. When the National Gallery acquired the work, it had been sitting for decades in a house in Rhode Island and had not been seen in public for more than a century.
“As Merrill removed accumulated grime and darkened varnish,” a 1991 story in The Post recounted, new details emerged in the gigantic painting, which is 10 feet wide and 6 feet high. “He discovered a cook pot over a fire, then wagons, then a gypsy in a wagon. From under the trees beyond emerged a file of cows, and then a cowherd. On a distant hill Merrill uncovered a procession winding its way toward a church, then a clock on the church tower and finally that the time was 2 p.m.”
Ross Mason Merrill was born May 30, 1943, in Abilene, Tex., and grew up in the Texas town of Breckenridge.
“My father was in sporting goods, and we were always outdoors,” he told The Post in 1995. “It was an endless stream of fishing and hiking and tramping about.”
When he wasn’t outdoors, he was being introduced to culture by his mother: “There were always lessons — violin, piano, organ. But it was the art classes that stuck, the painting and sculpture.”
At 19, Mr. Merrill headed to Philadelphia and studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for four years. After repairing his first paintings in Texas, he received a master’s degree in fine-art conservation from Oberlin College in Ohio in 1974, then led the conservation department at the Cleveland Museum of Art.
In 1977, Mr. Merrill won renown in the art world when he discovered that a painting that had been attributed to Matthias Grunewald, a 15th- and 16th-century German artist, was a modern forgery. His Cleveland museum had paid more than $1 million for it, but Mr. Merrill’s analysis of the painting’s pigments proved that it was a fake.
After coming to Washington in 1981, Mr. Merrill was recognized as one of the world’s foremost conservators and often spoke at international conferences. He retired in 2009 after learning that he had multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.
Mr. Merrill’s first marriage, to Diane Brown, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 28 years, Alice McLaughlin Merrill of Mount Vernon; a son from his first marriage, David Merrill of Honolulu; a daughter from his second marriage, Ashley Johnson of Richmond; and a brother.
Even though he was at the top of a precise and demanding profession, Mr. Merrill still thought of himself as an artist at heart.
“Though conservation work is fulfilling,” he said in 1995, “painting is the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.”
He had a studio in Old Town Alexandria and often traveled on weekends to the Eastern Shore or set up his easel on the banks of the Potomac River. He taught painting at the Art League of Alexandria for many years and often exhibited his artwork — most often impressionistic landscapes — at local galleries.
His paintings were twice featured on the cover of American Artist magazine, and he helped found the Mid-Atlantic Plein Air Painters Association.
Wherever he went, Mr. Merrill always carried a small watercolor kit with him because he never knew when he’d find a scene that had to painted on the spot.
“It’s demanding, painting on site,” he said, “but it’s what I do.”"
AQPR7EFRQ2_VUI94H9V3MFPOJU,Kwame Onwuachi to honor Benjamin Banneker in his new D.C. restaurant,Zoe Glasser,"January 24, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/kwame-onwuachi-restaurant-dc-salamander/,"Chef Kwame Onwuachi is looking to the stars as he plans to return to Washington this spring. The James Beard Award-winning chef’s new Afro-Caribbean restaurant, Dogon, will live inside the Salamander D.C. hotel near the Wharf and is inspired by Benjamin Banneker, the Black cartographer, almanac writer and mathematician who helped survey the city of D.C. in the late 18th century.
When Sheila Johnson, the owner of the Salamander properties, approached Onwuachi about the space, located in the former Mandarin Oriental, he immediately began considering the history of D.C.
“I really looked at the land — that’s what I like to do,” he said. “My mantra is, if something has a story, it has a soul. What was there before?”
He decided to center Banneker after researching the history of L’Enfant Plaza — named for the first cartographer of D.C., Pierre Charles L’Enfant. This story brought him to Banneker, a Black man who is credited with mapping the borders of the District using the location of the stars. Banneker’s use of the stars in his work calls back to his grandfather, an enslaved man who historians believe was from the Dogon people of Mali and Burkina Faso, both in West Africa.
Inspired by the way the Dogon people used the stars, especially the Sirius constellation, to create maps, Onwuachi decided to trace his own map between West Africa and D.C. via the restaurant. His goal is to infuse subtle references to D.C.’s history and culture into his signature style of cooking that draws from his Nigerian, Jamaican, Louisianian Creole and Trinidadian heritage.
Though he was raised in the Bronx, Onwuachi’s journey as a restaurateur began with the Shaw Bijou, a tasting menu-based restaurant located in the Shaw neighborhood of Northwest Washington. Less than six months after its 2016 opening, the Shaw Bijou closed and Onwuachi moved to the Wharf to cook at Kith and Kin. The menu also drew on Onwuachi’s beloved Afro-Caribbean cultures for inspiration. In the meantime, he opened two locations of his high-end cheesesteak shop, Philly Wing Fry, the first as a pop-up in a Whole Foods and the second as a stall in Union Market, both of which closed in 2019. The same year, he became one of Food and Wine Magazine’s best new chefs, was recognized as the rising star chef of the year by the James Beard Foundation and published his first book, “Notes From a Young Black Chef.”
Amid this winning streak and the pandemic, Onwuachi moved back to his native New York to open Tatiana, another Afro-Caribbean fusion restaurant whose menu celebrates the diversity of Manhattan and serves as an ode to his sister, for whom the restaurant was named. Within a year of its opening, Tatiana earned widespread acclaim — the New York Times declared it the best restaurant in the city, among other praises. Now, within 18 months of Tatiana’s opening, Onwuachi is returning to the Wharf with Dogon.
“The D.C. community [has] always been so great to me, and being a part of that community is one of the highlights I’m looking forward to,” Onwuachi said in a recent Zoom interview.
Onwuachi’s ties to D.C. extend beyond just his restaurants. His grandfather was a professor at Howard University, and with aunts, uncles and cousins in the area, Onwuachi has long considered D.C. a “second home.” When Johnson, the hotelier, approached him in 2021 to discuss opening a restaurant at the Salamander D.C., he jumped at the idea. He has hosted the Family Reunion, a celebration of diversity and inclusion in the restaurant industry, at Salamander’s Middleburg, Va., location since 2021, and looks forward to continuing his partnership with Johnson, whose work he has long admired. Another major reason he joined the project, he says, is that the business will be “Black-owned, top to bottom.”
Though the details of the menu are still in progress, he says diners can expect some of his “hits,” including plays on oxtail and Jamaican patties, but there will be no shortage of new dishes inspired by D.C.’s culture and history. The decor, of course, will be astronomy-themed, so while diners enjoy their meals, they can get a glimpse of what Banneker may have seen while mapping D.C."
AWBME99YWR_BCNUDQBQM58JGTY,Amazon workers’ unionizing crusade gets Sundance spotlight,Sonia Rao,"January 22, 2024 at 3:58 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/01/22/union-amazon-workers-documentary/,"PARK CITY, Utah — Chris Smalls couldn’t believe it. He walked in awe to the front of the Library Center Theatre as the audience gave a standing ovation to “Union,” a documentary that premiered Sunday at the Sundance Film Festival about Amazon workers’ tireless campaign to unionize a Staten Island warehouse. Management has attempted to discredit the Amazon Labor Union (ALU). But to much of this audience, Smalls and his fellow organizers were nothing short of heroes.
“As a former Amazon employee, I have to remind myself where I came from,” said Smalls, who currently serves as president of the ALU. “Every day, I get to look at the people here that helped me get by … and understand that what we started can never, ever be taken away from us. We built something that is monumentally historic.”
The film by directors Brett Story and Stephen Maing arrives after a banner year for the American labor movement. The success story of workers at JFK8, which in April 2022 became the first Amazon facility to unionize, no doubt inspired others. But organizing is rarely a smooth process, and “Union” doesn’t shy away from exploring the thorny politics — both internal and external — of going up against one of the biggest companies in the world. Producer Samantha Curley noted at the premiere that the team behind the film hopes it can serve as “a useful tool for organizing.”
Smalls was fired from Amazon — whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post — after protesting pandemic working conditions nearly four years ago. (While Smalls considers his firing to be wrongful termination, the company said that he was let go “for putting the health and safety of others at risk and for violating social distancing guidelines,” according to spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis.) Several workers in the documentary share their own grievances with management. There are numerous accounts of long, strenuous hours and too-short breaks. A 30-minute lunch window for a shift surpassing eight hours, for instance, isn’t always enough to make it to the 850,000-square-foot facility’s cafeteria and back. Some say they were fired, rehired, then fired again. Others claim they were written up because of their union sympathies.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
Amazon maintains that “the health, safety, and wellbeing of our employees is our top priority,” according to Paradis, who added that employees “are free to take informal breaks throughout their shifts.”
Amazon is known to struggle with employee retention. One of the title cards displayed throughout the film estimates an annual turnover rate of 150 percent, which the New York Times previously reported as a pre-pandemic figure. This posed an obstacle for ALU organizers, who required signatures from at least 30 percent of active employees to hold an election on unionizing.
Then, during that election, they needed a majority of workers to vote yes. The filmmakers impress upon their audience how determined organizers were to reach their goal. Some — such as treasurer Maddie Wesley, who figures prominently throughout the film — started working for the company just so they could contribute to the cause. The ALU ran much of its grass-roots campaign from a tent located outside the warehouse, offering hot meals and, on at least one occasion, free marijuana.
“We are the N.W.A. of the organizing world,” Smalls jokes, referring to the gangsta rap group, during a meeting featured in “Union.”
As the workers seek better conditions by reminding the company they are human, they are forced to face the emotional truth of it among themselves, too. Slowly, alliances start to shift. One JFK8 employee who started out with the ALU loses faith in the operation and shows up to the eventual election with a poster encouraging folks to vote no. Dissent begins to grow against Smalls over the belief that he exercises too much power as president. (According to reports, this is an ongoing issue for the union, which will hold leadership elections sometime this year.)
“You saw a lot of different sides of us that people don’t really see,” he told the crowd at the premiere. “That’s the nitty-gritty of organizing: You’ve got to trust people from all different backgrounds.”
While workers at JFK8 successfully unionized, contract negotiations have yet to begin — another point of contention within the unit, which seeks safer workplace conditions and higher wages, among other things. The film suggests Amazon is responsible for the bargaining holdup.
Paradis stated that members of Amazon’s leadership “strongly disagree with the outcome of the election,” as they outlined during hearings held about the unionization of JFK8. The company holds that “both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome.”
“Union” showed at the first Sundance since historic labor strikes shut Hollywood productions down for several months. The rapturous applause at the documentary’s Sunday afternoon premiere embodied the pro-labor sentiment widespread among artists at the festival, at least a few of whom have expressed gratitude toward their respective unions while screening their films.
But there have also been whispers of potential trouble for “Union” as it relates to acquisition. Major studios might hesitate to buy a film that could alienate Amazon and, by extension, Bezos himself. The filmmakers don’t seem too concerned about this risk. Maing told Variety that “it’s a very sobering moment probably for corporations to really have to consider what they value.”
The film also premiered as violence continued to escalate in Gaza. Multiple “Union” producers wore the Palestinian kaffiyeh around their necks while answering questions from the audience. While introducing the film, Story shared that her first language was Arabic. She said she grew up in the West Bank and lived with a Palestinian family for many years of her childhood, an experience she credited with helping her develop “the skills and lessons that have taught me how to be a good filmmaker: kindness, generosity, courage and a critical orientation to the world.”
“There’s no worse feeling than the feeling of powerlessness,” she continued, “and it’s for that reason that we’re so extraordinarily grateful the Amazon Labor Union organizers and workers shared space under their tent with us and allowed us in to watch and witness their incredible organizing.”"
AZKE0H3MLP_S718HURN6ULPFBQ,DeSantis says Trump’s victory in Iowa is ‘a huge warning’ for Republicans,Azi Paybarah,"January 24, 2024 at 2:53 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/ron-desantis-trump-iowa-victory/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Donald Trump’s commanding victory in Iowa should be “a huge warning sign” for Republicans, comments critical of the former president’s influence on the party that come just days after DeSantis dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.
Speaking on the “Steve Deace Show,” DeSantis warned that the low turnout for the Iowa caucuses was reflective of conservatives who are expressing their discontent with Trump by staying away from the polls. He said his team found Iowa Republicans who caucused in 2016 but who were refusing to do so again in 2024.
Ron DeSantis ends presidential campaign, endorses Trump
“They were conservative but they did not want to see Trump nominated again, but they had basically been told that it was inevitable, that it was over, so why even bother?” DeSantis said. “And they just totally dropped out of the process.”
As evidence, DeSantis cited the turnout at the caucuses. “To have 110,000 people show up, when in 2016 you had 186,000 show up — when Iowa has more Republicans this year than they did in 2016 — that shows you there’s a lot of our voters who have checked out,” he said, without addressing the record-low temperatures on that day.
Edison Research estimated turnout in Iowa at 115,000 on Monday night — down from 186,657 in 2016, and lower than 121,503 in 2012 and 119,207 in 2008, The Washington Post reported.
That turnout problem could get worse, DeSantis said. “In each contest, those voters that had checked out, I think that percentage will grow and those are the voters you need to be competitive.”
“And I think they’re just like, you know what? ‘We’re doing this again?’ and they’re checked out. So it’s a huge warning sign for Republicans, nationally, based on what we saw in Iowa.”
As for New Hampshire, DeSantis said, “Trump’s going to win that going away. But what’s the overall turnout?”
In a result tallied after DeSantis’s comments, Trump won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday with a decisive victory over former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, with voter turnout projected to be at a record high.
Who coined the term ‘caucus’? There are lots of candidates, but no winner.
On the campaign trail, Trump has relentlessly attacked and mocked DeSantis, using demeaning nicknames and charging him with being disloyal, while the Florida governor has spent the past 12 months effectively calling Trump self-absorbed and ineffective.
In his endorsement of Trump after dropping out of the presidential race on Sunday, DeSantis said it had become clear to him “that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Trump another chance.”
A day later, he appeared ready to veto a proposal that could help pay Trump’s mounting legal fees. The bill proposing financial support for Florida residents who run for president was put forth by Jimmy Patronis, Florida’s chief financial officer and a member of DeSantis’s gubernatorial Cabinet.
DeSantis sounded a note of caution in his comments Tuesday: “When I have people come up to me who voted for Reagan and … have been conservative their whole life, [who] say that they don’t want to vote for Trump again, that’s a problem. So he’s got to figure out a way to solve that. I think there’s an enthusiasm problem overall.”

U.S. chemist’s recipe brews controversy in U.K.,Karla Adam,"January 24, 2024 at 7:09 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/tea-salt-how-to-brew/,"LONDON — An American chemist caused a stir here on Wednesday with her suggestion that the humble cup of tea could be improved with salt, prompting shocked headlines from British news outlets and an intervention by the U.S. Embassy in London.
Drinking tea in Britain, of course, is almost mandatory — the first thing that most reasonable Brits do when they come home is to fire up the kettle. Making a good cuppa is something that many here believe they do very well, thank you very much.
But Michelle Francl, a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania with a new book on tea, has suggested techniques for making a perfect brew that are unfamiliar to many Brits.
She advised that adding a dash of salt could help the tea to taste less bitter. She went further, recommending a squeeze of lemon, which helps to remove the “scum” that can sit on the surface of the water. She is also a fan of vigorous dunking and squeezing of the tea bag.
Tea-loving Brits were notably distressed.
“American scientist reveals her secret to the perfect cup of tea … but adding hot milk and SALT risks leaving Brits at boiling point,” a headline in the Daily Mail said. ITV News did taster tests in the tea rooms of Manchester and discovered skeptical Brits. The salty tea tasted like “seawater,” said one. “Absolutely awful,” said another.
While adding salt to tea might be scandalous in Britain, it’s not unheard of — Tibetan butter tea, or po cha, is made with a pinch of salt, as is the Mongolian tea called suutei tsai.
Sensing a potential diplomatic incident, the U.S. Embassy in London issued “an important statement on the latest tea controversy.”
“Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, a sacred bond that unites our nations. We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our special relationship,” the embassy said on X, formerly Twitter.
“Therefore we want to assure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain’s national drink is not official United States policy. And never will be.”
But the country that once upon a time threw British tea overboard couldn’t resist stirring up a little trouble. The embassy added that its staff would “continue to make tea in the proper way — by microwaving it.”

The British government joined in on the fun, writing in a post, “We appreciate our Special Relationship, however, we must disagree wholeheartedly. … Tea can only be made using a kettle.”
On Wednesday evening, “microwave” was trending on British Twitter. Some noted that this wasn’t the first time Americans have trolled Britain by suggesting it is acceptable to microwave a cup of tea. And after an American TikTok parody about making tea with powdered lemonade, cinnamon, the soft drink Tang, British officials called out the military to clarify the situation.
I see there’s huge interest in how to make a British cup of tea. ☕️ So I’ve called in my military advisers to get this in the record. pic.twitter.com/Xc22BicwS6
Francl seems to be serious about her tea advice. In her new book, “Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea,” she documents tea-making practices that date back more than 1,000 years. She advises using short mugs, with less surface area, to help keep the tea warm, and she says warming up the cup beforehand is important as it increases the amount of caffeine and antioxidants released.
Throwing caution to the wind, Francl bravely weighs in on the Great Milk Debate and concludes that it’s better to use warm milk and to pour milk in after the tea. This, she says, will reduce the chances of it curdling.
Francl has suggested that practices on both sides of the Atlantic could improve. “You get some awful cups of tea in the U.S.,” she told the Daily Mail. “People here often use lukewarm water straight from a tap. It’s horrific.”"
B5JVE1WL40_RDOSYS8IFCJBA9K,"Man sues Macy’s, saying false facial recognition match led to jail assault",Drew Harwell,"January 22, 2024 at 6:24 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/22/facial-recognition-wrongful-identification-assault/,"A man was sexually assaulted in jail after being falsely accused of armed robbery due to a faulty facial recognition match, his attorneys said, in a case that further highlights the dangers of the technology’s expanding use by law enforcement.
Harvey Murphy Jr., 61, said he was beaten and raped by three men in a Texas jail bathroom in 2022 after being booked on charges he’d held up employees at gunpoint inside a Sunglass Hut in a Houston shopping center, according to a lawsuit he filed last week.
A representative of a nearby Macy’s told Houston police during the investigation that the company’s system, which scanned surveillance-camera footage for faces in an internal shoplifter database, found evidence that Murphy had robbed both stores, leading to his arrest.
But at the time of the robbery, his attorneys said, Murphy was in a Sacramento jail on unrelated charges, nearly 2,000 miles away. Hours after his sexual assault, prosecutors released him with all charges dropped, his attorneys said.
Murphy sued Macy’s, Sunglass Hut parent company EssilorLuxottica and three people his attorneys say were involved in the case. He is seeking $10 million in damages and says the assault left him with “lifelong injuries.”
“It is a day-to-day personal pain in your heart and your soul about what happened,” he said in an interview with The Washington Post. He said he remained “terrified by the idea that it could happen again at any time.”
Macy’s declined to comment on pending litigation. The company said in a previous statement that it uses “facial recognition in conjunction with other security methods in a small subset of Macy’s stores with high incidences of organized retail theft and repeat offenders.”
EssilorLuxottica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. A spokesman for the Houston police, who Murphy’s attorneys say investigated the case, referred a request for comment to the mayor’s office, which did not immediately respond.
Retailers increasingly are using facial recognition software to patrol their stores for shoplifters and other unwanted customers. But the technology’s accuracy is highly dependent on technical factors — the cameras’ video quality, a store’s lighting, the size of its face database — and a mismatch can lead to dangerous results.
The Federal Trade Commission last month said the pharmacy chain Rite Aid had misused its facial recognition system in a way that led to shoppers being falsely accused of theft, including in confrontations with police. As part of an FTC settlement, Rite Aid pledged not to use the technology for five years.
Police departments have said generally that they use facial matches only as an investigative lead and that criminal charges should come only in cases where other evidence can be found. But Murphy’s lawsuit suggests that it played a critical role in steering officers to him in the first place, and that the confidence authorities placed in the automated results may have “primed” witnesses and investigators to believe Murphy was at fault without substantial evidence.
Murphy, who is White, joins six other people, all of whom are Black, who have reported being wrongfully accused of crimes due to faulty facial recognition matches. One, Robert Williams, sued the Detroit police after he was falsely charged with stealing watches from a Shinola store and held in custody for 30 hours. Another, Porcha Woodruff, said she was held for 11 hours while eight months pregnant. Those cases are ongoing.
On Jan. 22, 2022, after two men held up the Sunglass Hut, the head of loss prevention for EssilorLuxottica told Houston police that he’d worked with a counterpart at the Macy’s store to run video from the robbery through Macy’s facial recognition system. That system, the official said, indicated that Murphy had robbed both stores.
Houston police officers conducted a photo lineup with a sales associate who had been held at gunpoint, and she identified Murphy as the robber, the lawsuit states. A warrant was issued for his arrest.
In October 2022, after the Texas native had left California to return to Texas for work, Murphy was handcuffed at a Department of Motor Vehicles examining station when he went to renew his driver’s license, he told The Post. He was in jail for about 10 days when the assault happened, he said, and he was released a few hours later.
Murphy said he was not told facial recognition was involved in his jailing and only learned after his court-appointed attorney discovered it in police reports.
Prosecutors in Harris County, where Houston is located, ultimately dropped charges after learning of Murphy’s alibi, said one of his attorneys, Daniel Dutko. He said it’s still unclear what facial recognition software was used to identify Murphy.
“It scares me to think we’re heading in a direction where one of my kids can be incarcerated for doing nothing wrong, based on this technology,” Dutko said."
B9BFAF3SNQ_3PAMBGN9PDMPDK5,Bulky or slender? Megalodon study reignites debate over extinct shark.,Carolyn Y. Johnson,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/01/21/megalodon-slender-great-white-shark/,"The extinct shark megalodon is often imagined as a beefy, supersize great white, with a gaping maw of pointy teeth capping off a powerful body that spanned 50 feet from nose to tail. Now, a team of more than two dozen scientists argues that the megalodon has been misunderstood, and may have been slimmer and longer than previous estimates.
The new study, published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica, is the latest chapter in an ongoing scientific dispute about what this apex marine predator really looked like and what its role was in ancient ocean ecosystems.
Otodus megalodon has been extinct for some 3.6 million years, but many nonexperts have a mental picture of this prehistoric super-shark. Reproductions of its massive jaw provide a backdrop for family photo ops at aquariums across the country. The megalodon spawned its own Hollywood franchise with the 2018 horror flick “The Meg.” And a 52-foot, some 2,000-pound model dangles menacingly over the cafeteria at the National Museum of Natural History.
The catch is that these are feats of scientifically informed imagination — and the basic question of what megalodon looked like is a thorny topic among experts.
What scientists know for sure is that megalodon had giant teeth, some as big as an adult human hand. They’ve dug up segments of its fossilized backbone. And they recently analyzed some of its tiny scales. But its cartilage skeleton doesn’t fossilize well, so many scientists have leaned on analogies to a living macropredator with similar-shaped teeth: the great white shark.
“We’re trying to speculate on something based on the very incomplete pool of evidence,” said Michael Gottfried, a vertebrate paleontologist at Michigan State University who was not involved in the new study.
Multiple outside experts said the study — which posits an elongated and slender megalodon more similar to a mako shark than a great white — won’t settle the matter. Even if the megalodon is longer than previously proposed, they point out, it could still have had a robust, bulky body. But the back and forth highlights the level of fascination that scientists and the general public have with this creature.
Much of what is known about the megalodon’s body stems from a collection of 141 pieces of its backbone discovered in the 1860s in Belgium.
In the 1990s, Gottfried measured pieces of that backbone. In modern-day great whites, there’s a mathematical relationship between the width of their vertebrae and their total length. When Gottfried applied that to the megalodon vertebrae, he calculated that the Belgian specimen must have been 30 feet long.
In a previous job, at the Calvert Marine Museum in Maryland, he constructed a reproduction skeleton of a megalodon, scaling up from a white shark and making adjustments to the proportions.
Then, in 2022, a different team of scientists returned to the Belgian specimen to create a 3D model. Drawing heavily on analogies to great white sharks, but also considering other modern sharks, they reported that the megalodon specimen was 52 feet long, weighing some 67 tons — a “transoceanic superpredator” that was probably able to cruise faster than any living shark, with a stomach big enough to ingest an orca.
Other shark experts had grumbles about the findings. The new study is in many ways a direct response: A team of more than two dozen scientists came together to point out flaws and make a counterargument. Their interpretation of the same specimen suggests that the megalodon was more slender — and possibly even longer than previously thought.
“The slender body would indicate that Megalodon may not have been a powerful swimmer as much as the modern great white shark is, and this is consistent with the interpretation that Megalodon may have been a slow-cruising shark,” Kenshu Shimada, the senior author of the new paper and a paleobiology professor at DePaul University in Chicago, said in an email.
Shimada said the new interpretation supports a recent study from his lab that examined fossilized placoid scales, the type of tiny, pointed scales unique to sharks and rays. That research suggested that the megalodon “was generally a slow cruiser with occasional ‘burst swimming’ for capturing prey,” he said.
But both teams have pointed critiques of each others’ studies, a normal — if sometimes uncomfortable — part of how science moves forward.
Jack Cooper, a graduate student and shark paleontologist at Swansea University in Wales who led the study that is under attack, said that his team’s work has been criticized because of its overreliance on the great white shark as an analog to megalodon. But the new interpretation originates from an analysis that also relies on comparison to a great white.
He also disagreed that a thin backbone would necessarily be too narrow to support a bulky animal, pointing out that the extinct shark cretoxyrhina also had a slender vertebral column but a bulky body form.
Outside experts said both papers still use speculation to arrive at their different interpretations.
“At the end of the day, I don’t think it brings us that much closer to knowing what megalodon really looks like,” said Robert Boessenecker, a coastal paleontologist at the nonprofit Charleston Center for Paleontology who was not involved in the new study.
Dana Ehret, curator of natural history at the New Jersey State Museum, said that it was good to see biologists who study modern shark biology join the discussion of ancient sharks, and, for him, the interesting thing is that both papers suggest that the megalodon was probably longer than scientists once thought.
“Some of the biggest sharks today are whale sharks, basking sharks. They max out at 35 to 40 feet,” Ehret said. “Think of a shark another 20 feet longer than the biggest shark today. To me, that is really mind-boggling.”
It’s not unusual for paleontologists to disagree about ancient animal bodies — sometimes with a ferocious intensity. Gottfried recalled witnessing some scientists get into a heated disagreement over the angle of the thigh bone when assembling a triceratops specimen.
John Hutchinson, a professor of evolutionary biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London, is part of the team that put forward the controversial 3D model of the megalodon. He said that the stakes are always high in science, but particularly when working on species that attract both public and scientific fascination.
“The more celebrity an extinct animal has, and the rarer it is, the more competitive or heated the disagreements can be,” Hutchinson said. “I know this all too well. I worked on T. rex.”
Hutchinson said that, early in his career, people used 2D illustrations of fossilized skeletons and shrink-wrapped skin around them, making them quite skinny. Based on these models, people believed Tyrannosaurus rex was around 11,000 pounds. But now, using various methods, scientists mostly agree that an adult T. rex would have been somewhere around 17,000 pounds.
Young tyrannosaur died with a full stomach, remarkable fossil reveals
The question matters not only because people want to put a face to these megapredators, but also because form can help explain function, which in turn has consequences for our understanding of ancient and modern ecosystems.
“This was one of the largest marine carnivores to ever live, and it was clearly a major component in the marine ecosystem,” said Phillip Sternes, a graduate student and shark paleontologist at the University of California at Riverside and lead author of the study.
The latest disagreements may provide little clarity on what the megalodon looked like — but the scientific competition between research groups has spurred more research, and pushed the field beyond papers that simply describe the discovery of new specimens to research delving into ancient ecology.
For instance, the megalodon is estimated to have gone extinct some 3.6 million years ago, perhaps because of competition for prey with the great white shark. And previous work suggested that when the megalodon vanished, the absence of a fierce ocean predator allowed for the rise of modern filter-feeding whales.
“The last five to 10 years or so, the study of megalodon has really changed considerably — from sort of stamp collecting to actual hypothesis-driven paleobiological study,” Boessenecker said."
B9CEIYKBWB_OZPG6R7SFT5LAEJ,Opinion How tens of thousands of Black U.S. doctors simply vanished,_,"January 22, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/uche-blackstock-legacy-black-doctors/,"Uché Blackstock is an emergency physician and founder and chief executive of Advancing Health Equity. This essay is adapted from her new book, “Legacy: A Black Physician Reckons With Racism in Medicine.”
When I was a little girl, my twin sister, Oni, and I used to visit our mother at work. Her name was Dr. Dale Gloria Blackstock and, in the 1980s and ’90s, she was an attending physician at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn,  not far from our home in Crown Heights.
Our mother worked long hours. So sometimes, we’d head to the hospital after school to see her and do our homework. Walking the hallways, our shoes squeaking on the linoleum floors, we’d make our way to the large cafeteria, where we’d pull textbooks from our backpacks and settle down to work alongside the physicians, nurses, technicians and aides taking a break. The staff behind the counter knew us well. They would smile warmly and ask, “Visiting your mother today?”
After our homework was done, we’d sneak into our mother’s clinic to ask for small change to spend on our favorite, red Jell-O. She’d hand it to us and, if we were quiet, let us stay and observe for a minute or two as she examined a patient. Our mother was warm but serious with those in her care. Occasionally, she would smile, but more often than not, she was extremely focused on what they were saying and what was going on in their lives.
Our mother always seemed to know as much about her patients’ children and families as she did about their medical problems. When you came for a visit with Dr. Blackstock, you weren’t only having your blood pressure or cholesterol checked — you were meeting with someone who would assess your whole being.
I believe our mother practiced what is now known as structurally competent and culturally responsive care, in which the entire complex nature of a patient’s background and the social context in which they live, work, love and pray is considered during evaluation. And people loved her for it. She wasn’t just taking care of patients. She was tending to her neighbors.
The daughter of a single mother, raised on public assistance, our mother grew up to become the first person in her family to graduate from college — and then from Harvard Medical School, in 1976.
“What am I doing here?” she remembered asking herself on her first day.
The majority of her classmates were White and from affluent backgrounds. In her class alone, one student was a relative of Jackie Onassis. Several students had parents who were Harvard professors and had written the textbooks they were using in class. Another student’s father had won the Nobel Prize in medicine.
My mother’s life couldn’t have been more different from theirs. She was a Black girl from Brooklyn. While she wanted to believe that she deserved to be at Harvard, she wasn’t always certain. Her own claim to fame was that her mother had received her licensed practical nursing degree after raising six children, attending school full time, working full time, taking care of the family and getting off welfare. Our mother was so proud of her mother’s achievements. But they weren’t a Nobel Prize in medicine.
When we were children, our mother insisted she hadn’t experienced overt racism while at Harvard. Notably, her class was one of the most diverse in the school’s history, thanks to diversity initiatives begun soon after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. A full 10 percent of her class was Black.
Even so, there were incidents that led her to wonder whether racism was at work. During one of her rotations, a professor held open a door for a White male student, then let it slam in my mother’s face. Another time, when a male professor made a joke in bad taste about women, he apologized to a White student within earshot but not to my mother, who was standing right next to him. Once, she was told not to sleep in an empty patient room — as was customary after a night shift — because a White male resident needed the bed.
Then there was the White patient who didn’t want to be treated by a Black student-doctor and told my mother this in no uncertain terms. By the time she graduated, she was exhausted — and not just because of the rigor of her schooling.
Although I always want to celebrate my mother’s achievements, I would be doing her memory a disservice if I were to portray her story only as one of exceptionalism, of the plucky young Black woman from humble beginnings who through grit and determination rose to success. To truly pay tribute to her, I know I must situate her story within the broader context of the historical barriers that Black people in the United States have faced entering the medical field.
Those barriers have been legion.
For centuries in this country, White-only medical schools, with exclusionary policies and practices, made it virtually impossible for Black people to receive medical training. It was only after the Civil War, with thousands of injured veterans in desperate need of medical care, that a small handful of Black trainees began to be admitted to White medical schools in the North. And it wasn’t until Reconstruction that a number of Black medical schools sprang up in the South, enabling Black people to finally have access to medical training in greater numbers.
These schools were Howard University College of Medicine, established in D.C. in 1868; Meharry Medical College, established in Nashville in 1876; Leonard Medical School, established in Raleigh, N.C., in 1882; New Orleans University Medical College, founded in 1887; Knoxville College Medical Department, founded in 1895; Chattanooga National Medical College, founded in 1902; and the University of West Tennessee College of Physicians and Surgeons, founded in Memphis in 1904. By 1905, those Black medical schools had trained 1,465 doctors. Each of those doctors was poised to train a new generation of physicians, who would have gone on to train a generation of their own.
And then, that promising legacy was abruptly extinguished.
The reason was the publication of the Flexner Report — a landmark document in U.S. medical history that had a devastating effect on the number of Black physicians in this country.
Abraham Flexner, the White author of the report, was an education specialist who at the turn of the 20th century was employed by the Carnegie Foundation and the American Medical Association to travel to all 155 medical schools in the United States and Canada to assess the state of medical education. His report, published in 1910, led to broad standardization of medical schools, with the top school in the country at the time — Johns Hopkins — held up as the example for all others to follow.
The new standards did go some way toward elevating the quality of U.S. medical care. Flexner’s recommendations included more-stringent admissions criteria; well-equipped laboratories and facilities; and a higher level of instruction by physician scientists, resembling the model found in Western European medical schools. The problem was that smaller Black institutions simply did not have the resources or endowments to implement the more rigorous instruction the new standards required.
Flexner had strongly racist opinions on the role of Black people in medicine. He wrote that Black students should be trained in “hygiene rather than surgery” and were best employed as “sanitarians” who could help protect White people from common diseases such as tuberculosis.
“Not only does the negro himself suffer from hookworm and tuberculosis; he communicates them to his white neighbors,” Flexner wrote, begrudgingly admitting that Black people did need some role in health care, if mostly as it pertained to Whites. “The negro must be educated not only for his sake, but for ours. He is, as far as the human eye can see, a permanent factor in the nation.” He added that Black medical schools were “wasting small sums annually and sending out undisciplined men, whose lack of real training is covered up by the imposing M.D. degree.”
After the Flexner Report, five of the seven Black medical schools in the United States were forced to close, leaving only Howard and Meharry.
Almost a hundred years later, in June 2020, amid a global pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests, I read an article about the Flexner Report that popped up in my Twitter feed. My heart dropped as my eyes scanned the information. I wasn’t prepared for its contents.
The article described a new study estimating that if the majority of Black medical schools had been allowed to remain open after the Flexner Report’s publication, and if they had continued training Black doctors to this day, they would have educated roughly 25,000 to 35,000 people. In essence, tens of thousands of future Black physicians had disappeared. I remember sobbing as I absorbed the magnitude of those numbers.
The loss of so many Black physicians to the field of medicine and to our communities has been undeniably profound. We know — as I witnessed in my mother’s clinic — that racial concordance in patient-physician interactions influences everything from how patients feel when they leave their appointment to how likely they are to take their medications. We know that because Black physicians are more likely to mentor and sponsor Black students, those students would have felt more comfortable, and would have been more likely to thrive, in academic medical environments, resulting in greater academic success and career opportunities — and generations of new doctors.
We know that had those Black medical schools remained open, the health of our communities might be in a different place, most likely better than it is today.
Instead, more than a century after the Flexner Report, we are still recovering from its impact. In 1900, 1.3 percent of U.S. physicians were Black, when Black people made up 11.6 percent of the population. Today, the number of Black physicians remains stubbornly low, with only 5.7 percent of all U.S. physicians identifying as Black — although Black people make up 13.6 percent of the population.
My mother died of leukemia in 1997, at age 47, when Oni and I were only 19. I remember feeling the loss then not only for myself, but also for my mother’s patients. They had experienced the care of a physician who listened to them, understood their lives and experiences, and was invested in them as whole human beings. Today, I imagine the hundreds of thousands of similar patient-physician relationships that never had a chance to exist because of a report that was designed to improve health outcomes — but only for White patients.
Since the time of the Flexner Report, the racism undergirding our medical institutions has hardly dissipated. Exclusionary criteria in medical school admissions look different than they did in the past, but they still have the same detrimental effect on the representation of Black physicians.
Reliance on the MCAT, the standardized test required to enter medical school, has been shown to be discriminatory against Black students and other students of color, even as the test does a poor job of predicting people’s future success as doctors. Studies have shown also that election to the national medical school honor society, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA), which often determines entry into selective medical specialties such as ophthalmology and dermatology, is embedded in racism, resulting in few Black student members. Admission to AOA relies heavily on traditional criteria, such as grades, test scores and publications, which are all influenced by inequitable factors leading up to and during medical school — including a lack of quality K-12 education in underserved communities; lack of social, parental and familial privilege and resources; lack of race-concordant teaching, mentoring and advising; and mistreatment based on race or ethnicity.
Because academic medical centers receive federal funding for education and training, they have a social contract with the public to ensure that medical schools accept and support a student body that fully represents the communities being served. Some medical schools have recently adopted a holistic review process that places value on lived experience and personal attributes apart from traditional metrics such as MCAT scores and grades; however, this process has not been implemented consistently by schools.
But training more Black physicians is only one of the many solutions needed to address the glaring health inequities that exist in this country. The fact is, we need multiple fixes, and we need them now — because since the days, 30 years ago, when my mother was practicing medicine in Brooklyn, health outcomes have gotten only worse, not better, for Black Americans.
Today, we are in the midst of an undeniable maternal mortality crisis largely driven by the deaths of Black people, who are at least three times more likely to die than their White peers. Black babies also have the highest infant mortality rate. And Black men have the shortest life expectancy of any major demographic group. These horrifying trends were true even before the covid-19 pandemic devastated our communities.
What is perhaps most shocking about racial health inequities is that these outcomes often persist across socioeconomic strata and levels of formal education. Even with my two Harvard degrees, I have a pregnancy-related mortality rate two to four times that of a White woman who never finished high school.
As the saying goes: If you’re not furious about this, you’re not paying attention.
Since summer 2020, there has been increasing public demand to reform racist U.S. policies and address the structural inequities at their root. This includes the health-care system, which needs to give practitioners of all backgrounds a framework for understanding what Black patients and communities have experienced here for centuries — and what they are still enduring.
Because of glaring gaps in my own education, it took me years to fully understand the long history underpinning racism in medicine. And it took me until well into my career as a physician to recognize the sheer scale of the problem, to free myself from the institutional status quo.
Now, the problems I see are crystal clear. So, too, are some of the solutions.
First, White physicians and health-care professionals must acknowledge that systemic racism exists, and that racism is not Black people’s struggle to fight alone. Your Black colleagues are exhausted. Your Black patients are dying. We need you to do your own due diligence to understand how racism operates and affects health outcomes.
Second, our health-care institutions must strive to provide structurally competent and culturally centered care to Black communities — care that takes into consideration the social, economic and political context in which people live. These institutions need to be intentional about earning the trust of Black communities, via reparative processes, so that people will be willing to seek care even before they really need it and have the opportunity to form meaningful, healthy relationships with health-care professionals. Institutions also need to implement clinical protocols to track inequities in practice and intervene when necessary — with buy-in from their leadership. Simply put, they must hold themselves accountable.
Part of that accountability is ensuring that the health-care workforce reflects the diversity of its patient population. Schools and academic medical centers have the most important job here and must commit to reforming their admissions policies and practices.
The responsibility of equity has been largely carried since the late 1800s by historically Black colleges and universities. Their mission since their creation, among other goals, has been to educate and train Black doctors. From 2009 to 2019, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, two historically Black medical schools, Howard and Morehouse, graduated more Black students than any predominantly White medical school in the country. Recently, two HBCUs, Xavier University of Louisiana and Morgan State, announced they will open medical schools, as will seven other predominantly White institutions.  While this is welcome news, these additional schools will create only a small uptick in the number of Black medical school graduates in the short term.
One of the major barriers to entry for Black medical school students is economic inequality, rooted in the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and in persistent racism. As a result of a lack of generational wealth, Black students don’t have the same financial resources as their White peers. The median White household has a net worth six times that of the median Black household. Black households and other households of color are overrepresented among the poor and working class, and underrepresented among the upper middle class and the wealthy.
To address this inequity, institutions ought to provide Black students full grants and scholarships for college and medical school. And they should specifically engage with students descended from enslaved Black Americans, especially Black men, whose matriculation rate into medical school has declined.
The recent Supreme Court decision to ban race-conscious admissions policies could have the same dire repercussions as the Flexner Report in terms of decreasing the number of Black medical school graduates. Academic medicine is often resistant to change, and many medical schools will most likely want to avoid legal challenges. Schools, such as the University of California at Davis, that have implemented race-neutral policies might have initial success diversifying their classes. But excluding race entirely could prove harmful, as it does not directly address how racism has disproportionately and pervasively affected the lives of potential Black applicants.
Solving these problems will require existing schools to invest in the pipeline of Black physicians and health-care professionals early, engaging with children and young people at every step along the path to medical school. In addition to financial assistance, this could mean medical schools making long-term investments in education, housing and employment in Black communities (areas not typically considered the domain of medical schools, but factors which can influence an applicant’s success); establishing mentoring programs in K-12 schools, in which students would be paired with health professionals; sponsoring opportunities where students can be exposed to a variety of clinical environments early in their education; and re-examining traditional admissions criteria, including grades and standardized test scores, in favor of more meaningful criteria such as community service and a commitment to practicing in underserved communities.
Schools must also commit to a meaningfully diverse, anti-racist learning environment in which Black students can show up as their full selves. They must listen to Black students when they articulate what they need to be successful: conditions under which they are graded equitably and fairly in their courses and rotations, where the curriculum is taught through a health- and racial-equity lens, and where students can learn free of discrimination by their peers and faculty.
As a young girl, and even into my 20s, I thought my mother had been successful because she worked incredibly hard, loved science and was determined. More recently, I’ve realized that she wasn’t exceptional — she was just one of the lucky ones who made it through. There have always been many “exceptional” Black people like my mother; they simply never had the same opportunities.
This is a lesson my mother came to understand for herself — something I learned only after her death, when, rummaging through her belongings, trying to find ways to stay connected to her, I found a book about the experiences of women in medical education, to which she’d contributed an essay.
In the book, physicians shared how being a woman had affected their personal and professional lives. My mother wrote in detail about growing up in poverty, her decision to pursue a career in medicine, and her time at Harvard and in her residency and fellowship training. Toward the end of her essay, she questioned whether sexism had been a significant factor in her trajectory.
“In looking back, I believe that many of my negative experiences were as a result of race, not sexism,” she wrote. “This is not to minimize the sluggishness of women’s progress in medicine, but in this society, race is such a major factor in our actions and policymaking that not to acknowledge it is unrealistic and naive.”
Returning to that essay as an adult — a woman in my 40s, a physician and a mother in my own right — I realized I no longer saw my mother’s story as one of success against the odds. Instead, I was far more aware of the demands placed on her as the first person in her family to attend college and then medical school, as a Black physician navigating predominantly White spaces, and as a Black woman juggling motherhood and her career.
I could sense her complicated feelings — her passion for medicine but also her ambivalence, as the journey had been far from easy. I realized the magnitude of what she had gone through: the lack of food on her childhood table, the absence of a stable home environment, the challenges of coming from a community where few people had walked the same path she was on. The nun who told her she should become a social worker when my mother told her she wanted to be a physician. Being told by a White patient that he did not want to be seen by a Black doctor.
“Black people in society learn to develop thick skin,” my mother wrote. “We learn to depend on inner strength to keep us on course. At the present time, for my perseverance, I look to my mother as my role model. I marvel at her just as I marvel at all the Black mothers who have achieved the unachievable.”
My mother will always be my role model and idol, but it hurts me to know she had to go through all that she did, to overcome all those barriers. Life should not have been so hard for her. It should not be so hard for anyone.
For me, my mother’s success, and the way she stewarded her daughters toward our own success as physicians, is a reminder of every Black doctor who is not here with us but should be. It’s a reminder of this tremendous loss — and of our nation’s duty to rectify centuries of injustice.

BARHPF83AL_KDELZE6QHS36R63,Opinion The Checkup With Dr. Wen: How to get Paxlovid for just a co-pay — or free,Leana S. Wen,"January 25, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/paxlovid-covid-cost-free-discount/,"You’re reading The Checkup With Dr. Wen, a newsletter on how to navigate covid-19 and other public health challenges. Click here to get the full newsletter in your inbox, including answers to reader questions and a summary of new scientific research.
In response to last week’s column on how the antiviral pill Paxlovid is dramatically underutilized in treating covid-19, readers shared their challenges with accessing the medication. One of the most frustrating: unexpected financial barriers.
Karen from Virginia, for example, contracted covid last week and was prescribed Paxlovid. But her pharmacy told her she had to pay the list price of $1,400.
Fortunately, she had just read an article from AARP explaining that patients on Medicare should be able to get Paxlovid for free. “You have to fill out information through the Pfizer Patient Support Program,” she told me. “I didn’t know this, and I think many of your readers may not either.”
Indeed, I was not aware of this program, so I spoke with a senior official in the Department of Health and Human Services for clarification. Last November, Paxlovid transitioned to the commercial market. Previously, the federal government purchased the medication and provided it free of charge. Now, it is dispensed like other drugs and billed through insurance.
The Biden administration has been working closely with the drug’s manufacturer, Pfizer, to ensure that patients aren’t being priced out from accessing this lifesaving treatment. The senior official was clear with me that “everyone on Medicare, Medicaid or without insurance should be able to get Paxlovid for free.”
People should go to paxlovid.iassist.com and enroll in the patient assistance program. They can also call 877-219-7225 to sign up. Those on Medicare, Medicaid or who are uninsured should then be able to get Paxlovid free either from pharmacies or through the mail. Those with private insurance might be charged a co-pay, but the patient access program can also help to reduce that amount.
David from Maryland also recently had covid. But when he called his local Harris Teeter pharmacy to check that his prescription had been filled, he said he was told that Paxlovid wasn’t covered and that he would have to pay $1,400 for the five-day supply. He called another pharmacy, a CVS, and this time he was told there was no charge. “I got it filled in two hours,” he wrote.
I posed this scenario to the senior federal health official, who provided a couple of explanations. To begin, there are millions of doses of Paxlovid that the federal government had purchased that are still in various pharmacies around the United States. It’s possible that the second pharmacy David went to had that supply and gave it to him free of charge.
In addition, some pharmacies are out of network on certain insurance plans. If you are quoted the list price of the medication from one pharmacy, it’s worth calling other pharmacies to see whether it’s available free or at a significantly discounted price.
“There’s no one in America that should have to pay $1,400 for this product,” the official told me.
That’s just one barrier to accessing Paxlovid. Other readers had trouble convincing their doctors that they needed it.
Ben from Massachusetts wrote that his mother is in a nursing home and “has every possible risk factor (I think literally) for severe covid.” She developed a cough and lost her sense of taste. She asked for Paxlovid if she tested positive but was told “they don’t use it due to all the side effects.”
Similarly, when Mark from Washington and his wife (both 65 or older) had covid last June, she got Paxlovid, but he did not. “Our doctor would not prescribe Paxlovid, as I also took a low-dose statin drug. No option was given to temporarily stop [taking] simvastatin. My wife tested negative for covid after finishing her five-day treatment. She felt much better, just a little tired. I had 103-degree fever for days, terrible joint pain, cough and headache. This went on for more than two weeks, and I did not test negative for covid until Day 18.”
Mark spoke with his doctor after, who said that he was “just playing it safe.” But, in his view, “it was not safe not to prescribe Paxlovid.”
Mark is right. There needs to be far more education of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health-care professionals about the benefit-risk trade-off of Paxlovid. Side effects are minor compared with the prospect of severe disease from covid, and most drug interactions can be managed.
Readers were also frustrated that their providers have resisted giving them “just in case” medications. One of these readers is Paul Newhouse, a psychiatrist and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Cognitive Medicine in Nashville.
“I am a physician-scientist and have survived a hematologic malignancy,” he wrote. “Yet I could not get my geriatrician to give me prophylactic prescription for Paxlovid when I traveled to Poland last summer for a scientific meeting, to take in case I developed covid. She told me that their ‘policy’ forbids this kind of medication. But I can recall years ago that I was provided antibiotics when I traveled to Thailand. (I did get ill that time and was glad to have the antibiotics.) It is very irritating that physicians seem very reluctant to prescribe Paxlovid, even for high-risk patients such as myself.”
I agree. It’s routine for physicians to prescribe an albuterol inhaler in case someone’s asthma suddenly worsens. And when people visit certain international locations, they often carry an antibiotic prescription in the event that they develop severe traveler’s diarrhea. Paxlovid should be no different. The drug is fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration, just like albuterol and antibiotics. There is no shortage of Paxlovid, and there is no legal or ethical reason to deny someone this “just in case” prescription.
It is a travesty that only 1 in 6 people at high risk for severe covid are being prescribed this lifesaving drug. This must change, and I appreciate the work of readers who are helping to educate one another and their providers.
Have you used the new Paxlovid Patient Access Program? Are there other issues you’ve encountered in trying to obtain antiviral treatment for covid-19? Please write to me, and I will try to include your comments in a future edition of The Checkup."

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the operation, carried out at President Biden’s direction and “in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks” against U.S. and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria, targeted Kataib Hezbollah. The militia is active in both countries and has claimed numerous attacks against Americans.
Kataib Hezbollah is under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which said in a statement that one fighter was killed and two were injured when the Jazeera Operations Command, near the Syrian border, was targeted. It said a training facility in the Jurf al-Nasr area was also destroyed.
“The President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend them and our interests,” Austin said. “We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks.”
The strikes, which occurred very early on Wednesday local time, marked the latest in what has become a regular drumbeat of military action as the militias seek to drive U.S. personnel out of Iraq and Syria. The militias are part of a broader network that receives Iranian training and weapons, and they have called for violence in response to Israel’s military campaign against Hamas, another group supported by Tehran.
On Saturday, the militants launched numerous ballistic missiles at Ain al-Asad Air Base, an Iraqi facility that houses U.S. troops. “Most” of the missiles were intercepted by U.S. air-defense systems on the base, officials have said, but some did reach the installation.
Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said earlier Tuesday that four American personnel were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, but returned to duty.
U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations across the Middle East, said in a statement that the retaliatory strikes targeted “headquarters, storage, and training locations” for rocket, missile and one-way attack drones.
The statement did not disclose how the strikes were carried out. Recent military action by the U.S. military in Iraq has been carried out primarily with fighter jets.
Since October, at least 151 attacks have targeted U.S. positions in Iraq and Syria, according to Pentagon data. Ryder said Tuesday that American officials were looking into reports of a new attack on al-Asad.

Here’s what to know.,Teddy Amenabar,"January 25, 2024 at 12:16 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/25/robitussin-cough-syrup-recall-contamination/,"If you recently purchased cough syrup, check your medicine cabinet. Several lots of cough syrup made by the popular brand Robitussin have been recalled because of microbial contamination.
Those who are immunocompromised could have severe or life-threatening complications such as fungemia or a “disseminated fungal infection” from using the cough syrup, according to the FDA.
The agency said most consumers will not develop the same life-threatening infections after using the product. But it said it can’t rule out the possibility of an infection that would require “medical intervention.”
Consumers who have experienced “any problems that may be related to taking or using the product” should contact their physician, the FDA said. People can report any adverse reactions associated with the recalled Robitussin cough syrup to the FDA online, or by mail or fax.
No adverse events have been reported to the company.
To treat a lingering cough, doctors say, hydration and hot beverages help and may provide the same relief as over-the-counter medications and cough syrups.
Any “thick and sweet” syrups such as honey may suppress your cough by soothing the nerves in the back of your throat, said Peter Dicpinigaitis, director of the Montefiore Cough Center and editor in chief of the journal Lung.
Some doctors said this winter respiratory virus season is worse than previous years’, as they are seeing more patients complaining of coughs that won’t go away.
A persistent cough after a respiratory virus is often a “sign of a lingering inflammatory response to that initial illness,” said Russell Buhr, a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at UCLA Health in Los Angeles. Consult a doctor for coughs that last more than a few weeks.

BJ0RG5MDP0_Z7GWFHLHW7F67NJ,Over 1 million rally in Germany against rising power of far-right party,Kate Brady,"January 22, 2024 at 7:47 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/22/germany-rally-afd-berlin/,"BERLIN — Demonstrations against the far-right Alternative for Germany party swept the country this weekend, strengthening calls to ban the party, after a report that AfD members had discussed plans for mass deportations.
The report appears to have served as a wake-up call for Germans opposed to the group, whose popularity has surged in recent months, and an estimated 1.4 million people hit the streets over the weekend.
In Hamburg and Munich, rallies had to be dispersed because significantly more people than expected attended. Images from across the country showed masses of people braving bitter temperatures to fill city squares and avenues. According to police figures, in Berlin on Sunday, about 100,000 people gathered on the lawns of the Reichstag, which houses Germany’s lower house of parliament.
Germany’s far-right party wins mayoral election, showing group’s rising appeal
Placards at the protests stressed Germany’s particular responsibility to stand up to the far right, given the country’s dark history under Nazi rule, which led to the Holocaust. “Never again is now” and “Now we can see what we would have done in our grandparents’ position,” read some banners.
The protests were prompted by an investigative report earlier in January revealing that AfD members met with far-right extremists in Potsdam in November to discuss a “remigration” plan for when the AfD might come to power. According to the report by the nonprofit research institute Correctiv, Martin Sellner, leader of the Austrian Identitarian Movement, proposed a “master plan” that would “reverse the settlement of foreigners.” The focus would be asylum seekers, non-Germans with residency rights and “non-assimilated” German citizens, the report said.
The idea of sending people to a “model state” in North Africa also was reportedly discussed — similar to a 1940 Nazi plan to deport millions of Jews to Madagascar.
With less than six months to go until Germans head to the polls in European parliamentary election, the AfD continues to maintain its months-long hold on second position in national polls. At around 22 percent, the party is behind the conservative opposition, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, known as the CDU/CSU, by only single digits.
The approval ratings of the center-left governing coalition, meanwhile, have plummeted to record lows amid higher costs of living, a budget crisis and the debate over migration.
Protests over the past week have underlined the sense of urgency among many voters to have the AfD banned before regional elections in the fall. In September, voters will head to the polls in three eastern states — Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia — where the AfD is polling as the strongest party.
Asked last week whether the Interior Ministry was surprised by the Correctiv report, a ministry spokeswoman told journalists that “we cannot comment on intelligence here.” The country’s domestic intelligence “has its eye on these things,” Britta Beylage-Haarmann said.
In the wake of the report, comparisons were immediately drawn to the 1942 Wannsee Conference, also in Potsdam, at which senior Nazi officials formulated the “Final Solution to the Jewish Question.”
Leading legal organizations in Germany strongly condemned the plans detailed in the report, warning that the November meeting should not turn out to be a “second Wannsee Conference.”
“It is an attack on the constitution and the liberal constitutional state,” a group of six organizations, including the German Association of Judges and the German Bar Association, said last week. “The legal legitimacy of such fantasies [of mass deportation] must be prevented by all legal and political means.”
Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, urged caution when making comparisons with the Wannsee Conference, however.
“The industrial mass murder of European Jews is unique in history in its coldbloodedness and madness,” Schuster told the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur on Monday. He added, however, that the “meeting in Potsdam between AfD officials and the Identitarian Movement is without question evidence of a brutality in thinking that is directed against the foundations of our democratic society.”
Politicians, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who attended one of the initial protests in his constituency of Potsdam, condemned the far-right meeting. Any plan to expel immigrants or citizens alike amounts to “an attack against our democracy and, in turn, on all of us,” he said.
The AfD has been designated as “right extremist” in three of Germany 16 states. But the legal hurdle to ban the party is extremely high. Germany’s constitution allows for the banning of parties that “seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order,” and the country’s Constitutional Court has done it only twice.
The Socialist Reich Party, a successor to the Nazi party, was banned in 1952, and the Communist Party of Germany was banned in 1956. In 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD) was too insignificant to prohibit, despite meeting the ideological criteria for a ban.
Berlin farmers protest gains support amid nation’s winter of discontent
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said last week, however, that she doesn’t “rule out” a procedure to ban the AfD, even if the hurdles for this “constitutional last resort” are high. Such a step would be the “sharpest sword” available, Faeser told regional broadcaster SWR.
Justice Minister Marco Buschmann has expressed skepticism about such ban proceedings, however.
Authorities have to be “100 percent sure” they will be successful if they want to pursue this course, Buschmann told the German weekly Welt am Sonntag. “If such a procedure were to fail before the Constitutional Court, it would be a huge PR victory for the AfD,” he added.
A shift in rhetoric has also been evident among leading German CEOs who have long dodged questions about the surge in support for the AfD. Lars Redeligx, CEO of Düsseldorf Airport, said the findings of the Correctiv investigation made it necessary to speak out.
“These thoughts that are a threat to the constitution are poison for Germany as an economic location,” he said. “It threatens our peaceful coexistence, it threatens our prosperity, and sends out a fatal signal to the world.”
The Potsdam revelations have increased concerns that Germany’s image as an attractive destination for foreign investment and skilled workers could be jeopardized at a time when an aging population and a shortage of domestic skilled workers are hindering growth.
The AfD says banning the party would be “undemocratic.” In the aftermath of the Correctiv report, it has sought to play down the Potsdam meeting. At a news conference last week, party co-leader Alice Weidel accused Correctiv employees of infiltrating and spying on the private meeting “using secret service methods in disregard of personal rights.”
Large demonstrations against the AfD were last seen in 2017 and 2018 after the party was elected to the Bundestag, the first time in nearly six decades that a far-right party had entered parliament. The turnout this weekend eclipsed the scale of those protests."

If sailing through the locks of the Panama Canal is on your travel bucket list, book quickly! Unless you’re okay with the itinerary changing into a 40-mile overland hike.
All right, things are perhaps not quite that dire, but as the Editorial Board reports, climate change has driven the water levels of the reservoir that feeds the canal perilously low, bottlenecking global trade through the route.
Panama has some short-term solutions in sight, but the board writes that “it’s not certain that Panama can come up with a definitive answer.” It joins river and canal systems across the globe that are similarly mired.
In the long term, the board says, the only way to stop these problems growing is to prevent additional warming.
For better or worse, U.S. energy — both fossil fuels and renewables — is booming right now, Catherine Rampell writes. Ironically, neither party is able to tout the achievement.
On fossil fuels, Republicans can’t crow that the United States is producing more oil than any other country in history because that ruins the narrative that the industry is overregulated and undersupported. Democrats, meanwhile, would obviously alienate their climate-minded base.
On renewables, Republicans (even in the states benefiting most from wind and solar!) can’t talk about green energy because, as Catherine writes, it’s “still politically coded as lefty, even when it makes plenty of conservatives rich.” And Democrats are victim to their opponents’ very successful messaging that energy is zero-sum and that growth in renewables hurts other industries.
From George Will’s column ridiculing several GOP senators’ position that U.S. Steel remaining U.S.-owned is integral to national security. The corporation is not even in the top 3 steelmakers domestically.
So, George writes, these economically illiterate Republicans ought to bless the sale to Japanese firm Nippon Steel, which “intends to modernize, not liquidate, U.S. Steel” and vows to keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh to boot.
George suspects that someway, somehow, domestic steelmaking will manage to scrape together the 3 percent of its output that goes toward defense purposes … even once the fourth-biggest domestic producer is owned by a superior company based in — heaven forfend — one of America’s greatest allies.
Gene Robinson cares about the GOP. Here, he says, sit down, GOP; we’re worried about you.
“No one has ever mistaken me for a conservative,” Gene writes, “but I believe our democracy functions best when there is healthy, fact-based competition between liberal and conservative viewpoints.”
Alas, that isn’t happening with today’s version of the party, which has once again fully given itself over to Donald Trump. Gene recalls the 2020 convention, at which the party didn’t even pull together a platform but instead gave a blank check to the former president’s agenda, “whatever that might be at any given moment.”
“The GOP is a cult,” Gene rules, “held in thrall by an unstable bully and would-be authoritarian.”
But, boy, is that bully funny, Shadi Hamid writes, and his incoherent ideology is a feature, not a bug.
Shadi’s column looks at what makes Trump so appealing to so many; the movement he has created is “extreme without being dogmatic,” which suits an angry, unprincipled America just fine.
Shadi says, “This twisted authenticity and indifference to any greater cause or vision — combined with his charisma and comedic timing — is a sort of superpower.” If Trump wins again, it will be off this ability.
That won’t do anything to help the country, though — nor will it do anything to help the GOP. Only one thing can save the party from itself, Gene writes: “Defeat. Crushing, unambiguous defeat.”

Today’s edition: The Biden administration is ramping up its focus on abortion rights as the general election nears. Why the president’s age could hurt his chances with independents in New Hampshire. But first …
Medicare Advantage plans are booming — 30.8 million of the 60 million Americans with Medicare are now enrolled in the private plans rather than the traditional government-run program.
But a little-known fact: Once you’re in a Medicare Advantage plan, you may not be able to get out.
Traditional Medicare usually requires beneficiaries to pay 20 percent of their medical bills after their deductibles are met — a potentially ruinous expense that most people cover in part with a private supplemental plan called Medigap. But unless you sign up for Medigap soon after you’re first eligible, insurers can often deny coverage or charge steeper premiums based on preexisting conditions.
Medicare Advantage can look pretty attractive to new Medicare beneficiaries, especially if they’re healthy. While there are co-payments and deductibles, annual out-of-pocket expenses are capped — unlike in traditional Medicare. Many Advantage plans offer low (or zero) premiums compared with the traditional program, while often including drug coverage and sometimes low-cost vision, hearing and dental benefits.
They are also heavily marketed, contributing to their growth, said Christine Huberty, a lead benefit specialist supervising attorney at the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources.
“They’re out there, they’re talked about, and I think there’s a little bit of lack of education too,” she said. “People don’t really know what they’re signing up for or what their options are.”
But when enrollees start to depend on the insurance for “bigger issues,” Huberty said, “that’s when people realize, ‘Oh no, this isn’t going to help me at all.’” By then, it may be too late to sign up for a Medigap plan.
Or as David Lipschutz at the Center for Medicare Advocacy put it: “When it comes to Medicare Advantage plans, some people swear by them and other people swear at them.”
Advantage plans control their costs by limiting their customers’ selection of hospitals and doctors and requiring prior authorization for some care — a process detested by doctors and patients. The Biden administration issued new requirements for prior authorization last week, following complaints from major physician and hospital lobbies.
Medicare Advantage open enrollment is happening now through the end of March. It’s a sort of “buyer’s remorse” window, when anyone who entered 2024 already signed up for an Advantage plan can switch plans or go back to traditional Medicare.
David Meyers at Brown University School of Public Health said about 15 percent of Advantage customers change enrollment annually. Most switch to another Advantage plan.
After I wrote about this issue recently for KFF Health News, I heard from retired pharmacist Jami Holt. The 66-year-old Virginia resident signed up for Medicare last year and “ended up calling a broker who helped explain it.”
Holt said the decision was scary: “I had to make the right decision at that moment.” She picked traditional Medicare and also signed up for a Medigap policy.
But Holt’s husband is on Medicare Advantage. It “works pretty well” but carries a higher deductible than her Medigap plan. “If you have one hospitalization, you’re going to run the bill,” she said.
Holt said she and her husband would like to move him to traditional Medicare, but he has a chronic condition that would make it “cost-prohibitive.”
The inability of most Advantage enrollees to switch back to traditional Medicare has been a known concern for years in policy circles, said Tricia Neuman, executive director of KFF’s Program on Medicare Policy.
One solution under discussion, she said, is putting a limit on out-of-pocket spending under traditional Medicare. That would increase federal spending on the program and might offset the need to increase Medigap premiums when beneficiaries enroll.
Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy at the University of Southern California, said another possible solution is to allow current beneficiaries to enroll in Medigap during specific enrollment periods each year without facing rejection for preexisting conditions, but to let insurers charge higher premiums — say an extra 20 percent for the first year or two.
That might still be too much of a burden for many Medicare beneficiaries; half had income under $30,000 in 2019.
With so many people enrolled in Advantage plans, “the current effective barrier on moving back to traditional Medicare is really a problem that policymakers should want to address,” Ginsburg said.

Vice President Harris framed the fight for abortion access in searing terms in battleground Wisconsin yesterday, highlighting what she called “the horrific reality that women are facing every single day” since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade 18 months ago, The Post’s Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Dan Diamond report.
Harris left little doubt that her remarks were aimed in large part at Donald Trump. “The former president handpicked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. He intended for them to take away your freedoms. And it is a decision he brags about.”
The bigger picture: The vice president’s appearance on the 51st anniversary of Roe came as the Biden administration launched a full-court press this week to mobilize the Democratic base around the fight for reproductive freedom. The effort is notable in part because the president has shown discomfort when it comes to offering a full-throated embrace of abortion rights — an area where his private faith as a Catholic may be at odds with Democrats’ public position.
As the general election campaign draws nearer, it is not yet clear whether Biden will begin speaking more forcefully and frequently about the issue, or if he will leave much of the argument to surrogates and supporters. He only briefly mentioned the word “abortion” during his remarks yesterday, making sure to stipulate that he was not pushing for “abortion on demand” but for codifying the protections in Roe.
Vice President Harris:
I am back in Wisconsin today to kick off my Fight For Reproductive Freedoms Tour on the 51st anniversary of Roe.I am traveling our nation to make clear: @POTUS and I will never stop fighting to protect a woman’s ability to make decisions about her own body. pic.twitter.com/NJGN91knij
A coalition of reproductive rights groups officially launched a campaign to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s constitution, Sara Wilson reports for Colorado Newsline.
The supporters of Initiative 89 have until April 26 to collect the roughly 125,000 valid voter signatures necessary to make it on the November ballot. If approved, the proposal would also lift the state’s ban on public funding for abortions, which advocates say limits access for state employees and residents on Medicaid.
Yes, but: Voters could face two opposing ballot measures on abortion in the fall. Antiabortion advocates started collecting signatures months ago for an amendment that would ban all types of abortion and define a fertilized egg as an “alive” human being, among other actions.
New this a.m.: President Biden’s age comes up frequently on the campaign trail among Trump-supporting Republicans, but independents who backed him in the last election increasingly say he’s too old to run again, The Post’s Colby Itkowitz and Dylan Wells report.
In New Hampshire, where independents voting today can choose which primary to participate in, many have seemed interested in Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, who, at age 52, has pitched herself as part of a next generation of leaders.
Haley is most directly positioned to benefit from real concerns about Biden’s age in the Granite State, where voters are worried about the 81-year-old president falling or another medical emergency, and used words like “old” and “tired” to describe him. But it’s unclear how independents — who form roughly 30 percent of the American electorate — will behave in the general election if, as polls suggest, the matchup will ultimately be between Biden and Trump, who is 77.

Rep. Burgess wants his Health Care Task Force to be an ‘incubator’ for ideas
Forty-seven members of Congress have announced plans to retire, resign or run for other offices at the end of this term, setting the stage for major turnover in the next election. Among those departing are four members of the GOP Doctors Caucus, including its co-chair, Rep. Michael Burgess (Tex.).
Eleven terms in, the obstetrician-gynecologist is the senior-most physician in Congress, where he leads the House Budget Committee’s Health Care Task Force. I caught up with Burgess this month to talk about some of the health policy issues he’ll focus on in his final year in the lower chamber.
H202: What prompted you to help launch the Budget Committee’s Health Care Task Force last year?
Burgess: Because no matter where you are, health care is the key driver of debt, and national debt is a big headline at over $34 trillion and growing. But at the same time, as a doc, I know we’ve got to ensure patient access to care. I want to nail down access to those next-level cures that we all know are coming. So that’s the whole purpose in me spending energy in this realm.
H202: What are some of your priorities for the task force this year?
Burgess: My biggest concern in the pharmaceutical world is that when you get a big breakthrough drug, it’s going to be expensive right out of the box, but downstream it’s going to deliver significant savings. So how do we reconcile what the cost is today with what the overall savings are going to be?
That’s where the Preventive Health Savings Act is going to begin to try to bridge that gap. We’ve had a hearing on the bill, we’ve put it through several iterations, and we’ve improved it. Watch this space, because we are going to be having a markup in the near future.
There are a lot of other things we need to explore. One of the things that scares me to death is the Biden administration coming out and saying “You know what? For these new novel therapies that are very, very expensive, we are going to use our march-in rights and take the patents.” Oh my God. What are you going to do to the research in cell and gene therapies for these things, these breakthroughs that people are literally dying for?
This is not the right way to go. The task force is going to try to be an incubator for new ideas, which is a stark contrast to the Biden administration — they’re anti-innovation, anti-patient in so many ways.
H202: One area that has gotten a lot of attention recently is prior authorization. As a physician, do you have any insights into how this impacts health-care spending and patient access?
Burgess: Prior authorization is a misapplication of your energy. You’ve identified as a doc how to remedy the problem that the patient has brought to you, and now prior authorization comes in and says, “Yeah, we know your diagnosis is right, we know your treatments are right, but we’re going to make you jump through all these hoops before the care is delivered.” Guess what? That doesn’t really save any money unless the poor person dies in the process and never gets the care. What a terrible way to approach fixing a problem that a patient has brought to you.
I’ll share a secret with you: I’m on a Medicare Advantage plan —  it’s not the way I expected to end up, but because of some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, I’ve ended up here. So it’s personal to me. If there is a prior authorization requirement on something that I need, I don’t like the idea that someone’s going to hold me up for days, weeks, even months, before I get the answer that we all know is coming anyway. The only way that they’re saving money is by rationing and waiting lines. That’s not really good patient care.
H202: I’m glad you brought up the ACA. Do you envision changes to Obamacare if a Republican wins the White House in November?
Burgess: There are any number of things in the ACA that have been removed or repealed by executive orders or legislative action.
When you really look back on the history of things, the cost to families was getting prohibitive. Anyone outside of the subsidy window in my district was coming to me and saying, “You’re killing us here with these premiums.” President Trump signed an executive order that allowed more competition in the insurance space with limited duration plans, and that immediately brought premiums back down to Earth. So we know there are things that can be done to the ACA that really seem like pretty minimal changes, but have a big budgetary impact.
H202: You’ve announced that you won’t seek reelection at the end of this term, along with several other members of the GOP doctors caucus. How do you think that loss will impact Republicans’ ability to move their health-care agenda forward?
Burgess: First off, I’m not going anywhere. Maybe they should have listened to me more before, but they have my phone number. This encyclopedic knowledge of health-care policy I have isn’t going to disappear, so if my counsel is needed it can certainly be sought.
I can’t say anything about other people who are retiring, we all make our own individual decisions. In my case, my wife told me I was too old. And since she decided to stay married to me for 50 years, I thought maybe I ought to listen.
Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) spoke to reporters yesterday ahead of next week’s vote on whether to compel two CEOs to testify in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, The Post’s Dan Diamond writes for The Health 202.
The panel’s Democrats in November demanded that Johnson & Johnson CEO Joaquin Duato, Merck CEO Robert Davis and Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner testify at a hearing — originally scheduled for yesterday — that would have probed the companies’ pricing practices and questioned why U.S. drug prices are much higher than those of other countries.
Boerner agreed to testify if he is joined by another CEO, Sanders said, but Duato and Davis have so far refused.
“We have to demand that the CEOs explain to the American public why these prices are so high,” Markey said. “We can create a health care system worthy of the American people when pharmaceutical companies take a seat at the table and deliver innovative groundbreaking medications at a price that the American people can actually afford.”
Sanders, who chairs the panel, returned to a regular talking point: that the pharmaceutical lobby has too much sway in Washington and is not being reined in.
The vote is scheduled for next Wednesday. If successful, it would be the first time the panel has issued subpoenas since 1981.

Political concerns within the World Health Organization about U.S support for Israel delayed the deployment of experts charged with preventing the spread of infectious disease from Gaza to neighboring regions, my colleague Lena H. Sun reports.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to send an epidemiologist to the WHO’s Cairo office next week, nearly three months after it first offered support to the U.N. agency, which seeks to remain impartial in global conflicts.
A closer look: The question was whether there would be “a perception of a lack of neutrality from WHO if we got support from CDC,” said Rick Brennan, emergency director of the WHO region headquartered in Cairo. Brennan downplayed the role political sensitivities played in the delay, saying logistics take time to work out, especially over the holidays.
But the setback drew consternation within the CDC as outbreaks of disease began to ravage a displaced population. Agency employees have called on the CDC to take a greater and more public role in the conflict, arguing that its lack of visibility in Gaza contrasts sharply with its responses in other humanitarian crises, according to internal communications shared with The Post.
The U.S. assisted living industry faced scrutiny yesterday from a bipartisan group of lawmakers who pressed for answers about low staffing, high costs and a lack of transparency surrounding poor care and preventable deaths at the facilities, The Post’s Christopher Rowland and Douglas MacMillan report.
The main question before the Senate Special Committee on Aging: Should the industry be subject to federal regulation, like nursing homes?
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sided with patient advocates in their push for stricter federal oversight, arguing that consumers can’t be assured they will get quality care without national standards. Across the aisle, the committee’s top Republican, Sen. Mike Braun (Ind.), said he favors state regulations but called for a stronger government role in promoting transparency about costs and quality in facilities.
Chairman Bob Casey (D-Pa.) didn’t commit to particular provisions that could be considered by Congress, but he asked the public to share their experiences to help inform future deliberations. Assisted-living operators have warned against pursuing uniform standards, arguing that they would damage the industry and drive up costs.
The top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Finance Committee are taking on generic drug shortages in the United States.
In a white paper published yesterday, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) outlined policy options under Medicare and Medicaid that the committee is exploring to address factors contributing to the shortages. Their proposals include changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and reforms to stabilize the supply of generic sterile injectables.
Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho):

CDHUT98FCF_CAKGNZZAVKJY36V,"Dexter Scott King, younger son of Martin Luther King Jr., dies at 62",_,"January 22, 2024 at 2:44 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/22/dexter-scott-king-dies/,"Dexter Scott King, the younger son of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, and who worked to preserve his father’s legacy, died Jan. 22 at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 62.
The cause was prostate cancer, the nonprofit Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta announced. Dexter King was the King Center’s chairman at the time of his death.
The third of the Kings’ four children, Dexter King was born in Atlanta on Jan. 30, 1961, and was named for the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala., where his father served as a pastor when the Montgomery bus boycott launched him to national prominence in the wake of the 1955 arrest of Rosa Parks.
Dexter King was 7 years old when his father was assassinated in April 1968 while supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis. In his 2004 memoir, “Growing Up King,” Dexter King recalled his father’s slaying as the end of a carefree childhood.
He recounted the burden of living in his father’s shadow and struggling with an undiagnosed attention-deficit disorder. He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, his father’s alma mater, but did not graduate.
“It was very difficult for people to treat me as a normal person,” he told People magazine. “It was like, ‘Why is he here?’ It taught me that I was going to have to be self-determining.”
He then worked as a corrections officer in Atlanta and a music promoter, among other jobs, and in 1989 served briefly as president of the King Center. “I had the title, but I really didn’t have the authority,” he later explained, noting conflicts with his mother.
He remained involved with the center as head of the special events office before succeeding his mother in 1995 as director and chief executive of the King Center. Much of his work involved protecting the King family’s intellectual property.
Dexter King made headlines when he publicly declared that he believed James Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty in 1969 to murdering his father, was innocent. They met in 1997 at a Nashville prison amid an unsuccessful push by King family members to have Ray stand trial, hoping the case would reveal evidence of a broader conspiracy.
Ray, who would have faced the death penalty if convicted at trial, recanted soon after pleading guilty and spun a web of shadowy conspiracies and claimed to have been “set up.”
When Ray said during their prison meeting that he was not the killer, Dexter King replied: “I believe you and my family believes you.” But Ray never got a trial. He died from liver failure the following year.
Over the years, other associates of Martin Luther King Jr. raised the possibility of other conspirators, but a comprehensive congressional study in 1978 concluded Ray was the lone killer, and a highly praised book on the matter by journalist Gerald Posner also came to the same conclusion.
Coretta Scott King died in 2006, followed by the Kings’ oldest child, Yolanda, in 2007.
Survivors include his wife of 11 years, Leah Weber King; and two siblings, Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Bernice King.
Dexter King and his siblings, who shared control of the family estate, didn’t always agree on how to uphold their parents’ legacy.
In one particularly bitter disagreement, the siblings ended up in court after Dexter King and his brother in 2014 sought to sell the Nobel Peace Prize their father was awarded in 1964 along with the civil rights leader’s traveling Bible used by President Barack Obama for his second inauguration. Bernice King said she found the notion unthinkable.
The King siblings settled the dispute in 2016 after former President Jimmy Carter served as a mediator. The items were turned over to the brothers, but other terms of the settlement were kept confidential."
CTUIEY366E_LN0WJQEJBUDL592,"At Va. rally, Biden and Harris blast Trump for antiabortion push",Toluse Olorunnipa,"January 23, 2024 at 6:36 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/biden-harris-abortion-rights-ally-virginia/,"MANASSAS, Va. — President Biden, Vice President Harris and their spouses appeared together for a campaign rally here focused on “reproductive freedom,” a political show of force designed to blast former president Donald Trump over abortion and keep the issue front and center ahead of November’s elections.
The Tuesday afternoon rally, which was interrupted several times by pro-Palestinian protesters, took place as voters in New Hampshire were casting ballots in a primary that could prove pivotal in determining the trajectory of the 2024 presidential race.
Aware that a win by Trump in New Hampshire could effectively end the GOP nominating contest, kick-starting the general election earlier than any time in recent memory, Biden attacked his predecessor by name multiple times.
“Let’s remember, it was Donald Trump and his Supreme Court who ripped away the rights and freedoms of women in America,” he told the crowd at a performing arts center near George Mason University. “It will be Joe Biden and Kamala D. Harris and all of you who will restore those rights.”
His speech was interrupted at least 1o times by pro-Palestinian protesters, including people chanting “Genocide Joe!” and “Free Palestine!” and waving flags that said “Stop Genocide.”
“This is going to go on for a while,” Biden said after one outburst. “They’ve got this planned.”
After each interruption, the crowd erupted into chants of “Four more years!” and “Let’s go Joe!,” and Biden continued with his speech, declining to address the situation in the Gaza Strip. Still, the constant disruption signaled how much Biden’s support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza — which has led to the deaths of more than 25,000 people — has become a ubiquitous political liability for the president.
Biden’s remarks on abortion highlighted a key issue on which Democrats have seen repeated success over the past two years, with voters turning out in droves to oppose limitations on the procedure enabled by the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.
Biden, a practicing Catholic, has at times seemed constrained in his public comments on abortion, balancing his personal beliefs and politics. During a fundraiser last year, he said, “I’m not big on abortion,” while reiterating that he would like to see the protections of Roe codified into law.
During a meeting of his top officials at the White House on Monday, Biden made sure to stipulate that he was not pushing for “abortion on demand” but rather federal policy that would codify the protections that the Supreme Court outlined in its 1973 Roe decision.
“I believe Roe v. Wade was right. I’m not supporting — they didn’t support abortion on demand,” he said at the event, which marked the 51st anniversary of the landmark ruling. “It was Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade was the decision. And the majority of Americans agreed.”
Harris has at times led the administration’s messaging on the issue, attacking “extremist” Republicans for banning abortions.
“Across our nation, women are suffering — and let us be very clear about who is responsible,” Harris said Tuesday. “Former president Trump handpicked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. He intended for them to take your freedoms. He is the architect of this health-care crisis. And he is not done.”
Her appearance came one day after she traveled to Wisconsin to kick off what’s expected to be a nationwide tour focused on abortion, which the Biden campaign has framed as part of a broader set of personal freedoms under threat by a second Trump presidency.
For his part, Trump has sought to take a more politically palatable approach to abortion after Republicans faced  losses in races where abortion access was a central issue.
During a Fox News town hall this month, he talked about being in favor of allowing the procedure in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. Trump, who has referred to six-week abortion bans as “harsh,” said at the town hall that “a lot of women don’t know if they’re pregnant at five or six weeks,” echoing a message Democrats have used successfully. He has not campaigned in favor of a national abortion ban.
“I will say this, you have to win elections,” Trump said. “Otherwise you are going to be back where you were. You can’t ever let that happen again.”
Democrats and advocates have countered by pointing out that it was Trump who appointed three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. They have resurfaced and circulated clips of Trump boasting about the Supreme Court’s decision and suggesting that women who undergo abortions should receive some form of “punishment.”
“Donald Trump is responsible for overturning Roe,” said Mini Timmaraju, head of Reproductive Freedom for All, the activist organization formerly known as the National Abortion Rights Action League. “We have to pin it on him.”
Trump’s performance in the New Hampshire primary, which typically features more moderate voters, could be a test of his handling of the abortion issue. Biden’s name is not on the ballot in the state, after Democrats changed their primary schedule for 2024, selecting the more diverse South Carolina as the first primary, on Feb. 3.
So, as Republicans focused much of their attention on New Hampshire, Biden, Harris, Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff were about 35 miles outside Washington speaking to a crowd of a few hundred supporters.
Biden campaign officials said the location of the rally in Northern Virginia was resonant because the state’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, had sought to prove last year that the 15-week abortion restriction he supported was a reasonable position backed by a majority of voters. Youngkin’s party lost several seats in the November legislative election, and Democrats captured control of the House of Delegates.
While the president largely has steered clear of using the word “abortion” — instead opting for terms like “freedom,” “choice” and “care” — his Republican critics have not shied away from challenging him on the issue.
“Joe Biden dodges questions on abortion limitations because he knows that Democrats’ support for abortion on demand … is out of touch with the mainstream,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Tuesday in a statement.
At the same time, even some Democrats are suggesting that Biden could offer more clarity on the issue.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said recently that “it would be good” if Biden spoke more about abortion in public.
“I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting,” she said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “And I think he has said that. To use maybe more blunt language, maybe that would be helpful.”"
CW8KF4E6HM_MP0U8N08GZALHY8,These were the most on-time airlines last year,_,"January 25, 2024 at 9:12 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/01/25/airline-on-time-rankings-flight-delays/,"If you flew Delta Air Lines last year, there’s a good chance your flight was on time. The carrier was the most punctual in the United States, according to new rankings from airline schedule data firm OAG. By this measure, 83.2 percent of Delta’s 1.6 million global flights arrived without a hitch.
And the airport with the most punctual flights? Few will be surprised that it was Minneapolis-St. Paul, a large Delta hub, where about 82.6 percent of flights left on schedule, despite its snow-packed location.
An on-time flight is defined as one that arrives within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival. Airlines supplied OAG with the data for its rankings, which include only carriers that provide information on at least 80 percent of their flights.
The on-time performance came during a challenging year for airlines. It kicked off with the outage of a key Federal Aviation Administration notification system in January that prompted the first nationwide halt in air traffic since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. A national air traffic controller shortage forced airlines to prune schedules. And severe weather disrupted flights in New York and elsewhere over the summer.
“Strong on-time performance results from Delta, American, United, and others point to a collective effort by the industry to overcome challenges,” OAG’s chief analyst, John Grant, said in a news release. He cited the operational issues airlines faced, as well as industry-wide maintenance and supply chain challenges.
After Delta, Alaska Airlines was the second most punctual among domestic carriers — and seventh worldwide — with 81 percent of flights arriving on time, OAG’s data shows. American Airlines flights were 79 percent on time, United Airlines nearly 79 percent and Southwest nearly 76 percent. Spirit Airlines and JetBlue Airways rounded out the list of U.S. airlines in OAG’s rankings, with 69.5 percent and 68.3 percent of flights, respectively, arriving on schedule.
Most U.S. airlines were more punctual last year than in 2022. Delta, Alaska and American improved by roughly two percentage points, while United performed about the same. Even laggard JetBlue improved by about four points.
Delta executives throughout the year praised the airline’s staff for its reliable operation. “Our people consistently deliver operational excellence with the relentless focus on raising the bar at every stage of the travel journey,” CEO Ed Bastian said earlier this month. The secret to on-time flights, however, runs deeper.
“The way you keep an airline on time is you schedule flights for a realistic amount of time, and have enough time on the ground between flights,” said Atmosphere Research Group travel analyst Henry Harteveldt. Delta, he continued, does both, scheduling flights for an appropriate duration, then providing enough time on the ground for staff to fully prepare planes for the next flight.
It helps that Delta’s busiest airports are Atlanta, Detroit and Minneapolis-St. Paul, none of which faces the same level of congestion in the air or on the tarmac that plagues many airports in the northeast and Florida.
Most flight delays in 2023 were airlines’ fault, according to the  Transportation Department — due to aircraft maintenance or a late crew, for example.
When a delay is the airline’s fault, it is responsible for accommodating travelers on another flight and, in some cases, offering meal or hotel vouchers, or even a refund. The DOT has a dashboard of travelers’ rights when airlines are responsible for the delay or cancellation.
But the shortage of air traffic controllers, coupled with severe weather last summer, played a significant role in punctuality in 2023.
In March, the FAA said national air traffic controller staffing was at 81 percent of target levels and, in the center that manages flights in and around New York City, at only 54 percent. As a result, it allowed airlines to cut flights by 10 percent at New York’s three main airports — John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — over the summer to minimize disruptions. Still, JetBlue faced 68 days of “significant operational disruption” in New York during the three months ending in September, airline President Joanna Geraghty said in an earnings call.
“Far worse September weather” and “unprecedented [air traffic control] restrictions” caused the disruptions, Geraghty said. Add to that the fact that a greater percentage of JetBlue’s flights than any other airline is in congested New York airspace, and the delays multiplied.
“If you are always driving on a congested highway, you are more prone to adverse conditions that might affect performance,” said Ahmed Abdelghany, associate dean in the David B. O’Maley College of Business at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. This means airlines flying in congested areas — like JetBlue in the northeast — are more susceptible to flight delays and cancellations.
Airport on-time rankings are largely outside of their direct control. Ones with plenty of capacity — runways, gates and other facilities to accommodate their full allotment of scheduled flights — are less likely to see delays than congested airports that operate near or at capacity, Abdelghany said.
Lack of congestion in the skies above is also important. For example, in New York, the FAA has very specific — and separate — routes for flights into and out of JFK, LaGuardia and Newark. If a direction is blocked by storms, one airport can see flight delays and cancellations spike while another continues to operate smoothly.
Then there is the simple fact that if an airport’s main airline is reliable, that airport probably is, too. The three airports with the most on-time departures in the United States last year — Minneapolis-St. Paul, Seattle-Tacoma and Atlanta — are all Delta hubs. Charlotte and Reagan National Airport rounded out the Top 5.

CY4K3IKZ5F_AKO608OLIWJZAY6,Political concerns about U.S. support for Israel slowed CDC help for Gaza,Lena H. Sun,"January 25, 2024 at 11:04 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/01/25/cdc-gaza-aid-israel/,"Political concerns about U.S. support for Israel delayed the deployment of experts charged with preventing the spread of infectious disease from Gaza to neighboring regions, according to four health experts, including three who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to start sending experts to support the World Health Organization’s Cairo office next week after nearly three months of discussions with the WHO, which seeks to remain neutral in global conflicts and avoid the politicization of health issues. The delay drew consternation within the CDC as outbreaks of disease began to ravage a displaced population, according to internal communications shared with The Washington Post.
The CDC, which has a long history of collaborating with the WHO, had reached out to the international health organization to offer support in October, about two weeks after the Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent declaration of war and bombardment of Gaza, according to a CDC official. But WHO officials raised concerns that the international community would view the U.N. agency as taking sides if U.S. government experts were assigned to WHO’s regional office in Cairo because of the United States’ military aid to Israel, according to WHO and CDC officials. The Biden administration’s unwavering support for Israel’s military campaign has drawn widespread international condemnation.
The question was whether there would be “a perception of a lack of neutrality from WHO if we got support from CDC,” said Rick Brennan, a public health physician and emergency director of the WHO region headquartered in Cairo, which covers 22 countries in the Middle East and northern Africa.
Brennan downplayed the role political sensitivities played in the delay, saying logistics amid humanitarian crises take time to work out, especially over the holidays. He said the WHO regional office had requested five CDC experts to bolster infectious-disease surveillance in Gaza and the neighboring countries of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. But the WHO was able to get personnel from elsewhere, including its Geneva headquarters, and narrowed its request to the CDC to one epidemiologist for the time being, Brennan said.
CDC Director Mandy Cohen announced at an internal meeting last week that the agency would deploy an Arabic-speaking epidemiologist to Cairo to support the WHO. The expert is scheduled to leave next week and stay for up to six months.
The Israel-Gaza conflict has been a particularly sensitive issue within the CDC. Cohen, who speaks frequently about the importance of her Jewish faith, sent an agency-wide email five days after the Hamas attack describing her sadness and anger. “Seeing tragic loss of life and escalating war has been very hard,” she wrote. She made no mention of Gaza, where the civilian toll from several days of Israeli bombing was already extensive and rapidly increasing, according to the Oct. 12 email.
More than 160 employees at the agency signed two letters to Cohen expressing frustration at her silence and the lack of a more visible CDC role in Gaza. They also urged the CDC to call for a cease-fire, support the restoration of access to safe drinking water, food, electricity and emergency services, and halt further “distribution of funding and armaments used to perpetrate violence and destruction of public health infrastructure,” according to copies of the letters shared with The Post.
During a town hall in early December that Cohen hosted with agency staff, one person pointed out Cohen’s remarks about Israel and asked for her comments about the violence in Gaza. Cohen responded: “We want to be reaching everyone in every corner of the world to make sure they are safe and healthy and protected,” according to a recording of the session shared with The Post. “I’m not the one who makes foreign policy for our government. But we’ll do whatever we can to provide the resources of CDC to make sure folks continue to be healthy around the world,” she added.
Four days later, on Dec. 8, Cohen sent an agency-wide email saying: “The conflict in Israel and Gaza is tragic, sad, and complex. Israelis and Palestinians deserve safety and security. … My heart is with every impacted family.” She said she and colleagues from the Department of Health and Human Services have offered “deepest condolences to health officials for the Palestinian Authority and Israel.” She said the U.S. Agency for International Development “continues to work to deliver food, medicine, water, and fuel to civilians in Gaza.”
A spokesperson for Cohen said she was not available for an interview in response to repeated requests for comment.
CDC employees say the agency’s lack of visibility in the Gaza war contrasts sharply with its responses in other humanitarian crises. CDC experts have worked with the agency’s offices in Ukraine, Eastern Europe and Central Asia to provide training on epidemiology in emergencies, rapid response teams, and mental health and psychosocial support.
But CDC officials say the agency does not typically deploy staff to active conflict zones, and it is not the lead agency during the earliest stages of disaster or humanitarian responses.
After more than 100 days of Israel’s military campaigns against Hamas, conditions in the Gaza Strip are fertile ground for disease to spread rapidly, public health experts have said. Hundreds of thousands of people are in makeshift shelters, with little access to toilets or clean water, aid workers have said. The United Nations is warning about looming famine. The WHO predicts that the death toll from sickness and starvation in coming months could eclipse the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza so far — more than 25,700, according to the latest count from the Gaza Health Ministry, with the majority of them women and children.
Public health experts are monitoring a hepatitis A outbreak, as well as a surge in acute respiratory infections and cases of jaundice and diarrhea. There have been more than 80,000 cases of diarrhea in children under 5 years old, a 23-fold increase from the 2022 baseline, according to WHO.
Cases of bloody diarrhea or dysentery can be life-threatening. Shigella, a type of bacteria that spreads easily and in recent years has become drug-resistant, is one of the most feared common culprits, health experts said. Another toll of poor sanitation: thousands of cases of scabies, lice, chickenpox and skin rashes, according to the WHO.
Experts are also worried that “massive levels of wound infections” from shrapnel and blast injuries could allow bacteria to become deeply embedded, Brennan said. Lack of proper treatment could lead to a spike in antibiotic-resistant pathogens, he said.
Public health experts say the Gaza situation is particularly challenging because it is impossible for aid groups to gain safe access to a population under siege and trapped within its borders.
“The limitations of humanitarian space, and the lack of water, sanitation, medicines, medical personnel and the collapse of the health system mean that if and when a real big epidemic comes, like a waterborne disease, such as cholera, we’re not going to be able to respond,” said Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Spiegel, a physician who has worked extensively in humanitarian emergencies in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, recently spent a month in Cairo supporting the U.N. response to the Gaza humanitarian crisis.
“Because of increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, these diseases will spread much more quickly and there’ll be a higher mortality, especially for children under 5,” Spiegel said.

CYLZC2TUET_ALQUTV1WDLD32RD,"Trump’s White House clinic improperly handed out narcotics, report finds",Joe Davidson,"January 25, 2024 at 3:03 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/trump-white-house-medical-unit-drugs-improper/,"It’s hard to imagine the president’s in-house health clinic as a rogue operation, but that’s the picture a Pentagon probe paints about the facility during the Trump administration.
The findings are clear and damaging.
“We found that the White House Medical Unit provided a wide range of health care and pharmaceutical services to ineligible White House staff in violation of Federal law and regulation and DoD policy,” says a new report from the Defense Department’s inspector general. “Additionally, the White House Medical Unit dispensed prescription medications, including controlled substances, to ineligible White House staff.”
Many of those served by the unit should not have been.
The report paints a scathing picture of the military-run facility with 60 medical personnel, who are tasked with treating the president, the vice president and the White House staff.
It also provides new context to systemic problems in a clinic that made headlines when Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), who was Donald Trump’s personal doctor until 2018, was accused by almost two dozen colleagues of improper activities, including providing prescription drugs without proper paperwork — a habit that allegedly earned him the nickname “Candyman.” A 2021 Defense Department inspector general report later corroborated some of those claims, which Jackson denied and described as politically motivated.
Jackson’s office said he “had no association or involvement with the White House Medical Unit’s clinical delivery of care” during the period covered by the new Pentagon report, which does not mention him.
The new report includes pharmaceutical procedures from 2017 to 2019 and patient eligibility practices from 2018 to 2020. Neither the pharmacy nor the clinical operations were credentialed by an outside agency. During those periods, the unit served between nine and 30 patients each week. “However,” the inspectors wrote, “we discovered that an average of 6 to 20 of these patients per week” were not eligible for the care.
Of the numerous problems with the medical unit, one of the most disturbing is its cavalier approach toward narcotics, particularly when the nation is suffering from a devastating opioid addition crisis.
“All phases of the White House Medical Unit’s pharmacy operations had severe and systemic problems,” the inspectors found. It stocked four opioid pain medications: fentanyl, hydrocodone, morphine and oxycodone. But the pharmacy protocols were so poor that they “increased the risk for the diversion of controlled substances” to illicit use.
For example, controlled medications, including the sleeping pill Ambien and the stimulant Provigil, were dispensed “without verifying the patient’s identity.” A witness told investigators that “Dr. [X] asked if I could hook up this person with some Provigil as a parting gift for leaving the White House … in the unit, it was authorized for us to do that kind of stuff.”
Notably, “the Military Health System senior leaders did not oversee the White House Medical Unit’s pharmacy operations,” according to the inspectors. Shoddy administration heightened dangers for “prescribing errors and inadequate medication management, increasing the risk to the health and safety of patients treated within the unit.”
White House medical officials argued to inspectors that the clinic doesn’t have a true pharmacy because of its size and the lack of a full-time pharmacist. But despite “a smaller number of pharmaceutical tasks,” the report said, “those tasks entail the full universe of pharmaceutical operations.”
Even clandestine surgery was available.
Aliases were used “to provide free specialty care and surgery to ineligible White House staff members at military medical treatment facilities,” according to the report. Former staffers told the inspectors that an ineligible White House employee received free elective surgery and that “the unit altered practices to cater to high‑ranking officials.”
One staffer said, “We bent the rules to meet this very weird, strange culture that was there, and I think it was really to just impress people.”
The White House referred questions about the report to the Pentagon. The Trump presidential campaign, people affiliated with the Trump administration and Defense Department officials did not respond to requests for comment.
The Pentagon accepted all the inspector general’s recommendations to improve White House Medical Unit operations, including developing procedures to better manage medications and patient eligibility.
When asked about possible crimes related to the findings, a Pentagon inspector general spokeswoman responded that “We do not confirm or deny criminal investigations.”
The investigation began in 2018, following complaints about “improper medical practices” by an unnamed senior military officer. That led to interviews with more than 120 officials and a review of more than 200 documents. Finally, almost six years later, the report was released this month after “a draft of this report was under review by the White House Military Office from May 2020 to July 2023,” during the Trump and Biden administrations, said Deputy Inspector General Michael J. Roark’s memorandum accompanying the report.
Good leadership was absent without leave. Medical unit leaders, who are not named in the report, were there, but they were part of the problem, causing more-diligent employees to flee.
“Senior leaders directed eligibility practices that did not comply with DoD guidance,” the report said. “Multiple former White House Medical Unit medical providers stated that they requested an early departure from the unit due to the unit’s practices.”
Reacting to the report’s “disturbing findings,” Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, “I am concerned by the lapse in procedure within the military’s White House Medical Unit, and I concur with the OIG’s recommendations to prevent this from happening again.”"
CYQ8E5ZDB7_XN1YH37TVFZAQQ3,Opinion The nation’s gain is Florida’s loss,Eugene Robinson,"January 22, 2024 at 4:27 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/desantis-campaign-woke-loser-florida/,"Ron DeSantis and his money-firepit of a presidential campaign didn’t even make it as far as the New Hampshire primary. Somewhere, in some magic kingdom, Mickey Mouse must be laughing.
As Florida’s governor, you will recall, DeSantis has waged a ridiculous war against his state’s biggest tourist attraction, Walt Disney World, to show Republican voters how pugnacious and “anti-woke” he is. That is his idea — his only idea, really — of a winning political message. His state, DeSantis loves to tell crowds, is “where woke goes to die.”
His candidacy died pretty much everywhere. DeSantis’s campaign and the technically independent super PAC  that supported him, Never Back Down, burned through an incredible $150 million. For all that cash, DeSantis got a crushing 30-point loss to Donald Trump in the Iowa caucuses and a grand total of nine GOP convention delegates.
He dropped out Sunday after reportedly deciding that a likely distant third-place finish Tuesday in New Hampshire, behind Trump and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, would further damage his political “brand.” That’s rich, given the way DeSantis has used his office not as an opportunity to serve the people of Florida but as a branding exercise. In positioning himself as the cowboy-booted crusader of anti-wokeness, he did real damage to his state and its institutions.
DeSantis launched his senseless fight against Disney, which has more than 80,000 employees in Florida, after the company criticized his “don’t say gay” legislation barring discussion of sexual identity in public schools. Rather than simply ignore a news release that hardly anyone would have noticed, DeSantis sought to punish Disney for daring to speak out. He seized control of the governing district that controls land use and services in the 25,000-acre Disney World complex, a move that led to state and federal lawsuits that are ongoing. Never back down, I guess, against Tinkerbell.
His attempt to pander to the GOP base on social issues went far beyond “don’t say gay,” however. The Stop Woke Act that he pushed through the GOP-controlled legislature bars teachers in the public schools from teaching critical race theory — which was not being taught to begin with — and ends all DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs in Florida’s public universities. It also seeks to restrict diversity training by private employers in the state.
That law is tied up in another legal battle after a federal judge blocked it and DeSantis appealed. But meanwhile, the state Department of Education, controlled by the governor, has issued rules that essentially squelch discussion of race in a manner that could make any students uncomfortable. His defense of a new Florida high school curriculum, in which students are to be taught that some Black people actually benefited from slavery, certainly made me uncomfortable.
All this posturing has real-world impacts. Florida school districts are having trouble hiring and retaining teachers, and Florida’s state colleges, including the flagship University of Florida, are losing prized faculty members. Ultimately, it is Florida’s students who suffer for DeSantis’s ambition.
On abortion, DeSantis apparently decided not to let any potential GOP candidate outflank him on the right. Having already signed a 15-week ban into law, he went further and had the legislature pass a pitiless six-week ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. That law, too, is the subject of a court fight, which the state Supreme Court is expected to eventually decide in DeSantis’s favor.
The good news is that Florida voters might have the final word in November. Activists say they now have enough signatures to place a measure enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution on the ballot. If the DeSantis administration fails to torpedo the ballot initiative, and if Florida follows the pattern of other states, having abortion at issue will likely boost Democratic turnout and cause problems for Republicans up and down the ballot. DeSantis’s effort to leverage reproductive rights for political gain will have been counterproductive.
Just like his whole campaign.
It is hard to see what DeSantis might have gained from his presidential run and easy to see what he has lost. His appeal, in theory, was as someone who could deliver on Trump’s MAGA policy agenda without all of Trump’s baggage. But DeSantis proved to be an awkward, wooden candidate who struggled to connect. His best weapons in Florida had been his bluster and belligerence, but he was too timid to use them against Trump. As all the failed GOP candidates have learned, primary voters don’t want New Trump — not while Trump Classic is still available.
The nation’s gain is Florida’s loss, sadly. I fear DeSantis will continue using the state as a stage to boost his MAGA profile — just like those awfully high heels on his cowboy boots."
CZ7KO0TAR4_IL8T92Q2DS6T9DK,"Union membership rate hit record low in 2023, though unions picked up workers",Lauren Kaori Gurley,"January 23, 2024 at 10:17 a.m. EST",20140125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/23/union-membership-low-strikes-labor/,"The share of American workers in unions fell to a record low, even as unions picked up more workers in 2023, a year marked by high-profile strikes, including by autoworkers, Hollywood writers and actors, and Kaiser health-care workers.
The union membership rate dropped by one-tenth of a percentage point to a new low of 10 percent last year, the Labor Department said Tuesday, while the total number of union members in the United States grew by 139,000 last year, with gains in the private sector offsetting losses in government jobs.
The decrease in the union membership rate happened because the labor market added a whopping 2.7 million jobs in 2023, with nonunion positions growing at a faster pace than union ones.
The decline in 2023 was driven by a drop in public-sector union membership to 32.5 percent, data shows, where union density is still roughly five times higher than in private industry. This happened as some states pushed to limit or ban government workers’ union rights. Union membership rates in the private sector held steady at 6 percent, because private-sector job gains were so strong.
The share of Americans in unions hit a previous low in 2022 as a booming employment market coming out of the worst of the pandemic created even more jobs.
The decline of union membership rates, a widely used indicator of union power, has been going on since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data in 1983. At their peak in the 1950s, unions represented more than 1 in 3 workers in the United States.
The new data also complicates President Biden’s self-proclaimed record as the country’s “most pro-union” president and emphasis on creating union jobs. His biggest accomplishments for the labor movement include approving trillions of dollars in spending on infrastructure and semiconductor and climate packages that incentivize companies to hire union workers.
Biden, in historic but sensitive move, joins UAW picket line
The shrinking of the U.S. labor movement contrasts sharply with growing evidence that Americans are on the side of labor unions. Support for unions has soared over the past decade, at 67 percent last year, after hitting a record low during the Great Recession, according to Gallup polling. Indeed, 2023 marked one of the three biggest strike years since 1990, according to Bloomberg Law’s database of work stoppages. And a new wave of successful organizing also notched victories at previously nonunion companies, such as Starbucks, Trader Joe’s, Wells Fargo and REI.
Inside the battle for the first union contract at Starbucks
Research shows that union workers earn about 10 to 15 percent higher wages than nonunion workers in similar positions.
This disconnect is largely a product of how difficult it has become for American workers to join unions, said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. Unionization is often an arduous process that can take months or even years. When businesses form, jobs start off as nonunion positions. Workers can gain union status through democratic elections that typically occur one workplace at a time.
Maintaining union membership rates requires “really active [union] organizing just to keep up with the natural churn in our labor market,” Shierholz said. “It’s a long slog that goes on and on.”
Adding to the challenges, U.S. labor law is “highly stacked against workers,” Shierholz added, with current penalties for illegal retaliation against workers hardly serving as a deterrent for employers looking to crush union activity. Recent efforts to secure first union contracts at Amazon and Starbucks have stalled in the face of pushback from companies. Starbucks denies findings from the National Labor Relations Board that it has refused to bargain in good faith.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has said declining union membership numbers suggest that unions are not as popular as the Biden administration has made them out to be, criticizing the White House for “put[ting] its thumb firmly on the scale for unions above all others.”
Union membership rates continued to remain higher for men, at 10.5 percent, than for women, at 9.5 percent, though that gap has been closing over the years. The share of Black workers in unions, at 11.8 percent, remained higher than union membership rates for White workers, at 9.8 percent, and other racial groups."
D05OX4SIUQ_VPRJY3XAD5B09AD,Japan sentences anime studio arsonist to death for killing 36,_,"January 24, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/japan-kyoto-animation-fire-shinji-aoba/,"TOKYO — A Japanese man was sentenced to death on Thursday after killing 36 people and injuring almost as many more in an arson attack on a Kyoto anime studio in 2019.
The attack made the fire the most deadly since a Tokyo office building blaze claimed 44 lives in 2001 and shocked Japan, where mass violence remains relatively rare.
In issuing the death sentence, Judge Keisuke Masuda said Thursday that the defendant was “neither insane nor suffering from diminished mental capacity at the time of the crime.”
The man, Shinji Aoba, admitted in court last year to starting the fire, but his lawyers argued that he was mentally unstable and suffering from delusions during the attack. He had a psychological disorder that left him incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, they said.
When the trial began in September, Aoba pleaded not guilty to five charges including murder, attempted murder and arson.
“I didn’t think so many people would die, and now I think I went too far,” Aoba told the Kyoto District Court at the time. His lawyers asked for him to be acquitted or given a lesser sentence.
But prosecutors said the severity of the crimes demanded the heaviest sentence possible.
“It is an unprecedented case of arson and mass murder, and the number of victims is by far the largest in the history of Japanese criminal trials,” the prosecution told the Kyoto District Court at the end of the trial.
Japan is one of the few developed countries to still retain the death penalty, which is carried out by hanging.
Although there are 107 people on death row, Japan carried out no executions in 2023 for the first time in thee years. International human rights groups have repeatedly called for Japan to abolish the death penalty, but a 2020 government poll showed that 80 percent of the public favor retaining it.
Aoba, who was 41 at the time, walked into the building owned by Kyoto Animation, one of Japan’s premier anime production houses, on July 18, 2019, and sprayed a flammable liquid around the office, screaming, “Die!,” police said at the time.
It appeared to set off secondary explosions, sparking panic as workers rushed into stairwells or up onto the roof of the three-story building.
Firefighters wrestled for hours with the blaze. In the end, 36 people died — many of them young animators — and 32 more were left with serious burns and other injuries.
Aoba suffered severe burns to 90 percent of his body and had to undergo 12 operations.
The studio, Kyoto Animation, was founded in 1981 and is one of the country’s most important producers of anime, a Japanese style of animated art that often features vibrant graphics and fantastical storytelling. Its notable titles include “Full Metal Panic!,” “K-On!” and “Sound! Euphonium.”"
D2C4N9Z2M9_R606S8HQVJY2E6L,"Man wielding ‘a metal object’ fatally shot by D.C. police, chief says",Emily Davies,"January 24, 2024 at 10:46 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/police-shoot-dc/,"A D.C. police officer who had spent about two hours trying to calm a man suffering a mental health crisis Wednesday morning fatally shot him after the man assaulted a paramedic in an ambulance en route to a hospital, according to D.C. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith.
Police identified the man as Clifford Brooks, 41, of Northeast Washington.
The shooting occurred about 9:30 a.m. near North Capitol Street and New York Avenue, one of the city’s busiest intersections. Smith described a tense scene, telling reporters that Brooks ran from the ambulance, darted through traffic, attacked an officer and did not respond to attempts to subdue him with pepper spray.
Smith, citing police body-camera video, said Brooks hid under a truck and then emerged “with a metal object raised in his hand.” The chief said officers repeatedly ordered him to drop the object as they retreated. Two officials familiar with the incident, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said the object was a long tire air-pressure gauge.
“The individual continued to move toward them with the object,” Smith said. In a later statement, police said “the man charged toward the officer, grabbed at him, and swung the metal object at him.”
The chief said the same officer, a 31-year veteran who had earlier counseled Brooks, and had been in a cruiser following the ambulance to the hospital, fatally shot him.
The police department has until next week to publicly release the officer’s body-camera video and identify him, unless Brooks’s family objects.
Smith and other police officials on Wednesday described the incident without identifying the man who was killed, pending notification of his next of kin. His name was made public Thursday.
Smith said the officer has been placed on administrative duties, in accordance with protocol. The police investigation of the shooting will be reviewed by the U.S. attorney’s office to determine if criminal charges are warranted. Smith would not say how many times the officer shot Brooks.
Police said officers responded about 6:40 a.m. to the 2500 block of Benning Road NE for a 911 call about a man suffering what appeared to be a mental health crisis. Smith did not provide additional details of the call or how the man was acting.
Smith said Brooks was outside at the time. She said one of the officers who responded is trained in crisis intervention and is a negotiator on the department’s tactical team. She said he spent nearly two hours counseling Brooks and eventually persuaded him to go voluntarily to a hospital for observation and treatment.
The chief said that officer did not ride in the ambulance but followed behind, which is common practice when a patient has agreed to seek treatment and is not being involuntarily committed.
Police said Brooks assaulted a paramedic as the D.C. fire department ambulance traveled north on North Capitol Street, under the New York Avenue overpass, approaching O Street NE. Two officials familiar with the investigation said Brooks “pinned” the paramedic to the floor of the ambulance.
Smith said Brooks jumped out of the ambulance and the crisis intervention officer called for help. She said Brooks assaulted one of those responding officers before getting under the box truck in the southbound lanes of North Capitol Street, on the Northwest Washington side of the wide street.
David Hoagland, president of the union that represents D.C. firefighters, called the violence against firefighters “an epidemic” and said other D.C. agencies, mainly the Department of Behavioral Health, should have been helping with a mental health call.
“That is what has been really frustrating for me,” he said. “Why are police and firefighters doing this? Where was the Department of Behavioral Health? We need more support from some of these agencies to address mental health issues in the city.”
Camil Douthit, a spokesperson for the Department of Behavioral Health, said the agency has trained 97 percent of D.C. police officers as either “crisis intervention officers” or in other forms of dealing with mentally troubled people.
“We continue to work with [D.C. police] to support individual and public safety,” Douthit said.

DCKIGJWPL8_GVYAH0718GMM5NB,House members tell Biden he must seek authorization for Yemen strikes,Yasmeen Abutaleb,"January 26, 2024 at 8:49 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/congress-biden-houthis-war-powers/,"A bipartisan group of more than two dozen House lawmakers plans to send a letter to President Biden on Friday arguing that he must seek authorization from Congress before launching additional strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.
While the signatories comprise a small portion of the House of Representatives, their letter marks some of the strongest opposition to date to Biden’s handling of the widening hostilities in the Middle East. It follows a letter from four senators of both parties earlier this week questioning the strategic and legal rationale for the strikes.
The House letter — led by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) — is more strongly worded, arguing that the U.S. strikes in Yemen are unauthorized and violate the Constitution. The lawmakers say that the strikes in Yemen — which were planned weeks ahead of time — do not meet the criteria for a “national emergency” that would allow Biden to bypass Congress.
“We ask that your Administration outline for us the legal authority used to conduct these strikes, and we urge your administration to seek authorization from Congress before conducting any more unauthorized strikes in Yemen,” the lawmakers wrote.
Near-daily strikes over the past two weeks on the Houthis, a powerful faction in Yemen’s long-running civil war, have failed to stop the militant group from targeting ships off the Arabian Peninsula. The Houthis have said their campaign against the ships is a way of pressuring Israel in its war in Gaza and standing up for the Palestinians.
U.S. prepares for a sustained campaign against the Houthis
Biden last week conceded the U.S. strikes were not entirely effective, but he said the administration would continue them.
“When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No,” Biden said in response to a question. “Are they going to continue? Yes.”
The House members signing the letter are mostly members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the most left-leaning faction of the Democratic Party, and the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group in the GOP.
In an interview, Khanna said it was “questionable” whether the first strikes by the administration needed authorization from Congress, but now that the strikes have become routine over a period of two weeks, there is no doubt that approval is required.
“You can’t get us into another Middle East conflict without coming to Congress. Bipartisan majorities on both sides are tired of presidents getting us into Middle East wars without congressional authorization,” Khanna said. “By striking and not coming to Congress, they’re cutting off the debate over what would be effective policy.”
White House officials say they are confident they are in compliance with domestic and international law.
“We are confident, after consultation with the Justice Department and interagency lawyers, that U.S. actions alongside coalition partners against Houthi targets are consistent with international and domestic law,” a White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “We have explained that legal basis in various forms, including in public notifications to Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution and in public letters to the United Nations Security Council.”
The War Powers Resolution of 1973, intended to clarify the constitutional provision giving Congress the power to declare war, requires that the president “in every possible instance” consult with Congress before introducing U.S. military forces into hostilities, and notify Congress within 48 hours regardless. It was passed amid congressional frustration with how American presidents prosecuted the Korean and Vietnam wars, and tension between the White House and Congress over the use of the military has simmered ever since.
A second White House official noted that the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have gone beyond commercial vessels. The official said U.S. government ships have been attacked by the militant group and that the administration is authorized to act in self-defense.
The Senate letter, sent to the White House on Tuesday, warned Biden that he will need congressional approval to carry the United States deeper into an escalating Middle East war.
“Unless there is a need to repel a sudden attack, the Constitution requires that the United States not engage in military action absent a favorable vote of Congress,” Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) wrote in the letter.
They said that while the defense of U.S. personnel and military assets — and perhaps even commercial vessels — is “within the boundaries of … presidential power … most vessels transiting through the Red Sea are not U.S. ships, which raises questions about the extent to which these authorities can be exercised.”
The senators submitted a list of questions, asking the president to define the administration’s “understanding of ‘self-defense’ in the context of these strikes”; seeking an explanation of “the legal authority under which the Administration has carried out each of these strikes”; and asking whether the administration believes “there is a legal rationale for a President to unilaterally direct U.S. military action to defend ships of foreign nations.”"
DCVDWV777A_V2QNKUP8KB8H8EZ,Opinion Netanyahu and his bloody logic must go,Karen Attiah,"January 26, 2024 at 3:20 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/26/netanyahu-must-go-israel-gaza/,"Last Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. officials that he is opposed to any postwar Palestinian state. When asked about the widely reported comments, President Biden said, “No, he didn’t say that.” But Netanyahu digitally clapped back, tweeting on Saturday, “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area west of Jordan — and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.”
We should take Netanyahu at his word: Israel desires indefinite “control.” Presumably, if Israel will not offer Palestinian autonomy, it must either dominate or eliminate the Palestinians. Looked at clearly, the statement implies either apartheid or ethnic cleansing. How can these words be understood any other way?
There is one thing that many people in Israel and the supporters of Palestinian freedom can agree on: It’s past time for Netanyahu to go.
Long before Oct. 7, Israelis had been taking to the streets to protest Netanyahu’s government. After he pushed through legislation that would limit the Supreme Court’s powers, Israelis protested for more than 30 weeks straight last year. More than 1,000 Israeli Air Force reservists said that they would suspend their volunteer service in protest of the blow to judicial independence, leading to fears that rifts in the military would affect Israel’s security, according to a July 2023 Times of Israel report.
After Hamas attacked, killing more than 1,000 Israelis and abducting more than 200 hostages, commentators in Israel began blasting Netanyahu’s alleged failures to respond quickly to the attack. “He bears personal responsibility for the abject strategic failure that allowed Hamas to invade Israel, take over Israeli communities and army positions, murder at least 1,200 civilians and soldiers, kidnap hundreds of hostages, and inflict upon the country the greatest defeat in its history,” wrote Uri Misgav for Haaretz.On Friday, more than 40 former Israeli national security officials and other leaders of society signed a letter calling for Netanyahu’s ouster, dubbing him an “existential” threat to Israel.
Netanyahu continues to fall short of freeing the hostages, despite more than 25,000 estimated dead in Gaza. Families of hostages stormed the Knesset this week and camped outside of Netanyahu’s home, demanding a deal to end the fighting.
Anyone who has studied Netanyahu’s career knows that he will use anything and anyone to survive. His survival now requires a forever war; he has no intention of seeking peace — only “control.” Others can see the need for negotiation. Gadi Eisenkot, a former senior minister in Israel’s war cabinet said: “Whoever speaks of absolute defeat [of Hamas] is not speaking the truth,” and that “the hostages will only return alive if there is a deal, linked to a significant pause in fighting.”
This gap between the need for compromise and Netanyahu’s refusal to budge cannot be papered over with denial from Biden. The rest of the world can see that Netanyahu’s assault on Gaza is not defeating Hamas and not bringing back the hostages. As the bodies of Palestinians pile up, Israel finds itself isolated from the international community. Polls show that global support for Israel has declined since Oct. 7.
Netanyahu is not the first Israeli leader to reject co-existence with Palestinians, whether in the form of statehood, or civil rights within a shared state — arguing that demographics would threaten the Jewish identity of Israel. Even in 2005, before Hamas won elections in Gaza, then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said, “We cannot hold on to Gaza forever. More than a million Palestinians live there and double their number with each generation.”
So what is Netanyahu’s plan? Is it to “hold on to Gaza” by decimating as many Palestinians as he can get away with?
It had to be a country from the Global South, South Africa, that followed Netanyahu’s bloody logic to its end and charged the government of Israel with genocide at The Hague. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the South African suit was “meritless” and “counterproductive.” But what did Biden have to show for weeks of diplomatic coaxing of Netanyahu to ramp down the ground offensive, halt illegal Jewish settlements and give Palestinians some measure of self-determination?
Looks like Washington is the counterproductive one here: Netanyahu is playing to his far-right base by telling the United States, The Hague and the rest of the world to go pound sand.
Israelis have failed to rein in Netanyahu. The United States apparently can’t or won’t. The rest of the world is bound to step up — especially those that have signed treaties on the prevention of atrocities and genocide. It is not the Palestinians alone who must be saved from Israel. Israel needs to be saved from itself.
Rather than attacking South Africa, the Biden administration should understand that this case at the International Court of Justice is a desperate but urgently needed wake-up call from the Global South. At the utter least, Israelis deserve better than a leader who flouts democracy at home, deprioritizes the safety and well-being of Israel hostages, and refuses to cooperate with demands for a sustainable path towards self-determination for Palestinians.
As for Americans, we should not let our tax dollars go to prop up yet another authoritarian in the Middle East. We are helping to keep a man in power that a majority of Israelis oppose — and whose only discernable endgame is his own survival. It’s time that we join the conscientious Israelis who are determined to remove Netanyahu from power."
DRCE3LVQIN_R2MXGKZQ53J39CI,Opinion The peculiar moderation of Donald Trump,Shadi Hamid,"January 25, 2024 at 2:26 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/trump-charisma-moderation-ideology/,"In the final days of his campaign, Ron DeSantis was reduced to hoping he might win the four delegates awarded by the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was a precipitous fall from grace. Not so long ago, the Florida governor seemed a genuine contender, the rare Republican who could challenge Donald Trump’s iron grip on the party. But it turned out he could not, for reasons both simple and complicated.
The country’s past five presidents — Joe Biden, Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — could all claim some mix of charisma, charm and folksiness. They were candidates you could conceivably enjoy getting a beer with. But this was not anyone’s idea of the stiff and robotic DeSantis, who often appeared at a loss when compelled to make conversation with voters.
It was a reminder that, for all the ideological charge of the Trump era, some things wouldn’t change: In a presidential system, personality matters. Competence, while nice in theory, wasn’t nearly as appealing in practice. Trump didn’t pretend to be competent. But he was entertaining, unencumbered and unusually funny.
Yet what has made Trump truly unique is the paradoxical nature of his political orientation. To even call it an orientation might overstate matters, since it suggests coherence where there is none. Trumpism manages to be extreme without being dogmatic. Its ideological nimbleness might, at times, even be mistaken for moderation — or more precisely “unhinged moderation,” to use writer Matthew Yglesias’s memorable term.
Though the GOP could conceivably support something like the Muslim ban again — to say nothing of believing the 2020 election was stolen — it has moved to the center on economic issues. The party that longed to privatize Social Security no longer exists. The small government ambitions of former House speaker and onetime Republican wunderkind Paul D. Ryan still elicit rote mentions. But under Trump, politicians who might once have cared about ballooning deficits pushed through two of the largest stimulus packages in U.S. history.
After the election was supposedly stolen by Biden — something more than 60 percent of Republicans still claim — this Trump-ified version of the GOP worked with Democrats to pass major legislation, including a historic $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the $280 billion Chips and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research. It was still an unhinged party, to be sure, but one that was more functional than anyone had reason to expect.
Even on culture war issues, Trump’s ideological intensity tends to vary according to his mood. After DeSantis doubled down on fighting “wokeness” as his signature issue, Trump mocked him, saying, “I don’t like the term woke because I hear woke, woke, woke, you know, it’s like just a term they use. Half the people can’t even define it. They don’t know what it is.” Just hours after saying this, though, he went back to using the word himself and made no apparent attempt to define it.
This is not a weakness. It’s a strength. In a time when U.S. politics revolves around the intangibles of “who we are” rather than the policies we support, Trump’s authenticity — his honesty about being dishonest and his unapologetic prioritization of self over country — appeals to tens of millions of Americans. This is also what makes Trump uniquely dangerous. Just as he is not guided by ideology, he is also not limited by it. He has no evident belief in ideas, beyond the idea of himself and his own greatness.
This twisted authenticity and indifference to any greater cause or vision — combined with his charisma and comedic timing — is a sort of superpower. And there’s some hope in this. For better and worse, Trump is a once-in-a-lifetime political talent. It’s hard to imagine a confluence of events that would produce anyone comparable in the foreseeable future. This, at least, is a relief."

The Antalya governor’s office said one body is assumed to be a Turkish citizen who was reported missing. Authorities believe the seven other bodies discovered over the past week may be migrants from a boat that went missing off the coast near the Syria-Lebanon border last month on its way to Cyprus.
An estimated 90 people were on board the boat that disappeared on Dec. 11, the governor’s office said, citing information provided by the Lebanese embassy in Turkey.
An evaluation of currents, winds and waves indicates that the victims may have been dragged toward the Antalya coastline, the office said in a statement.
In Lebanon, a lawyer who follows migrants’ cases, Mohammed Sablouh, said the boat left northern Lebanon with about 85 people on board, including 30 children.
Sablouh said contact was lost with another boat that left Lebanon on Thursday with about 50 or 60 people on board.
Saadeddine Shatila, executive director of the Cedar Center for Legal Studies, a Lebanon-based human rights non-profit, said his group had been able to identify 76 of the passengers on the boat that went missing on Dec. 11. All of them were Syrians, in addition to the Lebanese captain.
Some of the Syrians had been living in Lebanon for years as refugees and others had come recently from Syria to Lebanon, intending to reach Europe by sea, Shatila said. The smugglers’ going rate for passage from Lebanon to Cyprus is $3,500, he said.
The price tag of passage has increased, as has the demand for the journey, over the past few years after Lebanon has fallen into a prolonged economic crisis. Syria’s economic situation has also worsened, in addition to the ongoing impacts of the country’s nearly 13-year-long civil war.
Shatila said he hopes DNA tests will identify the remains of some of the missing boat’s passengers and bring some closure to their families. He called for international authorities to renew search efforts for the boat and for European countries to open more legal pathways for migration so that people do not resort to the dangerous sea journey.
“People are leaving irregularly by these boats because they don’t have another solution,” he said.
On Monday, hotel staff found the two bodies 500 meters (about 1,600 feet) apart on the beach used by guests, the private Demiroren News Agency reported.
The other bodies were found in resorts near the town of Manavgat and on the coast near Antalya city.

Ruane,"November 1, 2015 at 9:40 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/vietnam-critics-end-was-the-start-of-familys-pain/2015/11/01/b50e1d54-7cdf-11e5-b575-d8dcfedb4ea1_story.html,"Air Force Staff Sgt. Robert C. Bundt was waiting for his ride home outside the Pentagon that November evening when he heard yelling and saw the man on fire.
He couldn’t see the man’s face, because his whole body was wrapped in flames, and he didn’t hear anything, other than the people who were hollering at the man to drop the baby he was carrying.
Bundt, then 30, tore off his uniform coat and rushed at the blazing man to try to smother the flames. An Army officer joined him. They didn’t have much luck. Bundt recalled that it took the fire department to put him out.
Afterward, Bundt stood by, his hands and neck scorched. A bystander was holding the chubby baby, which was dressed in blue, kerosene-soaked overalls, but uninjured. Firefighters were spraying the incinerated body.
It was Nov. 2, 1965, and Bundt, now 80, had witnessed the self-immolation of Quaker antiwar pacifist Norman R. Morrison, who had just carried out one of the most horrific public protests of the era of the Vietnam War.
Scarcely remembered now, Morrison’s suicide 50 years ago Monday was front-page news at the time, across a country that was increasingly torn by protests over the war.
Morrison had set himself ablaze 40 feet from the Pentagon office window of then-Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, one of the chief organizers of the U.S. involvement in the war.
Years later, a contrite McNamara wrote that Morrison’s death was a tragedy “for me and the country.”
By the close of 1965, about 2,300 Americans had been killed in Vietnam, well short of the 58,000 who would eventually die there, according to the National Archives. But Vietnamese people had perished in untold numbers, the bombing of North Vietnam was underway and antiwar furor was growing.
The agonizing burdens left at the Vietnam Wall.
Draft cards were burned. Student protests were spreading. In March 1965, an 82-year-old Detroit pacifist set fire to herself to protest the global arms race and U.S. foreign policy.
Eight months later, on the morning before his death, Morrison asked his wife, Anne: “What can we do that we haven’t done?”
It was then that this intense, impatient, devout man received the sudden inspiration that he must destroy his life publicly to protest the war in Vietnam.
He succeeded, and struck a chord in some. But he also broke his wife’s heart, shattered his young family and left it with wounds that went unhealed for decades.
“Please don’t condemn me,” he wrote to his wife in a letter she received the day after he killed himself. “For weeks . . . I have been praying only that I be shown what I must do. This morning with no warning I was shown.”
Vietnam War’s first Medal of Honor, faded and cherished.
Morrison, 31, had brought his 11-month-old daughter, Emily, with him, for reasons that remain murky to this day. Back in Baltimore, Anne and their other children, Ben, 6, and Christina, 5, had come home to an empty house.
About 5 p.m., he had put on his favorite tweed jacket, bundled Emily and some extra diapers into the old Cadillac he had been taking of care for vacationing friends and began the 50-mile drive to the Pentagon.
Once there, he left the keys in the car, picked up Emily and the container of kerosene and went to a main entrance of the Pentagon, where people were streaming out of work.
Bystanders saw him pacing, according to eyewitnesses and historical accounts. At some point, he doused himself in kerosene. It’s not clear whether he doused Emily, too, or just got some of the liquid on her.
As he prepared to ignite himself down around his shoes, bystanders yelled, “Drop the baby!” Accounts varied as to whether he dropped her or whether someone took her. But Emily wound up safely in the arms of an onlooker as her father went up in flames.
“I seen the smoke, and the noise from people yelling, and I looked over and I seen him on fire,” Bundt, the Air Force staff sergeant, said last week by phone from his home in Michigan. “A ball of fire. I never seen his face.
“I took off my coat and went at him, [to] push him down so we could try to smother the flames,” he said. Others piled on their coats, but “we never really got it out. When the fire truck got there, they put a spray mist and they put him out.
“As they were spraying, they would take the coats aside and keep spraying until they got it down and they could remove him,” he said.
No photographs appear to exist of Morrison’s self-immolation, unlike the shocking images of Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc, who burned himself to death at a busy intersection in what was then Saigon, South Vietnam, in 1963.
The monk was protesting the oppression of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government, according to news accounts, and his suicide was captured on film and in a famous news photograph.
Morrison’s act was seen only by witnesses.
“When I got there, just looking at the state of the man, I knew he wasn’t going to make it,” Robert Ruderman, a military physician, told the Baltimore Sun in 1995. “The fire was out but he was totally burned from top to bottom. . . . There was nothing anybody could do for him.
“He died officially within two minutes of taking off in the ambulance,” said Ruderman, who died in 1998.
Friends drove Anne Morrison to Fort Myer, where Emily was being cared for.
“I sat in the back of the car stunned and frozen,” she wrote in a 2008 memoir. “I recalled that Norman and I had been awed and moved by Buddhist monks who had protested through self-immolation.”
And they knew about the suicide of Alice Herz, the woman in Detroit. But they didn’t dwell on these events.
Anne Morrison, who is 80 and living in North Carolina, declined to be interviewed for this article, saying in an e-mail: “My sentiments and experiences that I shared in the memoir still pertain today.”
Her daughter Christina, 55, also declined to comment during a brief telephone call. And daughter Emily, 50, declined to speak, via her mother. Their older brother, Ben, died of cancer in 1975 at age 16.
During the ride to Fort Myer, Anne wrote in the memoir, she reviewed the earlier part of the day for clues. Her husband had a cold and stayed home from his job at the local Quaker meeting.
She made them a lunch of French onion soup. He sat on a stool in the kitchen and talked about the war.
She remembered him wondering what else could be done to stop it. “I really don’t know,” she replied. “All I know is that we mustn’t despair.”
After lunch, he suddenly asked her: “What would you do if anything happened to me?”
“What a question!” she said.
They had been married eight years. She was a native of Georgia with a degree from Duke. He was from Erie, Pa., the son of a dentist, with degrees from what is now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and the College of Wooster, in Wooster, Ohio.
They had both become Quakers, and, in 1962, he had landed the job as executive secretary at the Baltimore’s historic Stony Run Friends Meeting. It was a great opportunity but not a great fit.
A man of passionate opinions, he “brought a radical Quaker posture to a meeting that didn’t fully embrace . . . his prophetic vision,” she wrote in her memoir. “His occasional bluntness and lack of social graces exacerbated tensions.”
He had been angry about the U.S. intervention in Lebanon in 1958. He was an eager supporter of civil rights and a determined opponent of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
“As the horror of the war grew, it finally overwhelmed Norman,” Anne Morrison wrote. His was “a soul burdened beyond endurance with the world’s suffering.”
“Though I was aware of the Quaker injunction to ‘let your life speak,’ I was totally unprepared for this kind of witness,” she wrote.
When she arrived at the Fort Myer dispensary, she went to a private room, where a nurse handed over Emily, wrapped in a white blanket. Anne was shown Norman’s tweed jacket and was amazed that it was only slightly burned. She was shown his wallet, comb and wedding ring.
“Yes, these are his things,” she told the authorities.
She faced a dilemma. Her husband had just violently and publicly removed himself from the lives of her and her children, and she had to try to explain why to the reporters waiting outside.
A friend, George Webb, jotted her thoughts on an envelope and went out and read a statement:
“Norman Morrison has given his life today to express his concern over the great loss of life and human suffering caused by the war in Vietnam. He was protesting our government’s deep military involvement in this war. He felt that all citizens must speak their true convictions about our country’s actions.”
The next day, newspapers carried headlines such as “Vietnam War Fueled Pacifist’s Fiery Death” and “War Critic Burns Himself to Death Outside Pentagon.”
Morrison had made his point. In North Vietnam, he was a hero. Back home, some thought him crazy, and some thought him a martyr.
His family was left it in “state of frozen grief,” Anne wrote in the memoir.
“I believed I had no right to grieve,” she recalled. “And it was very difficult to be angry at someone who had just given his life . . . to stop a war.”
The suffering children were told to be strong.
Although she remarried twice, she remained “Norman Morrison’s widow.”
She tried to establish herself as someone other than that. But, she wrote, “I have come to accept my life as it was, and is.”
“Healing has come little by little, bit by bit,” she concluded. But to this day, she can’t eat French onion soup.
Fifty years later, it still tastes too much like loss."

At least nine people were killed, an official said, in the latest violence targeting Egypt's Christian minority.
Egyptian authorities identified the gunman as 33-year-old Ibrahim Ismail.
A statement by the Interior Ministry said that Ismail had “attempted to attack another church near to the Mar Mina church, but he failed and ended up shooting two people in a shop next to it.”
How an Egyptian village became a target of the Islamic State
He then proceeded to attack the Mar Mina church, leaving nine dead, “before security forces wounded and arrested him, confiscating his weapon,” the ministry statement said.
Ismail is suspected to have links to several past attacks, including one by a group that opened fire on a police bus last year in Cairo. At least eight policemen were killed in the May 2016 attack.
The Islamic State asserted responsibility for Friday’s assault.
The spokesman for Egypt’s Health Ministry, Khaled Megahed, said eight Coptic Christians and a policeman were killed in the attack, the Associated Press reported.
At least five people were wounded, Megahed said.
The attack began when gunmen on a motorcycle started firing outside the Mar Mina church in the Helwan neighborhood south of central Cairo, while some worshipers were inside. Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency, citing the Interior Ministry, initially reported that at least two attackers tried to enter the church. The second attacker apparently fled, the agency reported.
A video posted on social media purports to show Ismail roaming a deserted street before being struck by gunfire. A man is seen later sneaking up to him from the back and snatching his weapon. Dozens of people then rush out from hiding to tackle and beat the fallen gunman.
Egypt’s Coptic community has come under increasing attack by Islamist militants in recent years, prompting tighter security measures around churches and other sites.
After Friday’s bloodshed, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi condemned the assault as “vicious.” A statement from Egypt’s parliament said the “bullets of terrorists did not differentiate between a Muslim and a Christian, or between a mosque and a church.”
In May, gunmen ambushed a bus carrying a group of Coptic Christians to a monastery in the Minya region, about 150 miles south of Cairo, killing at least 30 people.
Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.
Correction: An earlier version of this article reported that Ismail, the suspected gunman, had been killed.

EFVJ3L1FQX_ZFQR0E1TMXITTN2,Inside the unusual Biden write-in campaign in New Hampshire,Meryl Kornfield,"January 22, 2024 at 3:12 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/joe-biden-write-in-new-hampshire/,"CONCORD, N.H. — On a bustling intersection near where every presidential candidate has signed up to run in New Hampshire, a small posse of local Democrats held up signs for someone who has not recently visited the state and will not be on the ballot in Tuesday’s Democratic primary: President Biden.
In a first-of-its-kind effort, some Democrats are trying early this election year to drum up a symbolic show of support for the president, who has faced no formidable primary challengers, even as he has drawn low approval ratings.
The unusual New Hampshire initiative is one of the results of a revamped Democratic nominating calendar. Biden and the Democratic National Committee moved South Carolina to the front of the pack, but New Hampshire decided to continue to hold its long-prized first-in-the-nation primary earlier, in defiance of the new party rules. The contest carries no practical weight since the DNC has stripped the state of its delegates to the nominating convention and Biden opted not to put his name on the ballot.

But Democrats here say their vote has an important role to play — offering the first show of support for Biden in his party before other states hold contests. And Biden’s allies have been aggressive in promoting him in the state, with a super PAC run by a former party official spending more than $1.2 million on ads and mail, and many surrogates close to the campaign, including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), campaigning for the write-in effort.
The actions underscore a desire by many Democrats for a show of strength as Biden battles low polling numbers, concerns about his age and worries about the general election within his party.
“Why does he need to do well in New Hampshire, which I think he will? Because New Hampshire matters because of all of you,” Khanna said, pointing to a gaggle of reporters surrounding him at a house party for the write-in campaign on Saturday. “Around the world, people will hear what happened here. I think what people need to capture is the momentum and the excitement around President Biden.”
Volunteers for the Biden write-in campaign will be standing outside many polling locations Tuesday with large versions of the Democratic ballot that show the write-in option filled in. The bubble beside the blank should be filled, and the voter should write in Biden’s name, they plan to explain. According to training materials provided by the secretary of state to election officials, variations will count, including: “Joseph Biden,” “Joe Bidon,” “J. Biden,” “Joey B.,” “President Biden,” “Joe and Kamala.”
As long as it appears the voter intended to write in Biden, it is considered a vote in the president’s favor. (Some New Hampshire activists have advertised an effort to write in “cease-fire” to demand the end of the Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip.)
A disparate assortment of state and local Democrats organized the write-in campaign in October. The Biden campaign declined to comment on the write-in effort.
The grass-roots effort is also relatively low budget. The group — which filed with the Federal Election Commission as “Granite State Write-In” — spent about $70,000, mostly on signs that give instructions to voters on how to write in Biden. It is not waging any mass door-knocking efforts, although some volunteers have approached neighbors to talk about writing in Biden.
There are no organized phone banks, except some stray Democrats dialing people in their contacts. And mailers have not been part of the strategy, minus those sent by a few local groups that organized postcard-writing parties. The digital operation is so small that campaigners only recently managed to get a QR code set up by some entrepreneurial volunteer.
But a super PAC that can spend unlimited sums called Granite for America was created in November by former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan to offer support for the Biden write-in effort. It has invested $1.2 million, in part in print and online advertising.
“IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY,” one mailer from the group said, “Abortion Access IS ON THE LINE/ Social Security IS ON THE LINE/ Democracy IS ON THE LINE.”
Part of the Biden write-in effort is about reminding voters that the president is running at a time when rival campaigns are much more active. A mile in one direction of where the organizers in Concord stood on Friday, a Donald Trump rally was set to take place later. As his supporters drove by, some honked, shouted and made hand gestures at the volunteers.
“That’s fine,” said Liz-Anne Platt, a Concord resident and Biden supporter, after one man with a Trump flag mounted to his black SUV drove by, horn blaring. “Democracy works when everyone participates, and we want people to participate.”
Farther down the street, a group backing Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a long-shot Biden primary challenger, had convened in a coffee shop. The Phillips supporters included former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who walked over to greet the Biden sign-holders. The group members seemed unmoved, continuing to smile, wave and bounce their signs around in the 22-degree weather.
Much of the get-out-the-vote events and discussions that “Granite State Write-In” has convened have centered on explaining how writing in a candidate has worked. New Hampshire has never had write-in campaign of this magnitude. New Hampshire state Sen. David Watters, one of the write-in organizers and a longtime Democratic politician in the state, said he’s never seen anything like it.
“You can see how the Democrats know what’s at stake,” he said. “They’re really showing up.”
The effort relies on people like Sally Hatch, a 75-year-old Concord resident, who from her home, calls a list of Democrats who attended previous liberal campaign events — many of whom she knows herself — to ask them if they’ll spend two hours standing outside the polling locations with Write-In Biden signs. As of Saturday afternoon, she filled 52 of 60 spaces needed in two weeks. Whatever shifts she doesn’t find volunteers for, she and others will take turns doing.
The write-in organizers say that Democrats and independents are going to show up on primary day wanting to pick a candidate who is best positioned to defeat Trump, and the crux of their argument to voters is that Biden is a reliable option. They say long-shot Democratic candidates like Phillips and Marianne Williamson are lesser known and not well positioned to take on Trump, and Republicans have spoken positively of Trump on the trail. Biden has defeated Trump before, in 2020, they noted.
“We are going to do what the state of New Hampshire has always done, which is lead this country forward in protecting our democracy,” Cinde Warmington, a Democrat running for governor and a member of the state’s Executive Council, told volunteers Saturday at a house party in Concord.
The DNC has said the primary is “meaningless,” and no delegates will be appointed based on the results. That has created some friction with local Democrats hoping to keep New Hampshire first.
“The DNC rules were clearly misguided,” said former New Hampshire House speaker Terie Norelli, who has been one of the leaders of the write-in effort.
Turnout is not expected to be high. In a state where those unaffiliated with a party can choose to participate in either primary, the more competitive race on the Republican side is widely expected to draw more voters.
Over the weekend, voters received a call from what sounded like a digitally generated voice impersonating Biden that advised them not to vote on Tuesday, according to complaints that the New Hampshire attorney general is investigating. The call told voters: “It’s important that you save your vote for the November election.”
As they seek to build support for the write-in effort, some backers joke that the president’s name is easy to remember — and spell.
“It’s not easy to win a write-in campaign,” said Khanna, who has visited the state several times in recent months to support the write-in campaign. “I’d much rather have Joe Biden as a name than Ro Khanna. He’s blessed with good luck. If you want a write-in candidacy, you have to have a name that’s easy.”
The campaign has benefited from some national Democrats making appearances in the state in the lead-up to the primary. This past week, Khanna and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu joined some supporters standing outside holding signs.
Those leading the write-in effort have said they will be happy if Biden finishes on top. Around 70 percent of Democratic primary voters said they plan to vote for Biden, according to the University of New Hampshire’s poll in January.
Jim Messina, who is close with Biden’s inner circle and ran President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, said the closest parallel to the New Hampshire write-in effort is the 2010 election of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) after she lost the Republican primary but then earned 39 percent of the general election votes as a write-in candidate.
“Not having a modern American political organization behind you — I think it’s super difficult,” Messina said. “And most important,  [the New Hampshire primary] doesn’t matter,” so there could be low turnout, he said.
But that hasn’t stopped others from calling Biden out for not showing up. Phillips, who jumped into the race in October after urging other Democrats to challenge Biden and offer the party a competitive primary, has been a vocal critic.
Earlier this month, Phillips placed an ad on New Hampshire television, mocking Biden’s absence in the state by comparing him to Bigfoot.
“I thought I was good at hiding,” a Sasquatch-like character says in the spot.
On Saturday, Phillips showed up to where some of the write-in volunteers were standing with signs in Manchester, holding a carton of coffee and stack of cups. The interaction got a bit tense as some tried to shout over him.
“I know you’re not going to vote for me,” he responded. “But at least I’m on the ballot.”
Phillips later told The Washington Post he brought the volunteers coffee out of respect.
“Frankly, by taking some coffee outside to people practicing democracy — I don’t care if they are Democrats, Republicans or libertarians holding signs outside, God bless them,” he said. “I will show up every time.”

EFX5PVH8BE_A9MRTXT51WUD72F,Opinion Not even the Supreme Court can make Congress do its job,Ramesh Ponnuru,"January 22, 2024 at 6:45 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/ending-chevron-deference-congress-supreme-court/,"Normal people are not closely following a pair of Supreme Court cases about the regulation of herring fishermen in New Jersey and Rhode Island. Many of the small number of people who are passionate about these cases are indulging in hyperbole to try to generate interest — and to talk around some of the unsettling truths beneath the cases.
The main question is whether courts should defer to government agencies when they interpret the statutes that give them power. That’s what the Supreme Court said should happen in a 1984 case known as Chevron. If the Supreme Court keeps that rule, opponents of Chevron say, we will be one step closer to “tyranny”: Government bureaucrats will be able to determine the limits of their own authority. If the justices instead discard Chevron, they will be accused of voting to “gut” federal regulations: Experts with specialized training will have to face second-guessing from judges who know little about their fields.
George F. Will: How the Supreme Court could end the ‘Chevron deference’ foolishness
Neither alternative looks attractive because there is no perfectly satisfying solution to the problem of how to resolve ambiguities in the law. Put either agencies or judges in charge, and the result might be abuse. In the 1980s, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia became a cheerleader for Chevron based on the practical judgment that there was more to fear from freewheeling judges than from agency personnel subject to presidential control and political pressure.
Trends in government led him to reconsider that judgment toward the end of his career. Government agencies were taking greater liberties, in all senses of the term. Executive-branch expertise and power did not yield steadiness of administration, as one might have hoped, but zigzagging policy depending on who won the most recent presidential election. Congress failed to act as a check on regulators. Now, when presidents stretch laws to maximize their powers, their congressional allies applaud instead of trying to claw back authority for the legislature.
Ruth Marcus: Courts have long deferred to federal rulemakers. That might end soon.
Most Republican politicians sided with President Donald Trump when he claimed he could use federal money to build a border wall without getting congressional approval. Most Democrats backed President Biden when he asserted he could forgive student loan debt without getting a law passed.
Congress doesn’t just fail to stand up for itself. It deliberately passes vague laws that pass the buck to the other branches of government, allowing legislators to take credit for acting on some goal — clean air, help for veterans, you name it — without having to take responsibility for the specific decisions needed to pursue it.
Far from resenting these presidential power grabs, legislators greet them as a relief from the burden of finding compromises. When President Barack Obama attempted to grant legal status to large numbers of illegal immigrants, congressmen from both parties won. The Democrats didn’t have to make any deal to get what they wanted, and Republicans didn’t have to accept it as part of any deal either.
Conservatives have turned against Chevron because judicial power doesn’t scare them as much now that they wield it — and also because letting agencies interpret the law for themselves seems to have abetted this ongoing breakdown in the separation of powers. Unfortunately, overruling Chevron is unlikely to force legislators to step up. The courts have repeatedly weakened the ruling without having any such effect.
That’s not a reason to keep Chevron. It’s a reason to conclude that there is no substitute for a Congress that does its duty, including guarding its own status as lawmaker. Which raises a broader point that is too easy to forget: The Constitution’s checks and balances don’t operate automatically, like a machine. Republics presuppose a higher degree of virtue than other forms of government. Presidents have to exercise self-restraint instead of looking for every loophole; members of Congress have to pass laws for which they’re willing to be held accountable; and voters have to insist on both.
In our day, though, the idea that our leaders should be men and women of high character is considered naive or outdated. If at the same time our constitutional government is working poorly, perhaps it is not an accident."
EH2Y3F9MTA_LG7HCFEIIAVD9A3,21st Century Consort’s ‘Singular Beauty’ takes a kaleidoscopic view,Michael Andor Brodeur,"January 22, 2024 at 4:27 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/01/22/21st-century-consort-singular-beauty-simone-leigh/,"You have until March 3 to visit the Hirshhorn’s impressive eponymous exhibition of works by Jamaican American artist Simone Leigh. It’s an impressive, imposing assembly of sculptures that, as Post art critic Sebastian Smee put it, “monumentalize and make known the invisible, unwritten and historically underappreciated labor of Black women.”
Leigh’s works often feel larger than the exhibitions that show them — her 2022 Venice Biennale presentation overtook the U.S. Pavilion’s neoclassical facade with swaths of thatched roofing and grand bronze figures. (You may already have spotted her “Satellite” standing guard outside the Hirshhorn, or her “Sentinel” supervising the atrium of the National Gallery’s East Building.)
On Friday at St. Mark’s on Capitol Hill, the 21st Century Consort — resident ensemble of the Hirshhorn — supplied an additional dimension to Leigh’s work with “Singular Beauty,” a program of music attempting to emulate Leigh’s “polyphonic artistic vocabulary” as well as her experience “toggling daily between worlds — West Indian, African American, white.”
A keenly designed program by artistic director Christopher Kendall presented, as promised, a “veritable pepperpot of delectable music” that found the Consort shape-shifting between quartet, solo and ensemble configurations to perform short pieces by Jessie Montgomery, Hannah Kendall, Tania León, Shawn Okpebholo, the late Jeanne Lee, Eleanor Alberga, Jon Deak and a trio of pieces by the young Jamaican pianist/composer Mikhail Johnson.
“Of all the benefits the Hirshhorn residency provides, the stimulus for program design is the best thing,” Kendall tells me in an email. “I might not have discovered all the interesting composers of color featured in our December and January programs, for instance, if it weren’t for this inspiration.”
Like Leigh’s work, the music on Saturday’s program was big on materiality. A pair of string quartets — Montgomery’s “Voodoo Dolls” and Kendall’s “Glances / I Don’t Belong Here” opened the evening and set the tone. Montgomery’s 2009 quartet — originally composed for a dance troupe — bristled with West African rhythms (knuckle-drummed by the players against the wood of their instruments) before segueing into a thicket of serrated lines and searing glissandos.
Kendall’s quartet was equally rich in thrills — a suite of seven miniatures exploring alienation and otherness inspired by artist Ingrid Pollard’s “Pastoral Interlude” series. Each sketch, named for one of the composer’s favorite “nonurban” locales, was pulled taut by its long, tense lines — the sonic equivalent of sideways looks or parted blinds. The quartet of cellist Rachel Young, violist Daniel Foster and violinists Regino Madrid and Melissa Regni were in fine form, with tight timing and responsive dynamics that revealed deep intuition.
Pianist Lisa Emenheiser and soprano Lucy Shelton offered an entrancing reading of “Praise to the Mother of Jamaican Art,” a setting of a poem by Lorna Goodison which imagines its titular icon as a nameless enslaved African woman who “did not sign her work,” and the first of three pieces presented by Mikhail Johnson. Shelton gave a high-wire act of tremulous vibratos over Emenheiser’s spare piano — Johnson’s figures moving between melancholic nostalgia and the “blunt blade” (Goodison’s words) of angular chromaticism. It was a lovely, contemplative centerpiece to the concert’s first half, and a sharp engagement with Leigh’s own investigation of Black women’s uncredited labor.
A pairing of pieces by León and Okpebholo followed to close the half. León’s “Parajota Delate” (or, “For J. from T.”) was her 1988 birthday gift to composer Joan Tower. More so than her orchestral works, León’s chamber pieces foreground her love for texture and timbre, here most effervescently articulated by clarinetist Paul Cigan. (Cigan was a standout among the ensemble all night, especially his solo course through Johnson’s beguiling dance-inspired “Pasa Pasa” later in the evening.)
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
León’s birthday card was followed by Okpebholo’s sweet and endearing love letter to his wife and two daughters, “CryptOlogiE.” Their names are coded by the composer into serial pitch sets and Morse code rhythms that percolated through Young’s cello and Matthew Ross’s flute. Like the piece itself, the performance of it is something of a family affair — the entire quintet occasionally gathering around the open piano to slap its strings and issue a harrowing (and thoroughly charming) racket.
Johnson performed his own solo piece for organ, “Si Di Staar Deh,” to launch the concert’s second half — the ivy climb of his stormy buildups leaping from stop to stop, eventually blowing open the swell shades of the church’s mighty (i.e. nearly-4,000-pipe) Flentrop organ.
Shelton took center stage for an extended solo vocal improvisation in conversation with Jeanne Lee’s “Angel Chile” — the seventh track from her 1974 album “Conspiracy” (a record Leigh also referenced in her installation for Venice). Building off Lee’s recording — in which she vocalizes the syllables of “Naima,” her daughter’s name — Shelton similarly improvised by fragmenting the sounds of “Zenobia,” i.e. Simone Leigh’s daughter. The result was a mesmerizing latticework of live and recorded voice, language pulling itself apart and together, Shelton and Lee lost in disembodied conversation. Good stuff.
Johnson’s “Pasa Pasa” and Eleanor Alberga’s rhapsodic “Jamaican Medley” followed, the latter a 1983 pastiche of Jamaican folk songs, composed for the 21st anniversary of Jamaica’s independence and powerfully performed by Emenheiser. (I’m told that Johnson is learning to play the “Medley,” and Saturday’s was as good a demonstration as one could ask for.)
The evening concluded with composer Jon Deak’s quartet, “The Jury,” a highflying setting of a 1983 poem by the Dominican-American poet Rhina Espaillat, sung with expressive gusto by Shelton. The poem chronicles the observations of four birds — an Eagle and a Sparrow (the violins of Regni and Madrid, respectively), a Pigeon (Foster’s viola) and a Vulture (Young’s cello). And the music embodies these feathered (and quite judgy) friends, with Shelton’s dramatic chops taking particular flight in her turn as the Vulture (growling a Kramer-esque “Ohhh yeahhhh!”)
It’s a light piece that paints a dark scene — a portrait of humanity that marvels at our hubris and cruelty, and wonders aloud “toward what new grief their wayward shoes would have them go.” Like Leigh’s work, it forces self-reflection at a different scale; a consideration of ourselves and each other, from above and below."
EPL3T5AHHS_RQJ5UCAZT8Z7OJ5,Why Biden isn’t on the New Hampshire primary ballot,Amber Phillips,"January 23, 2024 at 9:13 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/why-biden-isnt-new-hampshire-primary-ballot/,"New Hampshire is holding the first-in-the-nation primary elections on Tuesday, for both Democrats and Republicans. But the Democratic primary won’t have President Biden on the ballot. Voters will see the names of his 21 primary challengers instead — and space to write in a name.
But even if one of his primary challengers wins in New Hampshire, it won’t change the electoral outcome of the Democratic nomination process. Barring a catastrophe, Biden will likely be Democrats’ nominee. Here’s what’s going on with New Hampshire.
The parties set their own primary calendars, but for decades Republicans and Democrats have followed roughly the same schedule: Iowa holds the first caucus, then New Hampshire holds the first primary. Republicans are still doing that this year.
But Democrats dramatically changed up their primary schedule for 2024. The party chose South Carolina, where there are far more Black voters than in mostly-White Iowa or New Hampshire. New Hampshire was supposed to go second alongside Nevada, then Michigan. Iowa was pushed way forward to March.
1/5
Democratic officials emphasize the party still sees value in New Hampshire being an early voting state. Like Iowa, it’s largely White, but it epitomizes small-government retail politics, they say.
“This showcases the diversity of the party and the country,” said a Democratic official of the new calendar, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “Rural, urban, Midwest, West, South.”
Democrats also point out that New Hampshire doesn’t have a great track record of picking the eventual nominee. Actually, it’s been terrible: Only once in modern history has it picked the eventual nominee, and that was John Kerry, who was from neighboring Massachusetts. (New Hampshire voters argue that it’s less about the result, and more about how they winnow the field.)
The state is holding a primary anyway on Tuesday, for both Democrats and Republicans. New Hampshire’s election officials note that a decades-old state law requires it to be the first primary in the nation. (Iowa doesn’t count, because it’s a caucus.)
New Hampshire Democrats argued behind the scenes they didn’t care if they got penalized for breaking the rules. It’s a pretty low-stakes primary, given there’s no real question about who will be the nominee.
But that will change in 2028, when there won’t be a Democratic incumbent running. If New Hampshire defies the rules again, candidates may have to choose between complying with the party and the media attention that comes from competing in the first-in-the-nation primary.
The fight between the Democratic National Committee and New Hampshire over the calendar quickly got contentious. The DNC decided to penalize New Hampshire by taking away its roughly two dozen delegates. The primary there is “meaningless,” the DNC declared this month, adding: ""…[P]residential candidates should take all steps possible not to participate.”
New Hampshire responded by accusing Democrats of trying to suppress voter turnout. “Falsely telling New Hampshire voters that a New Hampshire election is ‘meaningless’ violates New Hampshire voter suppression laws,” the state’s attorney general wrote to the DNC in January.
The Biden campaign long ago decided to follow the party’s guidance and not compete there. “While the president wishes to participate in the Primary, he is obligated as a Democratic candidate for President to comply [with party rules],” Biden’s campaign manager told New Hampshire Democrats.
Beyond New Hampshire, Biden’s 21 primary challengers are hardly a factor, but one of them might win this primary. But the win will be symbolic, since the state has been deprived of its delegates.
The most prominent challengers are Rep. Dean Phillips (Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson. They have been campaigning hard in the state, leaning into the anti-establishment argument against the Democratic Party. “They are working against all of us,” Phillips said on the campaign trail. “They are suppressing the voters of New Hampshire by saying your vote does not matter.”
If Biden wins the New Hampshire primary, it would be through a write-in campaign being led by grassroots Democrats. The Biden campaign is not involved in this, because he can’t compete in the state. But a group of New Hampshire Democratic Party leaders have launched a campaign to urge voters to write in his name, and it’s possible he could win that way. Still, write-in campaigns are historically difficult, and require a lot of voter education and outreach.
Lyndon B. Johnson actually won New Hampshire that way in 1968. One of the only successful write-in campaigns in modern history came in 2010 in Alaska, when Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) lost her primary but won a write-in campaign to win the general election. She was actively involved in the campaign, unlike Biden is in New Hampshire, and she won, but still only got 39 percent of the vote.
New Hampshire is also an open primary, meaning voters not registered with a party can choose which primary ballot they’d like. It’s actually pretty normal in the state for independents who lean left to vote in the Republican primary to affect that outcome, for example.
Trump and Biden won their respective New Hampshire primary elections. Here are the results, biggest takeaways and what exit polls showed.

Who is running? The top contenders for the GOP 2024 nomination are former president Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley after Florida Gov.

EQ6H7RE2H8_V92PJD4RL5XN9NC,Israel turns to Indian workers as Gaza war worsens labor shortage,Karishma Mehrotra,"January 24, 2024 at 2:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/israel-india-migrant-workers/,"NEW DELHI — Israel is looking to address a major labor shortage, abruptly worsened by the conflict with Hamas, by recruiting tens of thousands of Indians at a time when Palestinians who have long played a crucial role in Israeli construction and other sectors are being barred from the country.
While Israel had already been in discussions with India about recruitment before the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas against Israelis and Israel’s withering reprisal in Gaza, tough new restrictions on Palestinian workers have dealt a blow to the economy. Many foreign workers, notably thousands from Thailand, have headed home because of the conflict.
Israeli authorities say they are hoping to see 10,000 to 20,000 Indian migrant workers in the coming months. That would be equal to the total number of foreign workers that entered the country through bilateral agreements in 2021, according to Israel’s Center for International Migration and Integration (CIMI).
“India will be one of, if not the, largest supplier of building workers in Israel in the coming years,” said Shay Pauzner, the deputy director general of the Israel Builders Association, adding that about 5,000 workers in New Delhi and Chennai had already been secured.
Pauzner said his association had turned to India “because of the decision to stop the Palestinian workers coming to Israel since the beginning of the war.” About one-third of the workers in the Israeli construction sector had been Palestinians, but work permits had been canceled for those from Gaza and the occupied West Bank after fighting erupted. “Right now we are looking for any way to close this gap. We are under a lot of pressure,” he said.
In December, Raul Srugo, president of the Israel Builders Association told Israeli lawmakers that industry output is at 30 percent. “As far as we’re concerned, you can bring workers from the moon,” he said.
Israel’s turn toward Indian workers in part reflects the warming of relations with India in recent years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has publicly embraced Israel.
India’s Mideast rethink: From a Palestine stamp to a ‘Modi-Bibi bromance’
Even before the Gaza war, the two countries signed an agreement in May that would send 42,000 Indian construction and nursing workers to Israel, according to comments by former Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen in the Israeli parliament. Advertisements for recruitment across India show salaries ranging from $1,400 to $1,700 per month. Roughly 17,000 Indian workers now reside in Israel, mostly employed in nursing, according to local Indian media and Israeli officials.
While Indian officials minimized any connection with the war, they also said recruitment is now accelerating. “This is just the beginning,” said an Indian government official involved in recruitment who was not authorized to speak officially. “The objective is that this has to be much wider.”
Israeli government officials deny that the move is explicitly designed to replace Palestinian workers but acknowledge there is new pressure. “The current situation has its demands,” said an Israeli government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of ongoing negotiations. “Of course, now there is a sense of more urgency.”
Before the war, a new “all-time high” of 193,000 Palestinians worked in Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories after a one-third jump in 2022, according to the International Labor Organization. One-fifth of the West Bank workforce was employed in Israel.
But those numbers plummeted after violence broke out. “Letting workers from the territory of an enemy population into Israel during a war is a terrible mistake that will cost blood,” Gideon Saar, an opposition lawmaker serving in the emergency government, told the Times of Israel. And Economy Minister Nir Barkat told the Jerusalem Post that the Oct. 7 attack exposed the “risks” of employing Palestinians and stated his plan to replace them with foreign workers.
The return of Palestinian workers into Israel has become entangled in the country’s wartime politics. In addition to construction companies and hospitals, many in the security establishment are pushing for employment permits to be reactivated in significant numbers. The lack of wages, they fear, will contribute to despair and anger in the West Bank, where violence has already surged during the Gaza war.
But reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was prepared to launch a pilot program allowing certain vetted Palestinians to come back to their jobs ran into stiff opposition from right-wing lawmakers. More than a dozen members of his own Likud party condemned the plan in a public letter Wednesday.
How the costs of Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza are mounting
In India, Amit Kumar, a recruiter in a small town in Uttar Pradesh state who works with a large New Delhi workforce agency called Dynamic Staffing Services, is telling interested workers that Muslims cannot apply for the job. “They don’t want Muslim workers,” he said in an interview. In numerous YouTube videos explaining the process and calling for applications, he tells viewers, “Your name should be Hindu,” and “Only Hindu brothers can apply.”
Government officials who oversee recruitment and Indian workforce agencies — including in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and in the city of Hyderabad — said there was no restriction on Muslim workers. Dynamic Staffing managers did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Indian unions and activists have lambasted the recruitment drive, alleging dangerous conditions for workers. “We are against this because it is sending workers into the mouth of death,” said Ramher Bhivani, general secretary of a construction workers union in Haryana. “They entice workers with a lavish salary, but none of my workers will go.”
Several Indian unions, meantime, have released press releases stating that the step would signal “complicity” with “Israel’s ongoing genocidal war against Palestinians.”
During the October attack, Hamas militants killed 39 Thai migrant workers and took 32 hostage, Thai officials told Reuters. About 7,000 Thai workers, out of 30,000 in total, left Israel after the attack, according to the Times of Israel, and Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin appealed for the remaining Thai workers to come back. Since 2014, Thai workers have consistently accounted for more than two-thirds of migrant workers arriving through bilateral agreements.
Nepali workers also departed after the attack, leaving Israeli nursing homes operating with only half their staff, according to an Israeli parliamentary committee on foreign workers.
The Israeli official downplayed the danger to Indian workers. “We aren’t going to send people into areas that we ourselves aren’t willing to work,” he said.
Many Indian workers seem undeterred. “I need to work somewhere or another. It’s dangerous here, too,” said Vinod Dangi, a construction worker in Haryana who only has a few documents left to complete before getting to go to Israel. “But I am not going for Israel. I am going for my family.”
He has watched numerous videos online about Israel to learn more, including several videos of Kumar, the recruiter in Uttar Pradesh.
“Wherever they are from, they are just saying one thing,” Kumar said in a YouTube video. “Sir, I want to go to Israel.”

ERDJ8H5PIE_DD209FP3O4LKSYZ,This law makes her explain the trauma of her rape every few years,Petula Dvorak,"January 25, 2024 at 3:21 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/25/this-law-makes-her-explain-trauma-her-rape-every-few-years/,"“You can’t change what happened,” the judge told Kristen Hubbard.
It was 1992, Hubbard was a college freshman and the survivor of a horrific crime that had riveted the nation’s capital.
The judge was about to sentence one of two kidnappers who debased, raped and beat Hubbard and her friend before forcing them to dig their own graves.
Back then, hardened detectives of the sex crimes unit called the young women’s 12 hours of hell “degrading and terrifying.” The prosecutor in the case said she’d never seen anything like it. The courtroom scene that late September day was tense as the judge tried to uplift the devastated women sitting so close to the 16-year-old who had also urinated on them, raped one of them with a loaded revolver, then shrugged and replied “I can’t say” when the judge asked him why he had done that.
“You do have a great deal of control over what happens from here on out,” D.C. Superior Court Judge Harriett R. Taylor told the young survivors, according to The Washington Post’s coverage.
The judge, it turns out, was terribly wrong.
Because of legislation passed to give young offenders a second chance at life, Hubbard has no control over the demand that she relive that hell, publicly, every few years in court.
It’s not as though she goes about her life healed and happy every day. The scars of what she endured at 18 aren’t gone.
But that well-intended legislation passed in the District — similar versions of which are popping up in more than two dozen jurisdictions across the country — jolts Hubbard each time she has to get back into her court clothes and stand before a judge to recount again and again the nightmare she survived.
It happens each time one of her two attackers uses that law to petition for an early release. And it happens in D.C. and Maryland courts because the rapists crossed state lines. On one occasion, she was six months postpartum. On another, she was at a fall festival pumpkin patch with her family when she was told that her admitted rapist would be in court in a matter of days and was asked whether she could be there.
“There’s no rhyme or reason to it when it happens,” said Hubbard, who is now 50 and testified yet again this week. “No one is talking about this impact on us. We’re just re-victimized all over again.”
The Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act (IRAA) was passed in D.C. in 2016. The reasoning for it is compassionate and backed by a lot of data and advocacy.
“The idea behind the legislation is that children and young adults, whose brains aren’t fully mature, should not receive adult punishments of decades in prison,” wrote my colleague Keith L. Alexander, who has covered this subject for years and interviewed Hubbard extensively last year.
The star of the program is Kareem McCraney, the first IRAA case, who went on to become a paralegal after serving 21 years in prison for killing someone when he was 17.
As a teen he killed a man. A new law has given him a second chance.
It’s a tough one. We all know teens can do dumb and dangerous things. Some had wretched childhoods of abuse and neglect. Kim Kardashian has used her fame to advocate for some juvenile offenders in America and right here in D.C.
Following that, the D.C. law was amended in 2020 to include people who were as old as 24 at the time of their crimes, in a much-criticized effort led by D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6). There is no exception for murder, sexual assault or child sex abuse — all of which can be considered.
And that’s going to catch serious heat right now, as D.C. is struggling with a crime wave fueled by a lot of young offenders.
There are positive stories about this, such as Kareem McCraney’s.
Hubbard said she gets that leniency for offenders can be a good thing — in some cases.
“I absolutely think there is necessary reform,” she said, for nonviolent crimes committed by kids who make stupid decisions. Nonviolent.
For her, the only reason she was able to move haltingly forward with her life was because she thought that her attackers would be in prison for a very, very long time.
Having to remind the courts of that every couple of years has been exhausting. And infuriating.
She has decided to speak publicly because she believes these laws ignore people like her who are usually voiceless in these arguments. She’s tired of hearing lawmakers, universities and researchers talk about the benefits and generosity of reform and second chances without addressing the ongoing pain of victims and their families.
So she keeps testifying in court and opening herself up to journalists. She went before the D.C. Council and plans to expand her message to other jurisdictions.
“What’s shameful is there’s no organization that I’ve come across that specifically deals with victims and survivors that are now having to be re-victimized by bills like IRAA,” she said.
What they have is one another, an informal network of survivors like Hubbard who have been pushed into the unwanted role of having to continually advocate for themselves.
“We have been at hearings and have spoken discreetly in hallways where we had no intention of ever being,” she said.
She wants as much study, ongoing therapy, consideration and concern for the victims of crimes and their families as there is for offenders. Although our society is getting good at providing therapy and support for survivors right after a crime, what about five, 1o and 20 years later?
In Hubbard’s case this week, the judge decided that Joshua D. Haggins, who earned his GED in prison, was not ready to reenter the free world. This was after the first judge to hear his plea for release last year began crying when Hubbard’s friend testified and then recused herself from the case.
“I am depressed,” Hubbard’s friend said in court.
She slapped her right hand on a table again and again, according to my colleague Paul Duggan. “I am angry!” she cried. “I am sad! I have never married! I have no kids! I live alone! … I have tried to the best of my ability to live a life. But I am empty.”"

Can a class-based approach to affirmative action pick up where recently legally prohibited race-based policies left off? In theory, yes, if colleges give a substantial admissions boost to lower-income students. But it still won’t work for an important reason: It’s too expensive.
Many colleges and universities are searching for legal alternatives to preserve racial diversity on campus after last June’s Supreme Court decision. The idea that class-based affirmative action could boost racial diversity is straightforward. After all, Black, Latino and Native American students are more likely to grow up in lower-income families than their White counterparts.
Using class-based affirmative action to increase representation of low-income students would offer benefits beyond racial diversity. It would promote upward mobility because lower-income students benefit the most from attending selective colleges. It would also produce college classes that more closely reflect the socioeconomic distribution of the country.
But swapping class for race isn’t as simple as it sounds.
Admissions are only half the battle: Class-based affirmative action policies will be effective only so far as additional lower-income students actually enroll — and therein lies the rub. Schools would need to considerably expand their financial aid programs to support an influx of low-income students. And that’s a price that most colleges can’t afford.
We’ve crunched the numbers. In a new report for Brookings, we simulated several class-based affirmative action policies to understand their potential effects on racial diversity, as well as to estimate how much they would cost.
The math could work. We looked at selective schools that were likely to use affirmative action before the court’s decision. These schools enroll about 15 percent of full-time, dependent students at four-year institutions. We found that giving an admissions “bump” to lower-income students might maintain current levels of racial diversity.
But to achieve that outcome, the bump would have to be very large. In a simulation in which we gave lower-income applicants an extra 200 points on their SAT scores, selective colleges were able to maintain percentages of Black and Latino students near current levels — around 20 percent of enrollees.
The path forward for affirmative action
This would also create a big change to the mix of students enrolled at these schools: In such a scenario, around half of admitted students would be lower-income, compared with roughly one-quarter now.
Our analysis also suggested that getting more low-income students to enroll will be difficult. Many students already struggle to pay for college. More than one-third of students at these selective institutions bear educational expenses that are $10,000 or more beyond what they can afford — and this is accounting for financial aid.
This shortfall exists despite the $10 billion in need-based financial aid provided by these selective institutions. Even with all that spending, less than 30 percent of aid-eligible students enrolled in selective colleges receive enough support to cover their full financial need.
An influx of low-income students would cost billions more. We estimate that an additional $7.8 billion in financial aid would be needed to sustain current levels of racial diversity under a class-based affirmative action program.
Only a handful of elite universities — Harvard, Princeton and the like — have endowments large enough to cover this additional expense. Less wealthy schools — the ones that already struggle to provide enough aid to meet their students’ financial needs — probably wouldn’t be able to raise the necessary funds. Of course, affordability problems are not limited to students attending the selective four-year colleges we focus on in our report.
Policy changes to make college more affordable are urgently needed. Doubling the maximum Pell Grant would be a good start — but even then, many selective colleges would struggle to enroll racially diverse classes. Unfortunately, class-based affirmative action is simply not a realistic replacement for a race-based policy.

F1O6BP1PYC_I3JJ33JDSA02TNS,Pastor sues Ohio city after he faced charges tied to housing homeless people,Jonathan Edwards,"January 25, 2024 at 11:44 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/25/ohio-pastor-homeless-lawsuit/,"Pastor Chris Avell returned to his Bryan, Ohio, church on New Year’s Eve with doughnuts ahead of the Sunday morning service. As he was getting out of his car, he recalled spotting a police officer walking toward him.
Avell, who had been tussling with city officials for nearly two months about keeping Dad’s Place church open 24/7 and sheltering homeless people overnight, was told that he was being charged with 18 counts of violating the city’s zoning ordinance, the pastor recalled in an interview with The Washington Post.
On Monday, Avell’s church sued the city and several of its officials, alleging that they are trying to stifle Avell from exercising his religious beliefs by sheltering the homeless. In a 43-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern Ohio, the church accused city officials of waging a months-long harassment campaign to try to bully the pastor into evicting homeless people from the church. The lawsuit comes less than two weeks after Avell pleaded not guilty to the 18 zoning violations.
Bryan City Attorney Marc Fishel said officials are applying the law to Dad’s Place just as it would to any other business or organizations. Aside from zoning ordinances, the church violated fire codes in a way that endangered lives, the city alleged.
“Throughout this process, the City has merely tried to get Dad’s Place to comply with laws that apply to everyone,” Fishel said.
Jeremy Dys, a lawyer with First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm that’s representing Avell and that specializes in religious freedom cases, said the pastor wants to carry out his mission of taking care of people in need.
“This is what churches have done for centuries, millenia even,” Dys said.
The law the church’s lawsuit claims the city is violating protects religious institutions from governments discriminating against them using zoning laws. Frederick Gedicks, a law professor at Brigham Young University, said that city officials will have to demonstrate that stopping Dad’s Place serves a compelling public interest like fire safety, and that preventing people from staying at the church overnight is the least restrictive way to serve that interest.
At a hearing Tuesday, the church and the city agreed to maintain the status quo, Dys told The Post. That means that Dad’s Place will stay open 24/7 until at least March 4, when a judge considers the church’s request for an injunction against the city.
Last March, Avell said he saw more homeless people waiting for beds at the shelter next door to Dad’s Place. A local housing shortage left some on the streets after they’d hit the shelter’s limit on the number of nights they were allowed to stay there, he said.
“It was heartbreaking,” Avell told The Post.
He felt compelled to help, he said, and in March, opened the doors to his church 24 hours a day. For eight months, Dad’s Place church housed up to a dozen people a night, the lawsuit states. Two church volunteers stayed overnight to help, protect and minister to people, it adds.
“The Church’s religious mission in operating in this manner is to provide a place for people to go who have nowhere else to go and no one to care for them,” the suit states.
Dad’s Place received a cease-and-desist letter on Nov. 3 from the city’s planning and zoning administrator, ordering the church to stop housing people within 10 days, citing zoning laws, the suit states.
After considering the letter, Avell and the church decided that would contradict their religious obligation to care for “the least of these” in the community, a reference to a verse in the Book of Matthew, according to the suit. They kept the doors open 24/7.
“The ministry of the church is not confined to Sunday morning at 11am,” Avell said in a news release. “We welcome anyone to experience the love and truth of Jesus, regardless of the time of day.”
On Dec. 8, the city filed 18 criminal charges against Avell, and on Jan. 11, he pleaded not guilty during his arraignment.
The city claimed in its statement that, after learning in the late fall that Dad’s Place was housing people, it gave notice to Avell and the church to stop. Knowing people were sleeping there overnight, officials grew worried about the building complying with the state’s fire code, they said. In mid-November, the city’s fire chief conducted an inspection of the church, finding 18 violations, several of which were serious and could “endanger the lives and safety of those in the building,” including improperly installed laundry equipment, inadequate exits and concerns about ventilation, the statement alleged.
The fire chief ordered them to fix the violations by Jan. 9 and, upon coming back on Jan. 16, found that five remained, the city alleged.
“To date, there remain significant safety issues that Dad’s Place has not addressed,” Fishel said in his email.
In the lawsuit, Avell claimed that the church worked diligently to fix the violations, but added that officials would “move the goalposts” during their fire inspections.
During a sermon on Sunday, Avell vowed to keep the church’s doors open 24/7 because providing respite to those who need it is part of its Christian mission.
“The eyes of the world, the country are on Bryan, Ohio,” he told his congregants, adding: “We are a city on a hill. It is time to let our light shine.”"

F5NLGP10FT_BQMTVZS35GOBQEZ,One of Klimt’s ‘most beautiful’ portraits rediscovered after almost 100 years,Victoria Bisset,"January 26, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/gustav-klimt-portrait-frulein-lieser-auction/,"The last known location of “Portrait of Fräulein Lieser” by world-renowned Austrian artist Gustav Klimt was in Vienna in the mid-1920s. The vivid painting featuring a young woman was listed as property of a “Mrs Lieser” — believed to be Henriette Lieser, who was deported and killed by the Nazis.
The only remaining record of the work was a black and white photograph from 1925, around the time it was last exhibited, which was kept in the archives of the Austrian National Library.
Now, almost 100 years later, this painting by one of the world’s most famous modernist artists is on display and up for sale — having been rediscovered in what the auction house has hailed as a sensational find.
“The rediscovery of this portrait, one of the most beautiful of Klimt’s last creative period, is a sensation,” Austrian auction house im Kinsky said in a statement.
“A painting of such rarity, artistic significance, and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades,” it added. The painting will be presented internationally, including in Switzerland, Germany, Britain, and Hong Kong, before going to auction on April 24.
The 31-by-55-inch portrait could fetch between 30 million and 50 million euros ($32.5 million and $54.4 million) at auction.
Other works by Klimt, who is perhaps best known for his painting “The Kiss,” have sold for millions of dollars.
The Lieser family “belonged to the circle of wealthy, upper-class Viennese society in which Klimt found his patrons and clients,” according to the auction house.
It is unclear which member of the Lieser family is depicted in the piece: According to catalogues of Klimt’s work, Adolf Lieser — one of two brothers who were “among the leading industrialists of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy” — commissioned a painting of his 18-year-old daughter Margarethe Constance.
But some accounts suggest that Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, who was married to Adolf’s brother, Justus, until 1905, may have commissioned Klimt to paint one of her own daughters, im Kinsky said.
The subject — whoever she was — visited the artist’s studio nine times in April and May 1917, the auction house said. Small parts of the painting remained unfinished by the time of Klimt’s death in early 1918, when the piece was given to the Lieser family.
“The intense colors of the painting and the shift toward loose, open brushstrokes show Klimt at the height of his late period,” im Kinsky said.
Ernst Ploil, a managing director at im Kinsky, said in an email Friday that the painting was rediscovered in 2022, when the owner approached the auction house. The work had been purchased by a relative in the 1960s and passed through the family until it came into the possession of the current owner, he added.
Ploil said the firm had “checked [the] history and provenance of the painting in all possible ways in Austria” and “found no evidence that the painting has ever been exported out of Austria, confiscated or looted” during the Nazi era.
Equally, however, he said the auction house had no proof that the painting was not stolen — and so had reached an agreement with the present owner and the descendants of the Lieser family. He added that the deal is based on the Washington Principles, a set of guidelines for identifying and restoring artwork confiscated by the Nazis to their rightful owners.
Another Klimt work, “Dame mit Fächer” (“Lady With a Fan”), sold for $108 million in London last year — setting the highest price for any artwork ever auctioned in Europe, the Associated Press reported at the time. In 2006, his painting “Adele Bloch-Bauer I” — once at the center of a high-profile Nazi art theft case — sold for $135 million, a record sum at the time.
In 2017, a long-lost Leonardo da Vinci painting, “Salvator Mundi” (“Savior of the World”), sold for $450 million — in what auction house Christie’s described as “the most expensive painting ever sold at auction.”

FBBBSTVBZF_P1EPDPKG3W9B34U,Timeline: An increasingly tense dispute between Texas and the federal government,Philip Bump,"January 25, 2024 at 4:14 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/immigration-texas-federal-government/,"At the moment, no issue in American politics is more fraught than immigration. A surge in people hoping to enter the United States to seek political asylum in recent years has strained local, state and federal resources.
Beyond those strains, the increase also supercharged political commentary — particularly on the right, given that immigration is a federal issue and President Biden is a Democrat and up for reelection. At the extreme, the new arrivals (the numbers of whom are often exaggerated) have become fodder for anti-immigrant rhetoric that is at times explicitly racist or conspiratorial.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has, in practice and rhetoric, been at the forefront of combating the federal government’s handling of the surge. It’s not surprising that he should be, given how much of his state borders Mexico and, as a result, is tasked with accommodating the arrivals. In recent weeks, though, Abbott has taken steps that significantly increase his dispute with the federal government, both challenging federal authority and risking further escalation.
Below is a timeline of that tension:

Less than two months after Biden’s inauguration, Abbott announced that the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) would begin a crackdown on “the smuggling of people and drugs” into his state. He calls it “Operation Lone Star.”
“The crisis at our southern border continues to escalate because of Biden administration policies that refuse to secure the border and invite illegal immigration,” Abbott wrote in a statement. From November 2020 to February 2021, the number of monthly encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border climbed from 72,000 to 101,000. (That latter number was lower than several months in 2019, when Donald Trump was president.)
An assessment of the operation published a year later by the Texas Tribune, ProPublica and the Marshall Project determined that many of the successes claimed by its proponents were inflated.
“In an internal email in May,” the Texas Tribune reported, “DPS officials said that the DOJ was seeking to review whether Operation Lone Star violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin by institutions receiving federal funding.”
A news story from the El Paso Times noted that the deployment of razor wire along 60 miles of the border, meant to deter or block migrants from entering the state, had not been appropriately permitted by the federal government.
Abbott, who had declared a state of emergency in dozens of border counties because of the increase in migrants, responded on social media saying Texas “wasn’t asking for permission.”
We aren’t asking for permission.Instead we are doing the federal government’s job to secure the border.The Texas National Guard is taking the lead to uphold U.S. laws by establishing more than 60 miles of concertina wire barrier along the border.https://t.co/mzSErRQZnD
The government of Mexico made a diplomatic outreach to the United States to object to Texas’s use of razor wire and Abbott’s announcement that he would float barriers in the Rio Grande.
“The Mexican Government requested the United States that the buoys mentioned, just like the razor wire fencing, should be removed from the channel of the Rio Grande due to obstruction and deviation of runoffs toward Mexican territory,” stated a news release from Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs.
In a statement to the Dallas Morning News the following month, the U.S. government reiterated that it had not authorized Texas’s actions.
In a July 3 email to a supervisor, Trooper Nicholas Wingate described what he called “inhumane” orders he’d been given the previous month.
The Associated Press reported on Wingate’s allegations.
“[U]pon encountering a group of 120 migrants on June 25 — including young children and mothers nursing babies — in Maverick County, a rural Texas border county,” the AP wrote, “he and another trooper were ordered to ‘push the people back into the water to go to Mexico.’ ”
“In one instance, according to Wingate,” the report added, “a 4-year-old girl attempting to cross through razor wire was 'pressed back’ by Texas National Guard soldiers in accordance with orders and that the child later fainted from the heat.”
The large orange buoys Abbott had announced the previous month begin to be deployed in the river.
Soon after the rollout, the federal government sued, citing, among other things, humanitarian concerns — and the fact that the state didn’t have permission to install the buoys. A few days before the suit was filed, USA Today documented migrant children who had been injured by the razor wire.
The location of the buoy installation is important: in the river near Eagle Pass, Tex. The border city is in the Border Patrol’s Del Rio sector, where encounters with migrants more than tripled between federal fiscal year 2021 and 2022. From 2022 to 2023, the increase was a more-modest 56 percent.
One body was found stuck on the buoys; Texas officials said the body had become lodged there after the victim had drowned further upstream.
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s September 2023 decision ordering Texas to remove the buoys from the water.
“For months,” the AP reported, “Texas has asserted that parts of the Rio Grande are not subject to federal laws protecting navigable waters. But the judges said the lower court correctly sided with the Biden administration.”
In a dissent, one judge argued that removing the buoys “won’t dissolve any tensions that the Biden administration said have been ramping up between the U.S. and Mexico governments,” the AP reported. That’s significant, too, as a reminder that border disputes have national ramifications, reinforcing why the federal government has primacy on border protection.
Abbott was undeterred, signing into law a bill that authorizes spending another $1 billion on border barriers and another that makes it a state crime to illegally cross into Texas from Mexico.
Democratic lawmakers demanded the Justice Department sue to stop the laws from being implemented.

Read our letter: pic.twitter.com/L6K6UteEqF
The lawmakers’ letter argued that the state laws were “clearly preempted by federal law” and would likely result in racial profiling of Hispanics.
Tensions between Texas and the federal government now center on Texas’s seizure of a public park in Eagle Pass. The city’s mayor told the AP that he’d received a letter from DPS under the aegis of a state disaster declaration.
“This is not something that we wanted,” the mayor told the AP. “This is not something that we asked for as a city.”
Soon after, several migrants, including two children, were found to have drowned in the river near Shelby Park. The children were 8 and 10 years old.
See below my statement on the recent death of three migrants - a female adult and two children - near Shelby Park in Eagle Pass ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/0Fz878fnDg
Cuellar put the blame for the deaths on Texas, claiming that the Border Patrol had sought entry to the park to respond to claims of migrants in distress but were turned away.
This wasn’t accurate, as a later filing from the federal government made clear. The tragic drownings had occurred before the Border Patrol sought access to the area to respond to a different distress notification.
“It is impossible to say what might have happened,” the federal government’s top litigator, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, wrote in a court filing, “if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area — including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area.”
That filing was in support of the government’s appeal to the Supreme Court to allow it to remove Texas’s borders at the barrier. The government brought the case to the court in early January, arguing that Texas was preventing federal agents from doing their jobs.
That appeal was granted on a 5-4 vote in the Supreme Court. The dissenting justices were Samuel Alito, Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas.
Federal agents are now empowered to remove the razor wire placed by Texas.
Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.), compared the situation to a “civil war” — one somehow fomented by the government itself. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) offered his support for Abbott on social media.
On Wednesday, Abbott released a statement challenging the authority of the federal government on the issue.

The response to Abbott’s argument from constitutional scholars has been broadly dismissive.
“This is nonsense,” one told Newsweek. “Governors have no power to declare anything under the U.S. Constitution, nor does the Constitution give states any legal power to countermand the exercise of federal authority.”
Texas law enforcement officers continue to put up razor wire, despite the court’s decision.
Several Republican governors publicly sided with Abbott. The former president also weighed in on the matter. Trump, in a statement posted on social media, backed Abbott and “encourage[d] all willing States to deploy their guards to Texas to prevent the entry of Illegals, and to remove them back across the Border.”
In an appearance on Fox News Thursday morning, Abbott was asked if he would order DPS or other Texas agents to physically block federal officers trying to access the border near Eagle Pass.
“Texas has a right, as a state, to stop criminals from coming into our state,” he said. He added that Joe Biden “does have an option here” to enforce the law.
He did not respond to the actual question."
FFELOR6ZVX_73HBX3IRYT58QFD,Alabama plans first nitrogen gas execution after failed lethal injection,Kim Bellware,"January 25, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/25/alabama-nitrogen-execution-kenneth-eugene-smith/,"When Kenneth Eugene Smith enters the death chamber at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Ala., on Thursday night, he will be in a place that is at once familiar and entirely unknown.
Smith, 58, is expected to be placed on the same gurney that was used 14 months earlier, when he survived a botched lethal injection that was eventually called off because his death warrant was expiring and prison workers failed to set his IV line. But instead of being administered lethal drugs, prison workers will place a mask over his face and start the process of making Smith the first person executed by an untested method that uses nitrogen gas to force death by oxygen deprivation, a process known as nitrogen hypoxia.
If the execution moves forward, it will be the first time in more than 40 years that the United States has used a new execution method. The quest to use nitrogen hypoxia in executions came as drug companies refused to sell the chemical cocktails needed for lethal injections. It also encapsulates how proponents of capital punishment in America have been unrelenting in their fight to keep the practice alive. Twenty-one states still have the death penalty, and it remains legal but unused in six others because of suspension or moratorium.
Critics have decried nitrogen hypoxia, which is not known to be used for executions anywhere in the world, as human experimentation and akin to torture. The U.N. human rights office argued that the method could cause pain and suffering because Alabama does not intend to sedate Smith before execution. Alabama has argued that it is a workable, effective method that will allow closure to the family of Smith’s victim from a 1988 murder-for-hire plot.
Smith is one of two living prisoners to survive an execution attempt. The trauma of his nearly four-hour failed lethal injection in November 2022 is part of the basis for his attorney’s legal arguments that subjecting Smith to execution again is cruel and unusual, and a violation of his rights.
Smith, in an interview with NPR in December, said after receiving his current execution date that his anxiety surged far past what he felt the last time.
“Everybody is telling me that I’m going to suffer,” he told NPR. “Well, I’m absolutely terrified.”
The use of the death penalty in the United States has been on the decline for a decade. Changing attitudes toward capital punishment, difficulty in legally sourcing lethal injection drugs and wariness in the wake of botched executions have accelerated its disuse. Last year, just five states carried out executions, a figure the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a nonprofit research organization, said is the lowest number of states in 20 years.
While some states have turned away from their death penalty process, others have sought to evolve theirs: switching the types of lethal injection drugs used, reviving once-abandoned methods such as the firing squad or developing new methods entirely.
New execution methods tend to emerge when people become uncomfortable with old ones, said Robin Maher, the executive director of the DPIC. The electric chair was created in the late 19th century and billed as more humane than hangings, but the gruesome spectacle of condemned men sizzling and sometimes catching fire in their wired chairs eventually fell out of favor, too.
“Executions moved indoors, into chambers, sometimes in the middle of the night,” Maher said. “They were made more clinical, more quiet, less bloody.”
Lethal injection fit that narrative, until drug manufacturers, starting with suppliers in the European Union, where capital punishment is banned, pulled their drugs from being used in executions. As states scrambled to find alternative drugs, they also increasingly enacted new statutes and constitutional amendments that shrouded their execution process in secrecy. States such as Oklahoma and Texas argued that it was to prevent harassment of suppliers and interference with carrying out a legal punishment.
“Alabama has refused to tell the public critical information about its protocol,” Maher said.
Supreme Court refuses to stop Alabama nitrogen-gas execution
What is known about Alabama’s approach to Smith’s execution is drawn from a heavily redacted protocol released in court filings. Smith will be fitted with a mask, and pure nitrogen will flow into it until Smith no longer has oxygen left to breathe. The atmosphere is about 75 percent nitrogen, but breathing pure nitrogen with no oxygen in the mix is toxic and eventually leads to death.
Prison workers planned to meet several times before the execution to practice, and oxygen monitors will measure the air in the chamber. Unlike previous executions using cyanide gas, Smith will be on a gurney with nitrogen coming through his mask and not in an enclosed chamber.
Alabama’s method “alarmed” Philip Nitschke, an Austrian doctor and euthanasia advocate who is familiar with using nitrogen gas in lethal situations through his work directing the pro-euthanasia group Exit International.
Nitschke traveled to Alabama in December to look at the state’s setup for the nitrogen gas execution at the request of Smith’s lawyers. Seeing it in person did nothing to allay his anxiety, he told The Washington Post.
“This could be some grim and horrible, macabre death,” Nitschke said of Smith’s execution. He assessed that Alabama’s setup had the potential for significant error, including leaks in the mask, which could prolong the execution process.
Nitschke supports nitrogen hypoxia for assisted suicide but has rebuked Alabama’s approach. A key concern is the use of a face mask to deliver nitrogen gas, a method he said the “right to die” movement abandoned more than a decade ago in favor of pods, plastic bags or hoods that fully envelop the head.
Execution by gas has a brutal 100-year history. Now it’s back.
Nitrogen gas can yield a reliable, peaceful death, but there are glaring differences between the method used by people willfully wanting to kill themselves and what Alabama is attempting, Nitschke said. Patients who use nitrogen for assisted suicide are cooperative, calm and can practice entering a pod, or wearing a hood; Smith is being executed against his will.
Smith expressed fear in court filings that his mask could become dislodged if he prays out loud or hyperventilates. Nitschke inspected the mask Alabama plans to use and said it would be relatively easy to break the seal. At that point, the wearer could involuntarily gasp for enough oxygen to slow the process.
Anesthesiologist Joel Zivot, who teaches at Emory University and has performed numerous autopsies on executed prisoners, said states such as Alabama have a poor track record of carrying out constitutional executions. He notably performed the autopsy of Joe Nathan James Jr., where the state took about 3½ hours to complete his execution. Zivot was skeptical that a new method by the same state would fare any better than the three previous botched injections — including Smith’s in 2022 — that prompted Gov. Kay Ivey (R) to briefly suspend executions.
Jeff Hood, Smith’s spiritual adviser, had to sign a waiver acknowledging he could be exposed to the gas and had to agree to stand at least three feet from Smith, NPR reported.
“The most damming part of this to me is the idea of asking Jeff Hood to sign a waiver and saying ‘look, you could be at risk, too,’” Zivot said. “It’s such an obvious area of incompetence that they can’t even protect the witnesses.”
Hood told ABC affiliate WAAY in December that he feared for his safety.
“If a nitrogen leak were to happen in the execution chamber, who will be there?” Hood said. “What is the emergency procedure if I collapse?”
Alabama officials have steadfastly stood behind their procedure. In a filing to a federal appeals court last week, Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office called nitrogen hypoxia “the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.”
Marshall said carrying out Smith’s execution is important for holding Smith accountable for the 1988 murder-for-hire death of Elizabeth Sennett.
Sennett, a 45-year-old mother and pastor’s wife, was stabbed and beaten with a fireplace implement in what was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary at the Colbert County, Ala., house she shared with her husband, according to court records.
Investigators determined her husband, a preacher named Charles Sennett, who was having an affair and deeply in debt, had taken out an insurance policy on his wife and paid John Forrest Parker and Smith $1,000 each to kill his wife. Sennett killed himself a week after his wife’s murder when investigators identified him as a suspect. Parker was executed by lethal injection in 2010.
Mike Sennett, one of Elizabeth’s two sons, told WAAY that he plans to attend Smith’s execution with his brother, and that they have waited more years than the time they shared with their mother to see Smith executed.
“He’s got a debt to pay, and it don’t matter to us how it happens,” he said.
Smith’s lawyers on Thursday made a second last-ditch plea to the Supreme Court to stop the execution, characterizing Alabama’s methods as unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment because the state will expose Smith to a “substantial risk of being left in a persistent vegetative state, experiencing a stroke, and/or asphyxiation.”
His legal team told the justices that Smith is at real risk of vomiting and choking to death during his execution because of the planned deprivation of oxygen. As a result of the first failed execution, his lawyers said, Smith has already experienced nausea and vomiting in the lead-up to his new execution date.
Marshall, Alabama’s attorney general, blasted Smith’s petition and request for a stay in a response filed Thursday. The state’s response said that Smith’s claims had little chance of success and that he is unlikely to vomit and choke during his execution, noting that he will have taken his last meal more than eight hours before. Should Smith vomit, the state said, they would remove and clean the mask and clear Smith’s airways before continuing.

FGSWGZD8IX_C80YCHI4RNWF1YM,Vatican court convicts former altar boy who served the pope,Anthony Faiola,"January 23, 2024 at 1:42 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/vatican-abuse-conviction-martinelli/,"ROME — A Vatican appeals court on Tuesday convicted a priest of corrupting a minor when he served as an altar boy for the pope within the walls of the Holy See, handing down a 2½-year prison sentence in a case that brought allegations of sexual abuse — and the church’s resistance to rooting it out — into the geographic heart and spiritual center of the Roman Catholic Church.
The appeals court on Tuesday partially reversed the 2021 acquittal of Gabriele Martinelli, 31, in the Vatican’s first criminal trial on sexual abuse. The court concurred that there was no evidence Martinelli had used coercion when he engaged in sexual relations with a slightly younger peer, between 2006 and 2012, while living in a Vatican youth seminary with other boys who served in papal Masses. But it determined that he could be found guilty of corruption of a minor for the last period of the misconduct, when he was an adult and the victim still underage.
A teen was accused of abuse inside Vatican City. Powerful church figures helped him become a priest.
The conviction can still be appealed to the Vatican’s highest court. But the victim, who was 13 when he says the abuse began, and his lawyers hailed the verdict as “historic.”
“The first feeling I had was this: For years I was told I was a pervert, a faker, a liar, a madman, who was exploiting this for his own ends,” said the victim, now 30, in an interview with The Washington Post. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his privacy.
“But all these years of pain and fatigue now have a meaning. There’s some lightness pouring in,” he said.
The victim’s lawyer, Laura Sgrò, said: “This is the first verdict dealing with sexual violence, and convicting someone for it, inside the Vatican. From this point of view, this is historic.”
Martinelli has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Post investigation in 2021 detailed how Vatican officials had largely ignored accusations against Martinelli — despite repeated written warnings to senior clerics, up to and including the pope — and launched only speedy, superficial investigations.
The victim’s roommate was kicked out of the seminary after sounding the alarm. Martinelli was ordained as a priest in 2017.
Only after media scrutiny did the Vatican revisit the case and put Martinelli on trial.
The case was unprecedented. The Vatican for years had dealt with alleged abusers out of the public eye, in administrative decisions shrouded in secrecy or canonical trials with religious penalties, such as the defrocking of convicted clerics.
The 2021 ruling acquitting Martinelli concluded that the statute of limitations had expired for the charge of corruption of a minor. But on Tuesday the court ruled that the period between Aug. 9, 2008, and March 19, 2009, when Martinelli was of legal age and the victim was a minor, fell within the statute of limitations.
The verdict carried a rare Vatican prison sentence in a city-state with only three jail cells. Last month, a Vatican court issued other harsh sentences, including of a high-ranking cardinal, in a corruption probe.
Martinelli was also issued a fine and must cover the legal fees of the victim.
The decision did not address whether he can remain a priest.
A rector who also faced trial in 2021 for covering up the case — the Rev. Enrico Radice, 74 — was previously acquitted and was not subject to the appeal."
FI9829NQGI_O4LK48KAYDE8HA5,Opinion America’s social ills are not simply due to inequality and despair,Eduardo Porter,"January 25, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/economic-inequality-despair-redistribution/,"There is a grim, fairly popular story of the American social contract that goes roughly like this: Motivated by entrenched racial hostility, the greed of the rich (or maybe something else), the richest country on the planet refuses to develop a true welfare state that might secure the well-being of its citizens.
Taxation and redistribution have been successfully resisted, branded as illegitimate scams to feather the beds of welfare queens. Globalization and technological disruption have been embraced even as the institutions designed to protect the most vulnerable workers — unions, minimum wages — have lost their power to provide for a dignified living.
In this American story, the less fortunate — Black, Brown and White — are left to scratch by as best they can, often falling into a deep well of misery. The rich engorge themselves way beyond anything seen in other wealthy, industrialized societies of the West. And yet, though the destitution is clear for all to see, recent research suggests that the story built around it is, at best, incomplete.
The accepted narrative was built on the back of pathbreaking research by Thomas Piketty, now at the Paris School of Economics, and the University of California at Berkeley’s Emmanuel Saez, which established just how far inequality had been allowed to rip through the fabric of society.
Subsequent work by economists David Autor at MIT, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson, now at Harvard’s Kennedy School, documented how the surge in imports from China since roughly the early 1990s had devastated communities across the United States that relied on manufacturing for sustenance.
Princeton University scholars Anne Case and Angus Deaton made the case that these dynamics were deadly, producing an epidemic of suicides and overdoses that they called “deaths of despair.”
“Inequality and death are joint consequences of the forces that are destroying the white working class,” they wrote. “It is the deeper forces of power, politics and social change that are causing both the epidemic and the extreme inequality.”
This narrative is consistent with a constellation of data documenting the poor health of American society — from the nation’s short life expectancy and high infant mortality rate to a poverty rate that exceeds that of other wealthy democracies.
And yet, the straightforward story might be wrong.
Critics have left some dents in the “deaths of despair” thesis: The availability of opioids, they point out, does a better job explaining the overdose mortality patterns than socio-economic despair. The mortality trends look different when adjusted by age. The rise in mortality among the less educated is mostly about cardiovascular disease, not suicide, alcoholism or drug abuse. And it afflicts a small sliver of deeply disadvantaged Americans, not the working class writ large.
The accepted story of America’s intertwined ills has been challenged from a more fundamental front by new research suggesting inequality might not have evolved as most of us thought. The most prevalent story among economists, following the seminal work by Piketty and Saez, has argued that the rising concentration of income in the hands of the richest Americans has drastically shrunk everybody else’s share of the pie.
But a recently published alternative estimate, by economists Gerald Auten of the Treasury Department and David Splinter of Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, suggests that the share of income going to the top has remained roughly flat since 1960.
Inequality has increased, for sure. Yet once they include the effect of redistribution, adding taxes and government programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, Social Security and the like, the academics find that the poorest one-fifth of Americans drew roughly the same share of income in 2019 that they did about 60 years ago.
The new analysis has fueled a scholarly mini brawl over the true depth of American inequality. And it raises a prickly but critical question: How can we explain the fraying of the social contract if inequality hasn’t soared? The inverse can’t be true: It’s tough to fit the short life expectancy, the suicides, the extreme obesity and the high incarceration rates in a story in which inequality is tamed and desperation isn’t deadly. It leaves the United States littered with a trail of scattered ailments without the connective tissue of a narrative.
In an honest effort to find a workable new synthesis, here’s a suggestion: Inequality might not cause these symptoms on its own. Instead, many of America’s social maladies stem from the strategies it has chosen to mitigate the lopsided distribution of income, which leave its citizens singularly vulnerable.
The U.S. government doesn’t do much to affect how the market allocates prosperity. Unions are weak; the federal minimum wage is becoming irrelevant; retraining is patchy. If trade or a sudden technological shift makes swaths of the workforce redundant, there is next to nothing out there to help workers back on their feet.
Redistribution, then, must do most of the work. The U.S. government raises considerably less in taxes than do other Western democracies. But it does so more progressively, taxing people at the top most heavily. At the bottom, it largely provides help in cash. The earned income tax credit, for instance, is one of the most critical tools for lifting the income of low-wage workers. Poor families with children benefit from a child tax credit that puts money in their pockets.
Europeans are more aggressive about reshaping prosperity. Their unions are more powerful. Worker councils protect workers from swings in the market. Labor laws are more protective of incumbent workers.
European redistribution, moreover, is not just larger but different. European governments raise money more regressively, relying heavily on consumption taxes that take bigger bites out of the pockets of the poor. They use much of the money to pay for rich, often universal, welfare programs such as universal health care and housing, child care and early child education.
These institutional differences can help explain the chasm between workers’ experience on either side of the North Atlantic. In Europe, bigger job and wage protections have gone some way to prevent the spread of precarious, low-pay work, which has become prevalent across the U.S. service sector. And their redistribution might have also done a better job at preventing deeper social maladies.
Cash is not a bad tool. An economist will tell you it is, in fact, the best — with more power to increase welfare than any government service. Still, research suggests that poverty hurts economic decision-making. This could make a case for governmental paternalism in the European vein: redistribution aimed at some specific, desirable outcomes rather than just supporting the income of the poor.
Europe’s strategy is not without costs. Labor protections there shift unemployment onto the young. Still, it seems indisputable that European workers — and those in other rich economies — are surviving global capitalism without as many casualties, even though they have less money. The earned income tax credit might be a good tool for supporting the income of vulnerable Americans, but it has proved unable to mitigate America’s dysfunctions.
This might appear like some trivial academic brawl. But America’s dysfunctions are convulsing its politics. They could end up convulsing the world. It makes sense to figure out where they come from and try to fix them."

In today’s edition:
BREAKING: The vibes have shifted.
For quite some time now, the economy has been happily humming along — low unemployment, high growth, slowing inflation. Nevertheless, the Bureau of Labor Sentiments, chaired by Catherine Rampell, has reported in vibe check after vibe check that Americans just aren’t feeling it.
Until now. “Optimism is busting out all over the country,” Catherine writes.
Consumer confidence is increasing, and the share of Americans who think we’re in a recession (we’re not!) is down. Catherine names some tangibles she thinks we can credit, including higher prices in the stock market and lower ones at the gas pump.
Jennifer Rubin thinks the turnaround has a lot to do with the media shaping up after painting a dreary economic picture for far longer than was warranted. She writes: “You have to wonder whether the gap in perception was thanks to overly negative coverage.”
Regardless, with consumers, reporters and reality now all on the same page, President Biden might soon be in better electoral shape, Catherine and Jen agree.
The economy is almost always the most important issue to voters, Jen points out, and there are still months for a new narrative to crystallize.
And even if the economy does not “suddenly transition into a winning issue for the incumbent,” Catherine writes, “it might stop being an albatross around his neck.”
That will be a boon for Democrats, who are at this point almost certainly stuck with Biden no matter what avian adornments he’s sporting — a jam for which they can only blame themselves, Jim Geraghty writes. The Democratic National Committee, he says, “challenger-proofed” the primaries for the president.
Just look to New Hampshire this evening: If a Democratic primary falls in the forest but the DNC doesn’t allocate any delegates accordingly, does it even make a sound? No sane challenger would take on Biden in the committee’s tailor-made sweep of states he’s strong in.
Chaser: New Hampshire’s Republican primary will matter, perhaps tremendously. Follow along live tonight with our collection of election analysts.
From China analyst Richard Fontaine’s warning that assumptions about China’s inexorable decline are dangerous and unfounded.
Fontaine quotes more than a handful of top China watchers and worries over their growing consensus that the world has reached (or already passed) “peak China.”
Not so, he says. The country’s economy is still huge, its trade output still dominant, and its tech and military prowess still formidable. A decline might be coming, but it’s no guarantee.
Which is why, Fontaine writes, this narrative is so scary. If it comes to “represent the assumptions on which U.S. policy is based,” he warns, “America will fail to rise to China’s challenge.”
Have you been observing Dry January, in which participants give up drinking alcohol for a month? I’ve been right there with you! Except for my one friend’s birthday party. And après toddies during last week’s ski trip. And that beer on the couch with Season 3 of “Slow Horses.”
Okay, perhaps my January has been more damp than dry. But if you’ve managed to abstain, Leana Wen writes, your body will thank you. Temperance’s benefits include better sleep, weight loss and reductions in blood pressure and liver inflammation.
Your mind might thank you, too. Leana writes that the real benefit of a month off booze is the space for us to rethink our relationship with it: Why do we drink? Are we imbibing in a healthy way?
And good news: Leana writes that this introspection is just as possible for those of us whose month gets a little moist.
Er, chaser: If you feel as though you’re somewhere in the 18th week of January, find commiseration in writer and copy editor Benjamin Dreyer’s lamentation of this longest month, from 2023. (As always, linguistic surprises enclosed.)

FU0FLP236G_9IU4L9ZLI9ZR0FJ,A roaring tailwind just hurled a passenger plane at 826 miles per hour,Matthew Cappucci,"January 26, 2024 at 1:37 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/26/airplane-flight-record-speed-pacific-jetstream/,"China Airlines Flight 5116 rocketed to a speed of 826 mph as it bolted eastward across the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, potentially breaking informal records for passenger travel. The commercial flight, which departed from Taipei, landed more than an hour early in Los Angeles, propelled by exceptionally strong tailwinds.
A roaring Pacific jet stream, supercharged by the El Niño climate pattern and moving at more than 250 mph, gave the flight a boost.
Official records for commercial flight speeds aren’t kept, but a recent article in Simple Flying said a British Air Boeing 747 flying near Greenland had set a record when it reached 825 mph in February 2020.
Other flights were also hurled by this week’s extra-swift high-altitude winds. For example, China Airlines Flight 6, flying the same route as Flight 5116 on Friday, hit 822 mph.
The jet stream winds even enabled these planes to surpass the speed of sound (767 mph). China Airlines 5116, a Boeing 777, has a cruising speed of 564 mph, but the jet stream bumped it up over 800 mph — much like walking on a moving walkway adds to a pedestrian’s speed.
But the aircraft did not break the sound barrier. Even though its ground speed was greater than the speed of sound, it was still moving through the surrounding air at its ordinary cruise speed. It just so happened that the surrounding air was also moving.
China Airlines 5116 flew its route of 7,205 miles in just 10 hours 18 minutes, which rounds to an average speed of 700 mph! That’s including takeoff, landing and all the slower points in the journey. (Working against the jet stream, an average westbound flight from Los Angeles to Taipei is usually scheduled for 14 hours 40 minutes.)
There were more super fast flights Thursday and Friday. Among them:
What made the jet stream so fast? Ordinarily it has crests and dips, which limit just how fast its flow can get. Picture a kinked hose — even if water is flowing through it, it slows until you stretch it straight. Then fluid flows through the hose swiftly. Same premise here.
The jet stream is usually faster in the wintertime, and the world’s fastest jet stream tends to be over the Pacific. It’s easy for the river of furious winds to roar eastward without any land masses or topography (mountains, etc.) slowing it due to friction.
In addition, jet streams are fueled by temperature contrasts. Because the tropical Pacific Ocean is warmer than normal because of the El Niño climate pattern, there is a stronger temperature difference between southern and northern reaches of the ocean in the northern hemisphere, intensifying the jet stream in between.
The same active Pacific jet stream will bring storm systems to California and the Pacific Northwest. Back-to-back atmospheric rivers will deluge the region, causing heavy mountain snows and rain in the lowlands.
Planes can reach similar speeds over the North Atlantic given the right conditions. On Feb. 7, 2020, a KLM flight reached a ground speed of 819 mph over Newfoundland. It was a Boeing 747; the pilot snapped a photo of his instrument panel and reached out to The Washington Post after the flight.

FUB4FVSH28_OH87KZFWMU9XOJ7,"Austrian who imprisoned, raped daughter for decades to go to general prison",Kate Brady,"January 25, 2024 at 8:11 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/25/josef-fritzl-austria-father-incest-prison-daughter/,"BERLIN — An Austrian court ruled Thursday that the man convicted of imprisoning and raping his daughter for 24 years, during which he fathered seven children with her, can be moved from psychiatric detention into a regular prison.
The verdict was based on a psychiatric assessment that Josef Fritzl, 88, who became known as the “Monster of Amstetten” and now reportedly has dementia, no longer poses a danger. His earlier request to be moved to a regular prison was rejected in 2022.
Fritzl, who has changed his name, was handed a life sentence in 2009 after being convicted of incest, 3,000 instances of rape, coercion, false imprisonment, enslavement and negligent homicide of one of the seven children he had with his daughter.
As part of the conditions for leaving Stein prison’s high-security wing for mentally disturbed patients to join the general prison population, the regional court in Krems an der Donau stated “he must prove to the court that he has attended regular psychotherapy every three months” for a probationary period of the next 10 years.
For now, Fritzl’s “everyday life will remain similar. Prison is prison,” said his lawyer, Astrid Wagner.
While his application for conditional release from the “normal prison system” was rejected, Wagner saw the ruling as “an important first step” to seeking his eventual release. She told reporters she planned to work for her client’s early release by next year.
According to Austrian law, prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment are potentially eligible for parole after 15 years — in Fritzl’s case this would be March 2024.
Following the brief hearing, Wagner said Fritzl told her “how he regrets what he did.”
“He was actually close to tears,” she told local media.
The atrocities endured by his daughter Elisabeth made global headlines in 2008 when it emerged that she had been lured into Fritzl’s purpose-built, soundproofed basement at their home in the northeastern Austrian town of Amstetten in 1984.
According to authorities, his wife who lived on the second floor with the rest of the family was allegedly unaware of the horrors in the basement.
The crimes spanning more than two decades were exposed in spring 2008, when Fritzl sought medical care for one of the daughters he fathered in the basement. Police received a tip from the suspicious doctor.
Elisabeth and her surviving children took on new identities and moved to an undisclosed location.
The decision to transfer Fritzl is not yet legally binding and the public prosecutor still has 14 days to appeal, after which the Vienna Higher Regional Court would decide."
FVE4V5IKLM_AVG1RJJVDMZ1GOH,Opinion How much does Nikki Haley’s gender matter?,Alexi McCammond,"January 23, 2024 at 1:27 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/23/nikki-haley-woman-campaign-2024/,"You’re reading the Prompt 2024 newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox.
Nikki Haley wants GOP voters to elect a woman to the White House, but it can’t be just any woman. The next president must not offend the Republican Party’s masculine sensibilities, so the former U.N. ambassador has presented herself as “a badass woman” who wears high heels as “ammunition.” Kicking enemies with those bad boys, she often says, will hurt a lot more.
Now that she’s the last Republican standing against former president Donald Trump, I asked my Post Opinions colleague Karen Tumulty: Does that strategy makes sense? How much does Nikki Haley’s gender matter in this race?
Alexi McCammond: I’ve been a little surprised that Nikki Haley has been on the rise with an electorate that is otherwise enamored with Donald Trump, who is definitely not respectful of women, to say the least. What do you think of how Haley has used her status as the only woman in the race?
Karen Tumulty: Gender is tricky for Haley for two reasons: First, and probably most important, is that conservatives are suspicious of identity politics. Second, there’s a lot of research that shows it’s harder for a woman to win support when she is running for executive office. So Haley goes about it cautiously.
Alexi: How so?
Karen: She talks about her opponents as “the fellas” and makes jokes that her five-inch heels are weapons. In both cases, it’s a way of showing strength and portraying herself as an alpha female.
Alexi: Is that how women must operate to be successful in politics? Hillary Clinton wasn’t necessarily seen as an attack dog. Ditto Carly Fiorina.
Karen: Actually, remember Hillary’s 3 a.m. phone call ad in 2008? It suggested Barack Obama was unprepared for the tough decisions that a president has to make. And Carly Fiorina was running on her record as a CEO.
Alexi: I was still in high school for the ’08 primary. 🙈 But I do remember Fiorina’s campaign! I was in New Hampshire for the 2016 primary, actually. Sometimes I wonder if we should even care that Haley is a woman. Or care about gender at all when considering a candidate’s qualifications.
Karen: It makes a difference to have different perspectives and life experiences represented. Kay Bailey Hutchison (a former Republican senator from Texas) once told me that when she got to the Senate, she discovered that federally funded medical research was generally conducted with male subjects. She got that changed.
Alexi: That’s a great story and so true that different perspectives, of course, make for better solutions.
What’s happening with the Republican primaries? We’ll text you.
Karen: It says a lot that the last candidate left standing against Trump is a woman. I think she has employed her gender shrewdly in this race. Don’t forget: This isn’t, as they say, Nikki Haley’s first rodeo.
Alexi: Yeehaw to that! 🤠 Stay warm in New Hampshire, please!
It’s true Haley has to be cautious about how and when she brings up her gender, and she deserves credit for how she has managed the balancing act. You might roll your eyes when Haley makes a joke about her heels — or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) — but we really should be talking about how wild it is that a woman is Trump’s biggest primary threat right now.
I mean, the GOP is not exactly for the girlies. Consider this research, which shows that registered Republicans are less likely to vote for female candidates than Democrats, and Republicans view women as more liberal candidates than men, even when they’re not.
Moreover, Republicans have been especially unpopular with women in the post-Roe era. The party’s voters don’t seem to mind that Trump has been in court this week defending himself against defamation claims from E. Jean Carroll, the writer whom a jury found him liable for sexually abusing in the mid-’90s. (Trump denies the claims.) Some on the right are even trying to make it harder for women to divorce their husbands!
I don’t believe a President Haley would be the best choice for women overall, but she’s certainly a bright spot for women on the right. She has set up “Women for Nikki” volunteer groups in every early primary and caucus state through Super Tuesday, and she was the sole female voice at all of the GOP primary debates, where abortion restrictions were a big part of the discussion. That means something.
Judging by the polls in New Hampshire, Haley likely won’t be the 2024 nominee. But her campaign has revealed a hopeful space for non-MAGA women in the GOP.
The question now is: Will the Republican Party welcome more troublemaker women like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) or those with broader appeal like Haley?
The subreddit r/Astrology is one of the many I follow, and just last week there was a hidden political nugget in the comments. The user Potato_wedge was seeking interpretations on an upcoming planetary alignment: “April looks really intense,” they wrote, noting that Mercury will be in retrograde. “Not only do we start the month with an eclipse but we have a comet at the same time. This is immediately followed by the Saturn and mars conjunction ... Overall it looks really volatile this spring into summer.”
One commenter said it “probably just means Nikki Haley gets the nomination over Trump then 😂.” Another user wrote back: “If that happens maybe we’ll also get Newsom or Whitmer on the Democratic side 🙏🏽.”
Here’s hoping astrologers are better at predicting politics than pollsters."

Where are they now?",Annabelle Timsit,"January 24, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/jewish-holocaust-survivors/,"Eight decades since Nazis killed millions of Jews in the Holocaust, only about 245,000 of those who survived are still alive to tell the tale.
After the Holocaust, Europe’s heavily diminished Jewish population spread out across the globe. Since most countries do not systematically track survivors, it has not been clear how many were still alive — until now.
The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany published on Tuesday what is thought to be the first comprehensive, verified estimate of the size of this population, where they live and what their needs are. Known as the Claims Conference, it is an organization that secures compensation payments from the German and Austrian governments for Jewish Holocaust survivors.
Six million Jews were murdered by Germany’s Nazi government, in power between 1933 and 1945 — equivalent to two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population before 1933. The Nazis also persecuted and massacred Roma people and other minority groups and political enemies on a smaller scale during this time.
Today, the global Jewish population is estimated to be around 15 million. According to the report by the Claims Conference, survivors alive today are spread out across more than 90 countries. Nearly half live in Israel. The United States, France and Russia host the next largest groups of survivors.

Most of the survivors alive today were children during the Holocaust: 75 percent were between the ages of 3 and 12 in 1945, when World War II ended. Today, the median age of this group is 86. Over 60 percent are women.
“The data forces us to accept the reality that Holocaust survivors won’t be with us forever,” said Greg Schneider, executive vice president of the Claims Conference, in a news release. “We have already lost most survivors.”
Rüdiger Mahlo, the Claims Conference Representative for Europe, said it’s important not to see just the statistics revealed by the report, but also “the people that are behind it.”
“Those people were doomed to be murdered, all of them,” Mahlo said. “It is our responsibility to care for them until the end of their lives.”

SAMUEL GRANADOS/THE WASHINGTON POST
When survivors die, a living piece of history dies with them. Leon Weintraub, 98, one of the living Jewish survivors, said it is more crucial than ever to share and preserve the lessons from that history in the face of Holocaust denialism and rising nationalist sentiment across Europe. Despite the troves of evidence of Nazi crimes, “there are still people who deny that this happened,” he said.
Weintraub was 13 when the Nazis forced him and his family to leave their home in Lodz, Poland, and move into a ghetto, where he learned to work as an electrician. The family was then deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where more than 1 million people were murdered, mostly in gas chambers. Weintraub’s mother and aunt were among them. He still remembers “the smell of burned flesh around-the-clock” and “heavy, black” smoke coming from the chimneys, he said.
Weintraub managed to escape Auschwitz by embedding himself with a group of inmates who were sent to work at a different concentration camp. He was forcibly transferred to two other camps before he was liberated by Allied forces in April 1945. With his body weight down to about 77 pounds, and sick with typhoid fever, Weintraub ended up in a hospital in Germany. Out of 80 members of his family, only 16 survived, he said.
After the war, Weintraub practiced as a gynecologist and obstetrician in Poland and Sweden. Since the 1980s, he has shared his story publicly to raise awareness about the horrors of the Holocaust and help ensure it never happens again. “It begins very innocent, only, ‘I do not like these people,’” he said. “And then it becomes hate” and “ends in the gas chamber,” he said.
Drummer, 98, started band with fellow Holocaust survivors, now tours world
Before the publication of its demographic report, the Claims Conference collected data on Holocaust survivors who received regular compensation payments or who were eligible for services administered by organizations that work with the Claims Conference. But it did not have up-to-date information on the thousands of survivors who received one-time payments at some point in the past four decades, including whether they were still alive.
That changed in 2021, when the Claims Conference negotiated with the German government to obtain supplemental payments for some eligible Holocaust survivors. To disburse these yearly payments, which were designed to last through 2027, the organization got in touch with more than 200,000 survivors, according to the report.
The estimate of 245,000 Holocaust survivors alive today does not include survivors who never came forward to receive compensation payments or never contacted the Claims Conference.

Holocaust survivors’ needs are changing as they grow older, Mahlo said. After the Claims Conference was first created in 1951, Mahlo said most survivors who came into contact with the organization wanted to know if they were eligible for any compensation for what happened to them. As they have grown older, “it has evolved into, ‘can I get home care?’”
Nowadays, said Mahlo, they tend to ask more existential questions, such as: “Who will remember when I am not here anymore? Who will remember the fate of my family, of what happened during the Shoah [the Holocaust]? Who will remember … in the way we remember it?”"

The blaze swept through the Central Exhibition Hall on Sunday in the city of Sukhumi, where the gallery was located on the second floor of a building. The cause of the fire has not been determined.
The gallery’s estimated 4,000 artworks were mostly stored in poor conditions, unprotected and jammed into small rooms and narrow halls, according to the news website Abkhaz World.
That treatment of the region’s artwork “painfully mirrors our country, plagued by criminal neglect and abandonment,” commentator Roin Agrba wrote on Abkhaz World.
The fire brought an “irreparable loss for the cultural heritage of our state,” the regional parliament said in a statement.
The gallery had held much of the work of Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze, noted for his production designs of operas and shows at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, and elsewhere.
Abkhazia, a region of steep mountains about the size of Cyprus along the Black Sea coast, came mostly under the control of separatists in 1993 after intense fighting. Georgia held a small portion of Abkhazia's interior until the 2008 Russia-Georgia war.
Russia now stations thousands of troops in Abkhazia and recognizes it as an independent country. Nicaragua, Nauru, Venezuela and Syria also recognize Abkhazia’s independence but other countries regard it as a part of Georgia."
G62WNA1LFP_CBW1QHMPOMR79RQ,Cross burning in South Carolina stirs debate over hate-crimes laws,Tim Craig,"January 26, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/26/south-carolina-hate-crimes-laws/,"Monica and Shawn Williams, both Black veterans of the U.S. Army, thought they had bought a retirement home in a neighborhood that lived up to South Carolina’s slogan: “Smiling Faces, Beautiful Places.”
But within hours of moving into their three-bedroom house near Myrtle Beach in 2021, the Williamses said their next-door neighbors, a White couple, started scowling at them. The uncomfortable stares eventually led to racial slurs and a bitter two-year dispute. Then, on the day after Thanksgiving, they discovered a cross set on fire just outside their yard.
“I can’t believe what I am seeing,” Shawn Williams, 59, said he thought. A dozen relatives visiting for the holiday also grew distraught.
When Horry County Police Department officers and firefighters arrived, the neighbors stood near the cross and hurled racial epithets at the family, according to police reports. But police left that night without charging anyone with a crime. South Carolina is one of just two states without a hate-crimes law.
“Since no criminal activity took place, this report will be for informational purposes only,” the initial police incident report concludes.
A week later, after the Williamses protested the lack of charges, Horry County police filed second-degree harassment charges against Alexis Hartnett, 27, and Worden Butler, 28. Bail on the misdemeanor charges was set at $500, and the couple were released from jail within hours.
Both cases are pending. Neither has yet entered a plea. Butler has asked for a jury trial and is expected to appear in court in March.
Now, the fallout from the cross burning in Conway is reverberating across South Carolina — turning into a galvanizing moment for civil rights activists pushing the state legislature to enact a hate-crimes law. The bill is named in honor of the pastor who was killed along with eight others in a predominantly Black church in Charleston in 2015.
The debate over a proposed hate-crimes law in South Carolina comes as legislators around the country are gearing up for sessions expected to take on what constitutes a hate crime and how to enforce the statutes. From the Northeast to the Pacific Northwest, lawmakers believe they have the best chance in decades to make substantial changes to how crimes involving a host of matters involving race, religion and sexual orientation are investigated and prosecuted.
Many GOP lawmakers have resisted enacting broad new state hate-crimes laws in recent years — but a number of those legislators are now at the forefront of the outrage over an apparent rise in antisemitism following Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Democrats now believe 2024 may be the year for a bipartisan breakthrough on hate-crimes laws.
In New York, legislators will consider a proposal to increase the number of charges that can be classified as hate crimes and given more severe penalties. In Pennsylvania, lawmakers will weigh legislation to update the hate-crimes law for the first time in two decades. And in Georgia, legislators will consider a proposal to better define what constitutes antisemitism.
The flurry of legislation comes at a time when the country is increasingly strained over acts of hate that have left vulnerable communities on edge.
Attacks against racial minorities as well as the LGBTQ+ community rose after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, according to FBI statistics. There was another surge of hateful incidents against Asian Americans after the coronavirus pandemic originated in China. Now, law enforcement agencies report a significant uptick in antisemitic and Islamophobic behaviors related to Israel’s war in Gaza.
According to the most recent FBI statistics, there were 11,634 hate-crime incidents reported in 2022, compared with 10,840 in 2021. In 2019, before the pandemic, the nation reported 7,314.
“I think what is happening around the country helps build momentum toward its passage,” said Pennsylvania state Sen. Jay Costa (D), who is pushing for legislation that adds sexual orientation and disability to the state’s hate-crimes law. “There is no question in light of October 7, my Republican colleagues are to seriously consider advancing some of these measures.”
The Williamses said they never considered South Carolina’s lack of a hate-crimes law when they purchased their property in Conway. Wyoming is the only other state without a hate-crimes law, although several cities there have enacted ordinances.
The couple wanted to be closer to the ocean and spend their golden years in a house that could accommodate visiting friends and relatives. They said they were the first Black family to move into their subdivision filled with one- and two-story houses on spacious tree-lined lots. The neighborhood is about 15 miles from Myrtle Beach.
Most of their new neighbors were welcoming. But the couple said Hartnett and Butler refused to talk to them.
“There was just a lot of staring and things that make you feel intimidated,” said Monica Williams, 58. “And [Butler] was doing a lot of strange things on his side of the property — burning bonfires, using machetes and crossbows.”
Monica Williams, who spent 11 years in the Army and now works as a teacher in Charlotte, said other neighbors cautioned them about Butler.
“They warned us to be careful of him,” she recalled. “Most felt he was all bark and no bite, but we had one neighbor who really warned us, saying, ‘You all need to get a fence.’”
So the Williamses spent $13,000 on a fence, the first section of which was completed in the spring of 2023. Butler became enraged and would frequently harass the surveyors and construction crew, the Williamses said.
“They would call us complaining, ‘This guy won’t let us do our work,’” Monica Williams said.
Meanwhile, according to police reports and court documents, Butler was engaged in work on his side — digging a “moat” around his property.
On Thanksgiving, as she waited for her extended family to arrive, Monica Williams said she reached out to Butler and Hartnett to try to ease the tensions.
But when she approached their property, Hartnett came running out shouting racial slurs, Monica Williams said. Then, she said, her neighbor threatened her.
“She said, ‘I have killed Black people before and I didn’t get caught and I will do it again,’” Monica Williams recalled. “She said, ‘I shoot n-words.’”
An arrest warrant issued after Hartnett was charged with harassing the Williamses accuses her of “threatening bodily harm and referencing having killed a black woman in the past.”
The Washington Post attempted to reach Butler and Hartnett by phone, but several numbers were disconnected. The Post sent a certified letter to their house seeking comment, but no one was home to accept it. An attorney listed in court files did not return phone calls seeking comment.
A day later, the Williamses looked out their window and saw the cross burning in Hartnett and Butler’s yard. As the flames flickered, Hartnett bolted out of the house “ranting and raving, calls us all kinds of n-words” as police looked on, according to Monica Williams. A police report also stated an officer’s body camera captured Hartnett “repeatedly using a racial slur towards the victim family.”
But responding officers did little to stop Butler and Hartnett, and they left the scene after concluding no crime had been committed, the Williamses said.
“We just felt so unsupported and alone,” Monica Williams said. “Police and firefighters are just standing there and they did not realize how serious and intimidating a cross burning is and what it represents.”
Horry County police did not respond to a request for comment.
A few days later, Monica Williams decided to contact Horry County Sheriff Phillip E. Thompson to see if her neighbors would face any repercussions. Thompson told the Williamses he had no knowledge of the incident — but he promised to check with Horry County police on whether they investigated the matter.
Within 24 hours, the Williams family received a phone call from a deputy chief saying police leaders did not even know the cross burning had occurred.
“He was very apologetic for how things were handled,” Monica Williams said.
Police then intensified their investigation, discovering Butler had posted on Facebook that he intended to burn the cross to send a message to the Williamses. Next to a picture of the Williamses’ mailbox, Butler had written he was “summoning the devil’s army and I don’t care if we both go down in the same boat,” according to a police report.
Investigators charged the couple with second-degree harassment a week later.
In an interview with My Horry News, a Myrtle Beach-area news outlet, a local police commander said it took time to build a case against the couple because it’s not a crime to burn a cross.
“There is no current law for burning a cross in your own yard. It’s the totality of the situation at hand,” said Capt. Danny Furr of the Horry County Police Department. “It was done in a way in order to intimidate.”
The cross burning — as well as police officers’ initial response — was condemned by civil rights leaders in South Carolina who saw it as one more warning that the state needs a hate-crimes law.
“It was a cross this time, but what comes next? The rope?” asked the Rev. Kenneth Floyd, president of the Conway branch of the NAACP.
Because South Carolina has no hate-crimes law, the state has become reliant on the FBI and federal prosecutors to tackle crimes suspected of being motivated by bias, Floyd said. Federal laws generally allow prosecutors to charge anyone who injures or attempts to injure someone because of their race, color, religion, sexual orientation or national origin. Interfering with a person’s right to conduct federally protected activities like work and travel on account of those factors can also be a crime.
The FBI is conducting an investigation into what happened to the Williamses. In December, after news of the cross burning became public, the FBI visited the house where Butler and Hartnett live. An FBI spokesman said the investigation is ongoing.
Jimmy Richardson, the state prosecutor for Horry County, said his job would be easier if South Carolina had a hate-crimes law. Richardson added that the magistrate who set Butler’s and Hartnett’s minimal bail could only consider whether they were a flight risk or danger to the community.
“I don’t know if these charges of harassment really speak to the type of harassment that occurred,” he said.
Last year, Richardson noted, a man was leaving “disturbing antisemitic literature” on mailboxes and in door hinges in Myrtle Beach. But state prosecutors could only charge the suspect with littering.
Just in the greater Myrtle Beach-Conway area, the NAACP has documented 94 incidents over the past decade that the civil rights organization suspects of being driven by hate. The incidents range from property destruction and assaults to intimidation, said Marvin Neal, a vice president of the South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP.
Neal suspects the true number of cases is far higher.
“With the lack of a hate-crimes law, people have gotten to the point where they just don’t even report it anymore,” Neal said.
Last year, the Republican-controlled state House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a hate-crimes law, which would have added five years to prison sentences if someone was convicted of a violent crime that targeted a person because of their race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or physical or mental disability.
But the measure stalled in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
State Sen. Josh Kimbrell (R) has been opposed to the hate-crimes bill but said he’s open to considering it this year — if it removes protections based on sexual orientation. He believes hate-crimes protections for the LGBTQ+ community will lead to “censorship of free speech.”
“Right now, anything to do with sexual orientation or gender identity is a very prickly subject,” Kimbrell said in an interview. “I am open to a discussion but as of now, the language is far too broad and I can’t support it.”
In several other states, there is expected to be more momentum behind revisions to hate-crimes laws.
In New York, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) — whose office prosecuted 111 hate crimes last year, compared with 31 in 2019 — has teamed up with Assembly member Grace Lee (D) and several other legislators to upgrade that state’s statute. The proposed law adds 31 categories of crimes that can be prosecuted as hate crimes, including gang assault, forcible touching and making graffiti.
“Unfortunately, we are seeing hate crimes being committed in ways that probably wouldn’t have even been conceived of when the statute was originally enacted,” said Lee, who is Asian American and notes there has been a surge of xenophobia against Asian New Yorkers. “It is important we take a proactive approach to addressing hate crimes because there is a long-term corrosive effect when hate crimes are committed and there is no consequence.”
On the West Coast, lawmakers in Washington state are considering a bill to establish “a hate crimes and bias incidents hotline” where residents can report hate crimes.
A team of researchers at Florida Atlantic University and the University of Colorado concluded that state hate-crimes laws are often murky and leave too much discretion to police and prosecutors. Many states’ statutes, for example, mention churches but fail to explicitly cite synagogues and mosques.
“Victims are the one who suffer from that,” said Seth Fallik, an author of the report and a criminology professor at Florida Atlantic University.
The Williamses say they know all too well about that suffering.
Fearful of their neighbors in Conway, the Williamses fled back to Charlotte, their primary residence, where they plan to stay until more can be done to ensure their safety.
“My sense of security and sense of peace of mind has been totally eradicated at this point,” Shawn Williams said. “I can no longer send myself, my wife, my family or any friends to that house.”
“We love the state of South Carolina,” Monica Williams added. “But they need to get it together and stop playing games with racial issues.”"

Sign up to get it in your inbox.
In today’s edition:
“Juicy cantaloupes in summer, ripe figs in fall” Alyssa Blakemore rhapsodizes in the first paragraph of her op-ed — “these are but a few of the mouthwatering choices my son enjoys every day at his …”
Farm-to-table osteria? Michelin-starred trattoria?
“… Italian preschool.”
As someone who was raised on cardboardy cafeteria pizza that would make any self-respecting Neapolitan cry out for mamma, I am rather astounded. And that, writes Blakemore, a military spouse from Michigan living in Vicenza, Italy, is precisely the problem.
She describes how her kid’s preschool forbids outside food in favor of meals it prepares in-house. Other schools cater from off-site — but fresh is always the rule. The delicious dishes she mentions will leave you hungry — and maybe a little resentful of how American schools feed kids.
Perhaps parmesan risotto followed by a rabbit roulade with spinach is unrealistic in the United States (and perhaps I should enroll in Italian preschool!). But even modest modifications toward more healthful food, Blakemore suggests, could set up American kids for a much more dolce vita.
Ron DeSantis has at last stepped down from his chunky boots and out of the race, suspending over the weekend his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. That leaves just a two-person battle between Nikki Haley and Donald Trump — but don’t mistake that for any contest.
Karen Tumulty reports from New Hampshire that a win in the state on Tuesday is Haley’s last real shot at salvation, and the odds are growing longer. Despite doubling her support in the Granite State since November, Haley still trails Trump by nearly 20 points.
Karen blames an insufficiently bold campaign that, instead of dishing the “hard truths” it advertised, churned out “applause lines that go down like vanilla ice cream with Republican audiences.”
If there’s any hope for Haley, Karen says, it’s probably in the wide-open nature of New Hampshire’s contest, which allows voters not affiliated with either party (a plurality in the state) to vote in whatever primary they like. Non-Republicans could be a real force.
Matt Bai figures that plenty of Democrats are rooting for Haley, too, even if a victory for her means President Biden’s eventual loss.
The alternative of Biden vs. Trump is, Matt writes, a “whopper of a risk” that more than excuses “some sizable segment of voters, including Democrats — I don’t know what the number is, but I’m betting it’s not less than a third — for being not so much pro-Biden as anyone-but-Trump.”
If wishes were horses, Haley would be first past the post by a mile. Alas, as Ted Johnson notes, “most of the nation thinks the outcome is already decided.”
He sees the nigh-inevitable Trump-Biden contest as not just a reprise, but a finale, too: “the end of the ’80s presidents.”
At heart, Ted writes, Biden and Trump are both men of that decade, when “the country tried shaking off the blues” by winning, winning, winning. Ted isn’t surprised by the rematch, given a United States once again desperate for a comeback.
But age means the ’80s ethos is rapidly evaporating — and, honestly, maybe it’s time.
Chaser: A counterpoint from E.J. Dionne: Trump is not a colossus, and the party pushing that narrative is a riven mess.
From physician and activist Uché Blackstock’s essay on the kneecapping of Black medicine in America, adapted from her new book on racism in health care.
Blackstock provides the history of the 1910 Flexner Report, by White education specialist Abraham Flexner, which standardized U.S. medical schools. Most of the existing Black schools (which had already graduated hundreds of physicians) lacked the resources to keep up and thus shuttered.
Generations of Black doctors, Blackstock writes, disappeared. Think, she urges, how different today’s health care would be for Black people — how much smaller the inequities — had those doctors come along.
The Flexner Report is only one brick in the high wall that has long kept Black people out of medicine. Identifying the others is the first step toward fairness. Blackstock’s essay takes the next one, too, with solutions for how to start tearing that barrier down.
Chaser: The Editorial Board writes that if the Biden administration wants to save Black lives, its looming decision whether to ban menthol cigarettes is not a hard one.
The thinking of the most optimistic camp regarding Chevron deference is that if the Supreme Court, as is expected, throws out this principle that allows Congress to delegate rulemaking authority to agencies with more expertise, Congress will have no choice but to step up its responsibilities and write legislation that is less vague.
Ramesh Ponnuru is not in this camp. Voters have allowed Congress to be utterly dysfunctional, and no court ruling will get it to do its job.
Jason Willick puts forward an interesting argument that the Supreme Court should (kind of) skip out on its job, too. Most commentators on the impending ruling on Trump’s eligibility to stay on the presidential ballot have urged the court to rule clearly that the former president either is or isn’t eligible.
Jason makes the case for a secret third thing: punting.
Chaser: Conservatives want to unleash the courts, the Editorial Board writes of Chevron deference. They might regret asking.

G9LGSD207U_LV5I7D53RQ3BVLG,Trump takes another stride toward GOP nomination with DeSantis dropout,Josh Dawsey,"January 21, 2024 at 5:49 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/trump-gop-nomination-desantis-endorsement/,"ROCHESTER, N.H. — Former president Donald Trump sped toward clinching the 2024 GOP nomination on Sunday as the endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signaled further consolidation behind him and a rising sense of resignation among Republicans who hoped to stop him.
Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), head of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, reacted to DeSantis’s announcement that he was dropping out of the race by calling Trump “the presumptive nominee” and urging Republicans to unite behind him. Trump also picked up the support of Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who had previously endorsed DeSantis.
Trump began his speech here on Sunday by congratulating DeSantis and praising him, his wife and his campaign. “It’s not easy,” Trump said. “He was very gracious and he endorsed me. So I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron and everybody else to defeat Crooked Joe Biden.”
He went on to attack his sole remaining GOP challenger, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, as trying to defeat him by mobilizing independents, including those who lean Democratic, to vote in the Republican primary.
“Your vote in this primary is your personal chance to score the ultimate victory over the liars, cheaters and frauds trying to destroy America. Nikki Haley has made an unholy alliance with RINOs and Never Trumpers,” he said, using a pejorative abbreviation for “Republicans in Name Only.”
New Hampshire Republican strategist Mike Dennehy said DeSantis’s departure from the race “makes it virtually impossible for Nikki Haley to keep Trump under 50 percent. And there’s a chance that Trump could hit 60 percent on Tuesday,” he said. “From every indication anecdotally and from polling, DeSantis voters are Trump voters through and through.”
The former president has been topping 50 percent support in the latest polls of the first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday, and his campaign has been taunting Haley by trotting out surrogates from her home state of South Carolina, whose Republicans are scheduled to vote next month.
Trump’s team invited several prominent South Carolina lawmakers to New Hampshire, including Gov. Henry McMaster and Lt. Gov Pamela Evette, and found the elected officials happy to travel. A senior adviser for the Trump campaign described their goal as ending the primary quickly and showing Haley that winning in the state she used to govern would be difficult for her.
But the endorsement of Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) in South Carolina was meant to particularly sting because Haley and Scott had actually been friends for years, people close to both of them said.
“New Hampshire seems to be where she hung her potential success — after that, it gets a lot more tricky for the governor,” Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.), who traveled to New Hampshire on Saturday to boost Trump, said of Haley. “Republicans are united behind the president and seem to be consolidating every day.”
Trump’s top advisers on Sunday released a memo reminding reporters of Haley’s and New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu’s bullish predictions about her performance here, arguing that she set herself an impossible task of winning outright. The advisers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, dared her to drop out and back Trump or else “be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED [sic] in her home state.”
“Overwhelmingly South Carolina would go for Trump by 30 or 40 points against Haley,” said South Carolina state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, who was his state’s first elected official to support DeSantis and immediately endorsed Trump on Sunday when DeSantis dropped out. “A lot of people in the Republican base are frustrated with her and certainly how she’s handled this campaign. Her campaign isn’t going to play well here, and she’s already alienated a lot of her supporters here.”
Rob Godfrey, a longtime aide and former top spokesman to Haley, said Haley was a “clear underdog” in South Carolina because of Trump’s popularity and name recognition in the state. He said she had to come in a “strong second” or win New Hampshire to keep people on board with her campaign.
“While I know she is poised to do well in the state — and I know she has the strength and fight to go on no matter what happens — I also know she could start to hear from significant supporters or donors, who would tell her that protecting her brand and future means not prolonging the race unnecessarily if Trump runs up a significant margin,” he said.
Trump’s team is having a major fundraiser at his club in Florida next month, according to an invitation reviewed by The Washington Post, and has told donors who have not given in the past that they should get on board now, people familiar with the invitation said. One donor who backed DeSantis said he planned to call Trump allies in the coming days to try to get back in Trump’s good graces.
Haley, who was campaigning at Brown’s Lobster Pound in Seabrook, N.H., congratulated DeSantis and wished him well, while welcoming the one-on-one showdown with Trump.
“May the best woman win,” she said to cheers.
Democrats also seized on DeSantis’s announcement to portray the contest as a two-person race between Trump and Biden. “There is no path for Nikki Haley to overtake Trump,” said Aaron Jacobs, a spokesman for the write-in campaign for President Biden in Tuesday’s Democratic primary (in which he is not appearing on the ballot because the Democratic National Committee designated South Carolina as the first official primary). “We urge all Granite Staters to join us on Tuesday in writing in Joe Biden, the one candidate who has beaten Trump before and will beat him again.”
The rising sense of Trump’s inevitability contributed to DeSantis’s decision to withdraw, according to a person who spoke with him about the decision. The person said DeSantis determined that many Republicans, as well as right-wing media, started treating his nomination as a foregone conclusion.
One longtime Florida ally of DeSantis said it was a mistake to endorse so quickly. “You have no leverage now,” this person said. But the person said DeSantis also did not want to further invoke the ire of Trump and his team and realized the run had been bruising for his once-strong brand.
Trump and DeSantis had not yet spoken since the endorsement, a person familiar with the matter said. The former president’s team was in a jubilant mood, people close to him said, and he visited volunteers at his Manchester headquarters on Sunday.
After focusing primarily on DeSantis through the Iowa caucuses, Trump’s campaign has turned its fire on Haley here, attacking her for past positions on taxes, Social Security and Medicare benefits, immigration and foreign intervention. At the same time, the super PAC supporting Trump has worked to discourage independent turnout for Haley with mail-pieces portraying her as “MAGA.”
Longtime New Hampshire operatives described DeSantis’s exit from the race as the latest hurdle for Haley that will make it virtually impossible for her to beat Trump in New Hampshire. About two-thirds of DeSantis supporters have consistently said that Trump was their second choice, according to recent polling by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.
“The second choice for DeSantis has been Trump throughout this election, so if anything it’s going to boost Trump’s support,” the center’s director, Andrew Smith, said. While Haley still leads with anti-Trump voters and independents who lean Democratic but who are going to vote in the Republican primary, “there just typically aren’t enough of them.”
But Matt Mowers, a Republican strategist who ran for Congress in New Hampshire, said the numbers that he has seen both in private polling and public polling show DeSantis’s supporters splitting between Trump and Haley. Mowers added that DeSantis wasn’t “taking a lot of market share in New Hampshire to begin with.”
Hours ahead of Trump’s speech, a rowdy crowd of his supporters lined up around the block outside in the 20-degree weather chanting his name at passing cars. The packed audience inside the 750-seat theater here waited eagerly for the candidate, chanting “We believe that Trump will win!”
“My fellow deplorables,” Ryan Terrell, the state party’s vice chair, said in his warm-up speech. “We are back.”
Dylan Wells, Marianne LeVine and Hannah Knowles contributed to this report.

He was 97.
The publicist for his son, musician and actor Harry Connick Jr., announced the death but did not provide a cause.
Mr. Connick dethroned an incumbent prosecutor, Jim Garrison, in a 1973 election. He won reelection four times and successfully built biracial support as the city’s political power base shifted to African Americans.
After retiring in 2003, he was dogged by questions about whether his office withheld evidence that favored defendants. The issue came to the forefront with a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a lawsuit filed by John Thompson, who was exonerated after 14 years on Louisiana’s death row for a killing he didn’t commit.
In a 5-4 decision, the high court overturned a $14 million award for Thompson, ruling that the New Orleans district attorney’s office shouldn’t be punished for not specifically training prosecutors on their obligations to share evidence that could prove a defendant’s innocence. In a scathing dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg decried “Connick’s deliberately indifferent attitude.”
The issue was revived in 2014 when a murder conviction against Reginald Adams, imprisoned for 34 years, was reversed. Attorneys for the Innocence Project New Orleans presented evidence that detectives and prosecutors in the case had withheld critical information before Adams’s 1990 conviction. Adams later received $1.25 million in a court settlement.
Mr. Connick repeatedly declined to comment on the cases but defended his legacy in an 2012 interview with the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
“My reputation is based on something other than a case, or two cases or five cases, or one interception or 20 interceptions,” he said. “Look at the rest of my record. ... Perfect? No. But I’ve done nothing to go to confession about in that office. At all.”
Joseph Harry Fowler Connick Sr. was born in Mobile, Ala., on March 27, 1926, and moved to New Orleans with his family at 2 for his father’s career with the Army Corps of Engineers.
He served in the Navy in the South Pacific during World War II, then graduated from Loyola University in New Orleans with a degree in business administration and received a law degree from Tulane University.
In 1973, Mr. Connick was a little-known federal prosecutor when he took on Garrison, a three-term district attorney.
Known as “Big Jim,” the 6-foot-7 Garrison gained worldwide publicity when he unsuccessfully prosecuted a New Orleans businessman in connection with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and insisted that a massive cover-up was taking place regarding the assassination.
After Garrison lost his big case, Mr. Connick challenged him by running as a reformer and won by just over 2,000 votes.
In the 1970s and ’80s, Mr. Connick led crackdowns on prostitutes and used 19th-century morality laws to shut down adult book shops in the French Quarter. In the ’90s, anti-capital-punishment groups attacked Mr. Connick for his insistence that prosecutors seek the death penalty in most first-degree murder cases.
Mr. Connick learned firsthand about being a defendant: Federal prosecutors charged him in 1990 with racketeering and aiding a sports-betting operation. The indictment alleged that Mr. Connick returned betting records to a convicted bookmaker who wanted the records to collect gambling debts.
Mr. Connick was acquitted, then won his fourth election the same year.
His first wife, Anita Levy Livingston, died in 1981. In 1995, he married Londa Matherne. In addition to his wife, survivors include two children from his first marriage, Suzanna and Harry Jr.
For years, the elder Connick sang pop standards in French Quarter nightclubs. His music was politically useful. He developed close friendships with Black musicians — and Black voters. That was crucial for a White candidate in a city where, at the time, nearly 70 percent of voters were African Americans.
Support from powerful Black politicians was also key to his political survival. In 1996, Mr. Connick defeated a Black challenger and gave credit to Mayor Marc Morial, whose supporters campaigned heavily for Connick."
GJUD9AZ3CK_LAW9CRURUEFTI3S,"Ken, not Barbie, got an Oscar nod. Even Ryan Gosling is disappointed.",Leo Sands,"January 24, 2024 at 8:37 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/01/24/ryan-gosling-oscar-barbie/,"The running gag in “Barbie” is that Margot Robbie’s titular character is “everything,” while co-star Ryan Gosling plays “just Ken.” But this week, it was Gosling who earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, while the movie’s linchpin female duo — Robbie and director Greta Gerwig — were snubbed.
His response to earning his third Oscar nomination, however, was a mixed bag.
“I am extremely honored to be nominated by my colleagues alongside such remarkable artists in a year of so many great films,” Gosling said in a statement to news outlets Tuesday.
“But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally celebrated film,” he said. “No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent, grit and genius. To say that I’m disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement.”
Eva Mendes, Gosling’s partner, congratulated him on Instagram on Wednesday, and applauded him for overcoming “#Notmyken ridicule and articles written about him” to cinch Oscar praise.
“So proud of my man,” she wrote. “He created this completely original, hilarious, heartbreaking, now iconic character and took it all the way to Oscars. So beyond proud to be this Ken’s Barbie.”
America Ferrera was the only woman to be recognized for an acting role in the film, which is a piece of feminist art intended to show women shaking off the yoke of patriarchy.
The gaps on “Barbie’s” nomination list triggered a mixture of confusion and outrage among the film’s fans, who were quick to point out the glaring irony of it all. It’s worth noting that “Barbie” still racked up eight Oscar nominations, including best costume design, music, production design, adapted screenplay writing (for which Gerwig was named as a writer) and best picture (for which Robbie was named as a producer).
The biggest 2024 Oscar nomination snubs and surprises
After the nominations were announced, Simu Liu, who starred as one of the film’s many Ken characters, tweeted that he had witnessed firsthand “just how hard Greta and Margot had to fight to get Barbie made, and how flawlessly they executed.”
“Together they started a movement, touched the world and reinvigorated the cinema,” he said. “They deserve everything. They ARE everything.”
Even Hillary Clinton, the first female presidential candidate for a major political party, shared her reaction to the apparent snub on social media. “Greta & Margot, While it can sting to win the box office but not take home the gold, your millions of fans love you,” she wrote. “You’re both so much more than Kenough. #HillaryBarbie”
And, because the year is 2024, even Oklahoma’s Department of Wildlife Conservation weighed in with its take: “hypothetically, if I was going to nominate a film about a badger, starring a badger, called ‘Badger,’ for best picture... I would also nominate the badger, right?”
hypothetically, if I was going to nominate a film about a badger, starring a badger, called ""Badger,""for best picture... I would also nominate the badger, right?
While Gerwig and Robbie have not made a public statement, a video shared by “Barbie” actress Ana Cruz Kayne showed the two joining the film’s cast members in celebrating the film’s Oscar haul.
A post shared by Ana Cruz Kayne (@anacruzkayne)
The full list of 2024’s Oscar nominations
“Barbie” is the third film directed by Gerwig to be nominated for an Academy Award.
This year’s nominations were historical in other ways — including Lily Gladstone’s as best actress for her role in “Killers of the Flower Moon,” making her the first Native American to be nominated in the category, and Colman Domingo becoming the first Afro Latino best-actor nominee for his role in “Rustin.”
But the lack of racial diversity in the nominations was still evident, some cinephiles said. While many decried “#OscarsSoPatriarchal” on social media, others argued the sidestepping isn’t new for actors of color, particularly criticizing the academy for failing to nominate a number of Asian actors involved in best-picture-nominated movies over the years.
“Past Lives” was nominated for two Oscars this year, but its director, Celine Song, and lead actress, Greta Lee, both of Korean descent, weren’t given nods in individual categories, some fans pointed out. “Parasite” was the first foreign-language film to win best picture in 2020, and “Slumdog Millionaire” was the 2009 best-picture winner, but those two films — like other best-picture nominees “Life of Pi,” “Drive My Car,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “The Last Emperor” — also did not receive nominations in the acting categories, fans noted.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
Some social media users pointed out the irony that Gerwig’s script for “Barbie” weighed in on women receiving due credit for their work.
As Ferrera, playing the character of Gloria, said in a monologue in the film: “I’m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us.”
She continued: “Never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that, but also always be grateful.”

GKWNQY2HIG_UV28BEJ4BA1AYXU,Most N.H. GOP primary voters say Trump fit for presidency even if convicted,Amy B Wang,"January 23, 2024 at 11:42 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-voters-trump-trials-2020-election/,"Early exit polling in New Hampshire shows just how much former president Donald Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election — and his continued claims that the legal cases against him are politically motivated — have taken root in his voter base.
About half of those who voted in the New Hampshire Republican primary Tuesday believed the false claim that Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 presidential election, according to preliminary exit polls, underscoring the persistence of Trump’s false claims within the GOP that the election was stolen from him.
1/5
Of those voters who believed Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election, an overwhelming majority — nearly 9 in 10 — voted for Trump in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, while about 1 in 8  voted for former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, the only remaining major challenger to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.
Of the New Hampshire primary voters who said Biden was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election, over three-quarters supported Haley and about 2 in 10 supported Trump, preliminary exit polls showed. About 1 percent supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who announced over the weekend that he was suspending his campaign.
The margins from New Hampshire on the question of the legitimacy of Biden’s 2020 win were similar to those from the Iowa caucuses, with a majority of those thinking Biden’s win was legitimate supporting Haley and a majority of those saying it was not supporting Trump, according to entrance polling conducted in the Hawkeye State last week. But unlike in New Hampshire, two-thirds of Iowa Republican primary voters said Biden did not legitimately win.
Trump is facing a total of 91 charges across four criminal cases, two of which are centered on his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A slight majority of New Hampshire Republican primary voters said Trump would be fit to serve as president even if he were convicted of a crime, while just over 4 in 10 said he would not, according to preliminary exit polls.
Of those who said Trump would not be fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime, more than 8 in 10 supported Haley. A similar majority of those who believed Trump would be fit to be president even if he were convicted of a crime supported the former president.
In Iowa, about two-thirds of voters said he would still be fit for the presidency even if convicted, according to entrance polls in the state. There, too, the voters who believed that went heavily for Trump.
These are preliminary results from a survey of 2,129 voters as they exited randomly selected voting sites in New Hampshire on Jan. 23, 2024. The poll was conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC), The Washington Post and other media organizations. Totals may not add to 100 percent because of rounding.

The shooting occurred about 3:30 p.m. in the 4600 block of Minnesota Avenue NE, near the Deanwood Metro Station.
Ramey Kyle, an assistant D.C. police chief, said the driver of what appears to be a light-colored Acura sedan pulled alongside the stolen Kia in the northbound lane and someone inside opened fire.
Kyle said two occupants of the Kia were struck by bullets, including a juvenile in his late teens who was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that do not appear to be life-threatening.
Police said the other occupant, also a male, was pronounced dead at the scene. His age was not immediately available; police said they were trying to confirm his identity Monday evening.
Police said three males were seen running from the Kia after the shooting. Officials said they were also looking for the Acura, which Kyle said had distinctive damage to the front and back.
Kyle said the Kia had been stolen earlier Monday in Prince George’s County, Md. He said police do not know if the people in the Kia at the time of the shooting are connected to the vehicle theft.
No arrests have been made."
GS2C8RUWOL_ZX0118UBHN4U8II,DeSantis is far from the first to quote something Churchill never said,Jonathan Edwards,"January 22, 2024 at 1:39 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/22/ron-desantis-winston-churchill/,"Ron DeSantis ended his presidential campaign Sunday but promised to keep fighting “woke ideology” as Florida’s governor. To illustrate that his failure was not his last chapter, DeSantis quoted the prime minister who led the British to victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
“Winston Churchill once remarked that success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.”
But he never said that, according to the International Churchill Society.
It was a final misstep in a campaign criticized for being plagued by them. DeSantis is not alone in using a fake Churchill quote. Experts coined the phrase “Churchillian drift” to describe someone erroneously citing the former British prime minister to add intellectual weight to what they were saying. It’s been happening for decades but has exploded in recent years as internet users crave short, witty phrases and burnish them by slapping on Churchill’s name.
“The reason why Churchill is so often misquoted is that the person quoting him is attempting to evoke his legacy of resilience, optimism and perseverance,” International Churchill Society Executive Director Justin Reash told The Washington Post in an email.
The DeSantis campaign did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment from The Post.
Churchill is one of the most misquoted figures, in the company of George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain — all sources of sharp, quotable phrases whether they said or wrote them.
“Winston Churchill has become something of the king of fake quotes — a phenomenon the Internet has pushed to the extreme,” according to the Churchill Project at Hillsdale College in Michigan.
There are good reasons for that, Reash told The Post. His life spanned from the Victorian era to the Atomic Age, and he was front and center for most of it. According to Reash, he spoke or wrote more than 40 million words and, with his sharp wit and expansive mind, was eminently quotable.
And yet, people often quote things he never said.
The most common misquote is the one DeSantis used, along with, “If you’re going through hell, keep going,” Reash said.
In 2018, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) shared a photo of Churchill to his private Twitter account that included the quote, “The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists,” and the words “CHURCHILL ON THE LEFTWING.” Abbott added, “Some insights are timeless,” the Associated Press reported.
After getting criticized online, Abbott deleted the tweet but defended the meaning behind it, saying that “it was irrelevant to me who may or may not have said that in the past.”
In December 2022, as news broke that then Rep.-elect George Santos (R-N.Y.) was being accused of wide-ranging misconduct, his lawyer released a statement denouncing what he described as an attempt to “smear his good name with these defamatory allegations.” The lawyer ended with a quote to make his point.
“As Winston Churchill famously stated, ‘You have enemies? Good. It means that you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.’”
Except that Churchill never said that, either.
That won’t stop people, from anonymous internet users to name-brand politicians, from quoting him anyway.
“All types of people, public figures included, look to Churchill’s example of legendary leadership in unimaginable adversity for inspiration,” Reash said. “That is why he is quoted so often, he inspired people in his time, and he continues to inspire people around the world today.”"
GWMSZLAIC3_FHJ9IL4QEEFAQJZ,White House calls Alabama’s nitrogen gas execution ‘troubling’,Amy B Wang,"January 26, 2024 at 3:12 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/white-house-troubling-alabama-execution/,"The White House called Alabama’s use of nitrogen hypoxia to execute a prisoner Thursday night “troubling,” noting that President Biden has long had “deep concerns” with how the death penalty is implemented.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, a death row prisoner at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Ala., was executed Thursday night using nitrogen gas, the first known instance in the world that method was used to execute a prisoner.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that reports of Smith’s execution were “troubling to us as an administration.” She added that it underscored why Biden supported Attorney General Merrick Garland’s 2021 moratorium on federal executions, pending a review of death penalty policy changes made during the Trump administration.
“The president has long said and has had deep, deep, deep concerns with how the death penalty is implemented and whether it is consistent with our values,” Jean-Pierre said. “So we are deeply troubled by it, by what we heard by about Kenneth Smith’s death.”
According to media witnesses Thursday, Smith appeared conscious for at least two minutes while the gas flowed to his mask. He shook and writhed for at least two minutes on the gurney, and this was followed by two minutes of deep breaths and then a period of time during which media witnesses were unable to determine whether he was breathing.
The curtain closed at 8:15 p.m. local time, 10 minutes before the state pronounced him dead.
Speaking to reporters after the execution, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Q. Hamm called Smith’s shaking and writhing “involuntary” and said a 45-minute delay in the execution was because of “a hiccup on the EKG line” that was preventing a good reading.
Asked Friday for details on why the White House found the execution so troubling, Jean-Pierre repeated: “The use of nitrogen gas, of course, it is troubling. It is troubling to us.”
She said she had not discussed Smith’s death specifically with Biden but that the president had spoken to his concerns about the death penalty more broadly. During his 2020 campaign for president, Biden vowed to abolish the federal death penalty, but has only gone so far as to support the Justice Department’s pause on executions at the federal level.
Alabama officials had previously tried and failed to execute Smith by lethal injection in 2022. States that still use the death penalty have struggled to obtain lethal injection drugs, with lawmakers and prison officials adopting alternative methods as backup options. Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma have approved nitrogen hypoxia, while other states have brought back the long-disused firing squad.
Medical professionals and human rights advocates had argued for months that Alabama’s efforts to use an untested execution method on Smith amounted to human experimentation, claims that Smith’s lawyers took all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Despite the historic nature of Smith’s execution, only five independent witnesses from the news media, including the Associated Press, were able to observe the process. Smith’s family, as well as the family of his victim, Elizabeth Sennett, attended Thursday’s execution.
Smith was convicted in Sennett’s 1988 death in Colbert County, Ala. Sennett was found beaten and stabbed in her home, which was staged to look like a robbery had taken place. Investigators later found that Sennett’s husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, had hired a hit man to kill her so he could collect on her life insurance policy to cover debts.
John Forrest Parker and Smith were paid $1,000 each by a middleman on Sennett’s behalf to carry out the murder. Charles Sennett killed himself when police learned of his role in the plot, while Billy Gray Williams, the middleman, was sentenced to life in prison. Parker was executed in 2010.

H01JAAQ9C5_P6A55YO438840H5,U.S. stalls gas export projects that activists say are ‘climate bombs’,Maxine Joselow,"January 26, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/26/biden-lng-export-projects-climate/,"President Biden weighed in decisively in favor of climate activists fighting new fossil fuel development on Friday, deciding to pause the approval of new liquefied natural gas projects because of their danger to the planet, even in the face of criticism that the delay could hurt U.S. energy businesses.
The presidential directive, which requires the Energy Department to study the climate impact of new gas exports, could delay the approval of nearly a dozen fossil fuel projects past the November election. That could help Biden court young voters who consider such facilities to be “climate bombs” and who were angered by the administration’s approval of a massive drilling project in Alaska. But it risks antagonizing other interests, including foreign allies, fossil fuel companies and Republican lawmakers.
Many liquefied natural gas, or LNG, export facilities are in communities of color on the Gulf Coast and other parts of the country. Biden said in a statement that the climate review came in response to pleas from young activists and members of these communities.
“While MAGA Republicans willfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis, condemning the American people to a dangerous future, my Administration will not be complacent,” he said. “We will not cede to special interests. We will heed the calls of young people and front-line communities who are using their voices to demand action from those with the power to act.”
The decision represents the latest difficult choice Biden has faced over high-profile parts of his agenda. During early deliberations, it sparked a heated internal debate within the administration over national security concerns, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
Biden’s top climate aides, including White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi and clean energy senior adviser John Podesta, advocated for considering the climate consequences of gas exports, the two people said. But early on, top national security officials, including senior energy adviser Amos Hochstein and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, voiced concerns about curtailing gas exports to European allies in the event of another geopolitical conflict such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In the end, the national security officials were satisfied with the final decision, since the United States will continue to supply gas to Europe, even with the climate review, the people said.
“As our exports increase, we must review export applications using the most comprehensive, up-to-date analysis of the economic, environmental and national security considerations,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters during a Thursday call previewing the announcement, adding that her department could make exceptions due to national security emergencies.
Zaidi told reporters on the call that “the United States has been an unwavering partner to our allies in Europe, who, by the way … are our partner in calling for a transition away from fossil fuels.”
The New York Times first reported the administration’s decision, after Politico reported the White House was considering a climate review of LNG exports. Hochstein and a State Department spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
The United States is already a powerhouse in energy production, with its LNG exports playing a crucial role in helping Europe break free of its reliance on Russian gas. The question of approving additional gas exports has enormous environmental and political stakes: Allowing these facilities could lock in dependence on fossil fuels for decades to come, while pausing them could cede a future market to rivals and raise anxieties about global energy security.
Halting the expansion of LNG exports has become a top priority of environmentalists in recent months. Before news of the administration’s decision broke, several environmental groups had been planning a “Stop LNG” sit-in outside the Energy Department in early February.
The author and climate activist Bill McKibben, who had been preparing to attend the sit-in, this week declared victory. “It’s pretty clearly the win,” he wrote in a text message to The Washington Post.
The administration’s decision has cast uncertainty over a mammoth LNG project on the Louisiana coast known as Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2. The project is closer to becoming operational than nine other proposed LNG terminals, since it has already secured financing and customers and is awaiting federal permits.
Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the project’s owner, Venture Global, said in an email that “it appears the administration may be putting a moratorium on the entire U.S. LNG industry. Such an action would shock the global energy market, having the impact of an economic sanction, and send a devastating signal to our allies that they can no longer rely on the United States.”
Germany last year signed a deal to purchase about 2.21 million metric tons a year of LNG for 20 years from CP2. Stephan Gabriel Haufe, a spokesman for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, declined to comment on the Biden administration’s decision. But he said in an email that in general, “the German government has taken numerous measures to ensure security of supply, so we are currently not seeing any effects here.”
In a letter this week to the Biden administration, a coalition of fossil fuel industry groups blasted the decision as misguided. The groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of America, argued that limiting U.S. LNG exports would increase global emissions, since the gas could replace coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.
“One of the biggest things we can do for the environment is to send more U.S. LNG overseas to displace coal,” Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters at an event in Washington this month. The institute used the event to launch an eight-figure ad campaign promoting fossil fuels as “vital” to energy security.
Former president Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, said the decision would undermine America’s energy and national security. “Joe Biden has once again caved to the radical demands of the environmental extremists in his administration,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
Republicans on Capitol Hill also slammed the climate review. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday that “it is abundantly clear that our adversaries are not waiting for us to wake up from this experiment in green self-harm.” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a Friday statement that stalling LNG terminals “not only prevents America’s economic growth, it empowers our adversaries like [Russian President] Vladimir Putin.”
Yet some analysts said pausing permit approvals would have little immediate impact on the flow of U.S. LNG exports to European allies. They said the move would not impede the eight LNG export projects currently operating, nor would it halt the 10 projects already approved and under construction.
“This is an issue about not the coming wave of LNG but a potential future wave of LNG,” said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The United States now ranks as the world’s biggest LNG exporter after doubling its exports over the past four years. The projects already approved and under construction are expected to again double the potential volume of U.S. LNG exports by 2028. Almost all of these projects are along the Gulf Coast, mostly in an industrial region straddling Louisiana and Texas that is already home to hulking petrochemical plants.
Biden enraged young climate activists last year by approving the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska, even as the White House argued it was legally obligated to sanction it. But the greenhouse gas emissions associated with CP2 would be 20 times as large as those from Willow, according to an analysis by Jeremy Symons, an environmental consultant and former climate policy adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency.
“The Willow project was a carbon bomb, but the CP2 project is a megabomb when it comes to climate change,” Symons told The Post in an interview last year.
Some analysts said they view the administration’s decision as an olive branch to young voters, whom polls show prioritize climate action more than older generations.
“The president lost a lot of support after the Willow decision, especially among young folks,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and an energy adviser in the George W. Bush administration. “I think the environmental community has put pressure on these projects and said, ‘Here’s where you can claw back some credibility on climate.’”
Two federal agencies are responsible for approving permits for LNG projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must decide whether to authorize the siting and construction of projects, and the Energy Department must determine whether it’s in the “public interest” to export gas to countries with which the United States lacks a free-trade agreement.
The Energy Department has never determined that gas exports are not in the “public interest.” In response, environmental activists have pressured the department to overhaul its approach to better account for climate impacts.
Activists note that the main component of natural gas is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that traps more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide in the short term. They also warn that new LNG export terminals will be operational for decades, even as top climate scientists say humanity must rapidly phase out fossil fuels to avert catastrophic warming.
“Liquefied natural gas is an incredibly dirty fuel, and the scale of exports that the U.S. has built up over the last few years has enormous global climate implications,” said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice. “The fact that the president is taking it on is huge, and I think it is going to mobilize his climate base in an election year.”"
H9JUGAXG9I_50C2HW9FI0YY9TY,Are younger Americans shifting back to the right?,Philip Bump,"January 23, 2024 at 4:42 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/gen-z-republican-polling/,"It’s tricky to compare the scale of generational differences. Generations last a long time; social science is relatively young. What’s more, comparing things demands a shared scale. What scale or what measures are appropriate to use?
That bit of hedging completed, it’s safe to say that tensions between younger and older Americans are acute. Older Americans often (but not always) view younger Americans with some skepticism; younger Americans return the sentiment.
Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip Bump
You can see that reflected in a question posed by PRRI in its detailed consideration of how American opinions differ by generation — including by drilling down on the views of the country’s youngest adults, members of Gen Z.
At its most explicit, the divide looks like the data on the chart below. Asked whether they agreed with the idea that the country’s biggest problems could only be solved once older Americans (baby boomers in particular) had given up power, more than half of millennials and Gen Z said that was the case.
Asked if America would be worse off once younger generations took power, older generations were only slightly more likely to agree. (The dividing lines between generations are largely arbitrary but most people use the divides established by Pew Research Center. On the charts below, the generations are depicted from older to younger.)
Again, this is the top-line measure of generational tension. More important are the myriad ways in which the oldest and youngest Americans differ on a range of qualities. (This is a subject I explored at length in a book released last January.)
Consider race. The density of Black and AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) members of each generation are fairly steady. The percentage of White members drops as generations get younger; the percentage of Hispanic members increases. According to PRRI’s data, there is a 2-to-1 ratio between White and Hispanic teenage members of Gen Z. By contrast, the ratio among members of the (oldest) Silent Generation is 10 to 1.
This is largely a function of the loosening of immigration laws in the 1960s — after the Silent Generation was born but in time for the parents of members of Gen Z to come to the United States.
There are other understood differences, including some that were measured by PRRI. Young Americans are much more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ than older Americans, for example, and they are less likely to express a great deal of trust in major American institutions, like the police, the government or the news media.
This is true for another institution, too: political parties. Younger Americans are more likely to identify themselves as political independents and/or to not join political parties. In PRRI’s data, though, we can see another divide: even within Gen Z itself, younger (that is, teenage) members are more likely to identify as independents than older members of the generation.
Consider the position of the gray circles in the Gen Z section of this graph.
There are other important divides above. Non-White teens, for example, are much less likely to say they are Republicans than are adults in Gen Z. But White teens are much more likely to identify as Republicans.
When asked to identify their ideology, teenagers were most likely to call themselves “moderates.” That includes non-White teens. White teens were about as likely to call themselves conservative as they were to say they were moderates.
These are young people, obviously, not yet old enough to vote and — one might assume — less likely to spend time considering political choices at length.
But that’s not the only explanation for the difference between this group and older members of the generation. Consider the first question discussed above. Among teenage members of Gen Z, 45 percent of Republican respondents said that America would be worse once younger people held power — more than the older generations needed to get out of the way. Among Republican adults in Gen Z, more than half said that the country would be worse when younger people took over.
Overall, the PRRI data suggest that younger Americans are more moderate than older generations. Among Gen Z teens, “conservative” is a more common identifier than “liberal” while, among White teens, “Republican” is far more common than “Democrat.”
There are a variety of ways this might be interpreted, including that 17-year-old Americans have spent half their lives in a country where right-wing politics is defined by Donald Trump. It could (relatedly) be an example of racial insecurity from older White Americans trickling down to younger White ones. Or it could be an aberration.
Time will tell."
HBWDJ591AG_AQR5UC8PH6VAXW5,Alabama puts Kenneth Smith to death in first execution with nitrogen gas,Kim Bellware,"January 25, 2024 at 9:36 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/25/alabama-execution-nitrogen-gas-kenneth-smith/,"ATMORE, Ala. — Alabama carried out the world’s first known execution by nitrogen hypoxia Thursday. The unprecedented method was administered to Kenneth Eugene Smith, a prisoner on death row for his role in a contract killing more than three decades ago.
Smith’s execution was preceded by months of legal battles over whether it was constitutional to use nitrogen hypoxia in capital punishment, as the method was not known to have ever been used before in a prison setting. Alabama prison officials kept many of the details about how they would carry out the new method a secret from the public.
Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore.
Media witnesses arrived to the death chamber and saw Smith strapped to a gurney and fitted with a mask that covered his entire face.
“Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward,” Smith said in a lengthy final statement transcribed by media witnesses. “I’m leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.”
Using sign language, Smith said, “I love you,” directing the sign toward the window of the viewing room where his family sat.
Smith appeared conscious for at least two minutes while the gas flowed to his mask, according to media witnesses. He shook and writhed for at least two minutes on the gurney, and this was followed by two minutes of deep breaths and then a period of time during which media witnesses were unable to determine if he was breathing.
The curtain closed at 8:15 p.m., 10 minutes before the state pronounced him dead.
Speaking to reporters after the execution, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Q. Hamm called Smith’s shaking and writhing “involuntary” and said a 45-minute delay in the execution was due to “a hiccup on the EKG line” that was preventing a good reading.
Alabama officials had previously tried and failed to execute Smith by lethal injection in 2022. States that still use the death penalty have struggled to obtain lethal injection drugs, with lawmakers and prison officials adopting alternative methods as backup options. Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma have approved nitrogen hypoxia, while other states have brought back the long-disused firing squad.
Despite the historic nature of Smith’s execution, only five independent witnesses from the news media, including the Associated Press, were able to observe the process. Smith’s family, as well as the family of his victim, Elizabeth Sennett, attended Thursday’s execution.
Medical professionals and human rights advocates had argued for months that Alabama’s efforts to use an untested execution method on Smith amounted to human experimentation, claims Smith’s lawyers took all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Late Thursday, the nation’s top court rejected Smith’s final request for intervention. The court’s three liberal justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — noted their dissent in the court’s order, which did not explain the majority’s reasoning. Sotomayor called Alabama’s method “untested” and said “the world is watching.”
“Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before,” she wrote.
Kagan, joined by Jackson, wrote separately to say that she would have put the execution on hold to give Smith and his lawyers more information about the state’s new protocol to allow him to fully challenge the execution method.
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) had defended the state’s protocol, previously calling nitrogen hypoxia “the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.” The state argued that the district court heard from at least a hundred experts and was not convinced the method was likely to lead to an unacceptable level of pain before death.
Former Alabama governor Don Siegelman (D) had also called on Gov. Kay Ivey (R) to stop Smith’s execution. Siegelman was among those who noted that Smith would not have faced execution if he were tried under modern standards.
“So here we are in Alabama about to execute Kenneth Eugene Smith, who was sentenced to death — not by a jury, as required by the U.S. Constitution — but by a judge, a practice banned in Alabama,” Siegelman said in a statement.
A jury voted 11-1 in favor of life in prison at Smith’s second trial before a judge overrode its verdict and sentenced Smith to death. The practice, known as judicial override, has since been eliminated in all 50 states; Alabama was the last state to do so, in 2017.
Philip Nitschke, a leading figure in the controversial right-to-die movement, told The Washington Post that while nitrogen hypoxia is an effective method for willing euthanasia patients, Alabama’s execution protocol dramatically differs from legal assisted-suicide methods in Europe in both technique and spirit.
Nitschke said the right-to-die movement long ago moved away from using masks such as the one in Alabama, instead favoring methods such as hoods, specially designed bags and pods. Another key difference, he stressed, is that people are calm and cooperative in their assisted suicide, while a prisoner is anxiously awaiting an execution against his will.
In previous court filings, Smith’s attorneys said there was a real risk that Smith would vomit and choke to death during his execution. Marshall, Alabama’s attorney general, said that was unlikely, noting that Smith would have taken his last meal more than eight hours before the execution. Should Smith vomit, the state said, officials would remove and clean the mask and clear Smith’s airway before continuing.
The state last attempted to execute Smith in November 2022. Prison staffers failed to find a vein to set Smith’s IV line, which, coupled with last-minute appeals, made it untenable to complete the lethal injection before Smith’s execution warrant expired at midnight. Smith’s was the third botched lethal injection in a row, prompting Ivey to temporarily pause executions for review.
The Alabama Department of Corrections rejected calls for a third-party review and conducted a review of its execution process internally. A public report was not released following Alabama’s four-month review; Hamm instead sent a two-page letter to Ivey in February 2023 noting four changes to the procedures, including obtaining new equipment and hiring more medical staffers.
In two key changes to Alabama’s execution procedure, the Alabama Supreme Court in 2023 extended the typical 24-hour timeline for execution warrants to let the governor set the timeline and eliminated the process of automatically reviewing death penalty cases for “plain errors” during the trial phase.
Smith was convicted in Sennett’s 1988 death in Colbert County, Ala. Sennett was found beaten and stabbed in her home, which was staged to look like a robbery. Investigators later found that Sennett’s husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, had hired a hit man to kill her so he could collect on her life insurance policy to cover his debts.
John Forrest Parker and Smith were paid $1,000 each by a middleman on Sennett’s behalf to carry out the murder. Charles Sennett killed himself when police learned of his role in the plot, while Billy Gray Williams, the middleman, was sentenced to life in prison. Parker was executed in 2010."
HLKAGTRYX1_MXU2I6981YFT23V,"David Mills, the internet’s ‘father time,’ dies at 85",Gerrit De Vynck,"January 26, 2024 at 12:15 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/26/david-mills-network-time-protocol-internet-obituary/,"David L. Mills, a computer scientist who invented the system that allows connected computers to sync their clocks, a bedrock technology relied on by the entire modern internet, died Jan. 17 at his home in Newark, Del. He was 85.
His daughter, Eileen “Leigh” Schnitzler, confirmed the death but did not provide a specific cause.
Dr. Mills spent more than three decades as a professor at the University of Delaware and was active in designing key parts of the early internet in the late 1970s and 1980s. He was a lifelong contributor to open-source software, building tools that went on to be used and modified by engineers and tech companies to this day.
His dominant contribution was teaching computers how to tell the time.
In the 1970s, researchers were building out the Arpanet, an early, government-sponsored version of the web that connected various nodes at universities around the country. As the net grew and more machines were connected to it, the lack of a system to make sure they all had the same concept of time was beginning to cause problems.
Because there was an unpredictable time lag whenever one machine communicated with another, simply timestamping bits of code that went between computers was not good enough to keep things in order. It was a problem that had to be solved if the internet was going to be used for financial transactions, real-time communication and a million other potential applications.
As a researcher at Comsat, the company founded by the government to develop satellite communication networks, Dr. Mills had the chance to work on Arpanet, which had been built by the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. Dr. Mills began working on ways to sync computer time, partly because no one else was doing it, allowing him to do the project on his own terms, he told the New Yorker in 2022. In the late 1970s he invented the Network Time Protocol, known forevermore to programmers as NTP.
Part of Dr. Mills’s insight was to build a system that ranked various computers in a network by how reliable their concept of time is. Computers connected directly to an atomic clock are deemed the most reliable, and other machines in the network rapidly communicate with each other to determine a consensus on what time it is, through a mix of complicated math and clever programming.
“I remember being totally astonished,” Vint Cerf, a computer scientist who helped lead the development of the early internet and a close collaborator with Dr. Mills, said in an interview. “It was black magic.""
David Lennox Mills was born in Oakland, Calif., on June 3, 1938. His father was an engineer, founding a company that built oil seals for car engines, according to the New Yorker.
The younger Mills was born with glaucoma, had poor eyesight for much of his adult life and went blind in the years before his death. Cerf remembered Dr. Mills using a telescope to look at whiteboards. “He was not shy about the fact that he had a vision impairment,” Cerf said. “A very down-to-earth, cards-on-the-table kind of guy.”
Dr. Mills received five degrees from the University of Michigan, culminating in a doctorate in computer and communication science in 1971. He then taught computer science at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and at the University of Maryland before joining Comsat in 1977.
In addition to his daughter, of Lebanon, Pa., survivors include his wife of 59 years, the former Beverly Csizmadia, of Newark; a son, Keith Mills of Jackson, Miss.; and a brother.
Beyond Network Time Protocol, Dr. Mills contributed to key parts of the original internet structure. His “fuzzball” software was used to run the first internet routers. The name was a Mills invention, too, because he saw them as helpful little critters, Cerf said.
It was just one example of what computer scientists came to call “Millsspeak.” Trustworthy clocks were called “truechimers,” while unreliable ones were “falsetickers.” A computer that overwhelmed an NTP hub with too many requests was quieted with a “kiss-o’-death packet.”
“It is an open secret among my correspondents that I on occasion do twitch the English language in mail messages and published works,” Dr. Mills wrote on his personal website. “If you read my papers or my mail, you know my resonances. If not, you can calibrate my naughtimeter from children’s books, outhouse walls and old English slang.”
He taught at the University of Delaware from 1986 to 2008 and continued to update the NTP code for decades, even as the internet became a central piece of human civilization. Every day, millions of computers synchronize their clocks seamlessly billions of times, constantly communicating to enable financial trades, Zoom meetings and power grid surges.
The system can sync clocks down to microseconds, or a millionth of a second, Julian Onions, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham, said in a 2022 YouTube video explaining NTP.
Other contributors beyond Dr. Mills eventually took over more responsibility for upgrading the NTP system. In addition, Big Tech companies such as Google and Amazon have made their own updates to NTP that have become standard because of those companies’ power over the internet.
“It’s still one of the fundamental protocols of the internet,” Cerf said, and a piece of technology that cemented Dr. Mills’s position as an internet pioneer. “He was part of that pantheon."""
HSWANJR26W_VADTNZDKL5F3IW1,The first full moon of the year graces skies Thursday night,Kasha Patel,"January 24, 2024 at 12:42 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/24/january-full-wolf-moon/,"The first full moon of 2024 will brighten the skies on Thursday night — and the wolves may be howling.
The moon, known as the wolf moon, will hit peak illumination during the day, but the moon will be below the horizon. Sky watchers will have to wait until the evening to see it — when the sun goes down and the moon rises. Moonrise is expected around 5:14 p.m. Eastern in D.C., although the exact time will vary in different cities.
The moon will appear full starting Wednesday night and through Friday.
Full moons occur when the Earth is between the sun and the moon. The moon appears full because the whole side facing Earth is illuminated by the sun.
On Thursday night, the full moon will kick off the longest moon phase of the year. The moon will take 8 days, 5 hours and 24 minutes to transition from a full moon to the third quarter on Feb. 2, according to timeanddate.com. Typically, the moon takes about 7.4 days to transition from one phase to another.
The longer phase is due to the moon’s elliptical orbit around Earth, which means the moon is always traveling at slightly different distances from Earth and slightly different speeds (traveling slower when it is farther away). The shortest moon phase this year will occur in August, when the moon will swap from full to third quarter in 6 days and 15 hours.
January’s full moon is commonly referred to as the wolf moon, probably derived from the idea that wolves tend to howl more in the winter. Howling is four times more common in February than in May, according to the National Park Service. Wolves aren’t howling at the moon but are communicating with comrades. They typically breed from January to March in the northern United States, but are quieter in the spring so they don’t attract predators while they raise their pups.
The moon is also known as the ice moon, the moon after Yule and the old moon. The next full moon will be on Feb. 24, called the snow moon because of the month’s typically cold and snowy weather.
On Thursday night, Jupiter and Saturn may appear in the sky as well just after sunset. Saturn will appear low in the southwest from New York, but Jupiter will appear brighter almost due south, according to Space.com.
The moon will have a bigger special moment on April 8, when it blocks out the sun’s disk to create a total solar eclipse. Total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth about every 18 months or so, but the next total solar eclipses in the United States won’t occur until 2044 and 2045."
HUAYR7DAEI_I8XDPHL79FGRVEH,‘She didn’t win’: Trump angered by Haley’s boasts about N.H.,Ashley Parker,"January 24, 2024 at 5:50 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/she-didnt-win-trump-angered-by-haleys-boasts-about-nh/,"NASHUA, N.H. — Donald Trump seemed truly befuddled.
Addressing the crowd at his Tuesday night primary victory party in Nashua, N.H., the former president expressed genuine disbelief that former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley had finished the night in second place — yet she had taken to a stage before him for what he viewed as, essentially, a victory lap. While she briefly acknowledged his win, Haley went on to boast about what she depicted as a strong finish.
“I said, ‘Wow, she’s doing like a speech, like she won,’” Trump marveled. “She didn’t win. She lost.”
Later, an exasperated Trump continued: “Who the hell was the impostor that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory? She did very poorly, actually.”
It was as if game (Trump) thought he recognized game (Haley) — and that made game (Trump) a little bit grumpy.
Trump, after all, is the king of portraying a loss as a victory, though in his case dangerously so. He has a long history of claiming that any election he doesn’t win is RIGGED or STOLEN, and still refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to President Biden.
“Frankly, we did win this election,” he declared on election night 2020, as the polls tilted away from him and toward Biden.
Trump’s denialism helped spur his supporters to mount the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and the former president now faces 91 charges across four criminal cases — two of which are directly related to his refusal to accept the results of the free and fair 2020 election.
“It’s forever been true that Donald Trump thinks there are two kinds of elections — the ones that he wins and the ones that are stolen,” said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama.
But that didn’t stop Trump on Tuesday night from growing piqued that Haley had touted her election loss as a kind of triumph — relatively standard political spin in which a defeated candidate emphasizes the cloud’s silver lining.
Haley finished with about 43 percent of the vote compared to Trump’s roughly 54 percent in New Hampshire — an outcome closer than many of the polls were predicting in the final days before the state’s primary, but still a sizable loss.
In fact, Haley did briefly address Trump’s New Hampshire win Tuesday night, saying she wanted to congratulate him on his victory: “He earned it, and I want to acknowledge that,” she said.
But then Haley struck a more ebullient tone.
“Today, we got close to half of the vote,” Haley told the crowd at her primary party in Concord, after reminding her supporters: “I’m a fighter and I’m scrappy and now we’re the last ones standing next to Donald Trump.”
Speaking to his supporters, Trump proclaimed, “This is not your typical victory speech — but let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night.”
Conservative writer Jonah Goldberg posted on X, “Funny irony listening to Trump complain about a competitor acting like she won when she lost. You know who else did something like that?”
Trump also engaged in some dark rhetoric that felt discordant on a night that was, for him, an actual victory — the second of two, following a first-place finish in the Iowa caucuses eight days earlier.
Trump mocked Haley’s “fancy dress that probably wasn’t so fancy” — referring to the garment with a deep, almost midnight, violet shade, embroidered with large flowers. He also warned, with no evidence or specifics, of multiple investigations that he claimed would dog a Haley candidacy.
“And just a little note to Nikki,” Trump said. “She’s not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes. And I could tell you five reasons why already — not big reasons, a little stuff that she doesn’t want to talk about — but she will be under investigation within minutes.”
He also struck another nasty note while turning to Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who had recently endorsed him over Haley, despite owing his Senate seat to her appointing him to the role in 2012.
“You must really hate her,” Trump sneered.
Scott responded with a laugh: “I just love you!”
Trump has long deployed a form of “I’m rubber, you’re glue” projection, accusing rivals and perceived enemies of the very things of which he is guilty — wielding shamelessness as a superpower.
Late last year, for instance, amid growing concern that Trump was echoing authoritarians and dictators, he unveiled a new line of attack against Biden. It was Biden, the former president argued, who was the real fascist tyrant working to upend the nation’s fragile institutions.
On Tuesday, Trump also touted what he called his “winnability,” and extended his anti-Haley gripes back to the Iowa caucuses. He complained that then, too, Haley had lost — she finished third, just slightly behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dropped out several days later — but delivered the enthusiastic speech of a winner.
“I remember I sort of had the same feeling,” Trump recalled. “I’m up and I’m watching and I said, ‘She’s taking a victory lap.’ And we beat her so badly. But Ron beat her also.”
Trump noted that Haley “came in third and she’s still hanging around.”
And if there was still any doubt as to how Trump felt about Haley’s determination to spin two losses into a fiery momentum she hopes will carry her into the South Carolina primary next month and the Super Tuesday contests on March 5, Trump threaded his feelings into several dozen increasingly frenetic messages on his personal social media site, Truth Social.
“Could somebody please explain to Nikki Haley that she lost — and lost really badly,” he wrote just before 1 a.m. Wednesday morning. “She also lost Iowa, BIG, last week. They were, as certain Non-Fake Media says, ‘CRUSHING DEFEATS.’”
Trump and Biden won their respective New Hampshire primary elections. Here are the results, biggest takeaways and what exit polls showed.

Who is running? The top contenders for the GOP 2024 nomination are former president Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was dropping out just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. For the Democrats, President Biden is running for reelection in 2024.

HVSKQMI4N7_L1XIJEAJGKXQMZ6,Ukraine tells families: Russia has not given evidence of POWs on downed plane,Isabelle Khurshudyan,"January 26, 2024 at 9:24 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/ukraine-says-russia-has-not-given-evidence-pows-downed-military-plane/,"KYIV — Russia has not provided evidence that Ukrainian prisoners of war were aboard a military plane that was downed Wednesday, Ukrainian officials told relatives of captured soldiers Friday, as the warring countries continued to trade blame over the murky incident.
Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, met Friday with relatives of the prisoners of war who were allegedly being transported on the Ilyushin Il-76 transport plane, which crashed Wednesday in Russia’s Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine.
Russia claims that the plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs who were set to be exchanged that day.
Budanov told the POW families that Russia asked for the prisoners’ relatives to submit DNA to match to the bodies of detainees allegedly killed onboard, while not providing any evidence of their remains, according to two people present at the meeting.
Ukraine has rejected that request, Budanov said, according to the two relatives who attended the meeting and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.
“The puzzle doesn’t fit,” Budanov told the families, according to one of the relatives — the mother of one POW. She added that the exchange was supposed to involve more than 190 prisoners, matching a statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Russian Defense Ministry has said that just 65 detainees were on the plane.
Putin, in his first comments about the incident, said Friday that Ukraine shot down the plane with its own military personnel on board and that Russia would make the results of its investigation public “so that people in Ukraine know what happened.”
“I don’t know if it was on purpose or by mistake, but it is obvious that they did it,” Putin said, adding without evidence that the Ukrainians probably used an American or European air-defense system. Western countries generally have prohibited Kyiv from using their weapons to strike targets on Russian territory.
This man wants to run against Putin. Thousands of Russians are helping him.
“We were transporting their citizens, their military personnel, but no, they struck there,” Putin said. “Our only regrets are with regards to our pilots.”
But more than 48 hours after the plane fell from the sky and charred a large swath of earth, Russia has provided scant evidence of its claims. Ukrainian officials said that despite the Kremlin’s rhetoric, Moscow is blocking an international investigation.
Russian political and military officials, while quick to blame Ukraine, have not explained how their military jet was left vulnerable to being destroyed in midair, a highly unusual occurrence in a war in which each side has sophisticated antiaircraft weapons. Ukraine has targeted Russian planes, but usually while they are on the ground.
Ukrainian officials maintain that they have not seen proof that dozens of people died aboard the aircraft. The few short video clips released from the scene have shown scattered debris but few visible body parts.
A new clip released by Russian state media Friday purported to show the passports of some Ukrainians allegedly on board, but they were not shown at the crash site, and parts of the video were blurred. In another part of the clip, a Russian official is seen zipping up a black body bag.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, told Ukrainian media Thursday that just five bodies had been brought to the local morgue in Belgorod. The claim could not be independently verified. Russia has said that in addition to the POWs, there were six crew members and three other people aboard.
Ukraine has not directly confirmed that it shot down the plane, but it has not denied involvement and has hinted that it was responsible, calling the aircraft a military target that was regularly used to ferry missiles to be launched at Ukrainian cities.
Officials in Kyiv have insisted they do not know whether POWs were on the plane. Instead, they have called for Russia to provide more information to Kyiv and to international organizations and investigators.
But it is unclear how, when or if Moscow will cooperate.
Russia has resisted international investigations in the past, including into the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a banned nerve agent and the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over eastern Ukraine in which all 298 people aboard were killed.
In the case of that plane, investigators determined that a Russian antiaircraft weapon was used, and two former Russian security agents and a third defendant were convicted in absentia of murder by a Dutch court. One of those convicted, Igor Girkin, remained free in Russia until last year, when he was arrested and charged with inciting extremism for criticizing the Russian military’s battlefield performance in Ukraine. On Thursday, he was sentenced to four years.
Kharkiv’s air defense struggles to halt nonstop Russian missiles
Russia’s refusal to allow an international inquiry or provide access to physical evidence could prevent a definitive answer as to who or what was on the Il-76 that went down Wednesday.
At the meeting with Budanov, “most people are sure that [the Russian version of events] is fake news,” the mother of the POW said.
“I think I expected more hysterical, panicked reactions,” the woman said. “Intelligence spoke very openly with us. Budanov started the conversation with, ‘Let’s get to the point, let’s start with questions,’ and that was it.”
“I was hysterical during the first day,” she added. “But now I’ve calmed down.”
The woman said that after one young woman asked when the families could get the body parts of their loved ones returned, a second military intelligence official responded, “Wait, we hope for the best, and now we’re not speaking about the worst-case scenario.”
Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights, said on Ukrainian radio Friday that Kyiv had not received an official list of prisoners who allegedly died on board the plane.
Margarita Simonyan, head of the Russian state propaganda channel RT, published a list of names and birth dates that she said documented the Ukrainian POWs on board, but news outlets quickly reported that some of those named by Simonyan appeared to be prisoners released in previous swaps.
The wife of one of the prisoners listed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons, said she did not believe that her husband died in the crash. Simonyan’s list was the first time she had heard any news of her husband since he was taken prisoner more than a year ago.
“I don’t believe they were there,” the woman said. “I hope for the best.”
Ukraine alleges Russian disinformation in downing of military plane
In a statement Thursday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that it had not received a list of the prisoners who were set to be exchanged.
“We understand the stress and worry that this kind of news can bring to families that have been separated from their loved ones for months,” the statement said. “We will continue doing our utmost to help clarify the fate of POWs separated from their families from both sides and other missing persons.”
Yusov, the Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman, called on Russia to allow an international commission to investigate the site of the crash and examine the black boxes recovered from the plane, but he added that Moscow has so far refused to do so. Ukraine has requested that the Red Cross and the United Nations be granted access.
It could take months to get answers. A July 2022 explosion at a camp for Ukrainian prisoners of war in occupied eastern Ukraine killed at least 51 detainees and prompted a months-long effort by Ukraine and international groups to investigate.
Russia accused Ukraine of striking that site with a U.S.-provided rocket, but a United Nations report — released more than a year after the explosion — ruled that out. Ukraine’s government repeatedly criticized the Red Cross for not sending a delegation to investigate the scene.
An emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, convened at Moscow’s request, yielded no new information about the plane’s destruction or who was on board. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov complained Friday that the global reaction was inadequate.
“There is no strong condemnation here from the West of this horrific terrorist act, the destruction of the airplane that was carrying, first of all our pilots, escorts, but also killed a very large number of Ukrainian prisoners of war,” Peskov said. “What happened requires proper assessment by the international community.”

IARTGU91BK_NRK3WEO6WJVT2VU,"Harris, Biden deliver fiery message on abortion rights",Cleve R. Wootson Jr.,"January 22, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/01/22/biden-abortion-contraception/,"BIG BEND, Wis. — Vice President Harris framed the fight for abortion access in searing terms in this battleground state Monday afternoon, highlighting what she called “the horrific reality that women are facing every single day” since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade 18 months ago.
Harris left little doubt that her remarks were aimed in large part at former president Donald Trump. “As we face this crisis and as we are clear-eyed about the harm, let us also understand who is responsible, shall we?” she said. “The former president handpicked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. He intended for them to take away your freedoms. And it is a decision he brags about.”
Harris’s remarks on the 51st anniversary of the decision in Roe, the Supreme Court case granting a constitutional right to an abortion, came as the Biden administration is trying to mobilize the Democratic base around the fight for reproductive freedom. Her appearance was part of a full-court press on abortion rights being unleashed by the Biden team this week, as the administration announced new steps Monday intended to ensure access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortions at hospitals.
President Biden, Harris and their spouses will attend a joint campaign rally on Tuesday focused on abortion access. Biden on Monday convened two dozen senior officials in the White House for a meeting of his reproductive health task force, where he was joined by several physicians who have practiced in states with abortion bans. The Biden campaign also posted an online ad Monday that alternates clips of Trump boasting of his role in overturning Roe with testimonials from women whose complicated pregnancies were made more traumatic due to state restrictions on abortion.
Supreme Court to decide if law requires some emergency abortions
Biden used brief remarks at the beginning of the White House meeting to blast what he called, “outrageous” policies that punish doctors and pregnant women for abortions. He called out Republican state legislators for enacting abortion restrictions on the state level and rebuked GOP members of Congress for putting forward abortion restrictions that would apply nationwide.
“Even if you live in a state where the extremist Republicans are not running the show, your right to choose, your right to privacy would still be at risk” under federal abortion laws proposed by the GOP, he said. “Folks, this is what it looks like when the right to privacy is under attack.”
In addition to doctors affected by state restrictions on abortion, the meeting featured a wide range of high-ranking officials across Biden’s Cabinet and government, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
While Trump has not called for a nationwide abortion ban, and has shied away from the more forceful rhetoric on abortion embraced by some Republican leaders, he has been quick to take credit for the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe, since it came only after he cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court by appointing three justices to the nine-member bench.
“For 54 years, they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it,” he said at a Fox News town hall this month. “I’m proud to have done it.”
The onslaught by the Biden team is notable in part because the president personally has shown discomfort when it comes to offering a full-throated embrace of abortion rights, an area where his private faith as a Catholic may be at odds with Democrats’ public position.
Abortion has long been complicated for Biden
As the general election campaign draws nearer, it is not yet clear whether Biden will begin speaking more forcefully and frequently about the issue, or if he will leave much of the argument to surrogates and supporters. Biden only briefly mentioned the word “abortion” during his remarks Monday, making sure to stipulate that he was not pushing for “abortion on demand,” but for codifying the protections  in Roe v. Wade.
On Monday, Harris was, in many ways, leading the charge. She warned that the Supreme Court’s decision — and efforts across the country to further restrict access to abortions — was part of a more sweeping erosion of rights pushed by Republicans.
“In America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right,” she told a cheering crowd gathered at a union building in a suburb of Milwaukee. “And that includes the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body — not the government telling you what to do.”
Advocates collect enough signatures to put abortion rights on Florida ballot
Harris singled out a proposal by Wisconsin’s Republicans to ban abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy. Wisconsin’s Democratic governor has already said he will veto the bill. But Harris said the effort was a pattern to further restrict the rights of women — including in Madison, Wisconsin’s capital, an hour’s drive from where she spoke.
“Extremists aren’t done,” she said. “This afternoon in the Wisconsin legislature, extremists will hold a hearing on a bill that bans abortion with no exception for rape or incest. And in Congress they are trying to pass a national abortion ban.”
Biden, in contrast, was trying to shore up access to abortion, she said.
Eighteen months after the Supreme Court overruled Roe, Democrats see the issue as central to Biden’s reelection effort. Since the decision in Dobbs decreed that abortion rights should be left to the states, Democrats have won a string of electoral victories, fueling the party’s hopes that the abortion issue will propel Biden to reelection despite his low approval ratings.
Central to that endeavor is aiming Democrats’ animus at the politicians they warned will further restrict rights, with Trump at the top of the list.
As part of its push for reproductive rights, the Biden administration Monday announced several policy moves intended to expand access to contraception.
Federal agencies are issuing guidance that would make no-cost contraceptives more available under the Affordable Care Act and take similar actions to expand contraception access for federal employees. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra also sent a letter to health insurers instructing them of their obligation to provide no-cost contraceptives.
The federal health department also announced a new team dedicated to enforcing its interpretation of a law, known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, which the Biden administration has said requires hospitals to provide emergency abortions nationwide, including in the 21 states where the procedure is limited or banned.
“Where abortion has been on the ballot, the American people have overwhelmingly voted to protect reproductive freedom,” Jennifer Klein, director of the White House’s Gender Policy Council, told reporters last week, citing states such as Kansas and Ohio, where voters last year sided with measures protecting abortion rights.
The moves highlight Biden’s effort to shore up support among key allies, who have called for the White House to take stronger action to boost abortion access. Abortion rights advocates have been frustrated with the administration’s implementation of the emergency-care law, citing a case in which federal officials did not penalize an Oklahoma hospital that denied an emergency abortion to a woman with a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication.
Biden officials have insisted that the president is the nation’s strongest defender of abortion rights, contrasting his efforts with Republicans who are attempting to replace him. And 58 percent of all voters, including about 1 in 5 Republicans, said they trust Democrats more than Republicans on abortion, according to a November poll conducted by KFF, a health policy organization.
Trump’s staunch supporters in the antiabortion movement have begun to envision how he would carry out their agenda, such as enacting new restrictions on abortion pills. However, Trump has said that Republicans should consider moderating their focus on abortion bans. “You have to win elections,” he said at the town hall.
Biden officials have said they are continuing to work with Congress to enact legislation that would provide a national right to abortion. But it would probably be difficult to get the 60 Senate votes needed to guarantee abortion rights across the country — or conversely, as many conservatives want, to ban abortions altogether.
“As we’ve been really clear, the president, the vice president, everyone in the administration, the number one priority for all of us is working to pass a federal law that will restore the protections that were lost when Roe was overturned,” Klein told reporters last week.
Little evidence exists of common ground on Capitol Hill. House and Senate Republicans have made repeated efforts to target abortion access, including introducing legislation last week that would implement a 50 percent tax credit for donations made to crisis pregnancy centers, which aim to dissuade women from having abortions.
“Despite what the radical pro-abortion left wants us to believe, the pro-life movement is also a pro-woman movement with a long history of empowering women during pregnancy and after,” Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), who co-wrote the legislation, said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Senate Democrats last week held an event where they vowed to continue combating Republicans’ antiabortion legislation.
“This isn’t a PR problem for women — it is a living hell and a personal nightmare,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said.
Tracking abortion access in the United States: Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal, banned or under threat.
Abortion pills: The Supreme Court will decide this term whether to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Oral arguments are likely to be scheduled for the spring, with a decision by the end of June. For now, full access to mifepristone will remain in place.
Battles over access: Abortion access remains divisive politically and legally. In December, a pregnant woman in Texas lost her legal battle for permission to end her pregnancy. A Kentucky woman went to court asserting the state’s abortion restrictions violate her constitutional right to privacy.
Post-Roe America: With Roe overturned, women who had secret abortions before Roe v. Wade felt compelled to speak out. Other women who were seeking abortions while living in states with strict abortion bans also shared their experiences with The Post through calls, text messages and other documentation. Here are photos and stories from across America since the reversal of Roe v. Wade."
IBLI672MJZ_SD9RYKUQDLR93X0,Opinion Israel and Hamas probe for a pause that both sides need,David Ignatius,"January 23, 2024 at 7:00 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/23/israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal-gaza-war-hostages/,"Israel and Hamas are groping toward a resumption of negotiations to trade Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, accompanied by an extended pause in fighting, as well as a sharp increase in aid for desperate civilians in Gaza.
These deadlocked issues are the blood knot in this war. For a traumatized Israel, release of the hostages is a paramount aim. For a Palestinian population on the edge of famine and pandemic disease, a new cease-fire is an existential requirement. For Hamas leaders trapped underground, the deal offers the possibility of political survival.
There isn’t yet a breakthrough. But recent progress in framing issues is the first opening since December in an impasse that has turned Gaza into a nightmare of death and disease. If the indirect negotiations resume — with mediation from Qatar and Egypt aided by the United States — it could open a path toward a major de-escalation of the war.
The move to resume negotiations was outlined this week by knowledgeable Israeli and U.S. sources, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issues. Like every other aspect of the Gaza conflict, the bargaining is bounded by deep mistrust and internal political divisions. But officials who were bleak about progress a week ago are more hopeful now.
The main obstacle to resuming the indirect talks is Hamas’s demand for a long-term cease-fire. Israel refuses to grant that, but its negotiators are ready to accept a pause that would last weeks and could perhaps be extended as conditions evolve. Israel is pressing Egyptian and Qatari mediators to persuade Hamas to accept the negotiating framework, so bargaining over the details of swapping hostages and prisoners can begin.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thunderously rejected Hamas’s demand for a permanent cease-fire on Sunday. “I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” Netanyahu said. But he faces growing domestic pressure to free the estimated 136 hostages who remain in Hamas control, so he badly needs a release plan.
Negotiators envision several stages in the hostage-release process. First, Hamas would free about 10 women and children who were supposed to be released under a previous agreement that collapsed last month. In a second “humanitarian” phase, Hamas would free about 40 sick, injured and elderly hostages along with female Israeli soldiers. In the remaining group of roughly 86, Hamas would hand over male hostages, including soldiers, and finally the bodies of those who died during the Oct. 7 attack or in subsequent months of captivity.
Each departure of Israeli hostages from Gaza would be accompanied by release of Palestinian prisoners. Sources say the ratio would probably be more than three Palestinians for every Israeli. Among the hundreds of Palestinians to be freed would be some whom Israelis view as terrorists and killers, which would make this a bitter bargain.
The final swap lists wouldn’t be agreed on until shortly before release, but one Palestinian detainee who might be freed is Marwan Barghouti, who led the first and second intifadas. Barghouti is probably the most popular political leader in the West Bank and Gaza and potentially could unite Palestinians in a push toward statehood.
The renewed swap agreement would be accompanied by a lengthy cease-fire. This would allow humanitarian assistance that’s desperately needed in Gaza but blocked by continuing violence and Israeli intransigence. For example, a U.N. team that was supposed to enter northern Gaza 10 days ago to assess water, housing, food and sanitation needs has been blocked by continued skirmishing between Israeli forces and remnants of Hamas.
Such a pause in fighting could open new routes for aid, including ships unloaded at floating docks offshore. Doctors and medicines are urgently needed as infectious disease spreads in the crowded, dirty camps into which Palestinian refugees have been driven. Gazans are experiencing “unspeakable suffering,” wrote Leonard Rubenstein and J. Stephen Morrison, two prominent public health specialists, in a recent report published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
If negotiators can address the two most anguishing issues — Israel’s Oct. 7 hostages and the suffering of Palestinian civilians — that might open the way to progress on other problems that now seem irreconcilable. Netanyahu insists he won’t allow a Palestinian state with full sovereignty, seemingly blocking the outcome the United States favors and Saudi Arabia demands. But diplomacy is about bridging such gaps.
State Department officials are exploring sovereignty models that might satisfy both sides, such as the “compacts of free association” that allowed statehood for Pacific island nations such as Micronesia and Palau, with restrictions on defense and other sensitive issues. U.S. officials stress to their Israeli counterparts that the best guarantee for long-term security is a regional structure of cooperation that unites Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states against Iran and its proxies — but the Arabs demand that, as part of the deal, Israel accept a Palestinian state.
Israel needs this cease-fire and prisoner swap as badly as Hamas does. The endgame of the tunnel war could go on for many months. But aboveground, Gaza is becoming a version of warlord-dominated Somalia. Israel and Hamas need to start moving toward de-escalation of this conflict now, while they still have a chance."
IBOD15UVHC_B95P73VFOSRCDMH,Turkey votes in favor of Sweden’s NATO membership after months of delay,Kareem Fahim,"January 23, 2024 at 3:06 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/turkey-sweden-nato-vote-parliament/,"ISTANBUL — After 20 months of demands, obstruction and delay, the Turkish parliament voted Tuesday night in favor of Sweden joining NATO, clearing one of the final hurdles for a major expansion of the military alliance set in motion by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan still needs to sign the ratification document.
Assuming he does, Hungary would be the last remaining holdout. Officials there have previously signaled that they would not, ultimately, stand in the way. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced, somewhat cryptically, that he had invited the Swedish prime minister to visit to “negotiate on Sweden’s NATO accession.”
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson appeared to respond only to the Turkish vote, writing on X, formerly Twitter, “Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO.”
The vote was 287 in favor and 55 against, with four abstentions.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the outcome, saying, “I also count on Hungary to complete its national ratification as soon as possible.” He added, referring to the Lithuanian capital, “All NATO allies agreed in Vilnius to invite Sweden to join our alliance, and Sweden has fulfilled its commitments.”
If both Turkey and Hungary get on board, the alliance could formally welcome its 32nd member, potentially sealing the deal before its 75th anniversary in the spring.
Four maps explain how Sweden and Finland could alter NATO’s security
Sweden joining NATO would mark a historic shift for a country that long maintained a policy of military nonalignment. It would bolster NATO’s air and sea capabilities, improving the alliance’s position in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic.
In thanking the Turkish parliament for its vote, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey, Jeff Flake, wrote, “Sweden’s accession to NATO is a critical step in strengthening the Alliance, which is today more important than ever.”
It would also eliminate one source of Western disunity of the sort relished by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

After Putin sent tanks into Ukraine and shook Europeans’ sense of security, the ruling parties in Sweden and neighboring Finland endorsed becoming part of NATO, concluding they would be safer inside the alliance, even if their joining further angered Russia.
Ruling parties in Sweden, Finland back NATO membership in historic shifts
The two Nordic nations submitted coordinated bids. But each of NATO’s 30 member countries at the time had to approve, and Erdogan quickly emerged as the main obstacle, using the process to secure concessions and score domestic political points.
Even after allowing Finland to join, Erdogan continued to object to Sweden, demanding that the country do more to crack down on groups Turkey regards as terrorist entities, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and a movement accused of trying to overthrow the Turkish government in 2016. Erdogan got Stockholm to agree to continue counterterrorism cooperation, as well as lift an arms embargo on Turkey.
But analysts assessed that Turkey’s main goal was to secure a deal to buy F-16 fighter jets from the United States, as well as upgrades for its current fleet. In July, after Erdogan publicly dropped his opposition to Sweden’s NATO membership, the Biden administration said it intended to move ahead with the transfer of F-16s to Turkey.
The deal has faced resistance from senior members of Congress — though one of the staunchest opponents, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), is no longer chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His replacement, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), has not expressed a position on the sale. While some senior lawmakers have said the Sweden vote would clear the way for the F-16s, others have insisted that there are broader problems with Turkey, including human rights violations and ongoing Turkish attacks on Kurdish U.S. allies in Syria.
“For much of the time President Erdogan has been in office, Turkey has been an unfaithful NATO ally — so this is welcome news,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said in a statement to The Washington Post. “That said, I still have questions about Erdogan’s ongoing attacks against our Syrian Kurdish allies, his aggressive actions in the Eastern Mediterranean and the role he played in supporting Azerbaijan’s military assaults against Nagorno-Karabakh. We need more answers and assurances about these concerns from both Turkey and the Biden administration before Congress moves forward with the sale of F-16s.”
President Biden had a call with Erdogan on Dec. 14 in which they discussed Sweden’s bid and “further enhancing Türkiye’s NATO interoperability,” among other topics, according to a White House summary.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken also discussed Sweden’s NATO membership in a meeting with Erdogan this month.
To move forward on the F-16s, the administration would need to submit formal notification to Congress, after which lawmakers would have 30 days to raise objections. Or the administration could bypass the process by declaring an “emergency” requiring immediate shipment, as it has done twice recently for Israel.
An Arctic ‘Great Game’ as NATO allies and Russia face off in far north
Hungary, too, may be trying to extract concessions. Like Erdogan, Orban maintains ties to Putin. The Hungarian leader regularly acts as a spoiler of multinational agreements that work against Moscow’s interests, including European Union sanctions on Russia and aid to Ukraine.
Orban says he takes issue with Swedish criticism that democracy in Hungary has eroded under his rule. But he said the same about Finland and then quickly dropped his opposition to that country’s entry into NATO when Turkey did.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has remade the security landscape in Europe, spurring increased defense spending from countries that had been steadily cutting their militaries since the end of the Cold War and reinvigorating NATO after years of questions over the alliance’s relevance.
Sweden had not previously indicated an interest in becoming a full NATO member. It had adopted a posture of neutrality and nonalignment in the early 19th century and officially stayed on the sidelines during major conflicts, including the world wars.
But while that stance remained central to the country’s self-concept, Sweden gradually strengthened its ties to NATO. It joined the alliance’s Partnership for Peace in 1994, became an “Enhanced Opportunities Partner” in 2014 — after Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula — and signed a host nation agreement in 2016. Sweden has contributed to NATO-led missions in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq. As an E.U. member since 1995, it is also bound by a mutual defense clause, obligating help if any E.U. member is attacked.
De Vynck and Rauhala reported from Brussels, and DeYoung reported from Washington.
The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.
The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.

ICLWTFRFF3_LW2MLH3O5XT1OCV,"Homicides fell in many big U.S. cities in 2023, report says",Mark Berman,"January 25, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/25/homicides-fell-many-big-us-cities-2023-report-says/,"Homicides declined last year in nearly two dozen U.S. cities, though many communities still continued to face higher levels of deadly violence than they did in 2019, before a spike in killings, according to a new report on crime trends.
The report by the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice also said that while numerous cities saw violent crime fall in 2023 from the year before, other offenses increased over the same period, including motor vehicle thefts.
“Overall, crime rates are largely returning to pre-COVID levels as the nation distances itself from the height of the pandemic, but there are notable exceptions,” said the think tank’s report, which was released Thursday. A copy was shared with The Washington Post ahead of its public release.
Communities across the country have seen a welcome decline in the levels of bloodshed they endured in 2020 and 2021, when rates of gun deaths rose to their highest levels in a quarter-century. Experts say there was no single explanation for what drove that increase, though they cited as possible factors the stress of the coronavirus pandemic, which began in 2020, and the rising number of guns nationwide.
The staggering scope of U.S. gun deaths goes far beyond mass shootings
Data released by the FBI last fall showed that homicides and violent crime overall fell in 2022 from the year before. Many places then saw homicide decline further in 2023.
The homicide decrease across the country is “not as large as the increase was in 2020, but combining 2022 and 2023, what I expect to see is a large, possibly historic decline,” said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and consultant.
“We’re trending towards 2019, but have not reached those numbers yet,” said Asher, who is part of the Council on Criminal Justice’s working group on crime trends but was not involved in the report released Thursday.
The report examines data from a relatively small number of places — including the country’s largest cities, such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — and the analysis cautions that they “are not necessarily representative of all cities in the United States.” But the declines in many of those places still come as positive news for communities where homicides had been rising only a few years earlier.
Police in Philadelphia reported 410 killings across that city last year, down from 499 in 2020, 562 in 2021 and 514 in 2022. Even with last year’s decline, the city still saw more killings than the 353 that police reported in both 2018 and 2019.
The New York City police say there were 391 in 2023, down from the previous year and the first time since 2019 that the city saw fewer than 400 in one year. Chicago police said they had 617 in the city last year, down from 709 in 2022, 804 in 2021 and 778 in 2020.
In Los Angeles, the police reported 327 homicides last year, down from 392 the year before — and, officials said, it was the first time in nearly a decade that the city saw more deaths from traffic crashes than homicides.
2023 was District’s deadliest year in more than two decades
Still, these experiences were not universal. Memphis had nearly 400 homicides last year, breaking a record set only two years earlier, when the city had nearly 350 homicides.
In Washington, meanwhile, homicides surged in 2023 over the previous year, with 274 killings — up 35 percent from the year before. The nation’s capital had a homicide rate in 2023 that was higher than nearly all of the nation’s largest cities. Homicides were not the only crime to climb significantly in Washington: Carjackings also soared, and many of them involved young people.
Although homicide was declining across the country, the goal should still be reducing it further, Asher said.
“We should strive towards even lower,” he said. “We should strive towards historic lows. I certainly think … the current trend is very positive, but that there’s still work to be done.”
The report released Thursday is the latest in a series of analyses that the Council on Criminal Justice has produced since 2020 exploring crime trends. This newest report studied 38 cities based on those that had crime data available, though not all had information reported across all categories. While 32 cities are described as having available homicide data, only 10 reported carjacking data, for instance.
According to the report, the homicide rate across the 32 cities examined went down 10 percent in 2023 from the previous year. At the same time, the report continued, the homicide rate in those cities was still up 18 percent over what it had been in 2019. Homicides, the report said, have “yet to fully recede but, except in some cities, [are] trending in the right direction.”
While homicides and gun violence were up significantly in recent years, crime nationwide is still lower than it was a few decades ago, said Bryanna Fox, a professor of criminology at the University of South Florida and a former FBI special agent.
“We’re getting better at addressing crimes, particularly the most serious ones, [including] homicide,” said Fox, who co-directs her school’s Center for Justice Research and Policy."
IFE7K594IM_P8P726PQRNVRS0Q,HUD investigates whether D.C. landlords overcharge for voucher units,Steve Thompson,"January 23, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/23/hud-investigates-dc-landlords-vouchers/,"HUD is investigating whether D.C. landlords have overcharged for apartments rented to holders of low-income housing vouchers, even as the federal agency continues discussions with local officials about how they oversee the voucher payments.
The agency notified the D.C. Housing Authority last year that it was reviewing whether landlords were following federal rules on payments, which include a requirement that landlords verify they are not charging more for voucher holders than for privately paying tenants in comparable units.
The inquiry is separate from a scathing 2022 review by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which found that the authority was failing to ensure it did not pay landlords above-market rates, among dozens of other serious problems with its operations. Overpayments mean fewer people are helped by the troubled housing authority. They also put upward pressure on the market, ultimately making housing less affordable for people without vouchers and potentially exacerbating D.C.’s long-running affordable-housing crisis.
HUD officials this month declined to speak about the inquiry into landlords’ actions, saying the agency does not comment on ongoing investigations. The department last year asked for reams of documents and data from the D.C. Housing Authority that included analyses of privately paid market rent prices, records show. Several landlords contacted by The Washington Post said they had neither heard of the investigation nor received any requests for information from federal officials.
Housing Authority spokeswoman Alison Burdo said her agency provided HUD all the documents it requested. “The investigation is still underway, and DCHA is awaiting further instructions from HUD,” she said in an email.
A Post investigation last February found that the Housing Authority overpaid landlords by millions of dollars annually. The Post found, and authority officials then acknowledged, that the agency had no process for ensuring reasonable rents, other than rent caps the agency had set years earlier with little regard for market rates. If a landlord asked for the cap, that’s what DCHA paid, The Post found.
In a letter to the Housing Authority in July, HUD asked for data on 16,506 voucher contracts that the authority had provided to The Post in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The Post’s investigation used the data to estimate how much money the Housing Authority lost to paying rents above market medians.
The Housing Authority overhauled its procedures last summer to conform with federal law, contracting with AffordableHousing.com to determine a reasonable, market-rate rent for each unit leased. But contracts were grandfathered if they were entered with landlords before those changes, Housing Authority officials said, meaning any overpayments for them would continue.
Housing Authority officials have said the grandfathering of contracts was meant to avoid disrupting the market or displacing voucher holders whose landlords might balk at extending leases at reduced rents.
But it is not clear whether the grandfathered rents comply with federal law and regulations, which prohibit payments above market rate. Asked whether HUD had signed off on the grandfathered rents, Burdo said only that the Housing Authority has informed federal officials of its own review of the policy, which was implemented by the authority’s prior administration.
Housing Authority board members briefly discussed HUD’s investigation at a meeting in October, requesting information about it from staff. “They [HUD officials] asked us for a variety of records around how much we are paying landlords and our methodology for determining rent reasonableness,” then-chief of staff Jenna Cevasco, who has since left the agency, told board members.
In November, Keith Pettigrew took over as the authority’s executive director. He inherited an agency accused by federal authorities of dozens of shortcomings related to poor leadership and mismanagement and is tasked with bringing it back into compliance.
“DCHA is currently reviewing a number of policies and procedures — including prior policies regarding existing rents — which are subject to change,” Burdo said in an email. “Once our assessment is complete, we will refine processes where needed.”
HUD initially gave the District through last March to address the issues raised in its 2022 review. But the deadline was extended to last May, and it’s no longer clear whether there is any certain date before which the Housing Authority must make all the corrections.
Among other materials requested by HUD was information from federal forms that landlords must fill out and sign when leasing to voucher holders. The “Request for Tenancy Approval” form includes an “Owner’s Certification” that the rent charged is not above market rate. Owners of properties with more than four units must fill out a portion asking for the rent prices of the property’s three most recently leased comparable units occupied by tenants without subsidies. HUD requested information from forms collected by the authority since 2018.
The Post, through FOIA requests, obtained several dozen of these forms, filled out by various landlords. In many cases, the landlords left the portion about comparable units blank, though the buildings had more than four units.
Burdo said she could not say why the previous administration approved such forms, but that going forward the agency won’t. “DCHA recognizes the HUD requirement for landlords to submit the comparables on the RFTA form, and [we] are adjusting review and monitoring procedures and practices to ensure compliance,” she said.
In some of the forms filled out in recent years, comps listed by landlords were apartments rented by voucher holders, defeating the purpose of the comparisons. This appears to have been the case for forms filled out for 4801 Connecticut Ave. in Northwest D.C. For several years, the Housing Authority has paid $2,648 including utilities for one-bedrooms there, records show, though the building recently advertised one-bedrooms for $1,700.
Many apartment buildings, including 4801 Connecticut, have taken advantage of the fact that D.C.’s rent-stabilization law restricting rent increases in older buildings does not apply to subsidized renters. The Housing Authority has been willing to pay higher rents than these buildings could get under rent stabilization. But at 4801 Connecticut it’s the market, not rent stabilization, holding prices down for many units. The building has charged new privately paying one-bedroom tenants far less than the roughly $2,200 allowed, records show.
Alvin L. Aubinoe III, who owns the company that manages the building, did not respond to a request for comment.
DCHA’s trouble with the federal rules designed to prevent overpayment dates back to 2009, when the agency — to cut costs — stopped checking for overpayment on individual apartments, records show. Then, in 2014, DCHA began raising the citywide payment limits, in an effort to deconcentrate poverty and allow voucher recipients access to “high-opportunity” neighborhoods with better schools and less crime. During the coming years, building owners learned that money could be made by exploiting differences between market rents and what DCHA would pay, The Post found.
The 2022 HUD report instructed the Housing Authority to determine whether overpayments had been made and, if so, submit a plan to reimburse the federal government.
Burdo said that the Housing Authority has not yet completed the analysis and that “DCHA and HUD are engaged in regular communications to determine next steps” regarding any overpayments the analysis identifies."

The incident, which happened Saturday, involved a Boeing 757 plane that was headed to Bogotá, Colombia. “The passengers deplaned and were bused to the terminal,” it said in a statement.
A preliminary FAA report posted Monday said the nose wheel had rolled down a nearby hill. There were no injuries, according to the report.
Delta said a nose gear tire and rim had come loose from the landing gear and passengers were transferred to a replacement aircraft. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience,” it said in a statement.
The aircraft returned to service the next day, a Delta spokesman said via email.
A spokesperson for Boeing said the plane in question is 32 years old, adding that the company stopped building the 757 in 2004.
The incident comes amid intense scrutiny for Boeing and follows an accident earlier this month in which one of its 737 Max 9s, operated by Alaska Airlines, lost a chunk of its body midair, leaving a gaping hole beside a row of seats and endangering passengers. There were no fatalities, but federal officials grounded 171 of the Max 9s for inspections.
Alaska Airlines has checked its fleet of 65 Boeing 737 Max 9s since the Jan. 5 accident and said it found loose bolts on many of those jets, according to Ben Minicucci, the carrier’s chief executive.

Banmeet Singh, 40, who was extradited from the United Kingdom in March 2023, pleaded guilty to money laundering and another charge Friday at a federal courthouse in Columbus, Ohio.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio said it is believed to be the “largest single cryptocurrency financial seizure in DEA history.”
The cryptocurrency was worth at least $150 million at seizure, officials said. According to the plea agreement, Singh is forfeiting more than 8,100 bitcoin.The price of bitcoin fluctuates, and the amount being forfeited was more than $340 million Friday at 2 p.m.
Singh is accused of using dark-web sites to sell heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, LSD, MDMA, Xanax and Tramadol to customers in cities across the United States between 2012 and 2017. Customers paid with bitcoin, MoneyGram, PayPal or cash, according to court records, and Singh would then arrange shipments of the drugs to the United States through mail carriers or package delivery services.
Singh was one of eight members of the ring convicted in the United States, DEA Special Agent in Charge Orville O. Greene, whose field office covers Ohio and Michigan, said at a news conference Friday.
He used dark-web marketplaces including Silk Road, Alpha Bay, Hansa and Dream Market, according to the plea agreement unsealed Thursday.
Singh, an Indian national living in England, was indicted in Ohio in 2018 and arrested the following year. He was not extradited to the United States until last year.
The plea agreement states that Singh would plead guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. He is expected to be sentenced to eight years in prison, though a judge will ultimately have to approve the terms of the deal. No sentencing date has been set.
His attorneys, David Thomas and Paul D. Petruzzi, declined to comment.
Now shuttered, Silk Road was a notorious marketplace for illicit drugs. Earlier this month, judges sentenced a Maryland father and son — who sold drugs on Silk Road and similar marketplaces under the screen name XanaxMan — to prison on money laundering charges. They forfeited nearly 3,000 bitcoin. In another case tied to the marketplace, the Justice Department in 2022 announced it seized cryptocurrency stolen from Silk Road worth $3.36 billion.
Also in 2022, the Justice Department announced it seized bitcoin worth more than $3.6 billion that had been stolen from the Bitfinex exchange. A married couple from New York later pleaded guilty to money laundering in the case.

In St. Petersburg, a military court sentenced Daria Trepova, a young antiwar activist, to 27 years in prison on terrorism charges connected to the killing of a prominent pro-war blogger in a cafe, the harshest known sentence for a woman in modern Russian history.
Trepova, 26, was arrested last spring and accused of giving a statuette with a bomb inside to Maxim Fomin, a pro-war commentator and Telegram blogger with over half a million followers, better known by his pen name Vladlen Tatarsky. Fomin died in the blast.
Russian investigators said Trepova collaborated with a Ukrainian “sabotage and terrorism group” who gave her various tasks and requested that she track Tatarsky, his fans, and Cyber Front Z, a pro-invasion online troll group that described itself as the “digital troops of Russia.”
Kharkiv’s air defense struggles to halt nonstop Russian missiles
In videos released by authorities and published on local media, Trepova was shown handing Tatarsky the golden statuette, which promptly exploded. Other video showed her leaving the cafe in St. Petersburg where the incident occurred.
In court, Trepova maintained that she did not know the figurine contained explosives and believed it contained a listening device. She said she believed her mission was to establish audio surveillance on Tatarsky.
“I didn’t know who Vladlen Tatarsky was,” said in her final statement to the court this week. “When we met him in person, he seemed good-natured to me, a man with a sense of humor. I didn’t hate him. I definitely didn’t want him to die.” She added, “I am very hurt and very ashamed. My gullibility and naiveté led to such disastrous consequences. I didn’t want to hurt anyone.”
On Thursday, Trepova was found guilty on three counts: staging a terrorist attack orchestrated by a group of people that resulted in death, trafficking illegal explosives, and forging documents. The court also fined her about $6,700 and sentenced a man who allowed her to spend the night in his apartment after the blast to one year and nine months.
In a separate case in Moscow on Thursday, Igor Girkin, a former military commander, Russian federal security officer and prominent pro-war blogger who criticized President Vladimir Putin’s approach to the war on Ukraine, was sentenced to four years in prison on extremism charges.
As an FSB agent, Girkin participated in Russia’s invasion and illegal annexation of Crimea and helped foment war in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Last year, he was convicted by a Dutch court in absentia of murder in the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a passenger jet shot down over Ukraine.
But Girkin, whose nom de guerre is Igor Strelkov, was never arrested in Russia over the plane incident, which killed all 298 passengers and crew members onboard. Instead, he got in trouble with the Kremlin over interviews and blog posts that accused Putin and his top military brass of not being decisive or effective enough during the invasion of Ukraine.
Ukraine alleges Russian disinformation in downing of military plane
Girkin became one of the loudest voices among nationalist hawks who grew deeply disenchanted with what they saw as Putin’s lackluster warmongering.
Eventually, a criminal case was launched against him over two Telegram posts in which Girkin said he was concerned about Russia’s hold on Crimea, which the Kremlin annexed in 2014, and about the delays in payments to family members of pro-Russian fighters, according to Kommersant, a Russian newspaper.
His arrest last year on extremism charges signaled that Putin’s government, which crushed antiwar protesters but tolerated criticism from war supporters, would no longer tolerate even ideologically loyal critics.
The Moscow City Court on Thursday ruled that Girkin was guilty of “public calls to carry out extremist activities.”
The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.
The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.
The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

Upon further reflection, I realized what a bum rap I was giving to German citizens.
In the 1930s, most Germans saw in Hitler someone who could right the wrongs that arose from the Treaty of Versailles, which severely punished the nation for World War I. Hitler’s ever-increasing abuses of democratic and human values were first met with false hopes that his regime would soon moderate. When that didn’t happen, abject fear of his powers prevented any protests and defiance.
Today, supporters know exactly what Mr. Trump is offering them — or, at least, they think they do. As the article pointed out, his supporters “like Trump because he doesn’t seem like a normal politician,” which, ironically, is something we all can agree on. As with many cults that exude unquestioned faith in anything or anyone regardless of reason, Trumpers react with a smirk — rather than a frown — in delightful anticipation.

In today’s edition … White House steps up abortion fight on Roe v. Wade anniversary … New poll finds undeclared New Hampshire voters support Haley over Trump by 10 points … but first …
PETERBOROUGH, N.H. — Nikki Haley’s narrow path to the Republican presidential nomination runs through New Hampshire — and her narrow path to winning New Hampshire runs through towns like this one.
Haley made a campaign stop in Peterborough on Saturday, a day before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race and endorsed former president Donald Trump. His exit turned the primary into what Haley wanted: a one-on-one race pitting Trump against his former U.N. ambassador.
“May the best woman win,” Haley said while campaigning on Sunday.
Haley is polling stronger in New Hampshire than any other early-primary state, but she still faces tough odds in Tuesday’s primary.
Haley supporters in New Hampshire fall into two camps, according to interviews with nearly a dozen of them this weekend: Trump supporters whom she’s won over and “Never Trump” voters.
Ken Kleiner, 56, and his wife, Andrea Kleiner, 55, fall into the former camp.
“I was a Trump supporter for the last two elections, and I don’t think I can do it again,” Kleiner said as he left a Haley rally Saturday night in Nashua, N.H. “I can’t.”
Ken Kleiner, who works in cybersecurity and lives in the Nashua suburb of Hudson, had planned on voting for Trump in the primary as recently as a few days ago, but he has been dissuaded by Trump’s tone as he has campaigned in the state.
“It hits home when you see it happen in New Hampshire,” Kleiner said.
If Haley manages even to come close to beating Trump tomorrow, she is likely to run strong in towns like Peterborough.
A prosperous former mill town of 6,500 on the Contoocook River, Peterborough is one of only 14 New Hampshire towns that voted for John Kasich over Trump in 2016. It’s home to MacDowell, a venerable artist residency that has hosted James Baldwin, Willa Cather and Jonathan Franzen. Like Johnson County, Iowa — the only county Haley carried in last week’s caucuses — more than half of Peterborough’s residents 25 and older have bachelor’s degrees.
Haley has rallied some of the coalition that backed Kasich, who came in a distant second to Trump in a much bigger field eight years ago. Charlie Bass, a former congressman who endorsed Kasich in 2016, introduced Haley when she campaigned in Peterborough on Saturday.
She has picked up the support of moderate-leaning voters, even though her policy positions are conservative.
“Nikki Haley is not a moderate Republican, but compared to Donald Trump, she certainly is,” Bass said in an interview.
Haley’s supporters in Peterborough and nearby run the gamut from Trump supporters to Biden voters.
Gregg McManus, 76, a Republican who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said he plans to vote for Haley on Tuesday — partly out of admiration for her and partly out of frustration with Trump.
“There’s so much drama and noise around him,” said McManus, who lives in Peterborough and came to see Haley there on Saturday.
Still, McManus said he would vote for Trump again if he is the nominee. Trump’s remarks following his indictment on charges including seeking to overturn the 2020 election — “They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you” — resonated with him, he said.
“He’s kind of the bouncer that we need to knock some heads together,” he said.
His wife, Jane McManus, is an independent and is also backing Haley, but she won’t vote for Trump if he’s the nominee.
“I will again hold my nose and vote for Biden,” she said.
Haley’s chance may depend on how many Democrats and independents she can turn out in Peterborough and elsewhere.
Jack Calhoun, 69, who lives in nearby Harrisville, once worked as an aide to James Cleveland, a late Republican congressman from New Hampshire. “I used to be what I would call a New England Republican,” he said as he left All Saints Episcopal Church in Peterborough on Sunday morning.
Calhoun hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. He backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Biden in 2020. But he plans to vote for Haley in Tuesday’s primary out of distaste for Trump.
“Anything to signal that the leader in the Republican Party needs to be thrown off his game,” he said.
Haley’s campaign is already looking ahead to her home state, South Carolina, the next Republican primary in which she and Trump will appear on the ballot. She’s planning to hold a rally on Wednesday in North Charleston, S.C.
“We want to keep building out of Iowa, build out of New Hampshire, give her a head of steam when she goes back to her home state of South Carolina,” New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu — who recently toned down his earlier predications that Haley would win his state in a “landslide” — said as he introduced Haley at a rally Saturday night.
But if she loses New Hampshire on Tuesday, it’s not clear Haley will survive until South Carolina votes on Feb. 24.
South Carolina is a more conservative state than New Hampshire, and Haley might not have much home field advantage. Trump has consolidated top South Carolina Republicans behind him, and he brought many of them to New Hampshire over the weekend in a show of support, including Sen. Tim Scott, Gov. Henry McMaster and Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry.
No Republican in modern presidential history has won the nomination without carrying Iowa or New Hampshire. Two Democrats have secured their party’s nomination without winning either state: Bill Clinton and Biden.
James Carville, a top Clinton strategist in 1992, said Haley couldn’t replicate the reason that Clinton and Biden were able to hang on: the power of Southern Black voters in the Democratic primary. Clinton didn’t win his first primary until Georgia voted, while Biden didn’t win a primary in 2020 until he triumphed in South Carolina, helped by the endorsement of Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.).
“Once you head down South, it’s a whole different ballgame,” Carville said.
Clinton’s charm and political talent also helped persuade donors to stick with him even though he hadn’t won a state, Carville said.
“That’s how this thing ends,” Carville said. “You just run out of oxygen. You can’t pay anybody. You can’t travel.”
“That’s what’s going to happen to DeSantis,” he added, speaking on Friday before DeSantis had dropped out. “And that’s what’s going to happen to Haley.”
Thanks to our colleague Dylan Wells for her generous reporting help.
Correction: A previous edition cited Haley saying “may the best one win.” Instead, she said “may the best woman win.”
Let’s dig a little more into that Washington Post-Monmouth University poll:
“Haley’s support has nearly doubled from 18 percent in November, appearing to benefit from the withdrawal of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie,” our colleagues Dan Balz, Scott Clement and Emily Guskin write. “But Trump’s support has grown by six percentage points over the same period. Trump may have benefited from the withdrawal and endorsement of entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and could gain more with the exit of DeSantis, who immediately endorsed Trump. If DeSantis’s supporters in the poll are allocated based on their second choice, Trump’s support rises by four points while Haley’s increases by two points.”
“New Hampshire’s undeclared voters, those who are not registered as Republicans, have often played significant roles in presidential primaries,” our colleagues write. “They made up as many as 45 percent of primary voters in previous New Hampshire primaries and the Post-Monmouth poll finds 47 percent of potential Republican primary voters are not registered Republicans.”
Biden is heading back to Washington from Delaware this morning. He’ll meet this afternoon to mark the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision with the task force he set up in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe.
Biden’s campaign is also running an abortion-focused TV ad in battleground states this week. And Biden, Vice President Harris and their spouses will also hold a campaign rally in Manassas, Va., on Tuesday to mark the anniversary.
Biden will head to South Carolina on Saturday ahead of the state’s Democratic primary, which will be held Feb. 3. But we’re watching how Biden does in New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday, which the state is holding in defiance of the Democratic National Committee.
Biden is not on the ballot in New Hampshire, but his allies have mounted an aggressive write-in campaign to save Biden the embarrassment of losing to long-shot challengers Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) or Marianne Williamson. We’ll see if it works!
After two weeks in session, during which lawmakers successfully punted government funding for another six weeks, the House is out for a one-week recess.
The Senate is in this week, and we’re watching to see whether the bipartisan group of negotiators can finalize a deal on border security. They had hoped to release an agreement this week.
Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) are continuing to work on drafting the legislative text and directing the allocation for the border.
More details on what the White House is doing this week to note the anniversary of Roe:
Expanding access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortions: “Federal agencies are issuing guidance that would make no-cost contraceptives more available under the Affordable Care Act and take similar actions to expand contraception access for federal employees,” our colleague Dan Diamond reports. “Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra also plans to send a letter to health insurers instructing them of their obligation to provide no-cost contraceptives.”
A “nationwide reproductive freedoms tour”: Vice President Harris will kick off a multistate reproductive rights tour today with a stop in the battleground state of Wisconsin, where Republicans have proposed banning abortion after 14 weeks of pregnancy.

JFOZMS2NOM_2M04883TYARB3HL,Hunter Biden’s paintings have sold for a total of $1.5 million,Matt Viser,"January 23, 2024 at 7:12 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/hunter-biden-paintings-sold-15-million/,"Georges Bergès, an art gallery owner who gave small-dollar donations about 20 times to Donald Trump in 2020, signed an agreement shortly after that year’s election to take on an unusual task: representing Hunter Biden, the son of President-elect Joe Biden, who was pursuing a nascent career as an artist.
The agreement produced arrangements that drew concern from ethics experts and has now brought increasing scrutiny from House Republicans. A transcript from a House panel’s closed-door interview with Bergès, released this week, provides the most complete picture to date of Hunter Biden’s artwork, including when his paintings have been sold and for how much.
In total, there have been 10 buyers of the art, who have paid a sum of $1.5 million. Under their agreement, the gallerist received 40 percent of the sales while Biden took 60 percent.
Three of the buyers have been identified, while the other seven remain anonymous. The largest share of the work — 11 paintings, for a total of $875,000 — went to Kevin Morris, who has become one of Biden’s closest friends while also acting as an attorney and financial benefactor.
“I really like Hunter’s art,” Morris said, in a separate transcript released on Tuesday in which he was asked repeatedly by the committee about the roughly $5 million in loans he has made to Hunter. “And, you know, of course, he gets pilloried for it and, you know, all kinds of things said to him. The art is, in my view as an art collector, very good.”
Democratic donor Elizabeth Naftali bought two pieces of Biden’s, one for $52,000 and another for $42,000. President Biden appointed her in 2022 to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America’s Heritage Abroad.
William Jacques, an art collector whom Bergès described as a “really good friend” and part-owner of his gallery, bought four pieces for a total of $122,500.
There are seven other buyers, but they have remained anonymous, according to Bergès. He suggested that those purchasers were longtime collectors and customers of his.
Some Republicans and ethics experts have questioned whether buying Hunter Biden’s paintings could be a dubious way for individuals to curry favor with the White House, given that works of art are notoriously hard to value and the president’s son is not an established artist. Biden’s circle strongly denies this, saying the paintings have merit and that none of the purchasers want anything from the White House. They also note that most of them have remained anonymous, making it impossible for them to seek favors in exchange for their purchases.
Bergès entered into his arrangement with Hunter Biden in early December 2020, shortly after Joe Biden was elected president but before he was sworn in. Jacques purchased a painting for $40,000 that month, and one of the unidentified buyers also bought one.
In February 2021, Jacques purchased two more paintings for $25,000 each. Naftali purchased a painting titled “Mother and Daughter” that month for $42,000.
Jacques and Naftali did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. When her name was revealed as a buyer last year and she was questioned by House Republicans, Naftali’s attorney defended the purchases.
“Any insinuation that her purchase of art was unusual or somehow improper is entirely unsupported,” the lawyer, Jason Abel, wrote in a letter to Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.). “To be clear, Ms. Naftali purchased the artwork solely because she liked the art, and the prices were reasonable.”
He also said that she did not seek out a position on the Commission for the Preservation of America’s Heritage Abroad, and that it came at the instigation not of the White House but of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “Any attempt to link Ms. Naftali’s art purchases to her appointment to the Commission is also baseless,” Abel wrote.
The House Judiciary and Oversight committees interviewed Bergès on Jan. 9 in a closed-door session led by a committee lawyer. The panels, which are conducting an impeachment inquiry into President Biden that has yielded little public evidence of wrongdoing, is scheduled to interview Hunter Biden on Feb. 28 after a lengthy back-and-forth over the terms.
Hunter Biden makes a defiant appearance
Bergès was asked numerous times during his interview about White House involvement in his arrangement with the Georges Bergès Gallery as first described by The Washington Post in July 2021. The Post reported that White House attorneys, concerned about potential ethical issues, urged that any buyers of Hunter’s paintings be kept confidential, a practice that was adopted.
Bergès testified that he never spoke with anyone from the White House, and claimed that he was surprised to read reports about the arrangement. At the time, he did not respond to phone and email messages from The Post, but a person who said she was calling on behalf of Bergès confirmed to The Post that all sales would be kept secret from Hunter Biden.
Biden’s allies say that the public attention and the controversy around the art sales and gallery showings has dampened his ability to sell the paintings, with potential buyers worried that a purchase would invite subpoenas from House Republicans.
Bergès told the committees he chose to represent Biden after being inspired not only by his art but also the story behind it. Throughout the lengthy interview, the gallery owner repeatedly compared Biden, who has suffered from drug addiction and other personal difficulties, to Rocky Balboa, saying both are underdogs struggling for redemption.
“This is why we cheer for Rocky. Rocky is not supposed to win, but he wins,” Bergès said. “And that’s to me America. And Hunter is not supposed to win. He should be dead. And he faced a crossroad in his life, which we all do when we’re all struggling with things in our lives. And he could have chosen the easy path, which is to keep going and die, or do the hard thing, which is to change.”
At one point, a questioner challenged that image of Biden as an underdog, noting that he is the son of a powerful politician, has degrees from Georgetown and Yale universities, and has made millions as a consultant.
Bergès said that while he and Biden have become friendly, he let the contract lapse last year. “From a business perspective, it hasn’t been the best decision for me,” Bergès said, citing security issues, death threats and assumptions about his political affiliations.
“It was a little bit more than I could chew, that obviously I kind of wanted my life back,” he said.
Bergès’s testimony comes as the committee accelerates its interviews in an attempt to zero in on Biden ahead of the November election.
Morris, who appeared before the committee last week, testified that he met Hunter Biden at a fundraiser in November 2019. Morris said he viewed Hunter as someone in need, emerging from addiction and facing a media firestorm.
“I basically found him like a guy getting the crap beat out of him in a — by a gang of people,” he said. “And, you know, where we come from, you don’t let that happen. You get in and you start swinging.”
They grew up not far from one another and from similar backgrounds, Morris said — “Irish, Catholic, lots of booze flying around” — and forged a quick connection. Morris agreed to represent Biden. He bought some of his art for $40,000. And soon he was agreeing to help him on his taxes, to pay his rent, and settle debts for his Porsche.
Morris declined to answer numerous questions about exactly how much he has loaned to Biden and for what purposes. But he said they have around five promissory notes, with interest, and the terms state that Biden needs to repay them starting in 2025.
When asked about other testimony that he had loaned Biden approximately $4.9 million between 2020 and 2022 to cover tax payments and personal expenditures, he replied that those figures were basically correct. He cast it as not a consequential amount of money for him, saying that it represents less than 5 percent of his assets.
“With respect to the loans, I am confident that Hunter will repay,” Morris said. “I did not and do not have any expectations of receiving anything from Hunter's father or the Biden administration in exchange from helping Hunter, nor have I asked for anything from President Biden or his administration. My only goal was and is to help my friend and client.”
He said that he had met President Biden several times, including at the wedding of Naomi Biden, Hunter’s daughter. Hunter Biden also gave him a tour of the White House and, toward the end of the day, they saw President Biden.
“The president waved. And I think he said hi,” Morris said. “He always makes jokes about my hair. I think he made a crack about my hair. That was it.”"
JHK4DOJ0YS_D730QCLU2UGEGGW,"In tents, motels and wooded areas, D.C. region counts its homeless",Justin Wm. Moyer,"January 26, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/26/charles-county-homeless-point-in-time-count/,"CHARLES COUNTY, Md. — Homeless outreach advocate Corae Young ventured Wednesday into a stand of trees behind a bustling shopping center. A path littered with bottles, cans and takeout containers led to an encampment with about a dozen shelters — store-bought tents or improvised structures fashioned from tarps and plastic — at the edge of a pond.
At an elaborate tent equipped with a propane heater and a clothesline, Young approached a man she said had cycled from his tent to an emergency shelter and back again for years. On a relatively warm evening amid recent brutal weather, he said he didn’t want to go into shelter but did want help with permanent housing. He also accepted a Wawa gift card. (He declined an interview.)
Young, chief operating officer of the outreach organization LifeStyles of Maryland, spent Wednesday searching for Charles County’s unhoused people, surveying the vulnerable about their needs while distributing toiletries, tents, gift cards and other necessities. Her mission was part of the “point in time” count conducted across the country each year in January.
The count — a portrait of homelessness in America on one night — surveys homeless people wherever they are found: in shelters, encampments and motels. The 2023 count showed a surge in the number of unhoused people as pandemic assistance waned.
Some, such as 74-year-old Marva Washington, are included in the count because their housing is deemed unsafe. Young navigated her SUV around potholes on the dirt road to Washington’s home. Washington stood in her muddy front yard wearing a bathrobe. Her ramshackle structure in Nanjemoy, Md. — about 40 miles south of the District — was heated by a wood stove and surrounded by trash. Nearby, dogs ran free among trailers and vehicles that appeared to be abandoned.
Washington said she has no desire to leave the dilapidated home in the woods where she has lived for decades. Her family is here. She has electricity and running water. When the roof recently needed repair, she fixed it herself.
“I know how to get around,” she said. “I’m safe here. It’s beautiful in the summertime. You sit in your front yard and don’t have to worry about anybody bothering you.”
Charles County has no shortage of unhoused people, with 95 surveyed last year. It usually takes up to a few months for each year’s count results to be finalized and announced.
In her 18 years at LifeStyles, Young had seen underfunded social service systems overwhelmed with clients try to assist those in immediate need. Meanwhile, assistance organizations in different regions struggle to coordinate, sometimes passing along clients with insufficient information.
Even while conducting the count as night fell, Young fielded calls from people who unexpectedly needed emergency shelter. A woman stranded at a storage facility. A transgender 18-year-old with psychiatric problems who Young wasn’t sure could be safely placed in a shelter.
“It gets frustrating,” she said. “It’s not just as simple as finding somebody housing.”
Last year’s point-in-time count found more than 650,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide, a 12 percent increase from 2022. In the District, the 2023 survey showed the number of unhoused people had jumped nearly 12 percent, to about 5,000. Those double-digit increases were seen across the region, while Loudoun County in Virginia saw a 122 percent increase.
Ryan Harrison, an assistant director at the Loudoun County Department of Family Services, said the increase, to 220 people, came after the end of the eviction moratorium in June 2022.
As high as the numbers seem, they are probably an undercount, according to advocates. The point-in-time survey has long been criticized as inaccurate, failing to find people who, for example, pool their resources to share a motel room on frigid nights and simply aren’t outside to be counted.
Areas along the D.C. border, including parts of Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, have seen a precipitous uptick in homelessness over the last few years — a trend that officials expect to persist in 2024. James Bridgers, the director of Montgomery County’s Department of Health and Human Services, said that as D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) focused on breaking up large homeless encampments, nearby counties in Maryland noticed a rise in the number of homeless people moving across the border.
Bridgers said he would like to see more regional efforts to combat homelessness.
“It’s been happening, but it’s not happening fast enough,” he said. “Our homeless population cannot be allowed to be an invisible nation of people.”
In front of a motel in Charles County — one of a few where LifeStyles is able to house clients temporarily — Michael Tatem, 65, smoked a Newport cigarette as he contemplated his next move. Tatem was what Young called a “traveler.”
Tatem’s story wasn’t easy to follow. He said he had lost a career in the National Guard to drugs decades ago. A marriage had ended in divorce. He had lost a son to a fatal shooting.
After skipping out on probation in North Carolina in relation to a drug charge, Tatum tried living with his sister in Virginia. That didn’t work out, so he ended up in Charles County recently when his truck and a boat he was towing for salvage — both without proper tags — were impounded. Now, Young was arranging for him to get a room.
Tatem said he felt like he was hitting rock bottom, like he was falling through deep water: You realize you can’t breathe, then you jump up. That’s what he was doing now by asking for help.
He was optimistic.
“I’m reaching for the surface,” he said."
JKGC4TNRG4_30IOMCOSXE2EI7G,Execution by gas has a brutal 100-year history. Now it’s back.,_,"January 24, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/24/gas-chamber-execution/,"On a chilly morning in Carson City in February 1924, Nevada State Prison officials fired up an electric heater in a stone barbershop building and escorted an inmate inside. But the prisoner’s comfort wasn’t the priority. The heat was supposed to warm up cyanide acid so it would vaporize and execute Gee Jon, a young Chinese immigrant accused of murdering a laundryman.
The heater malfunctioned, and most of the acid fell as liquid to the floor of the makeshift gas chamber. But there was enough gas to kill Gee, strapped to a plain pine chair, in about six minutes as horrified witnesses watched his head lurch and his eyes roll upward. Some observers jumped back from an outside window when they thought they smelled almonds — the scent of cyanide. No autopsy was performed out of fear that gas in Gee’s body would poison onlookers.
Still, officials and journalists deemed the world’s first gas-chamber execution to be a success. “Nevada’s novel death law is upheld by the highest court — humanity,” proclaimed a Reno newspaper.
Nearly 600 inmates would die in American gas chambers over the next 75 years. Now, an Alabama man faces execution by nitrogen hypoxia on Thursday. If the execution goes forward as scheduled, he will be the first person in the United States to be killed by gas in a quarter-century.
Things are different this time. Instead of sitting in a sealed chamber full of cyanide gas, convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, is slated to breathe nitrogen gas through an industrial, full-face mask. But one thing hasn’t changed since that Carson City morning almost exactly a century ago: There’s plenty of room for error, and death may not come instantly or easily.
The death penalty’s 50-year rise and fall since Supreme Court struck it down
“Every gas execution involved torture of some sort. It’s the worst method of execution we’ve ever had and the most cruel,” said death penalty historian Deborah W. Denno, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York. “The inmate is conscious and aware of what’s going on, and the torment is obvious.”
This wasn’t the plan. Execution by gas was supposed to be a humane advance for a progressive era. “Unlike most countries which chose one method and stuck with it, for more than 150 years the U.S. has been on a search for an ever-better method of execution,” said death penalty historian Austin D. Sarat, chair of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
The goal, he said, has always been to find a way to kill prisoners in a “safe, reliable and humane” way.
Public hangings, initially popular, went out of style in the 19th century. Then electrocution was touted as more humane than hanging, which could decapitate prisoners or excruciatingly strangle them. But electrocutions often went horribly wrong as prisoners burst into flames.
One state, Minnesota, abolished the death penalty altogether. But Nevada, the nation’s least-populated state in 1920, with just 77,407 residents, chose to find a new way to kill.
Supporters described death by cyanide gas as “absolutely painless,” administered at higher concentrations than in World War I battlefield gas attacks so death would be quick. Ideally, Silver State prisoners would breathe the gas as they slept in their cells. Officials determined that idea was impractical, however, and they developed the gas chamber instead.
Four Carson City prison guards quit rather than take part in the first gas execution, and officials had a hard time locating and delivering cyanide acid to the prison. A gas chamber test on an unfortunate cat and two kittens revealed a hole in a wall that could have gassed witnesses; it was patched.
Then came the execution, which took place after a guard urged Gee to “take it like a man.”
Gas chambers became common, most famously in California, which installed its version at the Bay Area’s San Quentin State Prison in 1938. From Oregon to North Carolina, prisons developed unique protocols such as coating a gas chamber doorway with Vaseline to keep the gas in and patting down an inmate’s hair and clothes after executions to get the gas out so no one got sick while handling the body. Some prisoners were shaved and stripped to their underwear to lower the risk.
Three justices backed the death penalty — then changed their minds
“But the gas chamber never took off the way the electric chair or lethal injection did,” Sarat said. “Why would you want to go to all the trouble of constructing a gas chamber when you could more cheaply — and presumably more efficiently — go with the electric chair and then with lethal injection?”
And there were horrific deaths. In 1983, a Mississippi prisoner repeatedly “snapped” his head into a steel pole as he convulsed, gasped and groaned over eight minutes, UPI reported. Observers were told to leave while the inmate appeared to still be breathing in a chamber full of gas and mosquitoes. An official claimed the prisoner died after just two minutes, adding that physicians present believed “it was a prompt and easy death.”
In a 2021 op-ed, an Arizona attorney recalled his client writhing in agony during a 1992 execution as he wore only diaper-like underwear: “His face and body turned a deep red, and the veins in his temple and neck began to bulge until I thought they might explode.”
Sarat examined 8,776 American executions performed from 1890 to 2010 and found that more than 5 percent of gas chamber deaths didn’t follow standard protocol and “caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner” or displayed incompetence on the part of the executioner. Only lethal injections went botched more often (7 percent of the time), while errors were less common in hangings (3 percent) and electrocutions (2 percent).
Even when protocol was followed, things didn’t always go according to plan. Caryl Chessman, a best-selling prison author, was executed in the San Quentin gas chamber in 1960 after a judge tried to stop the execution at the last minute but apparently dialed the wrong number. In an earlier case, in 1957, the California governor tried to stop an execution, but the gas had already started wafting through the chamber as the phone rang. It was too late.
The first execution by injection was performed in 1982 — President Ronald Reagan was an early fan of the idea when he was California governor — and the method soon became popular. The thinking was that executions would be “very clean, clinical and peaceful-looking,” said Robin M. Maher, executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.
The specter of Nazi gas chambers during World War II also appears to have hastened the decline of gas executions in the United States, the late journalist Scott Christianson wrote in “The Last Gasp: The Rise and Fall of the American Gas Chamber,” although “America’s struggle over lethal gas was remarkably subdued.”
Only 11 gas executions have been performed since a Supreme Court moratorium on the death penalty was lifted in 1976, compared to 1,402 lethal injections, 163 electrocutions, three hangings and three deaths by firing squad.
In recent years, however, it’s become harder for states to obtain drugs for lethal injections, and several executions using the method have been botched. In 2022, the execution of Smith, the Alabama prisoner scheduled to be executed by gas Thursday, was called off after prison staff failed to find a usable vein for an hour. It was Alabama’s second unsuccessful lethal injection in two months.
Smith was sentenced to death in 1996 after he was convicted of killing Elizabeth Sennett in 1988 as part of a murder-for-hire plot. Prosecutors alleged Sennett’s pastor husband set up the murder to collect on insurance and paid $1,000 each to Smith and an accomplice, who was later executed. The husband died by suicide. Earlier this month, one of Sennett’s sons told an Alabama TV station that Smith “has been in prison right at twice as long as we knew our mom.”
Now Smith is scheduled be killed by nitrogen gas as his attorneys try to convince judges to stop the execution. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, the method is approved in Alabama, where prisoners can choose it or electrocution instead of lethal injection, and in Oklahoma and Mississippi, where it can be used if lethal injection is declared unconstitutional or “otherwise unavailable.” The method is also under consideration in Nebraska, where a legislator said it is “very humane.”
Smith opted for gas. Alabama officials required Smith’s spiritual adviser to sign a waiver acknowledging that he may face a risk from being in the room with Smith as the prisoner inhales nitrogen gas via a face mask, NPR reported.
While cyanide gas works by preventing the body’s cells from transforming oxygen into fuel, nitrogen gas — a normal component of air — causes asphyxiation when no oxygen is delivered to the lungs, said death penalty opponent Joel B. Zivot, an anesthesiologist at Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta.
Zivot has pushed for the United Nations to oppose the Alabama execution, and the United Nations Human Rights Office called for it to be halted. But an international outcry didn’t stop the last American gas chamber execution, in 1999.
Then, on a warm winter evening, an Arizona inmate convicted of killing a bank manager took 18 minutes to die in front of more than 30 witnesses, the Tucson Citizen reported, including the victim’s daughter, who held a photo of her father. As the gas rose “like steam in a shower,” the prisoner coughed violently, twitched and clenched his reddened hands. With about 12 minutes left until his heart stopped, the daughter “left the room, which had become uncomfortably warm.”
An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified the Death Penalty Information Center as opposed to capital punishment. In fact, it says it ""does not take a position on the death penalty itself but is critical of problems in its application."" The story has been corrected."
JM72UQZGPZ_6IVTG52JIFUTP7S,Opinion What in the world was Fani Willis thinking?,Ruth Marcus,"January 22, 2024 at 4:41 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/fani-willis-gift-trump/,"As a legal matter, the allegations about a romantic relationship between Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis and the chief prosecutor in the election interference case against former president Donald Trump are irrelevant. Even if all the claims are true, they wouldn’t imperil the prosecution or justify dismissing the indictment, as one of Trump’s co-defendants is seeking.
As a question of atmospherics, though, the situation is a disaster — an unexpected gift to Trump that he will exploit not only to discredit the Georgia prosecution but also to augment his broader claims of being unfairly persecuted. It would be advisable for special prosecutor Nathan Wade to step aside, as a group of legal ethics experts has suggested, but the harm has already been done and could get worse: On Monday, a judge ordered records unsealed in Wade’s divorce case.
Assuming that the allegations are accurate, Willis displayed monumentally poor judgment by bringing in Wade, a former municipal court judge and lawyer in private practice with scant expertise in complex criminal cases; he has been paid some $650,000, at an hourly rate of $250. (That might sound like a lot, but it’s reasonable and consistent with compensation for other outside attorneys.) Adding fuel to the fire are records, filed in Wade’s divorce proceedings, indicating he paid for Willis’s travel to San Francisco and Aruba.
What in the world was Willis thinking? She did not help herself after the allegations surfaced by insinuating that the criticism was racially motivated because there were no complaints about her hiring two other special counsels, who are White. “They only attacked one,” Willis said. Um, she’s only accused of having a romantic relationship with one.
And this is not complicated. In government or out, you don’t hire your boyfriend. You know who knows this? Fani Willis. “I certainly will not be choosing people to date that work under me,” she said in a 2020 campaign appearance helpfully recirculated by the Georgia GOP chairman.
I have not been a fan of the Georgia case, with its charge of a sprawling, multi-defendant racketeering conspiracy. But Willis and her team have racked up some notable successes, securing guilty pleas — albeit no jail time — from Trump lawyers Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis, who agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
Now comes a motion filed by defendant Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign official, seeking to have the entire indictment dismissed as “invalid and unconstitutional” and Willis’s office disqualified from further proceedings.
Roman’s lawyer, Ashleigh Merchant, asserted that Willis and Wade have an “impermissible and irreparable conflict of interest” in the prosecution. “Willis has benefitted substantially and directly, and continues to benefit, from this litigation because Wade is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to prosecute this case on her behalf,” Merchant argued. “In turn, Wade is taking Willis on, and paying for vacations across the world with money he is being paid by the Fulton County taxpayers and authorized solely by Willis.”
Not only does this violate Georgia’s legal ethics rules, she suggested, but it also could constitute the federal crime of “honest services fraud,” since Willis benefited from the hiring without disclosing it.
This is overblown and unlikely to succeed. As lawyers Norman Eisen, Joyce Vance and Richard Painter argue on the Just Security website, there is a critical distinction between whether Willis’s conduct violated any ethical rules and whether it warrants dismissal of the criminal charges.
“Questions about gifts and related matters go to Willis’s and Wade’s obligations to the Fulton County District Attorney’s office, and have no connection to assuring the defendants a fair trial,” they write. “These allegations are as irrelevant to the trial as allegations in other situations that prosecutors took office supplies for personal use, drove county vehicles for personal errands, or plagiarized portions of their student law review notes.”
A conflict of interest would be present in a situation where “conflicting loyalties” could harm the defendant. “We might question Willis’s judgment in hiring Wade and the pair’s other alleged conduct,” Eisen, Vance and Painter write, “but under Georgia law that relationship and their alleged behavior do not impact her or his ability to continue on the case.”
By contrast, at an earlier stage of the case, Willis was appropriately disqualified from pursuing charges against Burt Jones, a 2020 Trump elector and then the GOP candidate for Georgia lieutenant governor, after hosting a fundraiser for his Democratic opponent.
“This choice — which the District Attorney was within her rights as an elected official to make — has consequences,” wrote Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney. “She has bestowed her office’s imprimatur upon Senator Jones’s opponent. And since then, she has publicly (in her pleadings) labeled Senator Jones a ‘target’ of the grand jury’s investigation. This scenario creates a plain — and actual and untenable — conflict.” There’s no analogous conflict here.
But there is a problem. The arrangement stinks, and it plays right into Trump’s hands. Trump has already called Willis and Wade “the lovebirds” — shades of his attacks on FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page — and accused them of going after him “to ENRICH themselves and to live the Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous.”
We know Trump needs no evidence to launch baseless assaults; see his description of the law clerk for Justice Arthur Engoron in the New York civil fraud trial as “Schumer’s girlfriend.”
Now, Willis has offered him live ammunition. It might not damn her case in court, but the damage in the court of public opinion is immense."
JO9XT8IIM8_VDLFBM664WZDPLH,"Opinion As North Korea’s threat grows, ignoring it is not working",Editorial Board,"January 24, 2024 at 3:04 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/24/north-korea-danger-biden/,"The United States and its allies are in the worst situation yet in the long and unsuccessful attempt to curb North Korea’s quest for nuclear weapons and advanced missiles. Successive U.S. presidents tried isolation and sanctions, inducements and incentives. Nothing worked, and now North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is cozying up to a new benefactor, President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
This is bad news for the multitude of U.S. and U.N. Security Council sanctions intended to restrict North Korea’s exports and imports, limit its financial dealings and root out its illicit cyber and crypto activities. Mr. Putin cares little for the West’s sanctions and is desperate to acquire ammunition and missiles from Mr. Kim’s stockpile. The White House announced earlier this month that North Korea was already sending medium-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Mr. Kim also reportedly shipped more than 1 million artillery shells to Russia.
It is not known precisely how Mr. Putin will reward North Korea for this, but he could send desperately needed supplies such as oil or Russia’s sophisticated weapons technology. Last week, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui visited Moscow, where her Russian hosts reiterated their commitment to developing relations with North Korea in all areas, including “sensitive” ones. North Korea said Mr. Putin might visit Pyongyang at an unspecified “early date.”
President Biden has not shown much interest in Mr. Kim. At this point, he has almost no leverage over him. The best options are long gone. Eventually, China might brake Mr. Kim’s behavior, but the United States must first stabilize its relations with Beijing.
Indeed, Mr. Kim seems to have given up on negotiations with the United States after the failed 2019 Hanoi summit with President Donald Trump. The United States has stated repeatedly that it is open to negotiations on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula that could lead to eventual lifting of sanctions. But Mr. Kim insists he will not relinquish his country’s nuclear program — estimated at 20 to 60 nuclear warheads.
With diplomacy dead, the United States and South Korea are scrambling to shore up deterrence through regular military drills. Last year, the United States deployed a nuclear-armed submarine to South Korea for the first time since the 1980s. Mr. Kim has responded with yet another round of threatening maneuvers, testing a solid-fueled ballistic missile and experimenting with a nuclear-capable undersea unmanned vessel.
On top of all these worries, two experts on North Korea, Robert Carlin and Siegfried Hecker, warned on Jan. 11 that Mr. Kim “has made a strategic decision to go to war.” On the Stimson Center website 38 North, they write, “We do not know when or how Kim plans to pull the trigger, but the danger is already far beyond the routine warnings in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo about Pyongyang’s ‘provocations.’” Their argument is based on Korean official pronouncements, which they say have added a serious “war preparation theme.” They add, “The evidence of the past year opens the real possibility that the situation may have reached the point that we must seriously consider a worst case.” In a rebuttal, Thomas Schäfer, Germany’s former ambassador to North Korea, wrote that Mr. Kim is intentionally building up tension to drive a hard bargain should Mr. Trump return to office, repeating past cycles of threat and negotiation.
The United States should prepare for either possibility as tension rises. A modest military confidence-building agreement reached in 2018 by North and South Korea collapsed in November. Last week, Mr. Kim called for a change to the North Korean constitution to declare South Korea an enemy state and formally abandoned the idea of peacefully reunifying the two halves of the peninsula. “We don’t want war but we have no intention of avoiding it,” Mr. Kim said, according to North Korea’s state news agency.
Moon Chung-in, a professor emeritus of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul and a former presidential adviser, said in an interview published by the South Korean news outlet Hankyoreh that he did not see war as imminent but fears the nations could stumble into conflict by accident or miscalculation. “An unintended clash has the potential to erupt into a regional war, a full-scale war, or even a nuclear war,” he said.
North Korea is now an established nuclear weapons power and continues to expand its arsenal of missiles and other technology, such as hypersonic glide vehicles. Mr. Kim might use this growing muscle for leverage and threat, as in the past. Or his saber-rattling could portend something much worse. The United States can hope that Mr. Kim’s recent provocations amount to just more bluster. But the Biden administration should plan as though they are more serious.

JUF8VLQR46_E9C34Y4FS5FK4QT,"Trump beats Haley decisively in N.H., closing in on nomination",Isaac Arnsdorf,"January 23, 2024 at 11:24 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/01/23/trump-haley-new-hampshire-primary-election/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Donald Trump marched closer to the Republican nomination with a sweep of the first two contests, defeating former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley on Tuesday as voters turned out in projected record numbers in New Hampshire’s primary.
Trump’s lead here was decisive enough for the Associated Press to project his win shortly after polls closed. With nearly 75 percent of the vote tallied, Trump led Haley by about 11 percentage points. The Republican primary attracted widespread interest across the state, with turnout on pace to surpass the previous high, according to Edison Research estimates.
Trump’s victory dealt another blow to critics in his party who saw the New Hampshire race as perhaps the last best chance to stop or slow him. His campaign was eager to end the nominating contest and turn its focus to a rematch with President Biden and the battery of criminal and civil trials that Trump is facing — including charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election results, mishandling classified documents after leaving office and paying hush money to an adult-film actress before the 2016 election.
Haley vowed to press on and challenged Trump to debate her. Despite his comfortable win, Trump appeared peeved with Haley’s continued presence in the race, and his pivot to a general-election message or striking a triumphant note on a night that was supposed to finalize his presumptive nomination took a back seat to hammering her. He devoted the start of his victory speech to attacking her repeatedly, he called her “DELUSIONAL!!!” in a social media post.
The pressure on Haley to bow out mounted Tuesday night as allies accused her of helping Biden by staying in the race. Trump picked up endorsements from Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who has previously called for the party to move on from Trump.
“I have seen enough,” Cornyn said on social media. “Republicans need to unite around a single candidate, and it’s clear that President Trump is Republican voters’ choice.”
1/5
Haley is heading to her home state of South Carolina to campaign for its primary on Feb. 24.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last,” she told her supporters Tuesday night. “The worst-kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Donald Trump,” she said, to shouts of “Trump’s a loser!”
Despite her shrinking path to halting Trump’s march to the Republican nomination, Haley’s showing in New Hampshire hinged on independents, who are permitted to vote in this state’s Republican primary. Haley’s strength with those voters exposed weaknesses for Trump in a potential rematch with Biden in November, as moderate Republicans and right-leaning independents sent a message that the party’s internal divisions will not disappear so quickly.
Preliminary exit polling in New Hampshire showed about 3 in 10 Republican primary voters considered themselves part of the MAGA movement while over 6 in 10 did not. In Iowa, where Trump won in a landslide with Republican caucus-goers last week, 46 percent considered themselves MAGA.
“I’m Republican, and I’m not going to vote for the other candidate irregardless,” Roy Pieczarka of Bedford said after voting at the high school for Haley. “No thank you, that’s not what we need. I’m not going to vote for the man whose last name begins with T.”
Trump brushed off questions about his appeal when speaking to reporters outside a polling place in Londonderry. “They’re all going to vote for me again,” he said. “I’m not sure we need too many.”
The Biden campaign also reacted to Tuesday’s results with a focus on November. “It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee,” Biden said in a statement. “I want to say to all those Independents and Republicans who share our commitment to core values of our nation — our Democracy, our personal freedoms, an economy that gives everyone a fair shot — to join us as Americans.”
Democrats also voted here Tuesday, but Biden did not appear on the ballot because the party is holding its first official contest in South Carolina. New Hampshire held its primary first anyway, so the contest will not yield any delegates for the summer nominating convention. Still, some Biden allies ran a campaign urging voters to write in his name, in hopes of generating a symbolic show of support amid low approval ratings. Biden won the Democratic race, the AP projected late Tuesday.
“The alternative is so scary,” said Michelle O’Rourke, a Democrat in Bedford. “I’m just so upset with all the Republicans. I wouldn’t want anything to do with any of them.”
New Hampshire voters in the Republican primary split about evenly between people who were registered as Republicans and those registered as independent or undeclared, with a tiny share saying they were not registered to vote before Election Day, according to early exit polls. Independents and undeclared registered voters supported Haley by about a 2-to-1 margin, while registered Republicans supported Trump by about 3 to 1.
Just over half said they believed the false claim that Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 presidential election. They overwhelmingly went for Trump, by over a 6-to-1 margin. The roughly half who said he legitimately won supported Haley about 4 to 1.
The race now moves to Nevada, where Trump is poised to dominate the caucuses while Haley competes in a primary that does not count for delegates. After that, in South Carolina, Trump has maintained a wide lead in the polls of at least 30 points. His campaign has taunted her with warnings of a humiliating defeat there and brought out the state’s top-ranking Republicans who have all endorsed Trump.
“This election is over,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said at Trump’s victory party. “It is time for the Republican Party to coalesce around our nominee and the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. Let’s get that party started tonight!”
Trump suggested Scott “must really hate” Haley, since she originally appointed him to his Senate seat. Scott played it off by responding, “I just love you,” as the crowd laughed.
Haley’s campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, released a memo as voting began Tuesday vowing to fight on through Super Tuesday in March, despite pre-primary polls showing Trump with a widening lead here and less favorable contests ahead for Haley. The memo argued that outperforming with independents could buoy her after South Carolina. Michigan has an open primary, and 11 of the 16 Super Tuesday states also allow non-Republicans to vote to some extent.
“We’re onto South Carolina tomorrow morning,” Mark Harris, the lead strategist for the main pro-Haley super PAC, told reporters at the expo center in downtown Manchester. “Our goal in New Hampshire was to narrow the field down to two. We did that before a single vote was cast. … The campaign is built for a long-term fight, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”
Haley has staked her appeal on raising doubts about Trump’s electability and citing polls showing her outperforming him in a hypothetical matchup with Biden. But less than 2 in 10 Republican primary voters said they wanted a candidate who could beat Biden, and about 6 in 10 of them supported Trump.
Fergus Cullen, a New Hampshire Republican strategist who opposes Trump, said Haley’s slightly better-than-expected performance did not signal the electorate is moving away from Trump. “In a semi-open primary state [Haley] would need to keep him under 50 percent to make that argument that the GOP is open to moving on.
Trump has the next nine months to convince independents to take his side, said Mike Dennehy, a New Hampshire GOP operative who helmed John McCain’s primary wins in the state in 2000 and 2008. He cautioned that it was hard to draw conclusions about Trump’s broader support from Tuesday’s results. He expected Trump to hammer immigration and the economy as Biden has his own struggle to woo independents.
The challenge for Haley of mobilizing non-Republicans to vote in Republican primaries was on display at polling locations Tuesday, as some independents said they were not excited to cast a protest vote for a candidate they didn’t like.
“I just didn’t want to give any air” to the Republicans, said independent Melinda Chen, who voted for Biden in Bedford.
Other Democrats said they showed up expecting to cast a protest vote for Haley but couldn’t because they hadn’t switched their party registration by the October deadline. One such voter, Donna Gaudette in Manchester, said she unenthusiastically cast her ballot for Biden.
Just 408 Democrats changed their registration to Republican, according to tallies provided by state officials, while 3,542 changed their registration from Democratic to undeclared. New Hampshire Secretary of State David M. Scanlan said he expected turnout to meet or exceed his prediction of a record 322,000 Republicans.
“I would like to have a new generation of leaders in Washington, and one that’s got their full faculties and is also trying to drive a wedge,” Christian Fiore, an unaffiliated voter in Merrimack, said after voting for Haley. If Trump won the Republican nomination, Fiore said, “I would vote for Biden, unfortunately, because I think Trump’s a threat to democracy.”
At Haley’s watch party, Bruce Lariviere, 65, said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but couldn’t support him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. “He’s supposed to be better than that,” Lariviere said. “She reminds me of Reagan, John Kennedy. She really just wants to bring people into the fold.”
Trump and his allies went into Tuesday preemptively disparaging the legitimacy of courting non-Republicans, with the former president misleadingly suggesting that Democrats could vote in the GOP primary. In his victory speech, Trump falsely blamed the long-standing practice on the state’s current Republican governor, Chris Sununu, who endorsed Haley.
“They want to make me look as bad as possible,” Trump said.
He praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for dropping out and endorsing him after placing second in Iowa, and he brought up another vanquished rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, to attack Haley, introducing him as “The only person more angry, than let’s say me. But I don’t get too angry, I get even.”

JWV8RT95VU_356YY3360456U1I,The gamble Republicans are about to take on Trump,Aaron Blake,"January 22, 2024 at 9:22 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/trump-gamble-republicans/,"In a little more than 24 hours, New Hampshire Republican primary voters could effectively bring the 2024 nominating contest to a close.
Nikki Haley now has Donald Trump in the one-on-one race she had hoped for, but she trails in every poll in the state. If she can’t win head-to-head in New Hampshire, with its friendly electorate — and if Trump wins a majority of the vote there like he did in Iowa — it will be abundantly clear where this is headed: a third straight presidential nomination for Trump. Republicans will have chosen, and they will have chosen very quickly.
At this point of potential no return for the GOP, it’s worth reflecting on what that would amount to: a huge gamble.
The former president currently polls competitively with President Biden in a hypothetical 2024 matchup. But that doesn’t mean Republicans wouldn’t be saddling up for a rocky ride.
For a few reasons.
Despite Trump polling relatively well right now, his electoral track record is unmistakably poor:
None of that means Trump can’t win in 2024. He could. He was closer to winning the electoral college in 2020 than a lot of people realize. His voters seem to turn out better when he’s on the ballot.
But Republicans would be placing a lot of faith in a guy whose political instincts haven’t exactly rewarded that.
The reason Trump has as much of a chance as he does right now boils down to a couple of things: how unpopular Biden is, and the prospect of third-party candidates hurting Biden.
Biden’s continued unpopularity is not assured, and the third-party factor is likely to matter less as the race goes on.
Trump is a well-defined, known quantity to American voters. He didn’t crest 47 percent in either of his two campaigns, and both his approval and favorable ratings have pretty consistently hovered around 40 percent. (Trump actually took a higher share of the vote in 2020 than in 2016, but he won in 2016 because of an unpopular opponent and third-party candidates taking significant vote shares.)
That suggests Trump has a ceiling in the mid- to high 40s, and Biden’s numbers would have to remain down.
Which is possible. But signs right now are that the economy is headed in a better direction, which could help Biden. And while third-party candidates are taking historically large numbers in the polls, history shows that most of their would-be voters ultimately come home to one of the two major-party candidates.
Republicans can also see with their own eyes how much better a more standard-issue Republican could do. Haley generally polls better than Trump does in general-election matchups with Biden.
Also consider: Trump’s favorable rating is currently better than it has been at any point since he left office and higher than it was for most of his presidency (averaging 43 percent). One way to look at it is that he’s becoming more popular; another way is that he could be at an unsustainable high point.
The legal and political calendars are shaping up so Republicans could be designating Trump with virtually no clue about how his legal issues will shake out. And that means one of the biggest X-factors in modern presidential politics will loom.
There is little question that Trump’s indictments helped him in the primaries — and that the vast majority of Trump voters would stick with him even if convicted. But the legal issues could still hurt him significantly in the general election.
Of particular note: Polls have shown that a criminal conviction would reduce Trump’s general-election margins by between 5 and 14 points. Even if the swings aren’t that big, this could be decisive, given how close our elections typically are.
It’s also important to note that, while political watchers might be familiar with the details of Trump’s indictments, many voters are not.
Large quantities and even majorities of Trump backers say they believe Trump didn’t take classified documents to Mar-a-Lago (he did) and that he didn’t try to overturn the 2020 election (he did, allegedly illegally). About 6 in 10 independent voters said they had heard only “a little” or “nothing at all” about Trump’s indictments, October polling showed.
That’s a lot of voters who don’t seem to have internalized Trump’s conduct but could by the time November comes.
Trump has never made it easy to stand in his corner. However you feel about him, there’s no question that he creates unnecessary problems for himself (see: taking the classified documents), which he often needlessly provokes, and that his off-the-cuff style can go very wrong.
Lately, Trump has made clear how unwieldy he could be over the next nine-plus months:
All of this is from the past week alone, and there’s a compelling case to be made that Americans aren’t terribly familiar with it.
As the Atlantic’s McKay Coppins wrote recently: “These days, Trump exists in many Americans’ minds as a hazy silhouette — formed by preconceived notions and outdated impressions — rather than as an actual person who’s telling the country every day who he is and what he plans to do with a second term.”
That is a luxury of a man who hasn’t had to run a full-fledged campaign for a second term yet. It is not a luxury he is likely to benefit from come November."
JXDH5JYWHA_FR2I6TJKOSDZW0B,Republicans struggle to hold together Ukraine-for-border deal,Liz Goodwin,"January 25, 2024 at 11:24 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/ukraine-funding-border-deal-trump/,"Senate Republicans struggled to hold together support for a bipartisan border-for-Ukraine deal on Thursday as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately acknowledged former president Donald Trump’s opposition to the deal has complicated its future.
Republicans demanded stringent border policy changes to pass $60 billion in Ukraine aid requested by the White House last year, and a small group of Senate negotiators are closing in on a deal that Trump has publicly slammed and that some Republicans have argued could hurt Trump’s reelection chances by removing a potent campaign issue. A significant number of Republican senators have begun to speak out against the border security deal before its details have been released and even as they continue to raise alarm bells about the migrant crisis at the border.
In a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon, McConnell, who is pushing for Ukraine funding and reluctantly agreed to tie the foreign aid to border security, acknowledged that the politics have changed for passing a border deal given Trump’s opposition as he moves toward clinching the Republican presidential nomination, according to two people familiar with his comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.
The remarks, first reported by Punchbowl News, caused confusion among some in his conference and caused McConnell to clarify on Thursday in another closed-door meeting, saying he had been misinterpreted. “I am ... personally fully engaged in both the border and getting Ukraine and Israel [funding] together on this,” McConnell said, according to Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who attended the gathering.
The border deal, which negotiators say may be released as soon as next week, is focused on making it harder for migrants to seek asylum, changes to the use of parole for migrants, and a mechanism to effectively close down the border on days when crossings were particularly high. The overall aid package requested by President Biden includes $106 billion in military assistance for Israel, Ukraine and Indo-Pacific nations as well as humanitarian aid and U.S. border funds.
“This is a unique moment,” said Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), a lead negotiator. “And I think we should take it.”
Several McConnell allies said Thursday that the leader was not casting doubt on the deal, but was rather acknowledging the daunting political reality of the task as Trump, who wants to run on a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, looks poised to lock up the nomination.
“What is currently being worked on in the Senate will be meaningless in terms of Border Security and Closure,” Trump said in a statement Thursday evening, adding that the “ONLY HOPE” for a secure border is voting for him.
“What [McConnell] was talking about was what he saw as sort of the political challenges of moving forward,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said. “He wasn’t waving the white flag on border security at all.”
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), the lead GOP negotiator, said Thursday that he thinks McConnell was not “undermining” his work at all. But Lankford also acknowledged the problem of some Republicans seeing a deal as bad for Trump’s political future, given polling suggests immigration is one of Biden’s top political liabilities.
“There are some people that oppose the bill, based on the presidential politics issue, rather than the crisis that’s actually occurring at the border,” Lankford said.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally and a negotiator of the deal, has argued in recent days that a border deal would not affect the presidential election — a sign that Senate Republicans are attempting to publicly convince the president not to kill the deal. Republicans have also argued that this border deal would empower Trump if he were elected to reduce migration.
Negotiators said the next few days would be critical for the future of the package.
“I think the Republican conference is going to make a decision in the next 24 hours as to whether they actually want to get something done or whether they want to leave the border a mess for political reasons,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the lead Democratic negotiator. “If Republicans blow this up, Vladimir Putin will win the war and Europe will be at risk.”
GOP leaders have said they want the eventual bill to attract at least half of the Republican conference, in order for it to have a greater chance of passing the GOP-controlled House, whose leaders have expressed strong skepticism of any border deal or Ukraine aid. (House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said on Fox News recently that Trump was “extremely adamant” that the deal should be rejected.) But Republican defections have been mounting, making that number harder to reach.
“We’ve spent four months negotiating a border deal, plane’s not yet landed,” said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.). “Don’t know if the plane ever will land, but time’s not on our side and I’ve just seen support in the Republican Senate for a border deal deteriorate.”
Near the end of the Republican meeting Wednesday evening, McConnell stood to address the conference and laid out the choices facing it, the people familiar with his remarks said. McConnell said the politics have shifted now that Trump — whom McConnell called “the nominee” after his win in the New Hampshire primary — wants to campaign on the issue of a broken border, and that McConnell doesn’t want to undercut his campaign. McConnell also read out loud a statement from then-President Trump in which he said the law on the border needs to change, they said.
McConnell noted that this is the first border negotiation that did not include Democratic demands of a path to legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants, and he warned that a border-only deal has an expiration date, according to a senior GOP aide. Should Trump win the White House, Democrats would demand immigration reform in exchange for border security.
McConnell’s comments came during a meeting on the subject of funding Ukraine as it continues to fend off a Russian invasion — a top priority for McConnell even as it has become unpopular among Republican voters. Several GOP senators have argued against continuing to send U.S. aid to the embattled country, while McConnell has made the case in near-daily floor speeches of the necessity of stopping Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Everybody’s got the same opinion of Vladimir Putin, he’s a thug,” said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) about the tone of Wednesday’s meeting. “He’s invaded a country. It’s a question for many of whether that’s going to have to be a settled issue, negotiated, or if you keep spending money, whether it’s going to end up in any type of result.”
The White House has said it cannot send more security assistance to Ukraine without funding from Congress, and the administration has painted a bleak picture of Ukraine’s chances of continuing to fend off the Russian invasion without additional arms.
The debate in the Senate also comes as Trump called on states to deploy National Guard troops to Texas, saying, “All Americans should support the commonsense measures by Texas authorities,” after the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in a case that cleared the way for the removal of razor wire Texas had installed along high-traffic areas of the border.
“I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn’t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is really appalling,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters Thursday.

K3SMWR23QI_IC2IA2BQDJ3DJE9,U.S. envoy discusses possible new Israel-Hamas hostage deal in Qatar,Karen DeYoung,"January 24, 2024 at 4:49 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/israel-hamas-hostages-gaza-ceasefire/,"The top U.S. mediator for the Middle East is traveling the region to encourage discussions on the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, but U.S. officials emphasized Wednesday that there was little progress to report.
Brett McGurk, the top National Security Council official on the Middle East, was in Qatar on Wednesday amid renewed hope for a breakthrough on hostages and a pause in the fighting in Gaza. The combat there has been particularly fierce this week as Israeli forces have encircled the southern city of Khan Younis, where they believe top Hamas commanders are located.
Humanitarian organizations have reported that thousands of civilians are trapped in the city, many in the hospitals.
“We certainly want to see another humanitarian pause put in place,” NSC spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday.  “How close we are to that, what parameters are going to look like … that’s all part of the discussions right now.”
The day before, Kirby cautioned that the conversations were still at an early stage. McGurk planned also to assess the Israel Defense Forces’ operations and the protection of civilian life, Kirby said.
Israeli hostage families have ‘nothing left to lose’ in push for new deal
Qatar, meanwhile, responded angrily Wednesday to an alleged recording of Benjamin Netanyahu leaked to Israeli media, in which the Israeli prime minister appears to tell the family members of hostages that Qatari leaders had failed to use their leverage with Hamas to secure their release.
“I don’t thank Qatar” for its efforts, a voice that appears to be Netanyahu’s says in the recording, purportedly of his meeting with family members this week, that was broadcast Tuesday night by Israel’s Channel 12. The voice says Qatar is worse than the United Nations and the Red Cross, which Israel has accused of being sympathetic to Hamas.
Qatari spokesman Majed al-Ansari said Wednesday his government was “appalled” by the remarks, which he called “irresponsible and destructive” but “not surprising.”
If the comments were “found to be true,” Ansari said, “the Israeli PM would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives.”
The voice that appears to be Netanyahu’s also expresses outrage at the United States for its recent agreement to extend its use of Al Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle East, for 10 more years. “I’ve been very angry recently and I didn’t hide it from the Americans,” the voice says.
A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about private discussions, said they could not confirm that Netanyahu had expressed anger over the Al Udeid lease.
Israel has offered a two-month pause in its war to eradicate Hamas in exchange for a phased release of the remaining hostages, according to an Israeli familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue. The deal was first reported by the news website Axios.
“There’s a long way to go before reaching any agreements,” one person wrote in a text between Israeli officials that was shown to The Washington Post. “Israel is offering various terms for the return of the hostages, with a pause in fighting seen as a given. … But in no way will Israel give up on destroying Hamas, the return of the hostages.”
Thousands of Hamas-led fighters streamed out of Gaza on Oct. 7 to kill more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, in Israeli communities near the enclave and take another 240 hostage, Israeli officials have said.
After the release in November of more than 100 hostages in exchange for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, and the deaths of several hostages in Gaza, it’s believed that 100 living Israelis are still being held in the enclave.
A future release would begin with the remaining civilian women and children, followed by civilian men, military women, military men and finally the bodies of those who have died.
Those phases were first discussed in late November, when a week-long pause in the fighting led to the release of more than 100 women, children and foreign hostages. The U.S. expectation at the time was that the pause would be continued through the phased release of all the hostages.
Kirby said conversations surrounding another potential hostage deal “are very sober and serious. … Hopefully they will bear fruit.”
What they missed: Freed Israeli hostages return to tragedy and joys
Israel has not commented publicly on the reports. Hard-right cabinet members, a key base for Netanyahu’s coalition, expressed misgivings Wednesday over talk of a deal.
“Stopping the war at such sensitive timing could endanger the entire operation and bring about huge costs in the Gaza Strip and other fronts,” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said. “At this point, we cannot support stopping the war for a long time.”
National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said he supports bringing home the hostages but opposes a “bad deal.”
Hamas has said it will not release more hostages unless its conditions for an end to hostilities are met. Israel has said it will not withdraw or end the fighting until Hamas’s leadership and military infrastructure are destroyed.
Al-Ansari said Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, had “presented ideas to both sides” and was “getting a constant stream of replies from both sides.”
“That in its own right is a cause for optimism,” he said. But “when one side says they don’t accept the two-state solution, that they would not stop this war eventually, talking about the displacement of the Palestinians, that obviously leads to a harder mediation process,” he said, in apparent reference to Netanyahu.
Netanyahu’s government is under increasing pressure from family members of hostages to bring the captives home. A large majority of countries in the world have called for a humanitarian cease-fire, rather than a temporary pause, and demanded that Israel facilitate increased aid to civilians in Gaza.
What’s the difference between a humanitarian pause and a cease-fire?
The United States has repeatedly said it does not currently support a general cease-fire, and Kirby said Tuesday that Washington would back a humanitarian pause lasting a month or even longer.
“If that would give us the opportunity to get hostages out and get more aid in,” he said, “we would absolutely support a humanitarian pause of a longer length than the week that we were able to accomplish.”
Relief agencies expressed alarm at the intensified fighting in Khan Younis, particularly around Nasser Hospital, where Doctors Without Borders said “thousands” of people, including 850 patients, were trapped.
Many were unable to follow Israeli directions to evacuate the hospital because roads to and from the hospital were inaccessible or too dangerous, the organization said Tuesday on social media.
Nasser is one of two hospitals in southern Gaza still equipped to treat the critically wounded, the organization said. A day earlier, Israel ordered the evacuation of more than 500,000 people in Khan Younis, the U.N. humanitarian affairs office said, from an area that included three hospitals.
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that al-Kheir Hospital, a hospital of around 30 beds in Khan Younis run by nongovernmental organizations, was suffering “military incursions” and several health workers were detained.
Nine displaced people were killed and 75 were injured after tank shells struck a shelter in Khan Younis operated by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and ignited a fire there, an official said Wednesday.
Thomas White, the director of agency affairs, said two tank rounds hit a building that shelters 800 people. The compound holds thousands, he said.
“Buildings ablaze and mass casualties,” he wrote on social media. “People are trapped.”
White said agency staff had been unable to access the center for two days. It’s in an area on which Israeli forces are advancing after having previously directed Gazans to flee there for their safety.
U.N. teams were trying to reach the center, White said, but found the “agreed upon route with Israeli Army blocked with earth bank.”
The IDF did not respond in detail to questions about the strike on the shelter. It said in a statement that a “combat team is located around [Khan Younis], in the western part, and have begun to operate within it.”
The IDF accused Hamas of having “command and control centers, Hamas outposts and Hamas security headquarters” in the area. It also acknowledged that it’s “a dense area and an area that consists of civilians” as well as shelters and hospitals.
“It is a place that requires very specific methods of action and precise operations,” the IDF said. “This operation will continue for several days until we maximize the achievements: dismantling Hamas’ military framework and Hamas strongholds.”
The U.N. agency operates 154 shelters in Gaza, housing and providing aid to many of Gaza’s 1.7 million displaced people. Since Oct. 7, it has reported 249 incidents affecting its shelters and premises. It estimates that at least 341 displaced people in its shelters have been killed since the beginning of the war.

The ICJ will rule Friday on South Africa’s request that the court order Israel to suspend its military campaign. The court will not be ruling on whether Israel has committed genocide — a verdict that could take years.
Israel has stepped up its assault on Hamas in recent days as Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

K54GKNBEQ4_3AI5HGMFKL5TFRQ,Parents threaten to boycott baby clothing company that fired NICU mom,Maham Javaid,"January 23, 2024 at 10:32 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/23/kyte-baby-marissa-hughes-nicu-adoptive/,"One TikTok video shows a Kyte Baby outfit printed with animals being thrown out the front door of a house, into a yard full of snow, to the background score of ’N Sync’s “Bye Bye Bye.”
Another shows a new mom cradling two prematurely born babies, with a message on-screen: “One reason why I’ll never purchase from Kyte Baby again.”
The popular Texas-based company, which makes infant clothing from bamboo it touts as cooling and breathable, is under fire from customers after denying an employee’s request to work remotely while tending to her newly adopted, prematurely born baby. Company founder Ying Liu has twice apologized for what she called a “terrible mistake.”
But the outrage and threats of boycott continue.
While Kyte Baby’s actions appear to have been legal, its handling of the employee’s request seems to have hit a nerve with its customer base of parents — including some with preemies of their own. The company also portrays itself as family friendly, with its website declaring, “We’re parents too.”
The controversy began when the story of Marissa Hughes, a photo studio employee at Kyte Baby, spread online. According to a GoFundMe page started to support the costs of adoption, Hughes, 26, had a difficult journey to becoming a mother, including at least three miscarriages.
She and her husband ultimately decided to pursue adoption. A few days after Christmas, the couple received a call from an adoption agency about a baby born at 22 weeks in El Paso, about nine hours from their home near Dallas-Fort Worth.
“After extensive prayer and a lot of phone calls, we said yes to being his parents! We are so thrilled to have a son!” Hughes, who could not immediately be reached for comment, wrote on the GoFundMe page.
The baby, born weighing 1 pound, was required to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit, with a discharge date expected around March, the fundraiser page said. The couple said they were nervous about the baby’s “various health concerns” and meeting their financial needs.
Hughes, a seven-month employee of Kyte Baby, asked to work remotely to stay close to her baby at the NICU, according to accounts from Hughes’s sister and Liu, the company founder. But that request was denied.
Hughes told Today.com that her managers at first agreed to let her work remotely while her son was in the hospital, but as she was looking over the maternity leave paperwork, the company called and fired her.
Kyte Baby said in a statement that under its policies at the time, parents who had worked for the company between six and 12 months receive two weeks’ maternity time and must sign a contract saying they will return to their job for six months after the paid leave ends. Employees of more than a year receive four weeks’ paid maternity time and must sign the same contract.
While nine states and the District of Columbia mandate some degree of paid parental leave, federal law guarantees new parents just six weeks of unpaid time off, and not all workers qualify, as previously reported by The Washington Post.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act grants 12 weeks of bonding leave to parents, including adoptive or foster parents, after they’ve been with a company for 12 months. Hughes had not worked at Kyte Baby long enough to qualify.
“It was never my intention to quit — I was willing to work from the NICU!” Hughes told Today.com. “I did tell them, ‘This is a slap in the face … My child is fighting for his life.’”
As news of Hughes’s situation began to spread online last week, Liu posted an apology on Kyte Baby’s official TikTok account. She said in the Jan. 18 video she wanted to “apologize to Marissa for how her parental leave was communicated and handled in the midst of her incredible journey of adoption and starting a family.”
Liu added that Kyte Baby is a “family-oriented company” that treats “biological and nonbiological parents equally.” She said that she had been trying to reach Hughes to apologize to her directly.
Viewers dubbed the video “insincere,” leading Liu to post a second video admitting that the first video was scripted. “I memorized it. I basically just read it, it wasn’t sincere,” she said in her second video on the same day.
Liu described her refusal to grant Hughes’s request for remote work as a “terrible mistake.”
“I was the one that made the decision to veto her request to go remote while she has to stay in the NICU to take care of her adopted baby,” Liu said. “And when I think back, this was a terrible decision — I was insensitive, selfish and was only focused on the fact that her job had always been done on-site and I did not see the possibility of doing it remotely.”
The company said in its statement it would pay Hughes benefits and grant her the remote position that she requested, but she declined the offer.
As a result of her experience, Kyte Baby is now revising its maternity leave policy, “to give new parents, both biological and nonbiological, more time off and creating a better process to support our employees,” the company said in its statement.
“Kyte Baby needs to stand by their values of being a woman owned, family company,” the statement adds.
Hughes said in a video posted on social media that she’s “encouraged to hear that there will be some changes made for current and future employees of the company.”
“No company is perfect, but … I don’t think that’s a healthy work environment for me,” she told Today.com."

ABUTALEB: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I’m Yasmeen Abutaleb, a White House reporter here at The Washington Post.
Today I’m pleased to be joined by Ambassador Dennis Ross, a veteran diplomat--a veteran Middle East diplomat of multiple administrations. Today he’s here to join me to talk about the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Ambassador Ross, thank you so much for joining Washington Post Live.
MR. ROSS: Thank you. It’s good to be with you.
MS. ABUTALEB: So I want to start with some news of the day and where we're at right now. President Biden’s handling of the war has deeply divided the Democratic Party. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week personally criticized Biden on the issue of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution, despite unwavering U.S. support. Biden and his aides have repeatedly urged Israel to scale back its military campaign as the death toll surpasses 25,000. But earlier today, Israel struck a UN training center that reportedly caused mass casualties. Is the U.S. strategy working, and why or why not?
MR. ROSS: Well, clearly, the U.S. strategy to get the Israelis to do more in the area of humanitarian assistance may not be working to produce enough humanitarian assistance, but I think we also need to understand something. Within Israel itself, left to right, there is this belief that somehow Israel should be squeezing Gaza even more because Hamas's unwillingness to release the hostages, unwillingness to allow Red Cross access to them, unwillingness to provide medical assistance to them. So you actually had efforts today by Israelis to block efforts to provide convoys of trucks for assistance, because there is a sense that somehow if Hamas was squeezed more that way, that it would actually reduce the hostages.
The problem with that thinking is that Hamas holds the hostages, not the people, not the public within Gaza, but I mention it because the politics of this issue are really quite complicated in Israel. On the one hand, there is increasing pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to make it clear that the priority is actually to get the hostages out more than anything else. On the other hand, there is this perception that somehow allowing humanitarian assistance to go into Gaza is something that makes it easier for Hamas to hold the hostages.
So you have a reality where President Biden and his administration have basically succeeded in getting the Israelis to open Kerem Shalom, which is one of their crossing points, which they had been reluctant to do. He succeeded in getting them to provide humanitarian assistance over the opposition of the attitude of much of the public. He succeeded in creating some safe areas and humanitarian corridors. So, clearly, without the United States, I think they would be much less done with regard to humanitarian assistance. But in answer to what you said, does more need to be done, the answer is absolutely yes.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, I want to address the issue of the hostages because there were--there was reporting on Monday that Israel gave Hamas a proposal through Qatari and Egyptian mediators that would pause the fighting for two months in exchange for the release of all the remaining hostages.
This morning, it was reported that the two sides have agreed in principle that the exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners could occur over a month-long pause in fighting, but there's been no plan set in motion because Hamas has made clear it's holding out for a full cease-fire. And this seems to have been the sticking point over weeks of negotiations. So is there a way to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas on these negotiations, and do you think that a proposal should include a full cease-fire or some sort of pathway to one?
MR. ROSS: Look, I certainly believe that if you can get all the hostages out at this point, you should do that.
Now, the question of a cease-fire, the Israelis also proposed in what you were you're describing that the six leaders, the six military leaders of Hamas, meaning Yahya Sinwar, his brother, Marwan Issa, that these people should go into exile. Hamas rejected that, and the Israelis rejected the idea of ending the war.
I think the issue here is maybe a need for reframing it. I would like to see us and the Israelis put a premium on the idea of demilitarizing Gaza so that it cannot be remilitarized. In a context where you demilitarize Gaza--and the Israelis are clearly in the process of doing that--it seems to me that a cease-fire becomes more thinkable because a demilitarization with an international mechanism to ensure that material going into Gaza cannot be diverted, cannot be misused, you have monitoring it throughout its journey within Gaza to its end point, that will make it, I think, increasingly difficult for Hamas to resume control.
If you also tied the reconstruction to this guaranteed demilitarization and you make it clear that if Hamas is control, you're simply not going to get donors to invest, because there's a concern that Hamas will do this once again, and they're not going to invest if it's all going to be blown up.
So I think if we reframe the issue to focus on demilitarizing and ensuring a reconstruction, massive reconstruction for guaranteed demilitarization and no remilitarization, I think the idea of a cease-fire becomes more acceptable.
Earlier, I have to say, my concern had been if Hamas is able to regain control, it will reconstitute itself. We know from all the resources they invested in their tunnels and their military industrial base, which are huge--at least 25,000 tons of cement is just one example for the tunnels--that all of that could have been used above ground, but they didn't use any of it for above ground. They used it, in fact, for their mission, which is basically to continue to fight a war against Israel, so having them reconstitute themselves is a prescription for seeing this happen again, even if it takes some time for that to happen again. But if the militarization becomes the objective and if it's tied to reconstruction and investment for guaranteed demilitarization and also Hamas not being in control, then I think you can begin to look to a pathway to a very different future for Gaza and, frankly, a different pathway for Israelis and Palestinians.
MS. ABUTALEB: I want to switch gears for just a moment to the strikes in Yemen that are happening right now, because I think those have raised some fears of escalation. So the United States and Britain have conducted ongoing airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen in response to repeated attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. So do you see a greater risk of escalation right now with the U.S. becoming more directly involved, and is there the risk of the U.S. becoming bogged down in another Middle East conflict?
MR. ROSS: I think the risk of escalation relates much more to Hezbollah in Israel just because the character of the weapons that would be involved if that was transformed from what it is now, which is a highly localized exchange of fire to something that would be an all-out war.
The Houthis right now create, obviously, a threat to international shipping, but their ability to do much more than that is, I would say, limited. What the U.S. and Britain, in particular, with the backing of a number of other nations, at least another 10 nations, is geared towards reducing the means that Houthis have to attack the shipping. It's entirely missile-and-air campaign on our part. It's geared towards, in many cases, hitting the Houthi launch sites before they can launch anti-ship missiles, hitting the radar so they're not in a position to be able to direct the fire, and the more the U.S. and the UK and others are eroding the Houthi capabilities, the more I think that you'll see shipping able to return to the Red Sea. If this is joined with active naval efforts to ensure that Houthis aren't resupplied with weapons, I think you can keep this under control.
In any case, it's not going to involve American ground forces. When we talk about being sucked into a Middle Eastern conflict, we obviously have images of Iraq and Afghanistan where you had large numbers of American forces on the ground. Nothing like that is going to happen with regard to Yemen. Nothing like that should happen with regard to Yemen. And the question is, at what point do the Houthis decide that the price they're paying in terms of losing their military wherewithal is enough for them to stop the attacks? My guess is because they're very defiant publicly, they will keep up the attacks, but we're already seeing the pace of those attacks, the character of those attacks, the numbers of missiles or drones involved, all that has dropped dramatically since the initial strikes that the U.S. and the UK have carried out. So I don't mean to minimize this because obviously there are big shipping companies that made a decision not to go through Red Sea, and traffic through the Suez canal connected to the Red Sea is down by about one-third. So I don't mean to minimize it, but I also think in terms of the threat of a much wider war in the Middle East, that's not really the locale that would trigger that.
MS. ABUTALEB: Ambassador Ross, you recently met with some of the families of the estimated more than 100 hostages who are still being held in Gaza. We had nearly 300 questions submitted for this program, and one of them is from Joel Silver in Maryland, who asks, what do you believe is the fastest and safest strategy to recover all the hostages held by Hamas and collaborators?
MR. ROSS: I do think the--there has to be a negotiated deal. They're not going to be freed by military action. I do think military action can create more of a squeeze on Yahya Sinwar and maybe give him a greater interest in a reprieve, but military action is not going to produce the release of the hostages. We're--I think this is 109th day, and while it's true there was one release, you still have 130 hostages. We don't know the exact number of those 130 that are still alive. We do know every day they're there, they're under greater risk.
And there's Gadi Eisenkot, who is a member of the war cabinet, former chief of staff with the Israeli military, has said your military answer is not the answer. So I do think the negotiation that is underway right now is important you have Brett McGurk from the White House who's out there talking to the Egyptians and probably also to the countries. I think the key here is to follow that path, and I do believe a deal is possible. Whether it's a deal that's going to resolve it once and for all, I don't know. But as I said earlier, I think it’s the focus becomes demilitarization of Gaza as opposed to the eradication of Hamas, which frankly was probably never achievable. Then I think that we could be looking at a different future, and I think it could be a vehicle for producing the hostages.
And you can understand--you know, I said when I spoke to a rally in Tel Aviv in favor of the hostages, their release, and to the families there, I said for the families, their life has been frozen since October 7th. They're every waking moment is preoccupied, not only with trying to get their family members released, but they're horrified by the conditions under which they're being held, and that in itself is a nightmare for them.
And the Israeli government failed in its first responsibility. Its first responsibility was to ensure there were no hostages taken. So having failed in that responsibility, it has an obligation to do everything it can to make sure that they get them released.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, I would like to turn for a moment to the conditions in Gaza, because that is obviously what is deeply dividing the Democratic Party, interrupting many of the president's events in recent days over his handling of the war. So Israel announced on Tuesday that after weeks of heavy fighting, IDF troops surrounded the city of Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza. Aid groups have said thousands of civilians are trapped in the region's hospitals and are struggling to flee, despite nearby areas being designated as a humanitarian zone. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has become catastrophic. Much of the population is at risk of starvation and disease.
Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland recently visited Egypt's Rafah border crossing with Gaza and said the Netanyahu government had erected, quote, “a variety of barriers to aid getting in.” Are these tactics by Israel in violation of international law, and is Israel doing enough, or what more can they be doing to protect innocent civilians and ensure that humanitarian aid is getting into the enclave?
MR. ROSS: You know, there's a profound dilemma here, because on the one hand, Hamas embeds itself in a way that exposes the civilian population, and they hold them not simply as shields but really as hostages. So, on the one hand, you have that, and you're facing that, and you're trying, at a minimum, as I was suggesting, to demilitarize Gaza and, in effect, to destroy the military infrastructure and wherewithal of Hamas. So if, on the one hand, you're not able to attack those targets because you have the reality of this civilian population, if you're not able to attack it, you're basically saying the Hamas tactics are okay and that they work.
On the other hand, there also has to be some balance here in terms of trying to limit the consequences for the civilian population, and I would say the area where the Israelis could absolutely do more is in the area of humanitarian assistance and removing any possible obstacles to that. I think more can be done.
There is an additional problem. It's there isn't really law and order in Gaza right now. A lot of the humanitarian assistance that's going in, either Hamas tries to divert it for itself, or you have people who aren't Hamas, but who have guns who go and they seize some of this. So there needs to be some kind of an approach, and maybe in the early going, at least in this period, Israelis need to be providing the security for these trucks that are going in. That's not something they've been doing. It is something that I would say has to at least be considered, and if not the Israelis, then they should be prepared to support someone else coming in to provide security for at least the distribution of the humanitarian assistance.
So I think, yes, look, this is a huge dilemma. I don't think there's any easy answer to it. For those who say find your--Israel shouldn't do anything, well, then you're basically saying it's okay for Hamas to use the tactics they do and to be in a position where basically they can come out of this and do it all over again. But for the Israelis to impose some of the restrictions that they do now basically increases the level of hardship, and I think that has to be reduced.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, the politics of Israel have changed quite considerably in the Democratic Party over the course of this conflict. So I'd love to get your thoughts on that. Last Friday, there were five additional Senate Democrats who signed on to a measure that would condition aid to Israel on its compliance with international law, which brings the total of co-sponsors for that measure to 18 Democrats. Earlier in the week, 11 Senators voted for a bill to examine potential human rights abuses by Israel and its military campaign. Do you think the administration should look to condition aid to Israel or exert more of the influence it has to try to get them aligned with the goals I think they've been stating for quite some time now?
MR. ROSS: I certainly think that there's more that we can do to get the Israelis to take some of the steps, even I was referring to. They have opened Kerem Shalom. More can go through Kerem Shalom. I understand it's a political problem with Israel because, as I said earlier, the perception of the Israeli public, that humanitarian assistance going in when nothing is changing with regard to the hostages creates, obviously, a profound impulse on the part of Israelis to say something more must be done, and one way to do it is to squeeze Gaza even more.
As I said earlier, I don't see that's going to be productive because, in the end, it's not the Palestinian public in Gaza that's holding the hostages. It's Hamas, and Hamas clearly doesn't seem to be bothered by the suffering of the Palestinian public. So I think there does have to be more that is done to get the Israelis to do more, and that's a function, I think, of what the president himself can say publicly.
This president has created a remarkable bond with the Israeli public, and I think his words are taken quite seriously. And I think there is some cost to Prime Minister Netanyahu when it looks like he's resisting President Biden. Biden is perceived by the Israeli public as getting the Israeli predicament, understanding that those who threaten Israel's very existence, and because of that, his whole point of view is shaped by ensuring that those kinds of threats to Israel, in fact, never materialize. So I do think there's more leverage that the administration and he personally has in terms of what he has to say.
I'm not in favor of conditioning assistance, because I think part of the psychology of what exists in Israel today is a sense that they can count on the United States, but if they come to conclude they can't count on the United States and they have to go it completely alone, then the sense is, okay, we're alone anyway, so there really shouldn't be any constraints on us. And I said there's a psychology that favors that. I do think there's a leverage of this president, the connections he's created is something that needs to be used and can be used more.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, I'd love to follow up on that, because the biggest point of contention emerging in the U.S.-Israel relationship right now seems to be this question of the day after in Gaza, the establishment of a Palestinian state. Of course, we talked a little bit at the beginning of the program about how Prime Minister Netanyahu has now publicly criticized Biden, who, as you said, has been his biggest defender over this question of the Palestinian state. Biden and his administration have been very clear that they--a two-state solution, a political horizon needs to follow the conflict, and Netanyahu has become much more defiant and rejecting that. And so I'm wondering, do you believe that the current war can end if Israel's governing coalition refuses to move forward on this issue of a Palestinian state, and what should Biden and the U.S. do, given Netanyahu's increasing defiance on this issue?
MR. ROSS: Look, it's a very important question. Actually, The Washington Post had a really interesting article today on the many leaders of the Israeli military are saying their strategy is being hampered by not having a day-after strategy, that this is, in the end, the use of the military tool is designed to shape a different circumstance. So the political reality can be different when this is over.
Part of the problem is that Prime Minister Netanyahu has a coalition that has extremist ministers like Smotrich and Ben Gavir in it, and they seem to be limiting some of what he's prepared to do. Now, at some point, there has to be a choice made. The reality is there. When I was in Israel and I was speaking to people there and we were talking about the day after and this issue of who controls--who, in a sense, could be administering Gaza, I outlined a series of choices. I said, well, your first choice is that you stay, and Israel has to be responsible for administering Gaza and managing the 2.3- to 2.4 million Palestinians there. And almost nobody, except the fringe, the far right in Israel, wants to do that. So that's not an option.
I said a second option is having regional or international presence forces administration to be responsible, but you're not going to get anybody from the region or even internationally to come in if Israel is still in Gaza or if Israel is reserving the right to go in and out militarily. No one else is going to come in. So that's not really an option if you feel you have to reserve the possibility of going in and out, if there are pockets of Hamas that are still a threat.
A third possibility is that, in effect, you allow the UN through UNRWA to administer Gaza, and the problem there is that Hamas has pretty much infiltrated a lot of UNRWA. So UNRWA managing Gaza becomes a vehicle for Hamas coming back.
A fourth option is, in effect, nobody administers Gaza, and you just simply have a vacuum and chaos. But that will create the equivalent of Somalia, and that means, at some point, you could have 4- or 500,000 people on the Israeli border clamoring to get in. So that's not an option, and it leads you back to the idea that you need a Palestinian administration.
Now, it can't be the Palestinian Authority today partly because they wouldn't come in today, but partly they're too weak. They are too corrupt in the eyes of their own public. You need to a reformed Palestinian Authority, and that means institution building, real reform, taking on corruption. We've seen it done before in 2007 after the PA and Fatah lost Gaza in a Hamas coup, and it lost a lot of credibility and legitimacy because of that. But it was also presiding over the West Bank that was completely lawless at the time. The Bush administration organized all the donors. They went to Mahmoud Abbas and basically said, “We will cut off assistance unless you appoint an empowered prime minister,” at that time was Salam Fayyad, and he came in, and he cleaned everything up. He reestablished law and order. He cleaned it up. So we saw a period of five years where that was the case. So it can be done. It needs to be done. A reformed PA in time would end up joining what I would call a kind of local administration that might involve housing businessmen for now. There's a civic structure that was created by the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. It continued to exist, bureaucrats numbering 30- to 40,000 managing issues like health, water, electricity. They could be working in a low-key way with Palestinian businessmen, with parts of the Palestinian Authority, and when the Palestinian Authority is reformed, it would resume that kind of responsibility for Gaza, and you would politically reunify Gaza and the West Bank, which if you're talking about a Palestinian state, you need that in any case.
Now, if you're talking about a Palestinian state, which I'm a longtime believer that because you have two national movements competing for the same space, you need two states for two peoples. Now, one of those states can't be a failed state. So it does have to be reformed. One of those states can't--in the case of the Palestinians, can't be--cannot be led by those like Hamas who reject the very idea of two states and reject Israel's existence.
So we should be continuing to emphasize that we are committed to a two-state outcome, but also, there are going to be requirements on both sides. On the Palestinian side, there will be requirements to demonstrate that this is a state that will be led by those who are prepared to coexist with Israel, and in Israel, there will have to be clearly a different coalition that is prepared to accept a Palestinian state and especially if there's a Palestinian Authority that's reforming itself act in a way that makes it easier for that Palestinian Authority to succeed in what it's doing.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, we have a couple minutes left. So I want to make sure I get to an audience question that is related to this part of the discussion. We have Jonathan Dworkin from Maryland who asks about Prime Minister Netanyahu. He asks, what are the prospects for actually holding new elections and replacing him? Are you concerned about him dragging the war on in ways that are counter to Israel's interests in order to stay in power?
MR. ROSS: Look, there's no question that there's going to be a political reckoning in Israel. October 7th was the worst day in Israel's history, and you're going to end up seeing resignations from the top military and intelligence people, at a certain point, probably not now, but not until either we see the war evolve in a further stage where Israel is largely out and it is going in and out, as I was suggesting before, or if there is some kind of cease-fire at some point, based on what I was suggesting was a kind of demilitarization, there will be resignations from this top military intelligence leadership. They will resign because they will say we bear responsibilities for October 7th. But they're also likely to say we were carrying out the policy of the government, so we shouldn't be the only ones to resign. I think that--when that moment happens--and this may not be the only scenario, but when that moment happens, it will produce an election.
So I do think at some point this year, we will see an Israeli election, and then Israelis will decide. October 7th will weigh very heavily in terms of what they decide.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, I think, is trying to position himself to say a Palestinian state will be a mortal threat to Israel. Most Israelis today, because they're still suffering from the trauma of October 7, most of them look at a Palestinian state and are fearful that Hamas or Hamas-like group will run it, and then they'll have a base from which to threaten Israel more profoundly.
So, again, I come back to the idea, I believe there needs to be a Palestinian state as part of a political horizon, but there is a requirement on the Palestinians also to make it very clear to demonstrate this Palestinian state is not going to be led by those who reject Israel's existence.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, we have about 30 seconds left, so I would love to get just some closing thoughts from you on what are the biggest changes you've seen to the region in all your years working on Middle East diplomacy.
MR. ROSS: Look, I would say that in all the years I worked, this is the grimmest moment in terms of the Israeli-Palestinian reality and behavior. Both sides, the Israelis and the Palestinians, now are suffering from a trauma. They're incapable of being aware of the other side's pain. They're preoccupied with their own. That may be understandable, but in such a context, the idea of peacemaking becomes that much harder.
That said, the fact that the Saudis still have an interest in normalizing with Israel, provided you have a two-state outcome, creates some real possibility for the region because it creates the possibility of a coalition of those countries who want to create a future for the Middle East that is more hopeful and array them against what Iran is doing. Iran, they talk about the axis of resistance. I refer to it as the axis of misery because every state that they have a connection with is either failing or failed.
MS. ABUTALEB: Well, Ambassador Ross, we have unfortunately run out of time, but thank you so much for joining Washington Post Live today.
MR. ROSS: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.
MS. ABUTALEB: And thank you for watching. For a list of our upcoming programs, please head over to WashingtonPostLive.com to register.

KBOPSWOF1X_SVSZ8L8TW32W8FU,Ex-Baltimore prosecutor Marilyn Mosby on trial for alleged mortgage fraud,Katie Mettler,"January 22, 2024 at 1:40 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/22/marilyn-mosby-fraud-trial-openings/,"Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore’s former top prosecutor who rose to national prominence for charging six city police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, was back in federal court Monday facing fraud charges related to mortgage documents for two vacation properties in Florida.
The jury trial — which began in the morning with opening statements in a U.S. District Court in Greenbelt — is the second Mosby has faced in recent months, both cases related to the way she purchased those second homes at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
On Monday, federal prosecutors told jurors that they will see evidence of seven false statements that Mosby made to two separate mortgage lending companies as she moved to secure funds to purchase one home in Kissimmee, Fla., just minutes from Disney World, and another in Longboat Key, Fla.
“The evidence will show that the defendant, a lawyer and a public servant, Baltimore’s top prosecutor, lied repeatedly,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Delaney said in court.
Federal prosecutors allege that Mosby failed to reveal on her mortgage applications that she had unpaid federal taxes or that in March 2020 the Internal Revenue Service had placed a $45,000 lien against all properties owned by her and her husband, Nicholas Mosby, who is president of the Baltimore City Council. (Marilyn Mosby filed for divorce in summer 2023).
Mosby also allegedly signed a “second home rider” on her Kissimmee property, prosecutors told the jury, which allowed her to obtain a lower mortgage rate and included a promise that the space would be primarily used by her as a second home. But a week before that, prosecutors allege, Mosby signed an agreement with a vacation property management company to rent the home — which had eight bedrooms, six bathrooms and a pool — which violated the terms of the second home rider.
During the purchase process for the Longboat Key property, the mortgage lender asked for a letter explaining her planned use for the home. In that letter, prosecutors told jurors, Mosby discussed the Kissimmee house and said she and her family had spent the last 70 days there — but prosecutors alleged that evidence would show she had actually been in Baltimore.
Additionally, prosecutors told jurors that, to secure the Longboat Key property, a gift letter submitted to the mortgage lender — signed by both Marilyn and Nicholas Mosby — claimed Marilyn Mosby had received a $5,000 gift from her husband. But in reality, prosecutors allege, that money originated from Marilyn Mosby’s account, was transferred to her husband’s account, then transferred back to her account.
Delaney said the government’s case will be based upon a “long list of false statements” made by Mosby. He also cautioned the jury against a potential argument they may hear from Mosby’s defense attorneys — shifting blame to her husband for the alleged misconduct.
“Nicholas Mosby is not on trial today,” Delaney said. “Marilyn Mosby is.”
A shift in accountability to her husband — and her mortgage lender and real estate agent — was at the core of Mosby’s defense, which was laid out by defense attorney Sedira Banan.
Banan told the jurors that these Florida homes were the first Mosby had ever purchased, saying the woman’s name was not even on the deed to the home she had long shared with her husband in Maryland. Mosby, her attorney argued, was a “novice” to the home-buying process who placed trust in her husband, who was responsible for the couple’s taxes, and licensed real estate experts.
“The key to this case is understanding the interplay of trust, human relationships, context and trying to do your best to navigate an unfamiliar world,” Banan told the jury.
She painted Mosby as a woman, wife and mother of two who had faced immense pressures and carried great responsibilities in her personal and professional life.
“People’s life stories are more complex than a job title, a salary, a degree,” Banan said.
She told the jury that Mosby is innocent.
“The information she supplied for the loan process was submitted in good faith,” Banan said. “It was submitted without criminal intent. She committed no crime. She is innocent.”
Banan told jurors that the government’s “lens has the wrong focus.”
In focusing on the wrong things, Banan continued, prosecutors “will repeat the same mistakes that brought us here today. They will ask you to see crimes where there are none.”
In November, Mosby was convicted of two counts of perjury after she was charged with lying about her finances to withdraw $90,000 from her city retirement account to buy the two Florida homes. Prosecutors argued that Mosby accessed the money through a Cares Act program designed to help people struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. Mosby falsely claimed that she was experiencing financial hardships, prosecutors said.
In that case, as in the one playing out in Greenbelt now, Mosby denied wrongdoing, saying she didn’t defraud anyone.
As with her case in November, her trial was moved from Baltimore to Greenbelt after her lawyer argued that a jury in the city where Mosby was a controversial prosecutor would not be fair. Mosby became well-known for charging city officers in the 2015 death of Gray, who died one week after being arrested by police following a foot chase in his neighborhood. Mosby drew acclaim by those who said the charges levied were important to holding police accountable, but she was also criticized for prosecutorial overreach when her office failed to convict any of the six.
Mosby served two terms as Baltimore City state’s attorney before she lost the Democratic primary in July 2022.

KEP9RXZHV8_H06D738ZOAVR55C,Kenyan court blocks police deployment to crisis-racked Haiti,Widlore Mérancourt,"January 26, 2024 at 10:58 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/kenya-haiti-police-deployment-unconstitutional/,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — A Kenyan court on Friday blocked the deployment of some 1,000 police officers to Haiti, putting at risk the future of a multinational security force to break the stranglehold of armed gangs that have taken over vast swaths of the Haitian capital.
The U.N. Security Council approved the force in October, a year after Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry appealed for international intervention. Kenya last year offered to lead the mission after several other countries, including Canada and the United States, declined.
But on Friday, Kenyan High Court Judge Chacha Mwita said such a mission would be illegal, in part because the Kenyan national security council does not have a mandate to deploy police officers outside Kenya.
“Any decision by any state organ or state officer to deploy police officers to Haiti … contravenes the constitution and the law, and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid,” Mwita said.
U.N. authorizes Kenya-led force for Haiti; key questions remain
Isaac Mwaura, a spokesman for the Kenyan government, said it plans to appeal the ruling. Jean Junior Joseph, a spokesman for Henry, said the prime minister is continuing “diplomatic efforts with the support of the international community.”
Jean Eddy Saint Fort has lived in Port-au-Prince since 2001. He said he has never seen the violence this bad and viewed the potential deployment of a Kenya-led force as a chance for residents to “catch a breath.”
“It’s extremely bad news for us,” said Saint Fort, 41.
The mission’s purpose is to support the Haitian police — outmatched by the gangs that have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021 — and to restore order so the country can hold elections.
But pulling together a force has been difficult, and Friday’s decision raises questions about the viability of a mission if Kenya can’t take the lead. Several Caribbean nations promised to contribute hundreds of troops or police officers, but other countries have been reluctant to participate.
The United States, which backed Henry’s plea for assistance but ruled out leading a force, pledged at least $200 million to the mission, half contingent on congressional approval. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The United Nations this month reported nearly 4,800 killings in Haiti last year, up 119 percent from 2022. It recorded 2,490 kidnappings in 2023, up 83 percent from the previous year. Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, told reporters Friday that the need for the mission “remains extremely high.”
Henry’s plea for international aid drew a mixed reaction in Haiti, in part because past international interventions have failed to bring long-lasting stability. Some also fear an international mission will serve to prop up Henry, who is deeply unpopular. But others view it as the only option to restore order.
He was sentenced to a year in prison. He had been held more than nine.
In the southern city of Jérémie, Anne Shesca Alexis lamented that a gang blockade of the main road leading from the capital to the south had made goods more expensive. Anti-government protests, meanwhile, have kept her two children out of school.
“I’m for the intervention,” Alexis said, “but not under the government of Ariel Henry, which is profoundly incompetent and not caring for the well-being of the population.”
Stephane Marc, a driver in Port-au-Prince, said the court decision left him “shocked.” He said he rarely leaves home because of the gang violence, and that his neighborhood had been hoping for the deployment of a police force.
“Bandits are killing people left and right, and the state is doing nothing,” Marc said."
KNANB26K8E_GHJPDWKXCHUQQDU,Haley presses on against Trump on the trail. Her fight is a lonely one.,Dylan Wells,"January 25, 2024 at 4:39 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/01/25/haley-trump-republican-presidential-race/,"NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Nikki Haley returned to the campaign trail in her home state and swiftly unfurled an arsenal of attacks against Donald Trump. She accused him of throwing a “temper tantrum” in his victory speech, attacked his acuity and reprised her challenge to debate him. “Bring it, Donald, show me what you got,” Haley said. The crowd cheered.
But beyond the walls of the convention center ballroom where she spoke, a very different attitude was evident.
Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said she didn’t see “the math and the path going forward” for Haley after former president Trump scored a second straight early-state win this week in New Hampshire. Trump scooped up new support from congressional Republicans, including some former skeptics who saw the GOP race as all but over. And the Trump campaign released a list of his 158 endorsements in South Carolina — which Haley calls her “sweet home state,” despite polls showing her trailing by a wide margin against Trump.
The events and developments on Wednesday brought into focus Haley’s new reality as she continues on in a Republican presidential contest most of her party believes isn’t much of one at all. Outside of Haley’s most loyal supporters, Republicans are coalescing around Trump and have rejected attacks against him. Some have come to view her candidacy as merely a speed bump on Trump’s path to the nomination.
After losing by about 11 points in New Hampshire — which had been seen as her most promising early state — Haley returned home to South Carolina, where she previously defied expectations to win a seat in the legislature and then the governorship. Haley released two ads in South Carolina on Thursday and announced a schedule of weekend rallies.
But it was a difficult homecoming, since Trump has the backing of South Carolina’s top leaders — including the governor, both U.S. senators (including one Haley appointed) and members of Congress (including one Haley helped save from a Trump-backed primary challenger).
“The entire party needs to coalesce around Donald Trump TODAY,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) wrote Thursday on X, formerly Twitter.
But at her first event in the state since last year, Haley projected confidence, and attendees were upbeat about her showing in New Hampshire. Supporters wore handmade pro-Haley T-shirts and brought a banner reading “SC Proud of Nikki Haley.” They rose in a standing ovation when she was introduced and did not sit back down the entire speech.
As Trump and his allies aim to officially wrap up the nomination quickly, the former president said in a social media post that anyone who donates to Haley will be “barred from the MAGA camp,” which Haley turned into a fundraising pitch of her own.
Haley sought to portray her New Hampshire finish as a win despite Trump’s decisive victory, announcing that the campaign had raised $1 million since her speech in Concord on Tuesday night.
And she directed sharp attacks against her rival.
“He was insulting. He was doing what he does. But I know that’s what he does when he’s insecure. I know that’s what he does when he is threatened. And he should feel threatened without a doubt,” she said of his victory speech in New Hampshire, which he started with a series of attacks against Haley.
Haley reiterated that she will stay in the race, arguing that “a presidential candidate has to get 1,215 delegates. Donald Trump has 32 and I have 17. So we are not going to sit there and just give up.”
She continued to question his mental competence, pointing to a recent speech in which he appeared to confuse her and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying, “I think he was a bit confused.”
Alejandro Otman, an independent who attended Haley’s event, said he believes the members of Congress are only backing Trump because they want to keep their jobs.
Otman, who did not vote for Trump or President Biden in the last election, said he is optimistic about Haley’s chances because “Trump can go up, or he can go down very quickly,” alluding to both potential legal or health challenges.
Suzanne Brekke, a Haley supporter from Moncks Corner, said she’s disappointed to see the state’s leadership lining up to endorse Trump. Brekke, 69, said she is a registered Republican who did not vote in 2016 and voted for Biden in 2020 because of her dislike of Trump. She wishes Haley would go even harder after the former president, framing her campaign as the last, best shot at stopping him.
“Trump is like a cancer. I’m really and truly afraid that nobody can get him, but she is our best hope,” Brekke said.
Trump and Biden won their respective New Hampshire primary elections. Here are the results, biggest takeaways and what exit polls showed.

Who is running? The top contenders for the GOP 2024 nomination are former president Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley after Florida Gov.

KQAMY46I8Y_5WYP6TRXMPKMEPL,Trump attorneys accuse Fani Willis of trying to ‘foment racial bias’,Amy Gardner,"January 25, 2024 at 2:13 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/25/trump-fani-willis-racial-bias-georgia-election/,"Lawyers defending former president Donald Trump in the Georgia election interference case on Thursday accused Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D) of making racially charged accusations against the defendants that could prejudice a future jury and asked a judge to disqualify her and dismiss the case.
The motion from lawyers Steve Sadow and Jennifer Little, filed in Fulton County Superior Court, comes more than two weeks after Trump’s co-defendant Mike Roman alleged in a court filing that Willis appointed Nathan Wade to serve as lead prosecutor in the case — and subsequently paid him more than $650,000 in hourly fees — while engaging in a romantic relationship with him.
Roman requested that Willis and Wade be disqualified from the case and that all charges against him be dropped. Nearly a week later, Willis offered her only public comments on the controversy to date in a 35-minute speech before the congregation at the Big Bethel AME Church, during which she broadly accused her critics of attacking her and Wade because they are Black. In her remarks at the historically Black church, framed as a talk with God to commemorate the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday, Willis questioned why Wade was targeted and not the two other private attorneys appointed as special prosecutors in the case, who are White. She did not mention Roman or any other defendants by name.
Willis’s comments, Trump’s lawyers wrote, “constitute a glaring, flagrant, and calculated effort to foment racial bias into this case by publicly denouncing the defendants for somehow daring to question her decision to hire a Black man (without also mentioning that she is alleged to have had a workplace affair with the same man) to be a special prosecutor. These assertions by the DA engender a great likelihood of substantial prejudice towards the defendants in the eyes of the public in general, and prospective jurors in Fulton County in particular.”
They also wrote that Willis’s remarks amount to a violation of Georgia’s rules of professional conduct, which state that the prosecutor in a criminal case shall “refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.” They noted that the maximum penalty for such a violation is disbarment.
They asked that Willis’s entire office be disqualified from the case and that the entire indictment be dismissed. A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to comment.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case, has scheduled a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing on the accusations. Regardless of what he decides to do, the controversy has already upended the case.
The allegations against the prosecutors threaten to undermine public confidence in Willis’s prosecution of Trump and have inflamed grievances among those who believe that Trump has been unfairly targeted by partisan prosecutors and courts. Those who want Trump held accountable for his effort to reverse his 2020 defeat are scrambling to protect the case, but even in that camp, critics are emerging with deep concerns about the allegations.
Trump — who is accused of criminally conspiring to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia — has seized on the allegations against the prosecutors and is not likely to ease off his attacks. The former president has referred to Willis and Wade as “the lovebirds.” On Friday, after the release of Wade’s credit card statements showing he paid for airplane tickets for Willis, the former president accused the prosecutors of targeting him “to ENRICH themselves, and to live the Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous.” The scandal has dominated coverage on conservative-leaning media outlets.
State and local lawmakers are under increasing pressure to investigate the allegations themselves. On Thursday, state lawmakers in Atlanta were scheduled to take up a resolution to launch an investigation into Willis’s actions with a special new committee. Also Thursday, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed a complaint with the State Ethics Commission seeking a probe. Willis directly attacked Greene in her church speech.
A member of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners has indicated plans to investigate the potential misuse of county funds. On Wednesday, several speakers during the public comment session of a board meeting appeared to target Willis — including a White woman who wore sunglasses and a black bob wig and pulled a foot-long hot dog out of a package emblazoned with a hand-drawn logo similar to Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. “Nathan! Nathan! I can’t be without my Nathan!” she declared.
And more digging into Willis’s past is already underway. Last week, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon circulated a 2020 video of Willis saying she would fire any employee who sleeps with a co-worker and promising not to date people “that work under me.”
On Friday, records emerged in Wade’s divorce case showing he paid for at least two airline tickets for Willis to California and Aruba since he was hired in November 2021 to lead the Trump prosecution. It is unknown whether Willis paid him back. Wade is scheduled to testify in the divorce case next Wednesday.
McAfee, the judge overseeing the election interference case, has ordered Willis to respond to Roman’s claims in writing by Feb. 2. Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for Roman, has indicated she plans to issue subpoenas for witnesses and documents to back up her client’s claims.
The subpoenas are expected to be filed in coming days. Willis, Wade and other staff at the district attorney’s office are among those likely to receive summons for the Feb. 15 hearing, as well as Wade’s current and former law partners, according to a person familiar with the subpoenas, who declined to be named because the documents are not yet public.
Willis has also been subpoenaed to testify in Wade’s divorce case, but the judge in that Cobb County case stayed that request until after Wade’s planned testimony.
The latest: Four of Trump’s co-defendants have pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case. Trump previously entered a plea of not guilty. The Washington Post published details of recorded statements given to prosecutors by the co-defendants who accepted plea deals in the case, offering previously undisclosed information about the effort by Trump and his allies to reverse his defeat.
The charges: Trump was charged with 13 counts, including violating the state’s racketeering act. Read the full text of the Georgia indictment. Here’s a breakdown of the charges against Trump and a list of everyone else who was charged in the Georgia case. Trump now faces 91 total charges in four criminal cases.

KWXDBGMT01_Z409PMW48WFT9PM,Why Jan. 6 insurrectionists sent a letter to the Folger Shakespeare Library,Meena Venkataramanan,"January 22, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/22/folger-shakespeare-library-january-6/,"While insurrectionists were plotting to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they took time to write and send a letter to an institution two blocks from their target: the Folger Shakespeare Library, the world’s largest collection of material related to the English playwright.
“We will be blocking access to your building … to prevent our persons of grievance from using you as a loophole,” read the insurrectionists’ letter, which circulated on a pro-Trump message board called TheDonald before the insurrection and was published this month in the Folger’s online archive.
The letter explained that the insurrectionists would create a 2.4-mile blockade “surrounding all buildings to which the U.S. Capitol has underground tunnels to” — including the John Adams Building of the Library of Congress, with which the Folger shares a block — presumably to prevent those inside the Capitol from escaping through the buildings.
“This is nothing personal to the library itself,” the letter continued. “We have no intention of damaging, trespassing, or otherwise altering your facility in any way...We sincerely apologize in advance to any inconvenience this may cause you … we are simply citizens practicing our 1st amendment rights and are only involving you by happenstance.”
The letter was postmarked Dec. 29, 2020, and mailed from Minnesota. But the Folger didn’t receive it until almost two weeks after the insurrection, said Melanie Bender Martin, a spokesperson for the library. The letter is now in the library’s digital archive and will soon be made accessible to the public in the physical archive.
Trump disqualified for insurrection? Under 14th Amendment, it’s happened before.
“As a library, we felt we had a duty to preserve the letter and make it available for future generations to reference,” Martin said. The Folger, with the exception of its theater, is currently closed for renovations, but when it reopens in June, Martin said, any member of the public will be able to make an appointment to view the letter in the building’s reading room.
It appears the Folger was singled out by the letter writers. Bill Ryan, communications director for the Library of Congress, told The Washington Post, “We have no record of having received a letter of this kind.”
It might seem odd that the insurrectionists sent the letter to an institution that memorializes Shakespeare. But the Bard’s relationship to white nationalism — and specifically to a white American identity — has been long documented by scholars, including those who have drawn comparisons between the playwright’s works and the Jan. 6 insurrection.
In particular, white nationalists have invoked the play ‘Julius Caesar’ to “emblematize America’s white Shakespearean-Roman inheritance,” Shakespeare scholar Arthur L. Little Jr., an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the introduction of a 2023 book he edited called “White People in Shakespeare.”
‘Juliet and Romeo’: Newly unearthed text suggests how Milton might have edited Shakespeare
The Shakespearean tragedy follows the assassination of Julius Caesar, the ancient Roman dictator, by a group of conspirators who believed themselves to be guardians of democracy and feared Caesar was gaining too much power. The Jan. 6 insurrectionists — many of whom were neo-Nazis and white supremacists — claimed they were saving American democracy from election fraud by storming the Capitol.
“While it’s quite likely very few if any of those assembled at the Capitol on that day thought of Shakespeare or theatre … resonances of a white Shakespeare haunted the insurrection,” wrote Little. “Emulating Shakespeare’s ‘fierce fiery warriors’, the January-sixth insurrectionists, too, wanted to do more than imagine ‘drizzled blood upon the Capitol’: five people died and some one hundred and fifty were injured. It was white people’s Shakespearean theatre on a grand scale.”
The letter sent to the Folger suggests that some insurrectionists actually did think of Shakespeare leading up to the event. “I have drafted this short letter to the Folger Shakespeare Library as it will be within our perimeter and they have nothing to do with our protest or the theft of the election,” wrote a user named Minn2000 on TheDonald. The letter was signed anonymously by “#Stopthesteal protest participants.”
But Shakespeare’s relationship to white nationalism isn’t confined to the Jan. 6 insurrection; it has a long history that draws on Shakespeare’s role in constructing a white racial and cultural identity. Although Shakespeare was English, he has been invoked as a symbol of American linguistic and cultural heritage since before the revolutionary period. This heritage has often been tied to white supremacy.
The Folger Shakespeare Library’s first director, Joseph Quincy Adams (a relative of John Adams and John Quincy Adams), said in a speech at the library’s dedication that immigrants who were not from Northern or Western Europe “swarmed the land like the locust in Egypt,” and he saw Shakespeare as cementing America’s white, Anglo-Saxon heritage.
“The sentiments in that inaugural speech were an artifact of the time, but they’re also completely at odds with our sense that Shakespeare can be a vehicle for talking about what it means to live in a free and just society, one that is multiracial and democratic,” current Folger director Michael Witmore told The Post. A day after the Jan. 6 insurrection, the Folger published a statement denouncing the events.
While the Folger has distanced itself from its white nationalist origins and has made efforts to promote inclusivity, the relationship between Shakespeare and white nationalism has persisted into the present.
In June 2017, the summer after Trump’s election, two right-wing activists interrupted a New York Public Theater production of “Julius Caesar,” which depicted a controversial Trump-like Caesar in a production they believed represented “political violence against the right.”
Other American stagings of Shakespeare have also been embroiled in debates about white nationalism. In 1916, a New York production inspired by “The Tempest” represented an “Anglo-American claim to Shakespeare” by using Prospero’s authority to represent the dominance of Western thought and portraying Caliban, a dark-skinned man representing foreign-born populations, falling at his feet, Shakespeare scholar Elisabeth H. Kinsley noted in her 2019 book, “Here in This Island We Arrived: Shakespeare and Belonging in Immigrant New York.” This stood in contrast to the defiance of Shakespeare’s own Caliban against Prospero in the original play, Kinsley wrote.
Another famous invocation of Shakespeare in the service of white nationalism was directly rooted in violence. John Wilkes Booth, Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, came from a family of stage actors; his brother Edwin played some of Shakespeare’s most famous characters. Booth even starred in a production of “Julius Caesar” alongside his brother, playing Marc Antony, Caesar’s second-in-command, depicted by Shakespeare as loyal to the Roman dictator.
But Booth, a Confederate sympathizer and white supremacist, identified more with Shakespeare’s Brutus, who turned on Caesar; he invoked the character after shooting Lincoln, shouting, “sic semper tyrannis” (“thus always to tyrants”), a quote attributed to the real Brutus after he helped kill Caesar.
“After being hunted like a dog last night … I am here in despair,” Booth wrote in his diary after the assassination. “And why? For doing what Brutus was honored for.”"
L2I2ML11JR_E71F5EKROHJRJU4,Man who committed D.C. rapes in 1992 at age 16 must serve his prison term,Keith L. Alexander,"January 22, 2024 at 5:28 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/22/prison-iraa-sexual-assault-release-victims/,"In February, a 47-year-old man, serving a possible lifetime of incarceration for the 1992 abduction and rape of three women in D.C., told a judge that he had been rehabilitated behind bars over the past three decades and asked to be released from his sentence, which had been imposed for crimes he committed as a juvenile.
In D.C. Superior Court that day, two of his victims vividly recounted the night they were attacked. They pleaded with a judge not to grant relief to Joshua Haggins, one of their two assailants, who had been prosecuted as an adult and sentenced to 34 to 99 years. As the women addressed Judge Rainey R. Brandt — saying they were permanently confined to a psychological prison of their own, put there by Haggins and his accomplice — their powerful, unsparing recollections left Brandt in tears on the bench, and she later recused herself.
Now, nearly a year after that emotional court session, a second judge appointed to review the case has declined to change Haggins’s sentence substantially. In a Dec. 15 ruling, Judge Andrea L. Hertzfeld said Haggins, who was 16 in 1992, had not “demonstrated a basis for immediate” relief. He had been seeking clemency under a D.C. law that offers a second chance to prisoners whose crimes occurred before age 25 and who have been locked up for at least 15 years.
The judge did shave a year off Haggins’s sentence, shortening his term to 33 to 99 years. He still faces a sentence of 30 years to life in Maryland in a separate case. His attorney has said that Haggins, if he is ever released from his D.C. sentence, would seek clemency in Maryland under that state’s second-chance law.
Herzfeld’s decision brought some relief to the victims — but also frustration that they had to fight in court to keep Haggins imprisoned by publicly revisiting that terrible night.
“He’s a predator. He committed violent crimes repeatedly,” Kristen Hubbard, now 50, said in an interview. “I have a life sentence. I don’t get to change that reality of what I have. I live with this. My loved ones live with this. I don’t have parole. I don’t have a second-chance look at what happened to me.”
Hubbard consented to her name being published in The Washington Post, which generally does not identify victims of sexual assaults.
In denying Haggins’s petition, Hertzfeld acknowledged his young age in 1992 and his 30-plus years behind bars. The judge reminded Haggins, now 48, that he could reapply for relief in three years under the District’s Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act, known as IRAA. And if he does reapply, his victims will be allowed to address the court again.
The IRAA statute, enacted in 2016, sets out a list of factors that a judge must consider before ruling on a petition. Most criteria relate to the offender’s rehabilitation, maturity and potential for future threat. Other factors involve the petitioner’s childhood, including any mistreatment, and whether the offender’s crime was committed under the sway of an older person. The law initially applied to prisoners who were younger than 18 when their crime occurred and had served at least 20 years, but it has since been expanded to encompass more offenders.
The U.S. attorney’s office says that of 375 petitions filed, 194 have been granted, 16 have been partially granted, 48 have been rejected and others are pending. Prosecutors have objected to a vast majority of the petitions.
At the time of Haggins’s petition, his attorney, Jonathan W. Anderson, said that prison officials had deemed his client at “low risk” of reoffending and that Haggins had earned his GED after dropping out of school in the ninth grade. His petition included statements from treatment specialists and prison officials attesting to his maturity and good behavior while incarcerated.
In a statement Monday, Anderson said Haggins was “deeply remorseful and has been for years.”
“The records in this case also show that he was a severely abused, homeless, and drug-addicted 16-year-old at the time of these offenses,” Anderson wrote.
Haggins, who is appealing Herzfeld’s ruling, and his accomplice, Richard Settles, then 19, abducted the women from a car outside a D.C. music club on Jan. 15, 1992, according to authorities and the victims. The two were raped repeatedly outdoors and again overnight in a Maryland motel. Before being let go, they were forced to dig graves for themselves. Settles was sentenced to 99 years.
Hubbard says she is outraged that Haggins could eventually file a new petition.
“It’s unfair to the victims to have to keep coming back, revisiting the same crime,” she said. “To have us keep coming back every three years, when they apply for reconsideration, is not considering the victim at all.”"
LAI4E5RJFA_V0RYHI3YGKJ6IP2,Haley makes final pitch in N.H. as last candidate standing against Trump,Marianne LeVine,"January 22, 2024 at 7:51 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/haley-new-hampshire-trump-republicans/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Nikki Haley blitzed through New Hampshire on Monday as the last candidate standing against Donald Trump, urging voters not to take for granted that he will be the Republican presidential nominee as she tried to blunt his momentum on the eve of a critical primary.
With the party increasingly falling in line behind the former president, polls showing Haley facing double-digit deficits and a window for her best chance to stop or slow him about to close, the former U.N. ambassador made a final pitch as the candidate who is best equipped to defeat President Biden and usher in wins down the ballot for Republicans in November.
Haley seemingly got the race she wanted: a one-on-one matchup with Trump in the state where she’s staked much of her presidential bid. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s Sunday exit from the contest and endorsement of Trump added another potential hurdle during a difficult stretch for Haley, following earlier struggles to close the gap with her rival.
“Now, I always speak in hard truths. I voted for Donald Trump twice. I was proud to serve America in his administration. But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him,” she said at a stop Monday morning in Franklin. “You all know I’m right. Chaos follows him. And we can’t have a country in disarray and a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won’t survive.”
Tuesday’s results are expected to be pivotal — not only for Haley’s path forward in the GOP primary but also for the entire nominating contest. Trump has racked up endorsements from former rivals, lawmakers and others, including from Haley’s home state, and many Republicans see the contest as potentially wrapping up as quickly as it started.
New Hampshire is known for its sometimes surprise finishes — including Sen. John McCain’s 2000 win over George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton’s comeback defeat of Barack Obama in 2008 — and Haley backers are hoping that her growing crowds in the closing days are a sign of voters joining her fold.
Trump, who has been traveling back and forth to New Hampshire as he navigates court hearings, was set to hold a rally Monday night in Laconia. He has criticized Haley repeatedly over the past week, attacking her as a “globalist” who would be soft on the border and a threat to Social Security.
Even as Haley has at times tiptoed around her criticism of Trump, she has effectively become the anti-Trump candidate, receiving the backing of groups like Americans for Prosperity Action that are pushing for the party to move on from the former president.
“It’s pretty much: ‘I’m not Donald Trump,’” said New Hampshire GOP Chairman Chris Ager, describing Haley’s closing message. Ager is neutral in the race.
In recent days, Haley has held back-to-back events and sharpened her attacks on Trump after facing criticism for not going after him harder. She has taken more questions from reporters than she had in months as she makes her closing pitch in New Hampshire — a state where personal appeal and authenticity have proved to be keys to victory.
On Sunday, Haley drew her largest crowd to date in the Granite State: more than 1,200 attendees at a high-energy rally in Exeter. On Monday, she met with small groups of voters at her retail stops before ending the day at a rally with several hundred people in Salem.
Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College, said he’s noticed a shift in Haley’s approach.
“I think in the last 72 hours, she really changed her campaign into a challenger campaign. Very vigorous, lots of scheduling items, lots of questions,” Levesque said. “We’ll see if it’s too late.”
Haley is facing an uphill battle. A Washington Post-Monmouth University poll found that 52 percent of potential Republican primary voters are backing Trump, compared with 34 percent for Haley. That poll found that while Haley had nearly doubled her support from November, Trump’s support also grew.
Even as Haley has repeatedly suggested she wanted a two-person race, some Republican strategists said that DeSantis’s and Vivek Ramaswamy’s decisions to leave the race probably only helped Trump. And as the last candidate against Trump, Haley has faced the same challenge DeSantis and others did: how to attack him without alienating Republican primary voters who support him or did so in the past.
Haley has ramped up her attacks on Trump since finishing third in Iowa — questioning his mental fitness after he appeared to confuse her and Nancy Pelosi in remarks at a rally, and criticizing him for being overly friendly with dictators while she served in his administration as U.N. ambassador.
She’s also sought to tie Trump and Biden together, while framing herself as the only candidate who can defeat both.
But Trump’s attacks have put her on the defense. Even at her more intimate stops where she speaks for only a few minutes, she frequently spends part of the time attempting to fact-check his claims about her.
In interviews, many voters at Haley events said their primary reason for supporting her is because she is not Trump. Among them is Brad Marshall, who wore a big smile as he walked off the stage after shaking hands, having a brief conversation and taking a photo with Haley during her stop at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Franklin.
“I plan to vote for Nikki,” said Marshall, 80, an independent voter. Why? He didn’t list a single reason that he liked Haley. “Donald Trump did a good job while he was there. But he’s collected so much garbage around him and distractions, and Democrats have spent four years going after him.”
One wild card in Tuesday’s Republican primary is just how many independent voters turn out. These voters, who have chosen not to register with either major party, account for the biggest single share of the state’s electorate.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David M. Scanlan has predicted record GOP primary turnout of 322,000. To make the race genuinely competitive, Haley would need a historically high percentage of undeclared voters to participate and would also need a significant margin over Trump among them.
In the Post-Monmouth poll released Monday, Haley led Trump among these voters by 10 percentage points — 48 to 38 percent — and they made up 47 percent of the likely electorate. If that percentage increased to 55 percent of the electorate, which is 10 points above the 2012 high point, Trump would still be leading by double digits.
Public polls have been inconsistent in charting Haley’s support among undeclared voters in New Hampshire. While the Post-Monmouth poll gave her a 10-point margin, the newest Suffolk University-Boston Globe-NBC 10 tracking poll put her margin among them at 23 points and showed those voters increasing their support for her.
While some Trump critics have wanted Haley to go after the former president in a more direct way over his conduct, indictments and other matters, much of her pitch to voters has centered on suggesting that he would be weak in a general election.
“When you hear Trump speak, what’s he talking about? Grievances of the past. He’s talking about vendettas … Biden’s talking about investigations,” she said here. “Neither one of them is talking about the future.”
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R), who has actively campaigned with Haley across the state, emphasized that having her as the party’s nominee would not only ensure that Republicans win the White House but would also result in down-ballot victories.
“We haven’t been winning very often lately with Trump as the standard-bearer. I want winners. I’m tired of losers,” he said as he introduced her at the Franklin event.
Haley has suggested she will stick it out regardless of the outcome in New Hampshire. But the path ahead could prove difficult, with South Carolina — Haley’s home state, and where Trump is enduringly popular — looming as one of the next big contests in February.
At a restaurant in Manchester on Monday afternoon, a man who shook Haley’s hand urged her to stay in the race. “Don’t worry,” she replied. “We’re going on to South Carolina.”
Trump has drawn large crowds to his rallies in recent days, reflecting his appeal across the state.
“Trump has really got everything going, and I’m just so excited to have him back in office and things get back to normal,” said Caroline Gagan, 60, from Hampton Beach, an independent backing Trump. “I am brand new to volunteering. I’ve never been political, but I’m just done with what’s going on.”
Some New Hampshire Republican officials noted Haley’s relatively lighter schedule immediately after the Iowa caucuses and viewed her decision to skip a debate with DeSantis as a missed opportunity. Haley’s campaign said she went back to South Carolina on one of the days after her father was hospitalized — and in the days since she has ramped up her schedule.
“If you’re going to overtake President Trump, you’re going to want as much airtime as you can, and folks thought that was unusual for somebody trying to catch up to turn away the best television opportunity you can in the state,” Ager said. “When you’re behind you don’t play it safe and run up the middle, you throw a Hail Mary. I think we haven’t seen a sufficient Hail Mary from her to catch up in a normal year.”
Donna and Tom Waldron stood in the morning cold bundled up and excited to see Haley make her closing argument for why New Hampshire voters should support her in the Tuesday primary. For them, the reason was simple: She’s not Trump.
“It’s more of a vote against Trump than anything,” Tom, 68, an independent voter, said. Donna, 67, nodded in agreement.
Asked why he’s voting against Trump, he laughed: “Do you have enough time for that list?”
But both expressed concern at the size of the Veterans of Foreign Wars post where she was speaking.
Donna paused: “I can’t say I’m really optimistic. But I have to remain hopeful people will give Haley a chance.”
“I am hopeful that there’s a larger anti-Trump movement than people think — and that they’ll come out,” she added.

LALCH2Z9G5_H6FTXJ9ZZPIJBFB,Russian courts jail a Putin critic and a woman convicted of a blast that killed a pro-war blogger,_,"January 25, 2024 at 8:52 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/25/russia-ukraine-girkin-strelkov-putin-court/b0894232-bb73-11ee-b176-fe5fd794e716_story.html,"TALLINN, Estonia — A Russian court on Thursday sentenced a woman to 27 years in prison for a cafe blast that killed a prominent pro-war blogger after he was given a bust of himself that later exploded.
In a separate proceeding, a Moscow court convicted a former leader of separatist rebels in Ukraine who called President Vladimir Putin a coward of extremism and sentenced him to four years.
Darya Trepova, 26, was convicted by a court in St. Petersburg of carrying out a terrorist attack, illegal trafficking of explosive devices and forging documents in the April 2 blast at the cafe in which Vladlen Tatarsky was killed and 52 others were injured.
Tatarsky, 40, was an ardent supporter of the Kremlin’s military action in Ukraine and filed regular reports on the fighting from the front lines.
Trepova was seen on video presenting Tatarsky with the bust moments before the blast at the riverside cafe in the historic heart of Russia’s second-largest city where he was leading a discussion.
She insisted that she didn’t know the bust contained a bomb. Russian authorities have blamed Ukrainian intelligence agencies for orchestrating the bombing. Authorities in Kyiv have not directly responded to the accusation.
The court also convicted Trepova’s acquaintance Dmitry Kasintsev of concealing a grave crime for sheltering her after the blast and sentenced him to 21 months in prison.
The Moscow court imposed a four-year sentence on Igor Girkin, who used the surname alias of Strelkov (shooter), was the most prominent leader of Russian-backed separatist fighters in Ukraine’s Donetsk region in 2014, when rebellion arose after the ouster of Ukraine’s Russia-allied president.
He briefly became the self-declared separatist government’s defense minister, but left the post in August 2014 after rebel forces shot down a Malaysian passenger airliner over Donetsk, killing all 298 people aboard. He was convicted in absentia of murder in the Netherlands, where the flight had originated, for his role.
He returned to Russia and became a nationalist commentator and activist. He supported launching Russia’s war in Ukraine, but sharply criticized authorities for being inept and indecisive in carrying out the fight.
Girkin called Putin a “nonentity” and a person of “cowardly mediocrity.” He was arrested in July on extremism charges and remained in custody since then.
His conviction reflects the high sensitivity of Russian authorities to criticism and opposition. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, that sensitivity intensified sharply, with the passage of laws criminalizing statements and news reports that allegedly discredit the Russian military.
Two protesters calling for Girkin to be freed were detained by police outside the court building, Russian news agencies said.
Girkin’s sentence was considerable less harsh than those handed to some figures who have denounced the war, notably the 25-year sentence imposed on opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza.
Treopva’s sentence is the longest imposed on a woman in modern Russia, according to the Mediazona website that reports on human rights and justice issues.
Tatarsky, who had filed regular reports from Ukraine, was the pen name for Maxim Fomin, who had accumulated more than 560,000 followers on his Telegram messaging app channel.
Born in eastern Ukraine, Tatarsky worked as a coal miner before starting a furniture business. When he ran into financial difficulties, he robbed a bank and was sentenced to prison. He fled from custody after a Russia-backed separatist rebellion arose in 2014, then joined separatist rebels and fought on the front line before turning to blogging.
Tatarsky was known for his blustery pronouncements and ardent pro-war rhetoric."
LAT4T6DJYU_K0J2UUH2RK4VHSY,Prosecutors decline charges against 4 Park Police officers,Keith L. Alexander,"January 23, 2024 at 8:12 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/23/james-herndon-park-police-crash/,"Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that they won’t file charges against four U.S. Park Police officers who in 2022 chased a motorcyclist they believed was a suspect in a homicide, but who later died when his motorcycle crashed during the pursuit.
According to the U.S. attorney’s office, on June 27, 2022, D.C. police attempted to conduct a traffic stop of James Herndon as Herndon was driving a three-wheeled vehicle.
When Herndon sped off on his vehicle, D.C. police initiated a pursuit and requested assistance from U.S. Park Police.
Prosecutors said when the Park Police officers joined the pursuit, D.C. police officers learned that Herndon was wanted only for questioning and immediately called off their pursuit.
But Park Police officers were not notified of the terminated pursuit, prosecutors said, and continued to chase Herndon. Herndon later lost control of the vehicle and crashed. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Brian McDaniel, an attorney who represents Herndon’s family, called the prosecutors’ decision “certainly disappointing.” McDaniel said D.C. police and Park Police were “negligent” in Herndon’s death.
In investigating the Herndon crash, prosecutors said they reviewed witness accounts, body camera and surveillance footage, traffic camera footage, aerial video footage, police radio recordings and D.C. police and Park Police reports.
Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office are responsible for filing charges against officers if they find federal or District civil rights violations involving excessive use of force.
“After a careful, thorough, and independent review of the evidence, federal prosecutors have found insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the USPP officers who were pursuing Herndon at the time of the crash are criminally liable for his death,” the U.S. attorney’s office said in a statement.

LFPC5S7RV6_2LYM74MVUG3PI6I,How predictive are the midnight votes of six people?,Philip Bump,"January 23, 2024 at 10:48 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/dixville-knox-new-hampshire-primary/,"While you were either asleep (East Coasters, Europeans) or still experiencing Monday (West Coasters, night owls), six people showed up at a hotel in a tiny town in northern New Hampshire and voted to make former ambassador Nikki Haley the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.
Uh, okay?, you’re probably thinking. And that is fair. Six votes in nearly any election — save, say, middle school class president — is not impressively significant. But those votes, offered in Dixville Notch, N.H., invariably attract outsized attention every four years because, one, they are the first votes cast in New Hampshire and, two, that gives something for the press to do.
And the candidates. That Haley swept those six votes led her to make a bold prediction, given former president Donald Trump’s solid position in pre-primary polling: “Do you think if this was a done deal we would have gotten any of them?”
In fact, a review of past voting in Dixville Notch shows that the town’s votes mirrored the results in New Hampshire overall more often than not. In the past two contests, though, its results have not been predictive of the eventual nominee.
Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip Bump
Let’s first establish that your original response (if I correctly predicted it) was on the mark. Relative to total turnout in either party’s primary since 1964, the votes cast in Dixville Notch have, at best, constituted 0.03 percent of the total votes cast. (This was in the Republican primary in 1984, when President Ronald Reagan won every primary contest in a walk.) That percentage, 0.03 percent, is equivalent to 30 cents out of $1,000. It is about three-quarters of the area of Rhode Island compared to the rest of the continental United States.
Nor have the results in Dixville Notch correlated strongly to the statewide vote. For each contested primary over the past 60 years, I pulled data in both the town and the state and compared the percentages of support earned by the eventual nominee. (I chose this instead of comparing the town’s results to the winner of New Hampshire because this allows us to simultaneously evaluate the predictive power of both town and state.)
The short version: The percentage of total support the eventual nominee earned in Dixville Notch didn’t correlate strongly to the percentage statewide. So if a candidate got 30 percent in the town, that did not suggest it was likely they’d also get 30 percent statewide.
Of course, percentages aren’t a great point of comparison here, given that the median number of voters who’ve cast ballots in Dixville Notch over those decades is seven — meaning that half of the primaries had more voters and half had fewer. If the statewide result is 50-50, and 4 of 7 voters in Dixville Notch supported the eventual nominee, that’s a seven-point deviation from statewide (since 4 in 7 is 57 percent).
So I looked at it more simply. How often had the nominee’s result in Dixville Notch matched the result statewide? Because I had the numbers, I added another category, too: the eventual nominee earning a plurality of support or (in Dixville Notch) tying someone else.
Out of the 28 contests considered, Dixville Notch and New Hampshire both had the eventual nominee losing six times. The eventual nominee won both seven times. An additional eight times, the eventual nominee won a plurality, tied, or won in both the town and the state.
In other words, three-quarters of the time, the eventual nominee did the same in both the town and the state. But only 15 of 28 times did the eventual nominee win (or ties) in both the town and the state. Meaning that Dixville Notch’s ability to predict both the state and the nominee is the equivalent of a coin toss. As you’d expect.
Over the past four contested primaries, Dixville Notch’s results are not that great. In 2012, the eventual nominee tied in Dixville Notch with two votes. In 2016, it missed both eventual nominees. In 2020, the eventual nominee — Joe Biden — received zero of the four votes cast.
That is probably worth remembering as the rest of the vote in the state unfolds.
I made a complicated chart showing the support in both the town and state in primaries since 1964. It is complicated and would take too much time to explain but it also took a long time to make, so I am going to drop it here and then brush off my hands and walk away.

LIC6WKCTXW_E76DLVB1XT770F9,More Americans are nonreligious. Who are they and what do they believe?,Michelle Boorstein,"January 24, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/nones-no-religion-study/,"Over the past half-century, as the number of Americans with no religious affiliation has gone from 5 percent to nearly 30 percent, the emphasis has often been on what they were leaving. A report released Wednesday on the “nones” finds that they are diverse, young, left-leaning and may offer clues to the future of making meaning in a secularizing country.
The report, from the Pew Research Center, is one of the biggest yet on the nones, and it adds detail to this constituency that has been growing across a wide variety of demographic categories, including age, race, political leaning and education level. As the nation’s fastest-growing segment of religion (or nonreligion) in recent decades, the nones may reflect the front line of future spirituality. Fifty-six percent say they believe in “some higher power” aside from the God of the Bible; 67 percent say they believe that humans have a soul or spirit, and majorities say they believe that nonhuman animals and parts of nature can have spiritual energies.
The Pew findings seem to debunk, or at least complicate, the idea that people who leave religion are hostile toward it. The overwhelming majority of nones say religion causes division and intolerance and encourages superstition and illogical thinking, but 58 percent also say religion helps society by giving people meaning and purpose.
The report also challenges a notion often cited by faith-based groups and other civic leaders that secularization causes people to be less civically active. Pew asked about various civic metrics, including whether respondents had volunteered in the past year, had voted in recent midterm elections or follow public affairs closely. The rates for nones are similar to those of people who have a religious affiliation but don’t attend religious services. In other words, the issue appears to be more about involvement in groups than religious labels or associations.
‘Big Earth energy’: A new era of nature spirituality is here
Ryan Cragun, a sociologist at the University of Tampa who consulted with Pew on the report, said the data points to a new frontier of what might be called “meaning-making” research. The report adds more detail to what this huge swath of Americans believe about spirituality, but it’s not clear whether they are simply slowly letting go of the supernatural, or something else, he told The Washington Post.
“I think it’s possible these people don’t believe in anything [supernatural], we just don’t have the language yet to describe what they do believe,” he said. “When someone sees the stars and has an overwhelming, spiritual experience of awe, and they call it a ‘higher power,’ what does that actually mean? And that’s the next step in research. We don’t have answers yet. This report is showing where we need to do more research.”
Along with the Pew report, other research and books over the past couple of years have found that the nones are more of a bellwether or a canary in the coal mine — depending on the point of view — than a cohesive group coalescing around a new belief system. Nones, the Pew study finds, are 17 percent atheist, 20 percent agnostic and 63 percent “nothing in particular.” Atheists and agnostics are very different by most metrics from the nothing-in-particulars, who tend to be less educated, more politically moderate and less negative about religion.
In 1972, the General Social Survey found that 5 percent of Americans considered themselves nones. In 2007, it was 16 percent. The number reached 30 percent in 2022 before dipping back to 28 percent last year.
Several popular books have come out in recent years that take a new crack at determining the future effect of the nones, including one by Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University who wrote “The Nones: Where They Came From, Who They Are, and Where They Are Going.”
“This is really about the question: How do we live in a pluralistic society? Thirty years ago, 90 percent of Americans were Christian; now it’s 60 percent. How do Christians understand the nones? Are they your enemy? How much religious freedom do I get?” he said. “Religious people need to be able to talk about these questions. And how do nones feel about questions of religion? Can a woman wear a hijab in her driver’s license photo? Do they think religion plays a productive role?”
As far as the future, the new Pew survey finds that 69 percent of nones are younger than 50, compared with 45 percent of U.S. adults who identify with a religion.
Church for ‘nones’: Anti-dogma spiritual collectives emerge across the U.S.
In the growth of this complex, heterogenous group, Burge sees humans in a transitional, experimental period. “We’re in a ‘Let’s tear everything down and see how it goes’ phase,” he said.
Burge is focused on the nothing-in-particular segment of nones — the largest segment by far. According to his book, 32 percent of that group has a high school diploma and an annual household income of $50,000 or less, compared with 12 percent of atheists and 16 percent of agnostics.
“A third of this group is just struggling. From a societal standpoint, I think the nothing-in-particulars are really important for the future of American democracy and religion,” Burge said.
Another recent book about the nones is “Nonverts: The Making of Ex-Christian America,” by Stephen Bullivant, a professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St. Mary’s University in London. In an interview, Bullivant said a key aspect of the American experience — compared with countries in Europe that are further along in the secularization process — is that the nones grew so fast.
“What that also means is, it’s so real and personal for people. It’s in the space of a generation, in families, it’s a big, present, raw, very often painful issue for everyone,” Bullivant said. With growth and the passage of time, he said, “it will be a less big deal in many places because you’ll be another generation away from when it was a big deal.”
Indeed, the Pew study depicts nones not as opposed to religion, but simply caring less about it. Eighty-one percent say religion is not too important or not at all important in their lives. Ninety-seven percent attend religious services a few times a year or not at all, Pew found.
Trying to understand how nones construct their values, the study found that the group places a relatively high value on science. Forty-four percent of nones say there is a scientific explanation for everything, even if they don’t understand how everything works, compared with 16 percent of religiously affiliated Americans. Fifty-six percent of nones say science does more good than harm, compared with 40 percent of the religiously affiliated who say the same.
But when it comes to identifying important factors for deciding between right and wrong, nones and religiously affiliated Americans look similar, with 82 percent of the former and 83 percent of the latter saying “they don’t want to hurt people.” The motivation of “logic and reason” was picked by 82 percent of nones and 79 percent of the religiously affiliated.
Opinion  I left the church — and now long for a ‘church for the nones’
The phase the country is in now, said Cragun — who co-wrote the book “Beyond Doubt: The Secularization of Society,” which was published last year — is moving past the debate among social scientists about whether the United States is becoming more secular. Decades of global research done by the World Values Survey, starting in the 1980s, showed by the 2010s that religion was declining, Cragun said.
“That debate is over. Now we’re debating: What will the future look like? What will people turn to?” he said.
Cragun said he subscribes to a theory of Swiss sociologist Jörg Stolz that a key driving force behind religion’s decline is “the culmination of growing autonomy in society. People don’t like being told what they should do or what they should not do, especially when the teller isn’t especially qualified. Increasingly, people are saying, ‘Why do I need a pastor to tell me what to do? What makes them any more insightful than this academic journal?’ The rise of the nones is the manifestation of a move toward greater autonomy of individuals.”
A previous version of this article incorrectly said that 56 percent of ""nones"" say science does more harm than good, according to a new Pew report. Fifty-six percent say science does more good than harm. A previous version also incorrectly said that those who identify as ""nothing in particular"" tend to be more negative about religion than atheists and agnostics. They are less negative than those two groups. The article has been corrected."

Persistent cough has made this virus season exhausting.,Teddy Amenabar,"January 22, 2024 at 11:44 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/22/persistent-lingering-cough-virus/,"Coughs are common during every winter virus season. But this year it seems like more people than usual are complaining about a cough that just won’t go away.
Cathy Conger, 60, who works at a vintage furniture store in Washington, said she’s had a persistent cough for a month now after traveling over the holidays. She often wakes up coughing in the middle of the night. “I’m probably going to just keep the bowl of cough drops by my bed,” she said.
Adam Tampio, a 16-year-old who lives in Alexandria, Va., said he’s had “a really bad cough” since he caught a cold in the middle of December.
On social media — TikTok, Bluesky and Threads — people are also commiserating about their persistent coughs. Bryan Jun, 26, who lives in New York, complained about his lingering cough on TikTok last month, in a video that’s garnered more than 7 million views. “I’m coughing in Georgia,” wrote one viewer. “Everyone is coughing in New Jersey,” wrote another.
Cases of persistent cough aren’t tracked in any official way, so it’s impossible to know how this coughing season compares to past seasons. But some physicians say they are seeing more lingering cough than usual. Many of these patients have tested negative for the coronavirus, and the cough may be the aftermath of other circulating respiratory viruses.
Natasha Bhuyan, national medical director and physician at the primary care provider One Medical, said “many of our members” are reporting lingering coughs that they “just can’t shake.” (Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos is the founder of Amazon, which owns One Medical.)
“This winter, it felt like a lot of these circulating illnesses were all peaking at the same time,” she said. “Everywhere you turned somebody around you had a cold or had covid or the flu.”
Michael Stephen, a pulmonary physician at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, said his practice “has basically been taken over” by patients who have persistent coughs.
“It’s basically hijacked my whole practice,” said Stephen, who’s also the author of “Breath Taking: The Power, Fragility and Future of Our Extraordinary Lungs.” Stephen said his patients have been coughing for one or two months at a time, which can strain chest muscles.
“It’s beating them up,” he said. “These people are coming in with baggy eyes, not sleeping and pulled muscles. By the time they get to me, they’re not doing well.”
It’s possible, say some physicians, that people are just more tuned into coughing since the pandemic. Before covid, people routinely went to work and social gatherings with coughs. Today, that’s frowned on.
Russell Buhr, a pulmonary and critical care medicine physician at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, said anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of adults who get a viral infection can develop a post-infection cough that persists for two to eight weeks.
“I’ve seen it more frequently in my practice than I did a few years ago,” Buhr said. But he thinks it’s because people have been “paying more attention” to their coughs, and other respiratory symptoms, since the start of the pandemic. “Everyone is a little hesitant to show up at work with anything that resembles any kind of illness,” Buhr said.
Ashwin Vasan, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and a primary care physician, said health-care officials in New York are getting “a ton of questions from patients” about these lingering coughs, even though “post-viral coughs are actually very common.”
“We are aware of what’s getting posted,” Vasan said. “It’s not entirely surprising to doctors, like me, that there is this post-viral cough, because there’s always been post-viral cough.”
Charles A. Powell, system division chief of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said it’s very likely “the incidence of these diseases is higher than it was pre-covid” and that’s why more patients have these lingering coughs.
“With the influenza, the covid and the rhinovirus, the common cold virus — all those things are coming around the same time for us,” Powell said. “It makes it very, very common.”
A cough is a “protective reflex” intended to clear the lungs and keep the airway clear, said Peter Dicpinigaitis, director of the Montefiore Cough Center and editor in chief of the journal Lung. When someone has a lingering cough because of a viral infection, the reflex “isn’t serving any protective or beneficial purpose,” he said. “It just simply is a bothersome symptom for the patient,” Dicpinigaitis said.
A persistent cough after a respiratory virus is often a “sign of a lingering inflammatory response to that initial illness,” Buhr said. How long someone has the cough can depend on the virus. People who get RSV can “cough for weeks,” he said.
“You can kind of think about it almost like when you get a sunburn. Your skin is much more irritated and sensitive,” Buhr said. “This is a similar concept on the inside of your lungs, but it’s an injury related to the infection.”
Consult a doctor for coughs that last more than a few weeks. “It’s usually not something serious,” Buhr said. “But we also don’t want you to suffer through it unnecessarily.”
If you have a high fever, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, dizziness or confusion, or other signs that any symptoms are getting worse, Bhuyan said she recommends patients contact their doctor right away.
“The key one is if their symptoms are actually getting worse,” Bhuyan said. “At that point, they might be developing a pneumonia or a bacterial infection, or another kind of infection.”
And if a person has been coughing for more than eight weeks, “it becomes much more likely” that the cough isn’t just because of a viral infection and the “treatable underlying cause” needs to be diagnosed, said Dicpinigaitis. He said some of his patients have been persistently coughing for years. Those chronic coughs, coughs that last more than eight weeks, are often due to one of three conditions: asthma, acid reflux (known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) and postnasal drip syndrome, he said.
Gina Lee, 42, who lives in Swarthmore, Pa., had recovered from a bout of covid in September and said she developed a cough at the end of December after visiting her sister in Baltimore. “We went to the aquarium and I was very stupid and forgot to bring a mask,” Lee said.
Lee said she wondered if her lingering cough, from which she just recently recovered, could be related to having covid in the fall. “Is it an uptick because of covid? Or is it just everyone’s more aware of it?” she said.
Doctors say it’s possible that a bad case of covid could affect how quickly a person bounces back from subsequent colds or other respiratory viruses. It takes longer for some patients to heal from a covid infection and, when someone’s recovering, it’s possible that other viruses will have an easier time infecting the airway, Stephen said.
“Covid has really changed things,” Stephen said. “The fact that it causes a pretty significant bronchitis, I think, in a lot of people, it’s changing the immunology of their lungs.”
Covid-19 has also been “a bit of an eye-opener,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Healthcare System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis.
“We have a newfound appreciation that viruses that we trivialized actually can have serious effects,” Al-Aly said, adding that the flu and RSV can both lead to a lingering cough. “I don’t think any of this is new. I think our awareness and our documentation of it is new.”
There’s “no magic bullet” to treating a lingering cough, said Powell. Hydration and hot beverages help and will probably provide the same relief as over-the-counter medications and cough syrups.
Dicpinigaitis said any “thick and sweet” syrup may suppress your cough by soothing the nerves in the back of your throat. Some patients may need other treatments that have a “direct impact on the cough itself” if the cough continues, Powell said.
“If drinking tea with honey makes you feel better, and it’s soothing, that’s great,” Powell said.

Parliament Speaker Ali Abdelaal said 485 lawmakers in the 596-seat assembly — or more than the two-thirds majority needed for approval — voted in favor of the proposed constitutional amendments. The proposed changes are now headed for a review in a parliamentary committee and then will return for a second vote in the assembly.
If that passes, the proposed changes will face a national referendum by the summer.
The passage of the amendments came despite outrage by critics who feared that the measures will give unprecedented dictatorial powers to Sissi, whose term is supposed to end in 2022. The proposed amendments would extend the presidential term from four to six years while allowing Sissi to run for two additional terms. Many pro-democracy activists and critics fear that Sissi will now be able to remain president almost indefinitely. Even though weeks of discussions will take place before Sissi's path to remain in power is cleared, few expect the vast majority of lawmakers beholden to the Sissi regime to work against him.
""We know it is a done deal already,"" said Mohamed Zaree, director of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies. ""This is how Members of parliament pay back to the security apparatus that brought them to power.""
The vote comes little more than eight years after the Arab Spring revolts here ousted President Hosni Mubarak, ending his three decades of autocratic rule. Since Sissi led the 2013 military overthrow of democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi and was elected the following year, the former armed forces commander has jailed tens of thousands of opponents and blocked hundreds of websites deemed critical of his regime.
The amendments target Egypt’s 2014 constitution, passed after Mubarak’s fall, and would undo many checks and balances designed to limit the president’s power.
Last year, Sissi was reelected but only after all his opponents were either driven out of the race, jailed or pressured in other ways. His sole nominal opponent entered the race at the 11th hour, and a few days earlier had been one of his staunchest supporters.
The ghosts of the Arab Spring haunt Egypt’s sham election
The rush to push through the constitutional amendments may have been motivated by an expectation that Trump Administration wouldn’t object to Sissi extending his rule, according to a report in the independent Egyptian news website Mada Masr citing official sources.
Sources quoted by the website also said the vote was intended to fly under the radar before the new Democratic-controlled House of Representatives gave attention to Egypt. So far, the White House has remained silent on the proposed amendments.
The 596-seat parliament is predominantly filled with Sissi loyalists. His supporters argue that Sissi needs several more terms to achieve his goals of modernizing Egypt and its economy and combating terrorism.
“It is not true that these amendments were suggested by members of the parliament and the president has nothing to do with them,” said Zaree. “There is only one person (in charge) in Egypt. Only Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. Public opinion in Egypt is Sissi’s opinion.”
The amendments will also enhance Sissi’s power to appoint senior judges , including the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and would erode judicial oversight on any legislation as well as the judiciary’s financial independence.
“These amendments effectively serve to destroy the constitutional separation of powers, concentrating all authority into the president’s hands and solidifying his authoritarian rule,” a group for 10 Egyptian human rights groups said in a letter this week.
The amendments also call for a 25 percent quota for women in parliament as well as adequate representation for minority Coptic Christians, youth and people with disabilities. But activist groups in their letter described the additional provisions as the government’s “disingenuous attempts to sugarcoat its authoritarian power-grab.”

The men, who were in a jon boat or similar craft, apparently found conditions too icy to safely return to shore about 1:30 p.m. and called 911, according to Kelly Johnston, a fire department battalion chief.
They were safely retrieved by county fire and rescue boats and brought to shore, she said. No injuries were reported.
The bay lies between the Potomac River and the mouth of the Occoquan River, abutting shorelines in both Fairfax and Prince William counties."
LZ649O3SPB_0AFQHZ27DN9JSH0,Supreme Court refuses to stop Alabama nitrogen-gas execution,Ann E. Marimow,"January 24, 2024 at 2:57 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/alabama-execution-nitrogen-gas-supreme-court/,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the way for Alabama officials to execute a death row prisoner using nitrogen gas, a method critics say is untested and lacks sufficient safety protocols.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, convicted in a 1988 murder-for-hire scheme, asked the high court to intervene days before his scheduled execution Thursday evening. It was the latest legal battle over how states that allow the death penalty execute prisoners.
The court’s brief order gave no reasons, and there were no noted dissents.
Alabama officials previously tried to execute Smith in November 2022 by lethal injection but failed to find a vein through which they could administer the drugs, leaving him strapped to a gurney for hours, his lawyers said. Officials scheduled a new date and planned to administer nitrogen hypoxia — a method that has never been used in an execution by any state or the federal government.
Smith’s lawyers told the justices that the state’s attempt to carry out the execution a second time amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
The court’s conservative majority does not typically grant requests to delay executions, but Smith’s lawyers said in a court filing Tuesday that it is “difficult to imagine a more exceptional case than one where a state intends to make a second attempt to execute a person by a never-before-used method of execution after having already subjected that same person to hours of superadded pain while trying and failing to execute him by a different method 14 months earlier, resulting in serious (and persistent) physical and emotional torment.”
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) pushed back on those concerns, telling the justices in a court filing that nitrogen gas is “perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised.”
Lawyers for the state said an Alabama appeals court was correct to reject Smith’s constitutional claim that his execution should be halted, pointing to a case from the 1940s involving a failed electrocution. “Alabama attempted to establish an IV and never administered the lethal injection drugs,” the filing said. “If a second attempted electrocution is constitutional, so is Smith’s execution by nitrogen hypoxia.”
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) suspended lethal injections in 2022 pending review days after the failed attempt to execute Smith — the state’s second botched execution attempt in three months, and the third in four years.
The Biden administration separately issued a moratorium on federal executions in 2021. But states can conduct them, and the moratorium does not prohibit federal prosecutors from seeking new death sentences. The Justice Department announced plans this month to seek the death penalty for the man who fatally shot 10 Black people in a racist rampage at a Buffalo grocery store in 2022.
Smith is on death row in Alabama for his role in the murder of 45-year-old Elizabeth Sennett in March 1988. Sennett was stabbed and beaten with a fireplace implement in what was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary at her Colbert County, Ala., home, court records show.
Investigators determined that she was killed in a murder-for-hire plot by her husband, a debt-riddled Church of Christ preacher named Charles Sennett, to trade her life for insurance money. Charles Sennett contacted a man who then recruited two men to kill Elizabeth Sennett. One of them was Smith, who has said that he didn’t stab the woman. Charles Sennett paid the men $1,000 each — the equivalent of about $2,600 in today’s dollars.
After the state was unable to access Smith’s veins and called off his planned execution in 2022, state officials said, Smith chose nitrogen gas as his “preferred method of execution.”
Smith’s lawyers said their client was not asking the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the use of nitrogen gas, but whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits a second attempt to execute him after the failed attempt.
But Alabama’s lawyers kept the issue of nitrogen gas at the center of their argument that the execution should go forward.
Capital defense lawyers have criticized as unfair the burden death row prisoners face in challenging an execution method as unconstitutional: A 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving Oklahoma inmates held that to successfully challenge one method, prisoners must propose a workable alternative.
Alabama approved nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative execution method in 2018 and said the state’s death row prisoners could opt to die that way instead of through lethal injection, which was the default method. Smith did not elect nitrogen hypoxia at that time, arguing that he could not make an informed decision.
But he did note the nitrogen-gas alternative when he challenged his planned execution by injection in 2022. Alabama lawyers said that Smith’s acknowledgment of the nitrogen-gas method amounted to opting in.
Smith has said through his filings that he does not want to be executed by nitrogen gas, even though he acknowledged it as an option. The method involves piping gas through a face mask until the inmate’s oxygen is depleted and he is breathing only nitrogen, leading to death, according to the state’s heavily redacted protocol.
In media interviews, Smith has called the prospect terrifying.
Late Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit separately cleared the way for Smith’s execution Thursday, affirming a lower-court ruling that rejected his constitutional claims."
M70TULOJG7_VH2K1KW276PBKJI,Montgomery principal leaves amid harassment claims as turmoil grows in district,Nicole Asbury,"January 24, 2024 at 2:46 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/24/joel-beidleman-leaves-montgomery-county-schools/,"A former Montgomery County principal accused of sexual harassment and bullying is “no longer an employee” of the school system, a schools spokesman said Wednesday. A new report documents that the school system was warned of problems in its unit that investigates employee misconduct beginning in 2019 but took little corrective action.
The former principal, Joel Beidleman, had been on administrative leave since August when The Washington Post reported that the school system received at least 18 complaints alleging misconduct by him dating back to 2016. He has denied many of the allegations.
Montgomery schools spokesman Chris Cram declined to say Wednesday whether Beidleman was dismissed, saying it’s a personnel matter. He referred further questions to the former principal, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beidleman stopped receiving his pay Dec. 18.
Many teachers said a principal sexually harassed them. He was promoted.
The departure comes as the Montgomery district, Maryland’s largest school system, has faced criticism and investigations in recent months over how it handled misconduct allegations involving employees — and as the future of its leadership appears in doubt. Superintendent Monifa B. McKnight told reporters this week that the school board has indicated it wants her to step down, creating more uncertainty as the district tries to address problems and restore trust.
The turmoil has left some county officials perplexed.
“I’m not very happy with the way this thing is being handled,” County Executive Marc Elrich (D) said on a weekly call with reporters. “The amount of information we have is minimal.”
Much of the latest criticism was sparked by the allegations against Beidleman, who had been principal of William H. Farquhar Middle School in Olney, Md., until last school year. He was promoted last year to become principal of Paint Branch High School.
But the district placed him on leave after The Post sent questions to the school system this past summer asking about its handling of the misconduct complaints against Beidleman. School system employees and parents recounted a pattern of harassment, threats, retaliation, workplace bullying and other inappropriate misconduct spanning 12 years across three middle school campuses.
Baltimore-based law firm Jackson Lewis was hired to investigate the school system’s response, but the report released to the public in October was heavily redacted. It found that five individuals who participated in Beidleman’s promotion knew about an internal investigation into his conduct and that a central office employee tampered with the investigation.
After Jackson Lewis concluded its investigation, Montgomery County’s inspector general initiated two investigative inquiries of its own. The office said in December that an initial inquiry found evidence that Beidleman violated the school system’s sexual harassment and workplace bullying policies. The office said its investigation included interviews with 31 people with direct information related to alleged misconduct, including 15 who claimed to be victims of bullying, sexual harassment, retaliation and other violations. Beidleman participated in the inquiry.
Watchdog finds evidence of misconduct by Montgomery middle school principal
“I’m thankful that [Beidleman] will be not be treating any other teachers in this school system the way he treated the teachers at Farquhar or before that,” said Ben Israel, the teachers union representative assigned to the middle school during the 2022-2023 school year. “But I mean, the reality is that he was enabled clearly. The public evidence is immense that there was some amount of negligence and enabling going on at the highest levels of MCPS.”
Israel, who has since left the school system, added that he’s witnessed firsthand the widespread fear among MCPS employees. He has “no confidence” in any of the school system’s board leadership to remedy some of the issues.
On Wednesday, the inspector general released a report on its second inquiry, finding that a Montgomery County Public Schools unit in charge of investigating complaints of employee misconduct kept files in “chaotic condition” and that there wasn’t a clear process for how the unit should look into complaints.
“Our findings should not be surprising to some in senior management because similar observations were identified on at least four occasions dating back to 2019,” the county watchdog wrote. “Unfortunately, it does not appear that any substantive action was taken to address the previously noted findings and recommendations.” It did not name specific managers in the report.
Watchdog calls Montgomery schools’ handling of misconduct complaints ‘chaotic’
The Montgomery County Education Association — a union that represents teachers and other educators in the school system — said in a statement that the failures noted in the inspector general’s report “erodes our confidence in senior leaders entrusted with the oversight of this work.”
“The Board must put a swift end to the chaos,” it said.
McKnight said in a response letter to the inspector general that executive staff turnover could be a reason the recommendations weren’t implemented. She added in a later statement that she was “fully in alignment with the OIG’s recommendations” and pledged to “drive the reforms that will usher in a new era for MCPS.”
“As I’ve said from day one, these issues may not have started on my watch, but as superintendent, they will end on my watch,” McKnight said.
McKnight was previously charged by the school board to develop a “corrective action plan” for the school system. Some updates on the plan were shared this week, including a new system to track complaints and a more robust background check process for employees.
McKnight’s Wednesday statement did not address her apparent quarrel with the school board. She previously vowed to defend her reputation. Board members have punted questions on whether they have any doubts on her leadership.
Montgomery County schools superintendent says board wants her to step down
“That’s work that the board is responsible as an employer in terms of addressing,” the school board’s president, Karla Silvestre, said in an interview. “However, today we are talking about the IG report and her recommendations.”
Silvestre said the board is “committed to getting to the bottom of the root causes that led to this situation and holding individuals accountable.” She added that the board has held some individuals accountable but did not name specific people or actions taken.
Beidleman’s departure was the latest in a raft of personnel changes that has occurred in the Montgomery school district since the fall.
Former deputy superintendent Patrick Murphy left the school system in October. Donna Redmond Jones, associate superintendent of school support and well-being, was placed on leave in October and that remains her status, Cram said. Both of them would have had some hand in Beidleman’s promotion, The Post previously reported.
Eugenia Dawson, a director in the Office of School Support and Well-Being who oversaw Farquhar Middle School, is no longer on administrative leave. She remains employed by the school district, Cram said.
Diane Morris, associate superintendent of schools and well-being and Beidleman’s former supervisor, remains on leave, Cram said Wednesday. Morris, who was the principal of Farquhar Middle before Beidleman, managed his standard five-year evaluation during the 2022-2023 school year, according to a confidential internal school district document previously obtained by The Post.
Silvestre said the school board is aiming to restore trust with its community members by writing stronger policies for investigations of employees. She said the county inspector general is partnering with the school system to fix some of the systemic issues.
“We welcome this collaboration with the county that will assure our public that changes are really going to happen this time,” Silvestre said.
In the meantime, the Montgomery County Council has announced that it will conduct another joint oversight hearing Feb. 8 with its audit committee as well as the education and culture committee.
Council member Will Jawando (D-At Large), who chairs the education and culture committee, said Beidleman’s departure was “long overdue,” but there was still work to be done.
“We’ve made progress, but this didn’t start overnight,” Jawando said. “Are there other complaints in the school system that probably didn’t receive the attention that they probably should have? I think that’s absolutely true, given the many failures that are outlined in the IG report.”

Among those infected during a cruise on the vessel last month were three travelers from Montgomery County, Md., who were diagnosed with the virus two weeks after they returned from an overseas trip, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan confirmed Friday evening. All three are now recovering from moderate flu-like symptoms, health officials said.
It is unclear whether the outbreak on the ship is linked to other infections reported in the United States and elsewhere involving recent travelers to Egypt.
Eight people in the Houston area reportedly developed covid-19, caused by the virus, after they returned to the United States on Feb. 20 following a Nile cruise in Egypt. French authorities have said several people tested positive after visiting Egypt, and at least three cases have been confirmed in Canada among recent travelers to Egypt, according to Canadian authorities.
The Egyptian cruise ship workers were tested for the virus at the end of its 14-day incubation period, said Egyptian health authorities, which suggests the infections occurred during a cruise between the cities of Aswan and Luxor sometime in the third week of February.
Authorities have not disclosed the number and nationalities of passengers on that cruise.
Egyptian authorities were prompted to investigate a possible outbreak involving the Nile cruise after a Taiwanese American woman who had been aboard tested positive for the virus Feb. 28, after she returned to Taiwan, the joint statement said. Health officials said they suspect she had spread the virus to others on the cruise, including two unidentified Americans.
After Egyptian authorities were alerted to the woman’s infection, 12 workers on her ship were quarantined, and they tested positive on the last day of their isolation, officials said. Other people who had come into contact with the vessel and the workers have also been quarantined, the officials added, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Egypt reached 15.
A WHO epidemiologist said Friday that while the tests showed the virus was present in the workers’ bodies, none of them evinced symptoms, suggesting they had not readily passed the virus to many others.
“We know that is possible, but we do not believe that is a major driver of transmission,” Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters in Geneva. “If we look at the actual epidemics and how these epidemics are unfolding, if they were a major driver of transmission, it would have caused much larger numbers of cases.”
The 12 workers have been transferred to an isolation facility in a hospital for treatment. The cruise ship was named River A and was towed to an area 12 miles away from Luxor, according to the state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram, which cited security sources.
The vessels that cruise the Nile range in capacity, with some carrying as many as 150 passengers. The trip between Aswan and Luxor takes two to four nights, with the vessels stopping along the way for sightseeing.
The announcement of the new cases increased the number of confirmed infections in Egypt fivefold. Before Friday, the Arab world’s most populous nation, with more than 100 million people, had declared only three cases since the virus surfaced last year in China. The first, a Chinese national, recovered. The other two, a Canadian oil worker and an Egyptian who had returned from Serbia, are receiving treatment.
There have been growing concerns among Egyptians, on the streets, in dinner conversation and on social media, about a lack of official transparency. There are suspicious that the spread of the coronavirus could be larger than what the government has revealed so far. Egypt has not closed schools, halted Friday prayers or stopped other large gatherings of people to limit the spread of the virus.
The coronavirus outbreak is hitting the Middle East just as Egypt’s tourism — the country’s biggest earner of foreign currency — is showing signs of rebounding from political upheaval and terrorist attacks in recent years.
Cruising on the Nile has become a bucket-list item for travelers. Many itineraries are sold out for the coming summer season, according to industry reports.

MLMBW92TGM_4HVFEHEDZ850S5B,Triumphant Hindu mobs stoke fears in India after Modi delivers temple,Anant Gupta,"January 25, 2024 at 10:05 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/25/india-ayodhya-hindu-nationalism-attacks/,"NEW DELHI — In north India, Hindu nationalists clambered atop a mosque to plant the Hindu saffron flag. They did the same in central India, unfurling the standard of Lord Ram atop a Christian church. In the south, they burned down a Muslim fruit seller’s shop. And outside Mumbai’s financial capital, they pressured local police to bulldoze Muslim businesses.
In the past week, a spate of attacks by triumphant Hindu nationalist mobs against minorities, chiefly Muslims, has raised fears across India of religious tensions flaring following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consecration of a temple in Ayodhya that was seen in some quarters as a symbol of Hindu vengeance against India’s centuries-long oppression by Muslims.
Modi’s party has pushed for a more explicitly Hindu vision of India’s identity in contrast to the post-independence leaders who saw the country more as a secular, multicultural democracy.
From northern Uttar Pradesh to southern Telangana, each of the attacks in at least six Indian states followed a near-identical pattern: They erupted after men on motorcycles and jeeps waved Hindu nationalist saffron flags, blared loud devotional music from speakers and chanted the slogan “Jai Shri Ram,” or victory to Lord Ram, as they drove through Muslim neighborhoods.
Modi’s consecration of controversial Hindu temple caps years-long campaign
In each case, the violence either immediately preceded or followed the religious ceremony presided by Modi himself on Monday. In a soaring address from the temple premises, the prime minister, a staunch Hindu nationalist, congratulated citizens for successfully “untangling a historical knot” and building a “brighter future.”
The 71-acre temple complex is built at the site of the demolished Babri mosque that Hindu nationalists say was itself built on top of a razed Hindu temple in the 16th century and served as a reminder of Muslim domination over the majority Hindu subcontinent as long as it stood.
The mob attacks in the last four days have raised uneasy parallels to December 1992, when a Hindu mob agitating for the Ram temple in Ayodhya tore the Babri mosque down, sparking nationwide religious riots that killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Muslims. Mumbai was particularly hit hard by rioting, and months later, the Muslim mafia boss Dawood Ibrahim carried out revenge attacks that killed hundreds in early 1993.
Irfan Engineer, director of the Mumbai-based Center for Study of Society and Secularism, a nonprofit founded after the violence of 1993 to study riot-affected areas and propagate peaceful coexistence, compared the Hindu nationalist processions in Muslim neighborhoods to wartime marches performed by occupying militaries “for establishing control.”
“Muslims are slowly accepting that they must gulp down every insult because even the mildest reaction will invite trouble from the state,” he said.
Inside the vast digital campaign by Hindu nationalists to inflame India
In visuals circulating widely on social media in recent days, saffron-flag-wielding mobs have been seen pelting shops selling meat with stones or clothing stores with apparently Muslim business names. The provocative marches through Muslim neighborhoods have prompted Modi’s critics to caution against growing Hindu triumphalism under his watch.
The worst of the clashes took place in a suburban neighborhood north of Mumbai called Naya Nagar. The conflict started the evening before Monday’s temple consecration ceremony, when a Hindu motorcycle procession was stopped with barricades put up by Muslim residents.
The situation escalated when Nitesh Rane, a lawmaker from the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, demanded that the barricades be removed and threatened to “find and kill” those who blocked the Hindu processions.
Muslim residents then threw stones at another procession that passed through their neighborhood the next day.
Rane blamed the clashes on Muslim refugees from Myanmar and Bangladesh and called in government bulldozers as punishment. “Naya Nagar is not the new Pakistan,” he told reporters on Tuesday at a news conference. “We know very well what needs to be done there and how many bulldozers are needed.”
Rane could not be reached for comment.
Bulldozers then came through and destroyed illegally built structures belonging to 55 shopkeepers in Naya Nagar and another Muslim-majority neighborhood. As of Thursday, an uncertain peace has prevailed with 13 arrests, mostly of Muslims, according to local officials.
Tariq Chaudhary, a Muslim student, was driving his father’s truck around 8 p.m. on Tuesday near Mumbai when a mob of more than 200 young men charged at him armed with iron rods and wooden sticks and shouting, “Hail, Lord Ram.” They smashed the truck’s windshield, dragged him out and rained blows and kicks on him before moving on to another vehicle. Tariq suffered numerous cuts and bruises on his face, hands and back. His co-worker suffered a head injury and received four stitches at a local clinic.
“In Ayodhya, they said Lord Ram belongs to us all,” Chaudhary said by telephone. “Does Lord Ram teach them to drag Muslims out, beat them with sticks and force them to say, “Hail, Lord Ram”?
Even though reports in local media have trickled in this week of clashes in small towns and on college campuses, police have rarely made arrests or filed cases against Hindus and often punished Muslims or dissidents instead. One exception was in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh state, where police arrested three men for replacing a green Islamic flag on top of a mosque with a saffron banner.
On several campuses, heated debates have erupted over the temple inauguration, and in two cities, students were beaten or harassed when they tried to organize screenings of “Ram ke Naam,” or “In the Name of God,” a 1992 documentary film that delves into the controversial history behind the Hindu nationalist campaign to build the temple in Ayodhya.
After students at a film school in Pune promoted the documentary screening, a group of more than 20 men barged onto campus on Tuesday, scuffled with students and set their posters aflame.
The police briefly detained six of those involved before releasing them. On Wednesday, they filed a complaint against six of the organizers of the screening for “outraging religious feelings” and acting against “national integration.”"
MN8CLDG6L8_H3H7JHDSLBJLFEM,Man sentenced to 48 years in killing of Black transgender woman in Md.,Jasmine Hilton,"January 24, 2024 at 6:34 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/taya-ashton-murder-sentence/,"A 29-year-old man has been sentenced to 48 years in prison for the murder of a transgender woman he was in a relationship with in 2021 in Prince George’s County.
DeAllen Price fatally shot Taya Ashton in her apartment in Suitland, Md., on July 17, 2021, after he learned that Ashton was not born female, prosecutors said.
Price, of Capitol Heights, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence in October. Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy described Ashton, 20, as a “daughter and a beloved friend to many.”
“Taya’s death was a real tragedy for our community, as well as for her family. Her death represents so much more, in terms of our level of tolerance in our community for people who want to express themselves and live their lives on their own terms,” Braveboy said when announcing the sentence against Price on Wednesday. “Anyone who chooses to do that should be respected and [know] that their lives are as valuable as anyone else’s life.”
‘Please save us’: Dozens gather to mourn death of Black transgender woman
In a virtual news conference Wednesday, community leaders and advocates brought attention to the importance of preventing violence against transgender people and holding offenders accountable.
According to the Human Rights Campaign, at least 32 transgender and gender-nonconforming people were fatally shot or killed by other violent means in 2023. Eighty-four percent of those victims were people of color and 50 percent were Black transgender women.
Nationally, The Washington Post found that nearly half of transgender women killed between 2015 and 2020 died at the hands of an intimate partner.
Renee Lau, a representative from Baltimore Safe Haven, a nonprofit wellness center serving Black transgender women and LGBTQ community members, said that while violence “touches the entire community,” it disproportionately affects transgender people.

“The murder rate, the suicide rate and the deaths because of overdoses in our community reaches greater numbers because of the fact that we are such a small community,” Lau said.
Krystal Oriadha (D-District 7), the first openly LGBTQ member elected to the Prince George’s County Council, said the LGBTQ community is “often forgotten,” with many crimes against them going unreported.
In June, her efforts led to the Pride flag being raised at the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Prince George’s County for the first time.
“There’s something we can do when we all come together and say that we won’t let this stand,” Oriadha said, “and that we see you.”
In 2019, two transgender women were fatally shot in Prince George’s County, drawing attention to a lack of LGBTQ resources compared with neighboring jurisdictions like D.C. That same year, Braveboy created an LGBTQIA task force with the help of Oriadha, prosecutors and others in the community.
Braveboy said the task force features ambassadors from the state’s attorney’s office who partner with the community to reach members of the LGBTQ community to identify cases and individuals in need of support. Her office also works with the county police department’s LGBTQ outreach team.
Oriadha said she pushed legislation for an LGBTQ work group for nonprofits and county agencies to identify gaps in resources like housing and employment.
Prince George’s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) announced last year the hiring of the county’s first government liaison to the LGBTQ community.
According to online court records, Price is represented by the public defender’s office. A spokesperson for the Maryland Office of the Public Defender did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Prince George’s County Assistant State’s Attorney Sherrie Waldrup said Price and his defense attorney suggested at sentencing that his crime was unintentional, which Waldrup said she did not find credible.
Several of Ashton’s family members attended the virtual news conference and opted not to speak. Family and friends remembered Ashton at her candlelight vigil in Prince George’s two years ago, highlighting her hopes of starting a clothing boutique."
MXA8TYJZW5_CR3DT1HR03HL6TW,Dining at the best restaurant in one of America’s worst airports,Ben Pauker,"January 26, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/01/26/classified-newark-airport-secret-restaurant-united/,"Name me a place in this country where money and caste are brazenly delineated, and I’ll raise you: the airport. For the vast majority of us, air travel is now a grind: expensive, exhausting, if not downright exasperating. But for the elite, a better world awaits.
While you grab $7 Chex Mix at Hudson News, the rich cool their heels in a lounge with flutes full of brut. Feel their pitying  gaze as you shuffle past the front of the plane, clattering your carry-on through the aisle to your basic economy seat. The screaming kids never seem to be in business class.
But with the widespread adoption of premium travel credit cards, the perks of lounge access have become available to the bourgeoisie. And you can see the effect. Approach the airline lounge counter, and you’ll often be greeted with the welcome, “I’m sorry, we’re not taking Priority Pass customers right now.” If you do make your way in, every armchair may already be full. There’s free food and bad prosecco, but it’s no sanctuary.
So one airline has taken exclusivity a step further: United Airlines has Classified, the post-pandemic rebirth of a secret invitation-only restaurant tucked away behind a private door. It’s not advertised or even teased in commercials; it’s the kind of word-of-mouth thing that makes marketers and travel bloggers salivate. The caveat is that it’s at Newark Airport, widely regarded as the one of the worst airports in the United States.
To gain access, you input your name and United MileagePlus number on a special website. The algorithm is a secret; status is no guarantee that you’ll get a reservation. United representatives say it takes in a variety of factors, including loyalty and frequency of travel. Boasting a measly Silver status on United, I didn’t make the cut, but my partner’s Gold did the trick, so I booked a reservation under her name.
So in spitting cold rain on the busiest travel weekend of the year, after a holiday with family in New York, we drove to Newark Airport, young kids in tow, to see how the elite lunch.
Classified, a double entendre if there ever was one, is hidden behind the cheerful bistro Saison in Newark’s Terminal C. At the back of the restaurant, past an unmarked door, we’re led down a dark corridor into the small, rectangular dining room.
(Full disclosure: United arranged for us to get through security without plane tickets, but you’ll need to book travel if you want to try Classified yourself.)
Tables are set with wine glasses and seasonal flower arrangements. Modern brass chandeliers hang from recessed ceiling mounts, caramel leather dining chairs are tucked beneath generous white tables, and the banquettes along the wall are nestled in molded clamshell pods with a wavy pattern. A wall of windows, divided by gauzy curtains, looks out onto the silent tarmac. It’s an oasis of calm, marred only by two unnecessary flat-screen TVs on either end of the room.
Only three tables were occupied at 1 p.m. — unusually quiet for a busy travel weekend, though our charming server Aaron Murrell said it fills up fast during breakfast and dinner hours.
“Ooh, it’s beautiful,” my daughter loudly exclaimed, plopping herself into a chair and reaching for her coloring books. Immediately, I became hyper-conscious of the kids’ behavior: “Don’t ruin this for the fancy people,” I thought.
The menu is refined modern steakhouse, including a raw bar (that’s on you if a half-dozen littleneck clams seems like a good idea before a bumpy flight to Cleveland), salads, sandwiches and cuts of dry-aged prime beef. It’s not cheap, but pace David Brooks and his New York Times expense account: $78 here will still get you a jumbo shrimp cocktail, steak tartare and a negroni poured tableside.
A middle-aged couple from Colorado, visiting their daughter in New York, were dining by the window. Outside in the frigid early-winter rain, baggage handlers were unloading a plane and tossing luggage into carts. They’ve been to Classified a half-dozen times. “Why are we letting people know about this place?” the wife said, offering that she sits on the boards of health-care companies. I asked her husband what he does for a living. He paused, warily. “Let’s say I’m retired … for now.”
Retired? Frequent fancy airport dining? Clearly, I’m in the wrong business.
“We have a lot of repeat guests that come back frequently,” said chef Frank Pulgiano, 60, who helms the kitchen at Classified. “There’s nothing like it in the world.” But is the food any good?
We started with a Tsukiji tuna crudo over a spicy mayo, dotted with chunks of avocado and cracked black pepper. It was fine, though I’d wager that it’s not flown in daily from the famous — but now shuttered — Tokyo fish market. A dull Caesar salad followed. My 5-year-old daughter tore through the truffle mac and cheese with toasted breadcrumbs, though, an adult, I found it almost entirely devoid of that mushroom-y flavor. My son’s burger — a 28-day dry-aged Pat LaFrieda patty — was solid. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered one recently, Pulgiano said.
Zachary Friedman and Ethan Sukoneck, cousins and both students at Ohio State, were grabbing a bite before a flight back to school. “I would much rather be here than the new United Clubs. I’ve been in all of them. It’s a nicer environment, and the food is fantastic,” Friedman said.
Sukoneck concurred: “This blows the food at school out of the water.”
A butter-poached filet of halibut with chimichurri was overcooked, and the watercress salad alongside looked beat up. The New York strip steak was well-seasoned and tender — and it better be: The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey mandates that all knives at the airport be rounded or plastic. Desserts were a seasonal pumpkin tart with whipped cream and berries, and a chocolate hazelnut Paris-Brest. The kids wiped the plates clean.
I asked Eric Antmann, a technology salesperson from Miami who was dining alone, what he thought of his experience. “Eleven out of 10,” Antmann said, noting that he would book travel through Newark again over New York airports just to eat at Classified. Okay, let’s not go quite that far.
Is it the best restaurant in Newark Airport? Absolutely. Is it the classiest restaurant in an American airport? Probably. Is it a good restaurant? Sorry, no.
By the standards of any city, it’s just meh. Despite lovely service and a nice room, the food just doesn’t hit the high notes — and that’s perhaps understandable with one kitchen churning out plates for four different restaurants across the terminal. If you’ve ever flown in international business class (particularly on an Asian or Emirati airline), you’ll have been wowed by the meal service aboard. There’s just something magical about eating sushi or a lamb tagine at 35,000 feet. But back on the ground, that food wouldn’t pass muster.
I’ve had Korean BBQ tacos from a food truck inside a terminal at Los Angeles that were legitimately good. Rick Bayless’s Tortas Frontera in O’Hare packs the heat and killer micheladas. Austin has an outpost of the famous Salt Lick BBQ if you want the meat sweats before boarding.
But the experience of Classified counts for something. It makes you feel special, cocooned, elite. There’s something legitimately cool about a speakeasy-style spot in an airport. Sure, lunch for a family of four with a glass of wine and a cocktail cost about the same as an economy plane ticket. But that’s beside the point for those who can afford it.
The Colorado woman wearily sighed, referring to the perceived lack of exclusivity of United’s elite status tier: “Isn’t the whole world 1K?”
For the rest of us, who hoard our twice-annual lounge passes like they’re bullion, one can only dream. (Travel blogs say you’ll need to spend roughly $20,000 on airfare to achieve that status. But hey, free bag check and preboarding!) If you’re lucky enough to get an invite to Classified, it’s well worth the money for that taste of rarefied air.
But be warned: The thrill of dining like the rich makes it hard to go back to normal life. You’ll forever look down your nose at a southwestern chicken wrap pulled from a grab-and-go refrigerator. The thought of cramming into the back of a plane for a four-hour flight after a taste of the good life is almost too much to bear.

N1QGPAV1LP_MKRHDBYJA3GBOVJ,Will it really take Haley a month to read the writing on the wall?,Philip Bump,"January 24, 2024 at 10:18 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/haley-pressure-end-campaign/,"Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley stepped out on the stage at her election-night party only about 20 minutes after polls closed in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. Normally, candidates wait until later in the evening to speak to their supporters, after a substantial portion of the votes have been counted and races have been called.
The Republican primary in New Hampshire had been called, but only a small fraction of votes had been reported. Which, it seems safe to assume, is why Haley came out so early.
“We’re the last one standing next to Donald Trump,” she said to cheers. “And today we got close to half of the vote. We still have a ways to go, but we keep moving up!”
At the time, she was a lot closer to half the vote than she was as vote-counting ground on. Her “we did great and are pushing forward” landed better when she was down by a point or two than it would have when she was later down by double digits. In other words, she made the case for moving forward past New Hampshire while it was still somewhat credible to do so.
That eroded by midnight. And her suggestion that she will push on to the primary in South Carolina one month from Wednesday is barely credible at all.

In fairness, there are multiple ways to “run for president.” More than 280 people filed to run for president as Republicans; the vast majority of them simply filed the paperwork so that they could tell the guys at the bar that they were presidential candidates. There is no hard-and-fast benchmark for when campaigns begin or end, so Haley could simply scale things way back and mostly wait the next four weeks out.
This is not what Haley suggested in New Hampshire. She suggested that she would be going full-bore, spending money and holding events and buying TV spots (like ones already airing in her home state).
It’s an effort that seems impossible to sustain, for myriad reasons.
First, New Hampshire had an unusually Haley-friendly electorate. Exit polling suggests that only about half of those who voted Tuesday were Republicans. They backed Trump by a 3-to-1 margin, giving him his 12-point (as of this writing) victory margin. Haley did well with independents (and some self-identified Democrats), but in most future contests the electorate will be restricted to members of the GOP.
Future contests will also not be framed the way New Hampshire was, as a last-ditch way to derail Trump’s nomination. A lot of the support Haley had there came from non-Republican Trump opponents eager to stand in the former president’s way, the sort of political jumbling on which New Hampshire voters often pride themselves. Her failure to come within single digits of Trump in either of the first two contests despite that anti-Trump energy does not support the idea that she will be able to muster it again in the future.
Second, there will be an enormous amount of pressure on her to drop out. Republican officials (including Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel) have called for Haley to allow Trump to shift to general-election mode, and they will increasingly do so. The pro-Trump Republican base, meanwhile, will be incentivized moving forward to demonstrate to Haley that her narrowly open pre-Iowa window has now firmly closed.
More Republicans are likely to follow Sen. John Cornyn’s lead. Cornyn (R-Tex.), apathetic to Trump on most days, responded to the New Hampshire call by endorsing Trump’s candidacy. There is very little space within the party not to follow that example.
Third, Trump will do everything in his power to attack Haley and any wavering Republicans. We saw this Tuesday night, when a furious Trump attacked his opponent both in his election-night speech and relentlessly on social media. Haley has managed to largely avoid Trump’s wrath over the past year, in part because he was so focused on kneecapping Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). He will be unsparing in attacking her or other wavering Republicans over the next four weeks if Haley stays in — especially if she continues to attack him.
There could be blowback for this, certainly, particularly among women as Trump inevitably goes too far over the line. But the list of Republicans who have been able to parlay Trump attacks to their own political advantage is vanishingly short.
Fourth, four weeks is a long time in politics, especially when there are no head-to-head contests on the calendar. (Nevada votes early next month, but Haley is not actively competing there for delegates.) Elections energize campaigns. Lulls drain them. Granted, South Carolina is her home state. But it still means day after day of events while her party calls on her to drop out and Trump and his allies unload on her. It means millions of dollars poured into a contest that is measurable only in poll numbers. Quality independent polling in the state is scarce, but to date Haley only once has been above 30 percent. In her home state.
Fifth, it’s likely that donors will be increasingly unwilling to pour more money into the effort. The money is one thing; many big donors have more than enough of it that tossing a million or two at a candidate isn’t a big deal. But donors, too, can face the wrath of the Republican establishment. If you think Trump won’t notice a big donor who sticks with Haley over the next month, you have perhaps not been paying much attention to Trump over the last eight years.
Most donors, of course, aren’t big donors. If Republicans see the race as over, individuals will presumably also be less likely to hand more over to Haley so that she can grind on for the next month. And for most of them, such contributions are a big deal.
Sixth, Haley likely has future aspirations. If Haley wants to run again (in 2028 or for something else), she’ll want to minimize the extent to which she frustrates Republican voters.
Finally, does Haley want to be embarrassed in her home state? Maybe internal campaign polling suggests a closer contest than (relatively old) public polling does. Maybe she sees a path to victory there that isn’t obvious to others. To date, of course, the best-case scenarios for Haley — second in Iowa, win in New Hampshire — have not panned out.
If she fails to win her home state, her campaign will almost certainly end — and on as negative a note as you can get. If she loses by a wide margin? Even worse.
Again, there’s a form of campaigning that is mostly running out the clock. But Haley doesn’t have that luxury. Trump and probably many Republicans seem to have seen New Hampshire as an act of graciousness, letting Haley lose on her own terms. That patience will have evaporated after Tuesday night, and Haley can be expected to spend the next month campaigning while under withering criticism.
If she stays in the race."

N6M671E35R_AGPDB5BTVC1M2HW,Daughter saves her mother’s life with organ donations — twice,Cathy Free,"January 23, 2024 at 8:05 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/01/23/organ-transplant-maryland-mom-daughter/,"When Julia Harlin found out her liver was failing, she sat her five children down and told them not to donate their own organs to her. She didn’t want them to go through the stress of testing and surgery.
But daughter Eileen Harlin went behind her back and got tested anyway. She found out she was a match, and she broke the news to her mother on Mother’s Day in 2022.
“She told me, ‘Mom, you’re going to be mad at me, but for the last four months, I’ve been having all the tests done, and I’m going to be your donor,’” recalled Julia, 71, of Frederick, Md.
Julia tried to say no, but her children all told her it was her best shot at staying alive. They overruled her.
Julia’s liver was failing because of a condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. She’d had her name placed on the United Network for Organ Sharing waiting list, but as the months ticked on and Julia became weaker and sicker, Eileen and two of her siblings decided to secretly undergo testing to see whether one of them was a compatible donor. Eileen was the only match.
“My mom is my universe — I couldn’t imagine not doing it for her,” said Eileen, 39, who lives less than two hours from her parents in Windsor, Pa., and works as an office manager for an orthodontist in Baltimore.
During a liver donation, a piece of the liver is taken from a donor and given to the recipient. The liver is the only organ in the body that can regenerate, typically within months after surgery.
“I felt like this was something I could do,” said Eileen, who is single and doesn’t have children, like her siblings do. “If I didn’t donate and something bad happened to my mom, I couldn’t have lived with myself.”
“Nobody was ready to not have our mom in our lives,” she added. “It was a gift I was happy to give.”
After successful liver transplant surgery in August 2022 at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, Julia thought nothing could top her daughter’s generosity.
But then last month, six days before Christmas, Eileen gave her mom a second life-renewing gift: She donated one of her kidneys.
She is only the 14th person in the United States to donate both a kidney and a portion of her liver to the same recipient on different dates, according to David Klassen, chief medical officer for the United Network for Organ Sharing.
More than 46,000 transplants were done in the United States last year, including 6,950 from living donors, he said.
“It’s extremely rare to have a single living donor donate two organs — Julia was initially apprehensive about having her daughter donate again,” added Daniel Maluf, director of the transplant program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Maluf was Julia’s surgeon for both of her transplants.
Julia had low kidney function before her liver transplant because of her liver disease and her age, he said.
When her kidneys began to fail last year and she was hospitalized in September, Eileen and her siblings were tested again to become potential kidney donors.
Once again, Eileen learned that she was the only sibling who was a match, so she drove to Frederick to give her mom and her dad, Don Harlin, the news that she was going to donate a kidney.
“I told her, ‘Oh no you won’t!’” Julia recalled. “She’d already done it, and I didn’t want her to go through another transplant.”
She soon realized she didn’t have much choice.
“My doctors said I would never get a deceased donor’s kidney,” Julia said. “Because of my age, they would give it to someone younger. And I was going downhill fast.”
“They didn’t want to put her on dialysis because it would hurt the liver she’d gotten the year before,” Eileen added. “We were in a time crunch, so I told my mom that no matter what, I was going to do it.”
After the University of Maryland Medical Center’s ethics advisory committee approved Eileen’s decision to donate another organ to her mom, the pair were wheeled into adjoining operating rooms on Dec. 19 for the four-hour transplant.
“Everything went great — [Julia] will be able to have a normal life again,” said Maluf, noting that she will receive frequent checkups over the next year. Eileen said she has only one more bloodwork checkup, then she will be tested for any irregularities once a year.
Julia said she was shocked by how much better she felt after she received her daughter’s kidney.
“When we both walked out of the hospital two days after the transplant, I had so much energy that I didn’t know what to do with myself,” she said.
“I knew that if it wasn’t for Eileen, I’d be dead by now or still waiting for a donor,” Julia added. “She doesn’t even like having her blood drawn, and yet she stepped up.”
Eileen said donating two organs is a small price to pay to see her mom happy and healthy, with increased vitality.
“Her coloring is better, her outlook is better, and now she has more time to enjoy her 12 grandkids,” she said. “My mom is so deserving — she loves life, and she wants to see her grandchildren graduate from high school and get married.”
“I’m really grateful that I was able to do it, because a lot of people may not get that chance,” Eileen added.
Valentine’s Day is coming up, and Eileen said she hasn’t decided yet whether to give her mom flowers or chocolates.
“I don’t think I’ll be giving her another organ,” she said."
N8X21NRY17_NS1TL1Z2G18U81G,South Africa’s genocide case against Israel spotlights a global divide,Ishaan Tharoor,"January 26, 2024 at 12:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/south-africa-icj-israel-case-historical-global-divide/,"You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.
All eyes  were on The Hague  on Friday, where judges at the International Court of Justice  ruled on South Africa’s request for interim orders as part of its genocide case against Israel. The case was brought to the highest court of the United Nations amid the devastating, ongoing Israeli war with Hamas. In this preliminary phase of the case, the court  ordered Israel to do more to prevent the killing and harm of Palestinians in Gaza. Backers of the South African-led case  were hoping the judges would endorse a cease-fire.
U.N. court orders Israel to do more to prevent killing, harm in Gaza
Despite Friday’s initial ruling, the full case over whether Israel is carrying out genocide will rumble on likely for years. Israel has bitterly fought the charge. It casts the accusation of genocide brought against it as “libel,” given both the brazen Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that provoked the current war and the deeper history of the Holocaust that preceded the founding of the Jewish state.
“A terrorist organization carried out the worst crime against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, and now someone comes to defend it in the name of the Holocaust? What brazen gall,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in reaction to South Africa launching its case. “South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”
The ICJ’s rulings are legally binding, but require U.N. Security Council resolutions for there to be genuine mechanisms, like sanctions, to implement them — something that’s unlikely in this context given the United States’ long-standing practice of shielding Israel from international censure. But the fact that Israel has participated vigorously in the proceedings may mean it could find it harder to shrug off a ruling it does not like. South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor will be present at the court on Friday — a sign, perhaps, of Pretoria’s confidence in its argument.
What to know about the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ
South Africa’s team of lawyers laid out their argument before the court two weeks ago. More than 100 days of fighting have seen more than 25,000 Palestinians killed — the majority of whom are women and children — led to more than 85 percent of Gaza’s population being driven from their homes, and triggered a potential famine and humanitarian crisis whose combined speed, scale and severity, argue international aid groups, is unprecedented in modern memory.
“The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children, all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,” said South African lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
My colleagues summarized the case: “South Africa points to Israel’s large-scale killing and maiming of civilians; its use of ‘dumb’ bombs; the mass displacement and the destruction of neighborhoods; ‘deprivation of access to adequate food and water,’ medical care, shelter, clothes, hygiene and sanitation to civilians; its obliteration of Palestinian civic institutions; and its failure to provide any place of safety for Gazans. South Africa also accuses Israel of preventing Palestinian births by displacing pregnant people, denying them access to food, water and care, and killing them.”
South Africa’s lawyers also presented a voluminous scroll of statements from Israeli officials and politicians that appeared to prove the “genocidal” intent of Israeli actions — including calls for Gaza’s annihilation and the wholesale displacement of Palestinians living there. In response, Israel argued that these quotes were cherry-picked, articulated in a moment of trauma and anger in Israeli society, and did not reflect the official policy of the country’s war cabinet.
The Israeli right hopes not just for victory in Gaza, but also conquest
As the case gets litigated, it also has tapped into a pronounced global divide. South Africa is spearheading the charge against Israel out of a sense of historic commitment to the Palestinian people, who, South African officials contend, are subject to a regime of 21st century apartheid not wholly dissimilar to what existed in 20th century South Africa. “Like us,” Nelson Mandela said in 1990, “the Palestinians are fighting for the right to self-determination.”
“The significance of the fact that the country bringing the case is South Africa — an icon of the ravages of colonialism, settlement and apartheid — cannot be lost on anyone,” wrote Nesrine Malik, a Sudanese-British columnist for the Guardian. “It symbolizes a vast racial injustice, too raw and recent to be dismissed as ancient history.”
Western commentators have been quick to point out the supposed hypocrisy in South Africa’s position, given its government’s cozy relationship with Russia and seeming indifference to the Kremlin’s allegedly genocidal campaigns in Ukraine. But that example is already a source of frustration for many countries outside the West, which see a pronounced gap between American and European outrage over Russian war crimes in Ukraine and their complicity in the destruction of Gaza.
“It is the complaint of the Global South against Western criteria of moral superiority,” noted Le Monde’s Sylvie Kauffmann. “It calls into question an international order established by the defendant’s most powerful ally, the United States. It is also a challenge to a collective memory dominated by the Holocaust, which is openly opposed to that of colonization.”
And South Africa is not alone. Lining up behind it is a cast of countries from the so-called Global South — from Brazil to Turkey, Colombia to Bangladesh. Countries like Chile and Mexico have also referred alleged Israeli crimes for investigation by the International Criminal Court. According to a tally by Sarang Shidore and Dan Ford of the Quincy Institute, governments that represent some 60 percent of the population of “Global South” countries are now either leading or backing international legal action against Israel.
When Germany signaled that it would present a third-party defense of Israel at the ICJ, claiming that South Africa’s case had “no basis,” it triggered an outraged objection from Namibia — a former German colony that experienced what’s now recognized as the 20th century’s first genocide at the hands of German colonial authorities. It speaks volumes of the global moment that a war in the Middle East can stir historical animosities continents away.
“Few conflicts in the world have such global reverberations as this one. … All over the world people have a position on this,” Dahlia Scheindlin, a Tel Aviv-based political analyst, told the Financial Times. “So I can imagine any decision by the court is going to inflame both sides in one way or the other.”"

NF46SLP485_WKFW9TZVWHCXSRU,Opinion Israel needs to let journalists freely report the news in Gaza,_,"January 25, 2024 at 7:30 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/israel-gaza-news-reporters-access/,"Clarissa Ward is the chief international correspondent for CNN.
Within hours of Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7, I traveled with my team to Israel to take stock of the aftermath. We visited Beeri kibbutz, where the blood of nearly 100 victims was still smeared on the floor, and the site of the Tribe of Nova trance music festival, littered with the belongings of those who had fled for their lives. We interviewed the wounded and the grieving, including family members of the hostages held in Gaza. Walking along the border area where Hamas militants had poured into Israel, we came under heavy rocket fire. All of this contributed to our ability to create a vivid picture of the monstrosities of Oct. 7.
We must now be able to report on the horrific death and destruction being meted out in Gaza in the same way — on the ground, independently — amid one of the most intense bombardments in the history of modern warfare. And yet international journalists have been barred from entering Gaza without an escort from the Israel Defense Forces, even as criticism of the devastation brought by Israeli’s retaliation continues to mount.
Last month, we became the only Western journalists to gain access to Gaza without the IDF, during a one-off trip facilitated by the United Arab Emirates. We had only two hours on the ground. Two hours to cover more than two months of relentless bombing. During this brief time, we met children who had been maimed and orphaned being treated at a UAE-run field hospital. After an Israeli strike hit nearby, we were in the operating room as the casualties arrived. We drove past the rubble from recent bombing and watched people lining up at a bakery for food. Our trip provided a window into the war zone, but only a small one.
I have been covering conflicts for nearly 20 years, having reported from wars, uprisings and coups in Syria, Iraq, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Russia, Egypt, Ukraine, Yemen and China. In every case, all sides have attempted to shape reporting in the service of a desired narrative. Often, strenuous efforts are made to prevent outside and independent journalists from entering the conflict zone at all.
This month, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a petition from the Foreign Press Association for access to Gaza because of “security concerns.” Israeli officials have cited these concerns again and again to block international journalists’ entry to Gaza. Egypt, too, has stopped journalists from crossing its border into the territory, insisting that nothing and no one can go in without Israel’s permission.
In November, CNN and 10 other Western media outlets, including The Post, appealed to Israeli and Egyptian authorities for access to Gaza, proposing to assume full responsibility for the security of their reporting teams on the ground and highlighting their many years of experience operating in hostile environments. Their letter went unanswered.
The response to our report on Gaza in Israeli media suggests an unspoken reason for denying access. When asked on air about our piece, one reporter from the Israeli Channel 13 replied, “If indeed Western reporters begin to enter Gaza, this will for sure be a big headache for Israel and Israeli hasbara.” Hasbara is a Hebrew word for pro-Israel advocacy.
It’s not that the world can’t see what’s happening in Gaza. Our airwaves and social media feeds have been inundated with harrowing images and videos captured by the courageous journalists living there. They have risked everything to document the situation on the ground and have paid a high price for doing so. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 76 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza so far — more than the number killed in the entire Second World War.
But Gaza’s journalists should not be left to cover this war alone. In a conflict where information has been weaponized, where every claim is met with a dizzying counter claim and misinformation is thriving, international journalists can add an invaluable perspective.
More than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, of which an estimated 70 percent are women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry, numbers that the U.S. government does not dispute. How many of the civilian casualties could have been avoided? Weighing the density of the urban population against Hamas’s practice of embedding within, and below, civilian infrastructure, is the IDF’s strategy acceptable? Do the facts on the ground support the IDF’s contention that it is exercising restraint to minimize Palestinian deaths? As conflict reporters, it’s our job to provide perspective on these crucial questions.
Marie Colvin, a renowned journalist who was killed in 2012 while reporting in Homs, Syria, encapsulated the mandate of international conflict journalists: “Our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice.”
Looking to the future, what will be possible for Gazans when the guns stop? What do they want? What will they need to rebuild their shattered lives? Their voices must be heard.
As a democracy with a vibrant free press, Israel, like the United States, purports to hold itself to high standards. The freedom to report the news is not only a cornerstone of democracy, but also a fundamental human right. According to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right “to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers” should be protected. Barring international media from a conflict or indeed any other event is a dangerous precedent. Journalists must be able to exercise our duty to bear witness, no matter how difficult or dangerous that might be.

NG1FD0PPVR_XS61ZR4GWSTSQIX,Opinion The big winner of the 2024 GOP primaries was the ‘big lie’,Ramesh Ponnuru,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/24/the-big-lie-won-2024-republicans/,"Among Republicans, the lie has won.
When Donald Trump insisted against all evidence that he had won the 2020 election in a “landslide,” it was not merely a psychological defense against the fact of his defeat. It was a canny, though reckless, political tactic. It preserved his political viability in the Republican Party and kept him from smelling like a loser. Republicans never had the normal discussion of what they, and their candidate, did wrong in their failed campaign: a discussion that would have had to dwell on Trump’s character flaws and the general public’s reaction to them.
You could see the results in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Voters in the GOP contest were split roughly evenly on whether President Biden had won legitimately last time. If the primary had been confined to Republicans, there would almost certainly have been a solid majority for the view that Trump had won and had been cheated. The elected Republicans who didn’t want Trump to be the nominee have allowed his narrative about 2020 to go unchallenged for the past three years. Or they have abetted it, letting sane complaints about voting procedures and media coverage cover for Trump’s fantasies about Venezuelan interference with voting machines and the like.
Now those politicians get to run again with Trump and feign happiness about it on the record. Nikki Haley sounded defiant last night, but the Republican contest is over. She lost in a state, New Hampshire, that was tailor-made for her candidacy: full of secular voters, with independents eligible to vote in the primary, and with the support of the governor. Eight days earlier, Ron DeSantis had lost in Iowa, a state that seemed well-suited to him. The drumbeat is going to get ever louder that Haley should now follow DeSantis in exiting the race and endorsing Donald Trump.
The assumption behind that pressure is that the earlier the party unifies, the more likely it is that it will win in November. That logic is usually sound, but it is possible Trump will start to look weaker once a race between him and Biden begins in earnest.
The court cases against him are going to grind on. They helped him with Republican voters in the primaries. But in the exit polls, a significant percentage of voters — even his own voters — said criminal convictions would render him unfit for the presidency. Some of those voters may not be accurately forecasting their own behavior. But only a fraction of them would need to defect to sink Trump.
Trump has also benefited from receding a bit from the forefront of public consciousness. Normal people haven’t been reading his social media posts or even reading about them. That’s going to change, both because of the media and because of Democratic ads. The more voters see Trump, the more a lot of them will remember what they dislike about him.
There has been an anti-Trump majority in every national election since he announced his candidacy in 2015, and that majority had enough electoral strength to prevail in large part in 2018, 2020 and 2022. The one time he won, in 2016, it was arguably only because the majority didn’t believe he could win. That complacency won’t be present this November.
And Trump has deteriorated as a candidate since his victory eight years ago. He has gotten millions of Americans to identify with his travails, even those he has done a lot to bring on himself. But he has had less and less to say about anything else.
What Trump has going for him is, of course, Biden, who is 3½ years older but seems even older than that, and a Democratic Party that resists letting Biden accommodate public opinion on immigration and other issues.
Republican elites have been irresponsible in their cowardice toward Trump. Biden has been irresponsible in his assertion: He chose to run despite his age and his polls, having earlier chosen a vice president whom Democrats do not want to replace him.
The result: The primaries are effectively over, and the general election won’t be over fast enough."
NL4MBII1U9_MDDL3D1NYIRFLQF,Growing number of apps help automate pro-Israel activism online,Taylor Lorenz,"January 25, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/24/gaza-israel-activism-online/,"As the war in Gaza rages on, and both sides battle for support and public attention, supporters of Israel are making use of tools that allow them to mass report pro-Palestinian content as violating a platform’s rules.
The tools also generate AI-written suggested responses to posts online, allowing users to flood the comments of pro-Palestinian posts with pro-Israel messaging.
Experts who study communication online say the widespread use of such tools influences the online discussion of the war and is ushering in a new era of citizen-led propaganda campaigns. But the use of the tools does not appear to violate platform rules against what’s known as “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” or posts that appear to come from unrelated individuals but are really the result of an organized effort, often through automated accounts.
“Working in an orchestrated fashion can be violative, but it quickly becomes a gray area, and that’s why these apps exist,” said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights at Free Press, a nonpartisan organization that lists its goals as protecting free expression and civil liberties.
Researchers say it is difficult to determine which comments have been generated by such tools because there’s no way to publicly track a user’s private activity across multiple apps. Social media companies would have to come up with ways to detect their use, which is challenging because the apps operate on their own platforms, not those of the social media companies. If the apps were automatically posting, they would likely violate rules against inauthentic activity. But third-party apps that simply encourage legitimate users to report posts escape that sanction.
There’s also no way to know with precision that actions taken against someone’s account or posts are in response to activity from these apps. Anecdotally, some users report that after their Instagram and TikTok posts were mentioned on the apps, the posts were either removed or heavily downranked, making them less accessible to a large audience.
Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, did not respond to a request for comment. TikTok also did not respond to requests for comment.
“I’ve had many posts taken down, I’d say upwards of 15 to 20 posts removed,” said Nys, a content creator who posts on TikTok under the handle @palestinianpr1ncess and spoke on the condition that she be referred to by first name only because she’s worried about repercussions when traveling to the West Bank. Nys said that each of her posts that has been surfaced on one of the apps has received a flood of pro-Israel, seemingly AI-generated comments. The post is also usually removed after many users report it for bullying or hate speech. “I’m not using hate speech,” Nys said. “I’m just doing commentary on everything happening in Palestine.”
Laura Chung, a content creator and podcaster, said that she believes a mass reporting campaign facilitated by one of the apps is what led to her TikTok account being removed in December. “I was creating pro-Palestine content for education purposes and I was going massively viral,” she said. “I believe it’s these apps that got me banned on TikTok.”
Joan Donovan, a noted disinformation expert who is an assistant professor of journalism at Boston University, said the apps are a new development in the propaganda battle being waged on the internet over Israel’s offensive in Gaza and that social media companies need to find ways to monitor their use.
“Social media is a terrain of warfare, not just for cyber troops, but also for citizen battalions armed with AI-enhanced bots and the ability to generate endless unique posts that evade current content moderation tools,” she said. “It is incumbent on tech companies to defend against such abuses.”
“This level of organization only exists on one side of the conflict,” said Emerson T. Brooking, a former cyber policy adviser to the Defense Department who studies disinformation and propaganda campaigns as a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “It exists for pro-Israel voices, and it exists because there are government ministries in Israel that support these tools and encourage their use.”
Brooking and other experts said they aren’t aware of any similar tools for Palestinian supporters.
At least one of these apps is directly tied to Israel. The app, called Moovers, encourages users to “Advocate for Israel, One Click at a Time.” It pulls in allegedly pro-Palestinian content from Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X in a never-ending feed, allowing users easily to take action on that content, reporting it for review or commenting on it. It also provides pre-written pro-Israel scripts to respond to such posts.
In early December, a representative from Leaders, a Tel Aviv-based Israeli influencer marketing firm, began contacting creators in the United States, offering to pay them to promote Moovers to their audiences on Instagram. In emails viewed by The Washington Post, a representative from Leaders touted content on the Moovers app as “endorsed by Israel’s Government Advertising Agency.”
Words of Iron, another pro-Israel app, functions almost identically. It claims to surface anti-Israel posts collected by a team of social media experts and offers to “boost Israel’s voice on social media with a single click.” The app also provides “progress reports” to users with a daily progress bar, gamifying the experience and encouraging users to engage more.
What these tools categorize as anti-Israel content is broad and unclear. Several posts surfaced by Words of Iron featured content creators discussing news reports of a Palestinian teenager who was allegedly sexually assaulted while in Israeli custody, for example. Another post encouraged users of the app to mass report a post from influencer and lawyer Rosy Pirani, who posted on Christmas Day that Jesus was Palestinian.
Pirani said she didn’t know how many times the flagging of her post caused it to be reported to Instagram. Instagram does not share that information. But her posts no longer are being recommended to non-followers, her content is banned from the Explore page and the Reels tab, and she is no longer allowed to monetize her posts, she said.  “It’s sad to see content that’s in no way antisemitic being reported,” Pirani said.  “Sites like Words of Iron are scaring other content creators from posting about Palestine. They’re chilling free speech, and that’s what they aim to do.”
Some of the content the tool surfaces isn’t specifically anti-Israel, but is antisemitic. For instance, the website surfaced posts made by content creator Lucas Gage, who was suspended from X after making antisemitic comments.
Project Truth, another web tool, allows users to post the text of any tweet deemed critical of Israel and receive a pre-written “fact check” response to copy and paste online.
In response to a post on X by Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host, quoting Al Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh bemoaning what he said was “the lack of sufficient support from Western journalists and press organizations” for Palestinian journalists, Project Truth suggested this response: “Hamas uses human shields, making conflict zones chaotic. Israel warned civilians to evacuate. When Hamas endangers its own, silence on that is the real issue. Where’s the outrage for their methods? #HamasHumanShields #SelectiveOutrage #IsraelUnderAttack.”
""We feel that we are being killed twice: once by the bombs and once by this silence."" @WaelDahdouh on the lack of sufficient support from Western journalists and press organizations around the world. pic.twitter.com/X7XlDnN7GX
The apps’ impact on the perception of the war online is undeniable, Benavidez said.
“These tools upend authenticity and they make it harder for people to understand what’s happening on their feeds and recognize when content is real, recognize real interactions, and to feel that there is integrity on their feeds,” she said. “People who see [pro-Israel] content in their feeds and don’t understand that it originates from automated tools may feel like the language is indicative of a growing sentiment, and that can then shift their attitudes.”
The Atlantic Council’s Brooking said such tools and tactics aren’t new, but the way Israel involves the public in using them is different from how other nations have used similar tools. “These apps are targeting American speech and trying to enlist American users,” he said. “This level of organization and the fact that it takes place in the open is novel.”
It’s impossible to know how many users each of the apps has, and new apps have cropped up. They are shared primarily among private Facebook and WhatsApp groups that coordinate responses to accounts deemed critical of Israel.
Ameer Al-Khatahtbeh, a Muslim journalist and founder of the independent media company that operates the Instagram handles @Muslim and @Muslimnews, with a collective 6 million followers on Instagram alone, said he suspects the apps have been used to target his posts.
“As soon as we post something, messages that seem like bots flood the comments within the first 10 minutes,” Al-Khatahtbeh said, noting that his followers are unlikely to be the source of the comments. “We’re dealing with account-deletion warnings on a daily basis,” he said, describing an environment where he is “walking on eggshells” not to violate websites’ community guidelines.
Leslie Priscilla, a content creator who runs the Instagram account @Latinxparenting, with almost 200,000 followers, said she has altered language in the captions of her posts to avoid detection by the apps. Instead of writing “Palestine,” she uses the watermelon emoji, and instead of writing “Gaza,” she writes “G@z@.”
Even though the tools allow the organized targeting of posts, they do not violate platforms’ terms of service, which generally allow the copying and pasting of content and the manual reporting of content for review.
Donovan, of Boston University, called on tech companies to develop rules to defend against such tools. “Citizen-led propaganda campaigns are here to stay, which is why technology companies must push forward plans to universally boost reputable news sources to foster an informed public,” she said. “Anything less than that makes them complicit.”
Israel, whose $82 billion tech industry is considered a global leader in technology developments, has worked for years to shape online discussion of its policies.
In 2017, Gilad Erdan, then Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, introduced an online campaign, called 4IL (“For Israel”), to bolster support of Israel across social media. Act.IL allowed users to easily respond to any social media post deemed too critical of Israel, or too pro-Palestinian. It was billed as “a one-stop digital shop designed to provide tools for activists to promote Israel and delegitimize the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement,” according to +972 magazine, an Israeli news outlet (the name is a reference to Israel’s international long distance dialing code).
Act.IL shut down in 2022.
“At a time when journalist are being killed and their families are being erased, and a media blackout is pervading in Gaza,” said Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, a freelance journalist with 1.1 million Instagram followers who’s been covering the conflict, “it’s really scary that these services can contribute to the silencing of anyone trying to document, advocate or use their voice.”"
NP481YY999_W4J3WASQGOYLFZ9,Modi’s consecration of controversial Hindu temple caps years-long campaign,Gerry Shih,"January 22, 2024 at 12:30 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/22/hindu-temple-ayodhya-india-modi/,"AYODHYA, India — When Hindu radicals stormed a 16th-century mosque in this Indian river town and tore it to the ground in 1992, the demolition mortified India’s leaders, ignited religious riots that killed 2,000 people nationwide, and spurred figures in the Bharatiya Janata Party, accused of inciting the mobs, to issue anguished apologies.
On Monday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a grand Hindu temple on the site of the razed mosque, he spoke not of contrition but of justice achieved and pride restored — of a glorious “new epoch” awaiting the believers of Lord Ram like him.
Thirty-one years after the Babri Mosque was destroyed in a seismic event in modern Indian history, Modi’s consecration of a $300 million Hindu temple on the contested hill that many Hindus believe to be the birthplace of a beloved deity marked another watershed for India: the triumph of Hindu nationalist ideology over the secular, multicultural vision espoused by the country’s founders.
“We must not bow down anymore. We must not sit down anymore,” Modi said in a speech after he emerged from the shrine’s ornate inner sanctum. “The spirit of Lord Ram is present on the very first page of our constitution. It is unfortunate that we had to fight to prove the existence of our lord.”
Featuring seven shrines, a soaring dome 160 feet high and grounds encompassing 71 acres, the Ram Temple, in some ways, traces the rise of the Hindu nationalist movement; its most prominent political wing, the BJP; and their effort to remake India into a religious state.
As a fringe political party in the 1980s, the BJP gained national traction by making the construction of the temple a mainstream issue that galvanized the Hindu vote. Many Hindu nationalists believed that a Hindu temple had existed at the site before it was torn down by Muslim conquerors in the 16th century to make way for a mosque built in the name of Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire.
The Ram temple campaign, and the BJP’s image, suffered a setback in 1992 when a mob demolished the mosque, shocking the world. But following a decades-long court battle, the Indian Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that a Hindu temple could be built on the hilltop. Modi, reelected resoundingly that year after a heavily Hindu nationalist campaign, laid the foundation stone at the construction site in 2020 as work began.
Modi’s ceremony on Monday, attended by Bollywood stars and guests representing various castes, was anticipated in recent weeks by wall-to-wall coverage on pro-government television channels and in ebullient speeches by BJP politicians, who called the project a symbol of a new India proudly steeped in Hinduism, the faith of 80 percent of the population.
Busy intersections in New Delhi have been blanketed by the saffron flag of Lord Ram. Schoolchildren have participated in organized prayers to the god. Shops selling meat, frowned upon in modern Hinduism, have been closed in some states. Government offices and hospitals were ordered shut for a half-day on Monday morning so people could watch Modi and priests imbue the temple with its soul in a “Pran Pratishtha” ceremony.
Raghavan Jagannathan, a right-wing commentator, said the outpouring showed the significance of the temple inauguration in the Hindu psyche after centuries of Muslim and British rule and decades of “self-loathing” under independent India’s early leaders, who emphasized secularism.
“Hindus got the short end of the stick with secularism, where minorities could celebrate their religious identity but majority Hindus had to suppress theirs,” said Jagannathan, author of “Dharmic Nation,” a book stressing India’s essentially religious national character. “That’s why you’re seeing a widespread celebration right now. This temple is a coming-out party for Hindus who say: I can finally be a Hindu without fear.”
As India marks its first 75 years, Gandhi is downplayed, even derided
But critics feared the state-encouraged religious festivities — and simmering talk of Hindu supremacy and historical vengeance — showed how India under Modi has diverged from the vision of those who struggled for freedom, including Mohandas K. Gandhi, a defender of minority rights who often pleaded for the safety of his Muslim compatriots when Hindu-Muslim riots erupted.
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, said Monday’s event marked “an era when the prime minister is the high priest of Hinduism, blurring all lines between religion and politics on the one hand and between religion and the Indian state on the other.”
“We are on our way to becoming a de facto theocratic state with Hinduism becoming the official religion,” Mukhopadhyay added. “It will be very difficult for the country and its religious minorities to return to what was experienced before 2014.”
Since Modi’s election that year, emboldened Hindu nationalist groups have pushed for legislation discouraging interfaith marriage and Muslim cultural practices. Reports of hate crimes against Muslims have increased. Modi, meanwhile, has become the most powerful and popular leader in decades, partly by leaning into his Hindu bona fides.
This month, he prepared for the temple inauguration by praying at more than a dozen holy sites, draping himself in robes of pure white and, according to his press office, sleeping on the floor and drinking only coconut water in accordance with rules governing Hindu rituals.

The temple consecration is expected to give Modi a boost ahead of national elections expected in April, in which he is heavily favored to win a third term. Several opposition parties boycotted Monday’s event, and some high-ranking Hindu theologians, known as the Shankaracharyas, rebuked the prime minister for consecrating an unfinished temple in violation of Hindu scripture and scheduling a religious event in the lead-up to elections.
Modi has brushed aside criticism, citing his divine backing.
“God has made me the representative of the people of India during the ceremony,” he told the country in a video this month that garnered 4.2 million views on social media. “I seek blessings from all of you.”
For the prime minister, the temple’s opening also caps a personal decades-long journey.
As a young party worker in 1990, Modi helped Lal Krishna Advani, the hard-line BJP president, organize a cross-country rally to agitate for a temple in Ayodhya.
After the events of Dec. 6, 1992, Advani called the mosque’s demolition the “saddest day of my life,” and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a BJP leader who later became prime minister, said he felt “regrets, agony, anguish.”
On Monday, the mood was altogether different. Modi hailed the “sacrifices” made by Hindus to realize the temple project and apologized for failing to build it earlier. Yogi Adityanath, a BJP ally, said that Hinduism had been humiliated for centuries and that the temple represented the revival of India’s national identity.
Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.
The success of the Ram Temple project has given fresh impetus to Hindu nationalists who say other mosques across the country should be replaced by temples to settle historical scores. Already, Hindu activists have called for studies to examine whether two major mosques in the northern cities of Varanasi and Mathura were built on top of temples destroyed by Muslim invaders — a finding that would potentially support the argument for their demolition.
And last week, former Modi cabinet minister Anantkumar Hegde called for mosques in southern India to also be destroyed in the name of “revenge, revenge, revenge.”
“If we do not take revenge for the 1,000 years, then the Hindu community can clearly say that our blood is not Hindu blood,” Hegde said.
Inside the vast digital campaign by Hindu nationalists to inflame India
In a narrow alley in Ayodhya, a pilgrim named Himanshu Kumar Mehta, who had bicycled 400 miles in seven days to visit the temple as it opened to the public, weighed the significance of the monument that Modi had helped deliver.
The Ram Temple was only the beginning, said the 27-year-old tire salesman. He wanted to see more temples, more religious schools, more Indians return to living devout Hindu lives.
“The Hindu Rashtra is inevitable now,” Mehta said, referring to the formation of a Hindu state. “This temple is done. The Mathura temple is next. We are fighting on all fronts. And we are winning.”
A previous version of this article incorrectly said the Babri Mosque was destroyed 32 years ago. It was destroyed a little over 31 years ago. This article has been corrected."
NRTN377EJF_BA61UG73IUGIQPM,Florida lawmakers move to bar kids from social media in latest statehouse push,Lori Rozsa,"January 25, 2024 at 7:00 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/25/florida-social-media-children/,"Florida’s House of Representatives has greenlit what could be one of the nation’s strictest laws aimed at protecting children online, passing a bill that would bar anyone 16 and younger from using social media.
While lawmakers voiced some concerns about enforcement, parental rights and First Amendment issues, the bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, and on Thursday moved to the state Senate, which is expected to take up the bill soon.
“They are targeting our babies,” said Rep. Michele Rayner, a Democrat from St. Petersburg who sponsored a similar bill last year. “You all know I’m a civil rights lawyer, but the fight to protect our children on social media is a fight I will take every day and twice on Sundays.”
It’s the latest in a slew of statehouse proposals to crack down on what is increasingly seen as a threat to children — and their childhood. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy issued an advisory last year declaring social media “an important driver” of a “national youth mental health crisis.” According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 95 percent of kids ages 13 to 17 are on social media, with more than a third of them admitting “they use social media ‘almost constantly.’”
The bill, if passed, is likely to encounter resistance in court. Critics, including free speech advocates, say such proposals are unconstitutional.
“If enacted, it will jeopardize the privacy and security of Floridians who use the internet,” said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice, a D.C.-based trade association. “The Free State of Florida deserves better than a massive, unconstitutional internet surveillance program.”
NetChoice has filed four lawsuits against state laws restricting youths’ use of social media in Arkansas, California, Ohio and Utah. They recently won temporary injunctions blocking the laws in Arkansas and California while the cases proceed.
Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, asked Florida lawmakers to consider other options, such as requiring parental approval to download apps.
“While our company recognizes the goals of House Bill 1, we believe this bill, as currently drafted, not only fails to empower parents to make the decision regarding whether their teen may use a social media platform but also fails to create robust, industry-wide standards that help parents and teens manage their online activity,” Caulder Harvill-Childs, a public policy manager for Meta, wrote in a letter to Florida legislators.
X did not respond to a request for comment.
Legislators said they’ve lost patience with social media companies.
“It’s not a cure-all … but it will help and it will be a start,” said Rep. Katherine Waldron (D), one of the bill’s sponsors. “And perhaps it will be a shot across the bow to the social media entities such as Facebook, X and Instagram to push them to help protect our children, because they have shown no interest in offering legitimate protections.”
Rep. Fiona McFarland (R) said “even the most plugged-in parent” is unable to protect kids online because of the way social media algorithms encourage near-constant use.
“These dopamine hits are so addictive,” McFarland said. “It’s like a digital fentanyl.”
The bill is aimed at social media platforms that use “addictive, harmful, or deceptive design features, or any other feature that is designed to cause an account holder to have an excessive or compulsive need to use or engage with the social media platform.” It’s unclear how it would be enforced, but says the Florida Department of Legal Affairs could issue fines of up to $50,000 “per violation” under the state’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.
The proposal would require social media companies to terminate existing accounts on platforms belonging to anyone 16 and under. It would also require all Floridians opening a new social media account to provide proof of their age.
Members of the public opposed to the bill included some in the LGBTQ community who said children often use social media to find support that can be lifesaving for them.
“It’s really intentionally a positive bill, I think the intention of the bill and those who filed it is golden,” said Rep. Anna Eskamani (D). “We need to provide oversight and regulation. But it doesn’t have to be a complete all-out ban where many of our most vulnerable kids will not have the space to be themselves, to find affirming environments.”
Others said it goes too far in taking power away from parents.
“With this bill, we are telling parents you are not fit to be a parent, to make the best decision for your child,” said Rep. Daryl Campbell (D). “This is a complete governmental overreach.”
Florida passed a law last year that prohibits cellphone use during class time and blocks students’ access to social media on school WiFi. But legislators say kids need to be protected both inside and outside of school.
House Speaker Paul Renner made the issue his legislative priority this year. Jeremy Redfern, a spokesman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in an email statement that the governor “will review the legislation once it’s in its final form and delivered to our office.”
At least 35 states and Puerto Rico have proposed legislation to prevent social media from harming youths, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes blue states like New Jersey, where Deputy Assembly Speaker Herb Conaway, a Democrat, proposed two bills this session to restrict youth social media access.
Jonathan Bick, an adjunct professor at Rutgers Law School, sees a consensus building as more states propose and pass laws that may ultimately result in overarching federal legislation.
Bick noted that a federal law, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, already holds social media companies liable if someone under 13 uses their platform. What further federal restrictions on social media could look like isn’t clear, he said.
“The president and the courts have agreed that this sort of restriction on the ability to get information is appropriate” under the First Amendment, Bick said of COPPA. “The next question is where do you draw the line: Is it 13, 16? That is a question for the legislature and the president to deal with.”

NRUM1JR4V0_FO8P9L6SVU37HSI,Top Biden strategists to leave White House for Biden campaign,Michael Scherer,"January 23, 2024 at 6:35 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/top-biden-strategists-leave-white-house-biden-campaign/,"Two of President Biden’s top advisers, Mike Donilon and Jen O’Malley Dillon, will depart the White House and join his reelection campaign early next month as the president pivots to an all-hands-on-deck mode with former president Donald Trump quickly moving toward the Republican nomination.
O’Malley Dillon, currently Biden’s deputy chief of staff, will be the campaign chair, and Donilon, a senior adviser and longtime Biden aide, will serve as chief strategist. Both have served in the White House from the first day of Biden’s administration.
The moves come after several Democrats, including former president Barack Obama, have encouraged Biden to bolster his campaign apparatus and empower more top-level decision-makers at his campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del.
Obama urges Biden to bolster his campaign
O’Malley Dillon ran Biden’s successful general election campaign in 2020 and has been a principal architect of the president’s reelection while juggling other White House duties. Donilon is a longtime adviser who oversaw Biden’s message and strategy in the 2020 campaign and has replicated that role at the White House.
O’Malley Dillon’s move was first reported by the New York Times.
Biden, in a statement provided to The Washington Post, praised the two advisers. Of Donilon, he said, “No one knows my voice and my values better,” and he noted that O’Malley Dillon “led my winning campaign in the midst of a historically challenging environment.”
He added, “I’m thankful to Mike and Jen both for their service in the White House these last three years, and I am grateful that in rejoining the campaign, they are stepping up one more time to ensure we finish the job for the American people.”
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, currently Biden’s campaign manager, will remain in that role. Donilon is expected to play a central role in the campaign’s messaging and paid media strategy, and O’Malley Dillon in the organizing and execution of the path to 270 electoral votes.
“Mike and Jen were essential members of the senior team that helped President Biden and Vice President Harris earn the most votes in American history in 2020, and we’re thrilled to have their leadership and strategic prowess focused full-time on sending them back to the White House for four more years,” said Chavez Rodriguez.
Julie Chavez Rodriguez, from quiet aide to running Biden's campaign
One Biden adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said the move is being made now because the president is essentially heading into the general election. Trump is expected by most operatives in both parties to wrap up the Republican nomination shortly.
“This is a reflection that we are headed into the general” election, the adviser said. “This is a natural time to do this.”
Several people involved in the decision said it was not driven by outside criticism. Donilon, who also works with advertising and polling, has long been expected to leave the White House, while the plans for O’Malley Dillon have been less clear.
Jim Messina, who was a top aide to Obama in the White House and in his 2012 reelection campaign, said the move makes political sense.
“This is a smart move by President Biden and Julie,” Messina said. “Having additional top political aides focus full-time on the reelect is exactly what you’d expect the White House to do as the general election matchup comes into focus.”
Still, many of the people at the White House who are involved in campaign strategy will remain in Washington, including top Biden advisers Anita Dunn, Steve Ricchetti, Ben LaBolt and Emmy Ruiz.
White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients will remain involved in campaign discussions as well, and so will senior White House advisers Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal.
Because so many top strategists have been based at the White House, more than 100 miles from campaign headquarters in Delaware, important decisions about the 2024 reelection effort have often had to be run by the White House first. That has led to concerns that the campaign is moving too slowly.
The transition has been planned for some time, though the timing has been uncertain until now.
In December, Obama met with Biden at the White House, where the two discussed the structure of the campaign. Obama had raised concerns about keeping all of Biden’s closest aides at the White House.
In contrast, Obama in 2012 dispatched two of his top aides to Chicago to oversee his reelection campaign."

Jean Carroll, her attorney began her closing arguments. The trial was about how to compensate Carroll for the pain and suffering she had experienced because of Trump, Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan told the jury. She said the trial was also about how Donald Trump had tried to “normalize conduct that is abnormal.” The trial was about whether rules should apply to him at all.
Then, in the middle of this closing argument — before which the judge had admonished all parties that there should be “no interruptions” — the former president rose from the defense table and walked out of the courtroom.
It’s hard to think of a better illustration of Kaplan’s point. The trial, a civil proceeding stemming from a 1990s incident in which a jury last year found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, was from beginning to end an exercise in control: Could the legal system contain Trump and his defense team with its exacting rules, or would the former president manage to transform the courtroom into another political stage?
After following the whole thing, my money was on the law.
“I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial,” Judge Lewis Kaplan — no relation to Carroll’s lawyer — warned the former president earlier in the trial, in the manner of a parent who is absolutely prepared to turn this car around. Trump had been muttering audible commentary (“witch hunt”) from the defense table. “You just can’t control yourself in these circumstances, apparently,” the judge told him.
“No, we are not going to read out loud a document not yet in evidence,” Judge Kaplan informed Trump’s legal team on another day, as his attorney attempted to read from such a document. “We are going to take a break here, and you’re going to refresh your memory about how you get a document into evidence.”
Repeatedly, the judge’s authority was expressed succinctly and without fanfare: “We’re going to do it my way,” he more than once told both parties’ attorneys.
Judge Kaplan, it became apparent from news coverage and trial transcripts, was in control of both himself and of the circumstances. “The jury found that Mr. Trump inserted his fingers into her vagina and that Ms. Carroll did not make up her claim,” Kaplan said, referring to the previous verdict last year. He explained that he would not permit the former president to use his time on the stand to rebut that jury’s finding.
As a result, Trump was under oath for about three minutes total — deprived of the grandstanding, tangents and verbal runoff that often define his public speaking. Asked whether he denied E. Jean Carroll’s claim, Trump began, “Yes. She said something I considered a false accusation — ” but Kaplan struck everything after “Yes” from the record. Asked whether he “instructed” anyone to hurt Carroll, he began, “No, I just wanted to defend myself and my family and, frankly, the presidency.” Everything after “No” was stricken from the record.
You could argue, as Dahlia Lithwick smartly did in a Slate essay, that Trump’s attempt to disregard the judge’s instructions were “a way of signaling to everyone in the room that he is special; he is above the law.”
You could also argue that in that attempt, he failed. Because as Trump, a bipedal black hole of need, attempted to showboat for the jury like he showboats for his rallygoers, Judge Kaplan had essentially turned to the jury and said, Ignore him.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
Ignore him, he’s not playing by the rules. Ignore him, what he’s saying doesn’t matter.
Nothing Kaplan did was unusual for a judge, or for courtroom proceedings in general. He set a standard. He expected Trump to adhere to the standard, rather than allowing the standard to conform like Silly Putty to Trump.
While the latest Carroll trial was going on, Trump won the Iowa caucuses in the landslide. He won the New Hampshire primary in an avalanche. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race and immediately pivoted to praising the man who had painted him as a sniveling weakling. Nikki Haley stayed in the race but has critiqued Trump only in the most passive terms — talking about how “chaos follows” Trump as if chaos were a homeless dog and Trump were an innocent tourist rather than walking sausage wearing a bacon suit.
Nothing has contained him. Nothing has kept him from playing by his own rules.
And yet, in this trial, Trump was not able to thwart the rules of the courtroom. Yes, he might have stormed out of the room in the middle of closing arguments, but the jury would still hear closing arguments. Yes, he could hold news conferences, but those would be out of earshot for the jury deciding the outcome of his case.
The legal system managed to do what debates, news media, primary challengers, voters and democratic norms a had been ill-equipped to do: Cut his mic. Limit his participation. Strike his irrelevant muttering from the record."
O1BOAT7UEB_PA0FC7IXW5I21ZD,Did you see Him? Black Jesus is back.,Helena Andrews-Dyer,"January 25, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/01/25/book-of-clarence-lil-nas-x-black-jesus/,"About 20 years ago, actor and director Jean-Claude La Marre was looking for his next big thing. His 2003 Western, “Gang of Roses,” starring a majority-Black female cast including Lil’ Kim, was doing surprisingly well on home video. He wanted his next project to be different. Then “The Passion of the Christ” happened. Mel Gibson had financed the movie outside of the Hollywood system for about $30 million. Evangelicals snapped up theater seats like pews on Easter. The film’s success was practically preordained.
“I thought to myself, I’m going to do a Black Jesus movie. It hadn’t been done before,” said La Marre. He would follow Gibson’s model: Raise just under $1 million to make the film independently, tap the country’s massive audience of Black churchgoers to buy tickets, ka-ching. He called the 2006 film, in which he starred as a persecuted Black Jesus, “Color of the Cross.”
There was just one problem. “The biggest pushback I got was from the Black church,” La Marre told me recently. He pitched several prominent Southern California pastors on the project, hoping to drum up early support. But the nays had it.
The idea of “putting a color on Jesus” wasn’t just new, but sacrilegious.
“I went in, and every photo they had was of Jesus as White,” La Marre said. “It’s not like there’s an invisible Jesus at your church.”
Black Jesus is certainly visible right now. Take in the ambitious if uneven biblical epic “The Book of Clarence” or Lil Nas X’s outrage-courting music video for the song “J Christ” or even last year’s so weird it’s great Peacock limited series “Mrs. Davis.” There He is.
In each of these works, Jesus is depicted as a Black man, and no one really bats an eye. (The Lil Nas X video is designed to provoke, but not because of the color of Christ’s skin.) Does that mean that we — citizens of the Great Melting Pot — are finally ready for the Black Jesus that Ruby Johnson prayed to on the sitcom “black-ish” not all that many years ago?
Probably not. But we may be inching closer.
“The Book of Clarence,” which opened in theaters this month, isn’t so much about Jesus as it’s about the folks who live around the corner. The film’s titular Clarence (played by LaKeith Stanfield) is a weed-slinging ne’er-do-well who wants a shortcut to being a somebody. His twin brother Thomas (also Stanfield) is one of Jesus’s disciples. Seeing Christ and crew get the money, power and respect flips a switch for Clarence, who with his own band of merry men sets out to become a hood messiah. He finds himself and his faith — and he gets crucified for it.
Why make a movie about not just a Black Christ, but an entire ancient city populated by people of color? Describing the stories of the Bible as “hood tales,” Jeymes Samuel, the writer and director of “The Book of Clarence,” said he envisioned a sand-and-sandals movie in the vein of “The Ten Commandments” and “Ben-Hur” that reflected the west London housing estate he grew up in.
“I never met anyone who looks like Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas, but I know people that look like LaKeith,” Samuel said. “Hollywood has done such a number on us. And not just people of color but White people as well. In 137 years of the moving image, we have never seen Black people in the Bible days in a Hollywood movie.”
But while the Jesus on screen is obviously a reflection of the man Samuel sees in the mirror, the director said he doesn’t spend much time contemplating what Jesus might have looked like in real life.
“I’ve never been obsessed with the color of Jesus. I believe in the walk of Jesus,” said Samuel, who grew up in a house with framed pictures of a White Jesus. But “there’s no way on God’s green earth that Jesus looked like that,” he said, pointing to the oft-quoted verse from the King James Bible, Revelation chapter 1, verse 14 through 15: “His head and his hairs were White like wool, as White as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like unto fine brass.” Hair like wool and skin like brass? That doesn’t sound like the Jesus you see if you search on Google.
“While I don’t think it matters what color Jesus was,” Samuel said, “I think every race, every person that believes in Jesus should be allowed to see Jesus in their likeness.”
Nearly every culture has its own version of Jesus. Every year, S. Brent Rodriguez-Plate, a scholar of religion who teaches a course on religion and pop culture at Hamilton College in New York, zooms through two millennia’s worth of Jesus images from around the world. There’s Indian Jesus, Mexican Jesus, Chinese Jesus, Japanese Jesus.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
“Jesus is adaptable and moldable. He becomes whatever the culture is looking for,” Rodriguez-Plate said.
One depiction tends to shock their students the most. In 2002, Popular Mechanics ran a cover story titled “The Real Face of Jesus,” which highlighted the work of a team of researchers using archaeology, forensics, and computer imaging to produce a picture of an average Semitic man from Galilee. He’s got dark skin, curly hair, a broad nose.
“He just doesn’t look like anything anybody has thought Jesus looked like. It’s the historical image that gets my students the most,” Rodriguez-Plate said.
The characters in “The Book of Clarence” don’t act like how we assume folks did back then. They aren’t saints. They gamble, they get high, they fall in love.
The reviews have been mixed. Critics called it promising but baffling. Filled with wit but without a clear message. And it pulled in only $2.6 million in its opening weekend.
“I’m embarrassed at my first reaction,” admitted Tamura Lomax, an associate professor at Michigan State University, who saw the film last weekend. “I was confused about the storyline.”
Lomax has a Ph.D. in religion. Her husband is a Baptist pastor. “If anyone should get ‘The Book of Clarence,’ it should be us,” she said. Instead, walking out of the theater on a Friday night, they found themselves asking: What was that?
The one thing they could agree on was that the movie’s representation of Black people was radical and necessary. Jesus, Lomax said, is always political. So she couldn’t ignore the impact. Something important was happening. That was clear. They just needed more time to process. They went back the next night.
“We realized that thing that the film is combating, we too …” Lomax trailed off. “Even I missed it. Even I, in all of my radicalism, have been influenced by the broader culture going back to slavery, going back to Roman imperialism. The narrative is so in ingrained in us,” Lomax said. “Now I’m not Florida Evans, but even I could not process.”
Lomax was referring to the second episode of “Good Times”: “Black Jesus.” The classic, Norman Lear-produced CBS sitcom centered on the Evanses, a Black family who lived in Chicago public housing. In “Black Jesus,” the Evanses’ eldest son, J.J., paints a picture of a Black Jesus that the family’s youngest son, Michael, wants to hang in place of a White one. The family’s matriarch, Florida, is scandalized. The only Jesus she knows is White. But when they put up J.J.’s painting, small miracles start to happen — debts are reversed, numbers come in.
“They see this representation that gives them hope that they did not have previously,” Lomax said. “They begin to feel possibility in ways that they weren’t feeling before.” It’s a basic allegory about the power of representation. And that was way back in 1974.
The concept of a Black Jesus isn’t controversial to Lomax. When she prays, the Jesus she’s talking to is Black like her. But echoing Samuel, she said, “The history of White supremacy has really done such a great job on us.”
In the movie theater a second time, Lomax recognized the story of everyday people like Clarence who are just trying to survive. What “The Book of Clarence” did, by populating the entirety of “inner city Jerusalem” not just with Black people but Black culture, was something subversive. Perhaps that’s what makes the film hard to pin down for audiences. It’s not whether Jesus is tan but whether he’s the kind of guy you can toke with. Which, in itself, smells a little like progress. Back on “Good Times” in 1974, Florida Evans was most upset when she learned that J.J.’s model for his Black Jesus was the neighborhood wino.
For La Marre back in 2006, Black Jesus still felt untouchable. But now? He’s here, perhaps right on time.
“I went into this with the creative inclination to do something outside the box, but as I got deeper, I realized there was something bigger at play,” said La Marre, who was raised Catholic and has since 2015 produced several films and reality shows based on a Black version of the stripper tale “Magic Mike.” But nearly two decades later, Black Jesus has stuck with him.
Later this year, Martin Scorsese plans to return to the subject of Christ with a film based on the book “A Life of Jesus” by the Japanese writer Shusaku Endo. For 1988’s “The Last Temptation of Christ,” Scorsese cast Willem Dafoe as the son of God. La Marre had some advice about whom the Oscar-wining director should cast as his leading man.
“If he gives us Leonardo DiCaprio as Jesus, there’s going to be some pushback,” La Marre said. “We are now in a global market. Those things are not going to fly anymore.”

O1N2953HP5_0YJK9W57IVQPMD1,French tourist unearths 7.46-carat diamond at Arkansas state park,Andrea Sachs,"January 26, 2024 at 3:58 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/01/26/arkansas-crater-of-diamonds-park-french-tourist/,"When Julien Navas left Paris for a vacation in United States, he knew that he needed to buy a diamond for his future wife’s wedding ring. He could have picked one up at Zales or Tiffany. Instead, he found the perfect sparkler earlier this month in the mud at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. The 7.46-carat chocolate-colored gem cost him only $15.
“I was so happy,” the 42-year-old entrepreneur said by email. “Since it’s a big diamond, they asked me to name it. I gave it my fiancée’s first name, ‘the Carine Diamond.’”
Navas’s find ranks as the eighth-largest diamond discovered at the 37½-acre field since 1972, the year it became a state park. A Texas visitor on a family vacation holds the title for the 16.37-carat bauble he extracted in 1975. The record whopper for the Murfreesboro, Ark., site and the country is the Uncle Sam Diamond, a 40-carat dazzler dating to 1924.
According to a 2016 Census report, more than 75,000 diamonds have been unearthed on the land owned by farmer John Huddleston who discovered diamonds in 1906. Between 1972 and last year, the state park has recorded 35,250 diamonds weighing a total 7,032 carats. For nearly two decades, more than 100,000 people have visited annually.
Sarah Reap, a park interpreter with Arkansas State Parks, said the attraction averages one to two finds a day, depending on the number of visitors. The figure dips during the slower winter months and increases during busier periods.
“On a March day, we could have 10 diamonds turned in,” she said, “but we could also have a thousand people here.”
Regulars obviously pocket more diamonds, such as a frequent visitor who last year amassed about 100 diamonds. However, Navas was only looking for one for his One.
“In France, there are a lot of articles about the Crater of Diamonds,” he said. “I always had the idea [of visiting] in the back of my mind. I often come to the United States, but this time, being engaged, I needed to find a wedding ring with a beautiful diamond for my partner.”
Navas’s primary reason for coming to the States was to watch United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur Rocket zoom to the moon from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Jan. 8. Unfortunately, the mission flamed out. The Peregrine, a lunar lander, missed the moon because of a fuel incident and burned in the sky. An experienced hunter of precious metals and minerals, Navas decided to spend the latter half of his trip trying his luck closer to Earth.
“Since I was little, I have been looking for treasures — gold, gems — with shovels, gold-panning pans and metal detectors,” he said. “For my engagement ring, I collected 10 kilos of computer processors to extract the gold and make a geeky ring for my future wife. For the gem, I went to an old emerald mine in Austria. I searched for more than a week to find one and finish the engagement ring.”
Before setting off on his search, Navas consulted with park staff about the different techniques for finding diamonds. Reap said the three methods are surface searching, dry sifting and wet sifting. The ideal weather is a sunny day on the heels of a ground-soaking rain. Before Navas’s visit, the park had received more than an inch of rain.
“We plow rows in the field, and the rain will kind of hit those top layers of topsoil and wash away heavier materials,” she said. The sun, meanwhile, will pick up the glint of the gemstones.
Navas rented a basic diamond-hunting kit — shovel, sieves, buckets — and set to work. He spent four hours digging in the mud and rinsing the gravel he collected in bins with cold water. Nothing sparkled. After a lunch break, he roamed the crater, observing the regulars. A pro hunter “with only his head sticking out of the hole” advised Navas to stop digging and start scanning the surface. He walked around for another three hours before he noticed a brown crystal that resembled a smoky quartz. He consoled himself with the idea of a consolation prize.
At the park’s identification lab, the experts took his crystal and returned with broad smiles. They informed him that he had found one of the largest diamonds in the country. Reap said most people’s discoveries average a quarter carat. She described Navas’s diamond as “very abnormally large.”
“It was one of the most amazing surprises, after the birth of my daughter,” he said.
Navas kept the diamond a surprise until he returned to France. He said his partner had been wondering what he had been up to in Arkansas. He presented her with the answer. He said the diamond is so large, he may be able to use the stone for two wedding rings, one for his fiancée and one for the distant nuptials of his 3-year-old daughter.
A previous version of this article incorrectly said that 7 million carats of diamonds had been found at the park since 1972. It is 7,032 carats. The article has been corrected."

“As a guy who is mostly an introvert and on the quiet side, having to have a conversation about the engagement is a little, you know, uncomfortable in a way, but it’s the most exciting thing I’ll do with my life besides making Jesus my Lord,” Scott said in an interview Sunday.
“I’ve been very patient and prayerful, and I’m really excited and somewhat nervous, and I couldn’t be more thankful for having found a soul mate and someone who shares a lot of the same interests, passions and goals that I do,” he said.
Noce, a Charleston-area interior designer and mother of three who was previously married, was spotted Sunday at a church in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., wearing an engagement ring, Scott said.
They began dating about a year ago, Scott said, after being introduced at church and bonding over Bible study.
“My joke is as soon as I saw her picture, I figured it out. But the truth is about two weeks into it, I knew there was something very different about her and her faith,” he said. “In our first conversation that went about an hour and a half or two, we ended up deciding to do a Bible study together.”
Scott said he had approached her parents about two weeks before Christmas to ask for their blessing. With their approval, he set about planning the proposal. One of his friends rejected an early idea of proposing after a pickleball game, a hobby that both of them enjoy, he said.
He settled on a sunset proposal on Kiawah Island, prompting a long drive Saturday to the frigid beach. He described awkwardly trying to dissuade her from wearing gloves when they walked out on the sand, and positioned someone to take a photograph of the event.
Scott, 58, endorsed Donald Trump’s presidential campaign Friday in New Hampshire, after abandoning his own presidential bid last year. His campaign, backed by an uplifting message and significant early television advertising, failed to gain traction after several debate performances where he was overshadowed by former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
“We need a president who sees Americans as one American family,” Scott said Friday. “And that’s why I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States, President Donald Trump.”
A lifelong bachelor who is the only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate, Scott was previously engaged more than two decades ago, but never married. Scott said he and Noce plan to wed this year.
He disclosed during the campaign that he was dating someone he met through his church. After a November debate in Miami, he brought Noce onstage to pose for a photograph.
Months before the debate, Scott told The Washington Post that he was dating a Christian woman who agreed with his religious values.
“I can’t imagine dragging her onto the campaign trail unless I have the intention of marrying her,” he said. “I hope that happens, to be honest with you.”
He later tried to amend that remark.
“I guess I should be careful about how I say that,” Scott said. “Strike that comment.”

OV8GJ9RER9_UD9319OQ8BQLV8G,A Pink Floyd CD is returned to a Maryland library — 35 years overdue,Danny Nguyen,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/pink-floyd-cd-library-overdue/,"The Laurel branch librarians wished you were here. You, with the overdue library item you forgot to return since your childhood. Don’t worry, you’re not in trouble. You don’t owe any money.
And then you came.
Earlier this month, a mystery patron returned a 35-years-overdue CD of Pink Floyd’s 1975 album “Wish You Were Here.” After all this time, the CD is still in good condition, with no scratches and only such normal signs of aging as the yellowed CD booklet, said Ella Alonso, a public services specialist at the Laurel branch library in Prince George’s County.
On the album cover is a stamp dated Jan. 4, 1989 — presumably when the CD was checked out, she said.
The library staff didn’t know the CD was missing, said Megan Sutherland, interim chief operating officer at the Prince George’s County Memorial Library System. The system that the library used to track its loaned materials did not capture the CD and other items from decades ago. “We gave up hope that it would ever come back,” she said.

The CD may have been returned on Jan. 12, but library visitors won’t find it on the Laurel branch’s shelves. Since 2018, the library has not stocked CDs, Alonso said. “Our customers have moved onto streaming. They don’t have CD players anymore,” Sutherland said, adding, “We tend to focus on popular materials.”
Such a late return has happened only one other time during Alonso’s seven years at the Laurel library, when a patron returned a cassette tape with a yellowed and faded label of Phil Collins’s 1982 album “Hello, I Must Be Going” in September 2021, Alonso said. The library began phasing out cassettes in 2007.
Periodically, “we do get materials that are five years late [or] 10 years late” Sutherland said. “People move. [An item] gets put in a box on the bookshelf and they don’t realize it has a special label that says it belongs to our library system.”
Most overdue items, though, are returned a day or two after the deadline, Alonso said. Perhaps “they just had an extra chapter they really needed to power through and they didn’t have time over the weekend. Or the book is due on Monday and their book club is on Tuesday. They just need to keep it an extra day.”
Alonso added, “They bring stuff back.”
But there is still a hesitation among patrons to return late items. “There were customers who had a fee and were afraid to return materials,” Sutherland said. “They knew that they owed money and just were never going to come back to the library, even if it was something that had happened a really long time ago.”

But the mystery tardy patron, like everyone who now visits the library, was not at risk of being hit with a hefty late fee. The Prince George’s library system waived all overdue fines from customer accounts and eliminated future fines on July 1, 2020. At that time, the library system joined more than 200 libraries across North America that had eliminated late fines since 2016, including the D.C. Public Library. Until then, late fines for the Prince George’s library system were 25 cents per day for items checked out on an adult’s library account and 15 cents per day for items on a child’s account.
The fee elimination is part of a larger goal to bring back people who may be hesitant to return to the library because of overdue items, Sutherland said. In 2021, Maryland passed the Building Lifelong Library Learners Act, which eliminated late fees for minors.
Even if the fees were still in effect, the decades-late patron wouldn’t have accumulated a massive fine. “The good news for [overdue patrons] is that we [capped] the late fees to the replacement cost of the item,” Sutherland said, adding, “It wouldn’t [have been] as astronomical as one might think.” A new copy of the “Wish You Were Here” CD can be found for around $12 online.
The benefit of returning patrons has far outweighed the negligible revenue the library used to collect in late fees, Sutherland said. In fiscal 2020, before going fine-free, the library system collected $138,000 in library fines and fees; the system’s budget that year was more than $33 million. The library system has since found better ways to generate revenue, such as establishing passport acceptance facilities at several branches, Sutherland said.
At Laurel, many patrons have returned after the fine-free declaration, Alonso said. “We had a ton of people coming in that were talking to us about how they were terrified about these fees that were on their account,” she said.
Sutherland added, “We really want you here.”"
OXPA09BFIA_OE3E1J4W1W294OD,Opinion The Chevron deference is desperately needed,_,"January 22, 2024 at 4:36 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/chevron-deference-desperately-needed/,"Last week, the Supreme Court heard nearly four hours of argument in two cases addressing the question of whether courts should defer to executive branch agencies in interpreting and applying federal law [“The empty case against the administrative state,” editorial, Jan. 21]. The justices managed to ignore completely the elephant obviously hovering over the room: Given the fact that our badly divided Congress, held hostage by radical factions, is incapable of even funding the government, much less making policy decisions of any consequence, power to make policy must reside either in the elected executive branch or the politically unaccountable judiciary. This is what these cases are fundamentally about.
If the court decides to throw out the long-standing Chevron doctrine, as it seems determined to do in these cases, the court will no longer defer to the executive for policymaking but will rather abrogate all policymaking power to itself. Given the increasingly ostentatiously political nature of the courts, this will mean that the judiciary (not just the Supreme Court but also the even more political lower courts) will become our most powerful political branch. No one can seriously argue that this is what the Founders intended when they drafted Article III, but this seems to be where we are.
Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, Harrisonburg, Va.
In its 1984 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council decision, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that courts should defer to the implementing agency’s reasonable interpretation of a statute when the statute is ambiguous. Chevron is now under attack, blamed for inducing Congress to shirk responsibility and delegate too much authority. If the court overrules Chevron, the claim goes, Congress will sober up and draft more precise laws.
Our polity is facing a worrying level of dysfunction. But as one looks around the government for leverage points to take us to a better place, Congress doesn’t leap to mind. Too many members see Congress as merely a stage for sound bites designed to ignite anger and thwart solutions, rather than a place to negotiate needed policy.
Chevron’s critics invoke Chief Justice John Marshall’s famous dictum that says “it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” But Marshall never suggested that this interpretive job is exclusive to the judiciary. Such a stance would be ridiculous. Whenever a regulatory law is enacted or amended, both the implementing agency and the affected public will need early guidance on what the law is. Since the earliest days of our republic, executive branch agencies inescapably have had to make determinations of what the law is, long before courts have a chance to pronounce.
The original Chevron decision recognized this reality by encouraging reliance on agency expertise in the course of statutory implementation, while still providing a measured role for court review.
It shouldn’t be discarded.

OZR54VREXU_VTNEFTGVKTL682Z,This man wants to run against Putin. Thousands of Russians are helping him.,Mary Ilyushina,"January 26, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/putin-challenger-russia-boris-nadezhdin/,"RIGA, Latvia — Boris Nadezhdin claims he wants to do the unthinkable: unseat Vladimir Putin in Russia’s March presidential election by campaigning against the war in Ukraine. Many Putin critics suspect that Nadezhdin, a former member of parliament, is playing by the Kremlin’s rules — and is the latest to join a cast of approved opposition candidates used to create a sheen of democracy in a ruthless, authoritarian state where true dissent is crushed and genuine challengers are jailed or exiled.
Despite these misgivings, tens of thousands of antiwar Russians have flocked to help Nadezhdin get on the ballot. They don’t believe he will win, and some even dislike him, citing his appearances on propagandist state television programs and his previous job as an aide to Sergei Kiriyenko, who is now Putin’s domestic policy czar. Nonetheless, they view Nadezhdin, 60, as their own tool — a way to signal to the world that many Russians are outraged by the war and want Putin dislodged from office.
Shrugging off the question of whether he is an independent candidate or a spoiler, Russians at home and abroad waited in lines for hours, helping him amass 180,000 signatures as of Friday, well over the required minimum of 100,000 Nadezhdin needs to qualify as a candidate.
Nadezhdin, in turn, has embraced the outpouring as a show of genuine support. “If I am honest, we didn’t expect this turnout,” Nadezhdin said in an interview with The Washington Post. “But it appears that people are sick of what is happening.”
“Secondly,” he continued, “I think people crave action — their protests got quashed, but many have accumulated experience in activism in the past years and now they have an absolutely legal opportunity to do something, leave a signature.”
Voters and established Russian opposition leaders now in exile said Nadezhdin was the embodiment of “none of the above” or “no to war” options on the ballot. In the scorched field that is modern Russian politics, they said, Nadezhdin offers their best bet to show that Putin, who is seeking his fifth term, does not enjoy unanimous support.
“I honestly didn’t have time to read his program, but to me the idea of an antiwar candidate in itself is important,” Andrei, a Russian living in Riga, said after leaving a signature at a makeshift campaign point set up near the city’s train station. “And if everyone stops thinking that everything we do is meaningless and does what’s within their means, there will be a result.”
In 2018, when Putin was last up for reelection and opposition leader Alexei Navalny was barred from the ballot because of criminal convictions in cases largely viewed as trumped up for political purposes, Ksenia Sobchak, a television presenter and socialite, ran and was rumored to be a Kremlin-approved candidate, similar to Nadezhdin.
Nadezhdin denies he ever asked the Kremlin for a permission to run, and Russia’s Central Election Committee could still dismiss Nadezhdin’s candidacy over technical errors in collected signatures.
“He is in no way a dream candidate,” Ivan Zhdanov, the head of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said. “But our position from the get-go was that any candidate who is not Vladimir Putin is a good thing.”
Navalny and his team have urged Russians to conduct their own personal campaigns ahead of the election and seek to persuade 10 people they know to vote against Putin.
Ukraine alleges Russian disinformation in downing of military plane
For the Russian opposition, which is united against the war but has long squabbled over how best to oppose the longtime ruler, how to interact with Western governments or how respond to sanctions affecting Russian elites and civilians, Nadezhdin’s unlikely campaign became a moment of consolidation.
His campaign began collecting signatures in late December, showing modest numbers at first, but then spiked in popularity after he received endorsements from popular opposition figures, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former Yukos oil tycoon, and Maksim Katz, whose YouTube blog has more than 2 million subscribers. They promoted Nadezhdin’s campaign as a way for Russians opposing the war to legally and relatively safely express their views en masse without the risk of arrest.
Last weekend, images of long lines assembling at collection points flooded Russian social media.
“Signature for Nadezhdin is a statement against senseless murders, against the unhinged old people in power and for changes,” Khodorkovsky said, adding that Russians should help Nadezhdin even if he “isn’t their candidate.”
Nadezhdin has a controversial political past. His regular appearances on Russian state television programs, mixed in with an overwhelming majority of pro-Putin commentators, led some to label him “a conformist” and a “token liberal.”
And some of his views are decidedly ambiguous. In a recent interview with Georgian news outlet Sova he ducked the question of whether he considers occupied territories to be part of Russia, saying that “this is a matter of negotiations and a peace treaty.”
He added that “the position of those who live in Crimea, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions matters much more” than his own personal view.
Nadezhdin has sought to portray his opposition to Putin as genuine.
“I am running as a principled opponent of the policies of the current president,” his election manifesto states. “Putin views the world through the prism of the past and drags Russia into the past. … The country is increasingly sliding into medieval feudalism and obscurantism.”
In the manifesto, Nadezhdin added that starting the war was “Putin’s fatal mistake” and that he would offer Ukraine to cease hostilities on the first day of becoming president.
Michael Nacke, a Russian journalist and popular YouTube host in exile, said he was convinced that Nadezhdin is a stooge.
“In my view, Boris Nadezhdin is a Kremlin-approved candidate, and the initial idea was to inject a weak antiwar candidate not capable of running a campaign so when he garners a low percentage,” Nacke said, “they could say look, no one is supporting the antiwar rhetoric.”
Kharkiv’s air defense struggles to halt nonstop Russian missiles
Nacke said that the rising support for Nadezhdin’s candidacy showed the Kremlin had miscalculated. “The more pressure on the regime, the more often it makes mistakes and the more opportunities there are to demolish it and end the war,” Nacke said.
“People view Nadezhdin as an idea, so his personal qualities don’t matter here,” he said. “The lines at his headquarters are essentially demonstrations under a banner ‘I’m against the war’… and this is the only way to oppose the war publicly.”
Putin is facing several uncomfortable issues in his campaign, including disgruntled wives of mobilized soldiers demanding their husbands be sent home, fervent war hawks who think Russia is not doing enough on the frontline, and a series of infrastructure mishaps that left thousands of Russians without heat or water in winter.
On Saturday, a group of women, part of the growing The Way Home movement, staged a demonstration at one of Putin’s campaign offices in Moscow. The wives of mobilized soldiers are particularly angry that convicts recruited to the military from prison, including those who had been serving decade-long sentences for rape and murder before the war, have been allowed to return home after serving six months in exchange for pardons.

The Kremlin, so far, has played down the grievances. Still, it remains a sensitive issue for Putin’s campaign that he has yet to address. The president recently met with military widows but not the relatives of living soldiers, drawing ire from some wives who complained that in order for them to reach the president their husbands must die.
Nadezhdin, by contrast, has held several meetings with the wives and mothers of mobilized men, garnering their support and potentially irritating the Kremlin.
“This is an important symptom that shows the state of Russia two years into the war,” said Maxim Oreshkin, a political analyst. “Nadezhdin’s personal credit here is small, there could be someone else in his place … saying simple yet amazing things: He wants a peaceful, free Russia that exists to benefit its citizens.”
Oreshkin added: “The main news here is that these words suddenly resonated.”
Katz said the signatures for Nadezhdin could be just the start of more serious opposition to Putin after nearly a quarter-century as Russia’s supreme political leader.
“For Putin this may turn into a problem,” Katz said, “because these citizens who lined up to gather signatures may line up once again to vote against him.”
The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.
The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.

P0GC1JIR1I_KB8ZJFNSHIG5DST,Alaska CEO says he’s ‘angry’ after loose bolts found on ‘many’ Max 9 jets,Ian Duncan,"January 23, 2024 at 2:47 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/23/united-boeing-max-earnings/,"Alaska Airlines’ chief executive disclosed Tuesday that he has had “very tough and candid conversations” with Boeing, urging the company to improve its in-house quality programs and noting that Alaska’s inspectors have found loose bolts on “many” of the carrier’s Max 9 jets.
“I am more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry,” said CEO Ben Minicucci, referencing the accident in which part of a Max 9 jet operated by his airline came loose in midflight early this month. “This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people.”
Inspections at United Airlines since the accident have turned up similar issues.
Minicucci’s remarks, made to NBC News, came the same day that executives at United said they expect to report a first-quarter loss as a result of the grounding. They also said they are weighing alternative planes for future growth out of concern that the accident — which prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to ground more than 100 of the planes indefinitely — will further delay certification of a new, larger version of the plane, the Max 10.
1/2
The financial and operational impact of the grounding could be even more significant for Alaska Airlines, which is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. Although the carrier has a smaller number of Boeing Max 9 aircraft, the 65 planes affected make up about 20 percent of Alaska’s total fleet.
“The reality is that with the Max grounding, this is the straw that broke the camel’s back with believing that the Max 10 will deliver on the schedule we had hoped for,” Michael Leskinen, United’s chief financial officer, told analysts during an update on the airline’s financial results.
United is not canceling its order for Max 10s, but the company no longer expects them to be delivered on time, chief executive Scott Kirby said. The carrier has orders for 277 Max 10 jets, with an option to buy 200 more. In 2017, when the deal was made, United expected the planes to be delivered in 2020.
“Boeing’s not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes, and I’ll just leave it at that,” Kirby said.
United had hoped to incorporate Max 10 jets into its future growth plans, but uncertainty surrounding when the FAA will certify the plane as ready for passengers means the carrier will have to move forward without counting on those plane deliveries.
Kirby said he remained confident in the airplane manufacturer.
“They’re going through a rough patch right now, but I believe that Boeing is across the board from top to bottom committed to changing and fixing it,” Kirby said.
After midair failure, critics ask: Did Boeing learn from Max crashes?
When asked whether Boeing has a serious quality control problem that goes beyond just one plane, Minicucci said that is a concern.
“This is the issue that’s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program to make sure that when we get an airplane, it’s at the highest degree of excellence,” he said. “And that’s what’s got to be different going forward.”
United’s financial forecast and the executives’ comments underscore the widening fallout from the Jan. 5 incident on the Alaska flight, in which a plug covering an optional emergency exit flew off the side of the plane, leaving it with a gaping hole. No one was seriously hurt, but the FAA grounded the plane the following day and has been working with Boeing on a plan for inspecting the other Max 9s currently in service to ensure their safety.
The grounding has led to thousands of canceled flights at both United and Alaska and shaken confidence in Boeing.
The disruptions come after a relatively smooth year for the airline industry, following the bumpy recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, with the cancellation rate dropping to 1.2 percent, according to federal data. The improved conditions boosted airlines’ finances, with United reporting $600 million in profits for the final quarter of 2023.
Stan Deal, the head of Boeing’s airliner division, acknowledged the disruptions Tuesday and said the company was following the FAA’s lead.
“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” Deal said in a statement. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance.”
Boeing did not respond to questions about the future of the Max 10, which is still under a prelaunch review by the FAA. But it said that on Thursday, it will hold the first of several “quality stand downs” at the Renton, Wash., factory where it builds 737 Max aircraft. Teams will pause for a day to “take part in working sessions focused on quality,” according to a company memo. The action is one of several Boeing announced as part of its efforts to rebuild trust in the company.
Kirby said United’s technical team has been working 18-hour days over the past several weeks to ensure the Max 9 will be able to return to service safely when it is ungrounded.
FAA probes potential flaws in Boeing’s manufacturing process
Minicucci told NBC that preliminary inspections have taken about 10 hours per door. Both carriers are still awaiting clearance from the FAA to complete formal inspections. Once the FAA issues its directive, Minicucci said, it will take several days to complete all the inspections.
The FAA, for its part, has said there is no timeline for when the Max 9 jets will be cleared to resume flying.
United is a major Boeing customer. In June 2021, the airline announced its largest aircraft order in company history: 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft and 70 Airbus A321neos. At the time, the order was a huge boost for the 737 Max and the largest by a U.S. carrier after the FAA certified they were safe to fly again following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The cause of the Alaska incident is still under investigation, with officials seeking to determine whether bolts designed to hold the plug in place were properly installed. That has raised fresh questions about Boeing’s quality control. The FAA has launched a separate review of the company’s manufacturing process, and Boeing has appointed a new internal adviser to carry out an internal review. Minicucci said that Alaska also has increased its oversight of Boeing’s production line."
P0JAL5Y52Y_8GSC3AANDQIVGY9,Opinion Banning menthol cigarettes,_,"January 24, 2024 at 4:34 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/24/banning-menthol-cigarettes/,"Regarding the Jan. 20 editorial, “Don’t let politics cloud a menthol cigarette ban”:
Unlike the federal government, cities have addressed menthol flavoring in cigarettes, despite litigation threats or political pushback. In short, they have saved lives, particularly in communities of color.
Led by urban health departments in places such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Minneapolis and D.C., at least 190 localities now restrict the sale of menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products.
But the story of Columbus, Ohio, shows why federal rules to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars nationwide remain so essential.
In 2022, the Columbus City Council approved legislation to end the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, a critically important step to reduce the city’s 25 percent adult smoking rate and end the pernicious efforts by tobacco companies to hook young Black residents on menthols.
Literally hours after the bill passed, however, state legislators in Ohio introduced legislation to preempt, or block, municipalities from regulating tobacco products. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) vetoed multiple preemption bills in 2023, but the state House overrode his veto last month, and some state senators are attempting to follow suit.
Columbus’s law took effect this January — a truly landmark achievement. But the law remains in jeopardy.
With many states preempting localities from passing tobacco laws and others such as Ohio threatening to join their ranks, the federal government must step up. The Biden administration needs to stop its hand-wringing, follow the science and take its cue from local public health officials to get rid of menthol cigarettes (and flavored cigars) for good.

I recognize the surface appeal of a ban on menthol cigarettes urged by the Jan. 20 editorial. Unfortunately, such a ban would be bad policy and would not improve people’s health, as the editorial suggested.
Prohibitions on alcohol, marijuana and other addictive products have shown that simply banning such products does not get rid of them or help the people who use them. Instead, it drives sales underground and leads to smuggling and related illegal behavior. Sellers of illegal products don’t worry about verifying age and avoiding sales to children the way legitimate businesses, including convenience stores, do.
The experience with a ban of menthol cigarettes in California is a case in point. After the ban, menthol cigarettes made up about the same proportion of cigarette sales in the state as they did before the ban. The only difference is that those products were distributed and sold through a lawless, illicit market rather than through regulated businesses. Nobody but the illegal sellers won with that outcome. Adult smokers and the predominantly small businesses that follow the law were all worse off.
Wishing away things that are bad for us by simply declaring them illegal just isn’t a sound plan. That isn’t politics. It is just reality. The current administration would do well to recognize the complexity of these issues rather than reaching for this simple and ineffective answer.

P5G1W9M8RI_NDXJNO9PIO3N2NF,Egypt prosecutor alleges schemes by Mubarak,Robert O'Harrow Jr.,"April 9, 2011 at 5:43 p.m. EDT",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/egypt-seeks-help-to-find-mubarak-family-assets-abroad/2011/04/07/AFCMkZ9C_story.html,"Egypt’s top prosecutor has notified the United States and other governments around the world that former president Hosni Mubarak and his family might have hidden hundreds of billions of dollars worth of cash, gold and other state-owned valuables, according to a document obtained by The Washington Post.
Prosecutor General Abdel Meguid Mahmoud wrote in the document that Mubarak and his sons, Gamal and Alaa, might have violated laws prohibiting the “seizing of public funds and profiteering and abuse of power,” using complex business schemes to divert the assets to offshore companies and personal accounts.
The claims spelled out in the document are the most sweeping to date against Mubarak, a strategic ally of the United States for three decades until he was forced from power in February in the wake of national protests and international pressure. The sum of the assets alleged to be appropriated by the Mubarak family — more than $700 billion — far exceeds earlier estimates and might be wildly exaggerated. Previous figures for the amount allegedly stolen by the Mubaraks range from $1 billion to $70 billion.
The 12-page document, written in Arabic and titled “Request for Judicial Assistance,” is intended to provide the legal basis under civil law to recover assets belonging to the Egyptian people. The copy of the document obtained by The Washington Post indicates it was prepared in February 2011 but does not provide a more precise date. An Egyptian official in Washington said the request was sent to countries where the Mubarak family might maintain assets.
A legal representative has categorically denied to news service reporters the “ill-intentioned rumors” that Mubarak and his family had amassed enormous wealth while in office and hid it abroad.
The document mixes the credible with the questionable. Gamal Mubarak’s widely known role at one of the Arab world’s largest investment funds, EFG Hermes, has long fueled suspicion. But other statements appear to be supported only by hearsay witness testimony, secondhand news accounts, and, in two cases, by what apparently are fraudulent bank documents.
The U.S. Embassy in Cairo on Friday issued a statement saying officials were “vigorously pursuing all leads provided by the Egyptian Government with regard to freezing assets of former Egyptian officials. . . . We are meeting regularly with Egyptian Ministry of Justice officials to investigate any allegations that such assets have been deposited in the United States.”
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department, the agency responsible for recovering stolen assets, declined to comment on the document. A former federal fraud prosecutor said some of the claims made against Mubarak remind him of the allegations against deposed Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s.
“Some of this might sound far-fetched at the beginning of the investigation, but often it turns out to be true. The difficulty is in linking the assets to specific acts of corruption,” said Ted S. Greenberg, former chief of Justice’s anti-money-laundering section. “It was alleged that Marcos took huge amounts of gold out of the Philippines. He may have, but we never found it. He did take large amounts of jewelry. He took a steamer trunk of pearls — big pearls, little pearls, all kinds of pearls. The U.S. government seized it and it was ultimately returned to the Philippines.”
The document highlights the difficulty facing Egyptian prosecutors and a military council in responding to public demands that the Mubarak regime be held accountable after 30 years of rule. The murky nature of some of the allegations also may help explain why some governments — including the United States — have been unable or unwilling to act on the request to freeze or seize assets and accounts alleged to be held by Mubarak.
More than 70 people filed charges and the prosecutor cites testimony from eight people, including lawyers and human rights advocates. One witness produced a document alleging that Mubarak in 1982 deposited 19,000 kilograms of platinum bullion worth more than $15 billion into a personal account maintained by the Swiss banking giant UBS. The document provides a 19-digit account number, but a UBS spokeswoman called the document “a forgery.”
An Egyptian human rights group also produced documents listing $620 billion in bonds payable to Mubarak issued by “Barclays International Bank.” But a Barclays Bank spokesman in London said the bank does not refer to itself that way and the bonds sound similar to fraudulent ones posted on the Internet.
The prosecutor’s request also cites allegations that Gamal Mubarak used his position on the Egyptian central bank’s board to withdraw 75 tons of Egyptian gold held by the U.S. Federal Reserve. While the Federal Reserve does hold gold for other nations, the deposits and withdrawals are not public, a spokeswoman said.
The prosecutor also repeats unsubstantiated claims — which apparently were first reported in an Algerian newspaper, without documentation — that the Mubaraks owned property in Manhattan and Beverly Hills, Calif. The document also contains other allegations published in the Guardian newspaper.
The document portrays Mubarak’s sons as skilled businessmen who manipulated the country’s financial system, using offshore front companies to hide ill-gotten gains. It alleges that the Mubaraks “seized public monies and partnered with businessmen, investors, importers and exporters by force to realize profit without basis other than that they are the sons of the president.” The document also says the sons and their partners purchased “one of the debts of Egypt for 35% of its value and then collected the full 100% value from the Egyptian state budget.”
Other allegations came from Mamdouh Hamza, a civil engineering professor at Suez Canal University in Cairo and longtime Mubarak critic detained or put under house arrest several times for criticizing the government. Hamza alleges that Gamal and Alaa Mubarak siphoned off money from the sale of public assets, using front companies in Cyprus and the Cayman Islands to hide the wealth. Hamza gave the prosecutor documents that he claims show that the Mubarak sons worked closely with EFG Hermes, an investment bank listed on the Egyptian and London stock exchanges, to divert money out of Egypt.
Hamza gave the prosecutor details about one deal worth $84 million “with the Egyptian government through Hermes company in Egypt and transfer of 35% as commission or illegal bribes.” In an interview, Hamza said he did not have firsthand knowledge of any transactions and had relied on secondhand media reports and other publicly available information in making his claims.
Hermes chief executive Hassan Heikel is a former Goldman Sachs executive whose father was the longtime aide and spokesman for the legendary Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser.
In a statement, EFG Hermes denied any wrongdoing: “The firm has always operated under legal and transparent best practices that benefit the vital sector in which it operates.”
Hermes said that Gamal Mubarak’s only relationship with the firm was through his 18 percent stake in a Hermes subsidiary, EFG Private Equity, which accounts for no more than 7 percent of the parent company’s revenue.
In a recent interview with The Post, Hamza said he hopes the investigation recovers stolen assets. “It’s very difficult to say, but it’s billions,” he said. “My goal is to bring the money back. They have no right to take it.”"
P5WNJEUV4I_OVORKACTXQGQ13B,"Biden endorsed by United Auto Workers, shoring up union vote in automaking swing states",Lauren Kaori Gurley,"January 24, 2024 at 12:45 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/24/biden-uaw/,"The United Auto Workers endorsed President Biden at its annual legislative conference Wednesday in Washington, signaling union support in auto-making swing states, where former president Donald Trump is also popular.
The endorsement is a political victory for the self-proclaimed “most pro-union president,” who has gone to great lengths to appeal to union members, including autoworkers.
“Rarely, as a union, do you get so clear of a choice between two candidates,” said UAW President Shawn Fain, as he explained the UAW endorsement. “Donald Trump is a scab. Donald Trump is a billionaire, and that’s who he represents.”
“If our endorsements must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it,” Fain added, receiving a standing ovation from the audience.
Later, Biden addressed UAW members in his first campaign event since Tuesday’s primary election in New Hampshire, where Trump secured a decisive victory with Republican voters and Biden notched a write-in win.
“You built these companies,” Biden said, addressing hundreds of cheering UAW members in a hotel ballroom in Washington. “You sacrificed to save them, and you deserve to benefit when these companies thrive,” he continued, invoking the losses UAW members took during the Great Recession and auto companies’ strong rebound in recent years.
Tracie Collins, a 24-year Ford employee, flew from Livonia, Mich., to attend the UAW conference in Washington. “The UAW loves and supports Biden, because he loves and support us,” Collins said after leadership announced the Biden endorsement. “He gets what we deserve. [During the strike], we weren’t asking for everything. We were asking for enough to support our families.”
A group of UAW members interrupted Biden’s speech at one point, criticizing the president for his support of Israel in the war in Gaza. They were dragged out by security, a day after protesters with similar concerns disrupted another Biden campaign event. The union is one of a handful that has called for a cease-fire in the war.
Josh Saunders, a union welder at John Deere who traveled from Iowa, reluctantly voted for Biden in 2020 and a third-party candidate in 2016.
After Biden’s address Wednesday, Saunders said he isn’t ready yet to throw his support behind Biden. “I think there needs to be a cease-fire called for in Gaza,” Saunders said. “I’m not saying I won’t vote for Biden, but I feel there’s a genocide taking place and he has the power to do more than he is.”
Coming off a high-profile strike in 2023 that won record wage gains for autoworkers, the UAW had been holding off from endorsing in the race, even as Biden made several trips this fall to support autoworkers, becoming the first sitting president to visit a picket line. The work stoppage also brought Trump to Michigan to woo autoworkers.
The autoworker union’s endorsement has strong implications for the key battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin; Biden narrowly won both states in 2020.
Fain, the UAW’s enthusiastic and relatively new leader, has been an outspoken critic of Trump. He slammed Republican policies as dividing the working class “using racism, sexism and xenophobia” during the conference Monday.
The UAW, which represents around 400,000 members, used the specter of an endorsement as leverage in last year’s autoworker strike, which spotlighted worker concerns in the transition to electric vehicles, a key priority of the Biden administration. The union won new protections for workers in EV battery plants, and it pushed Jeep owner Stellantis to reopen a shuttered auto factory in Belvidere, Ill., with the support of the Biden administration.
“Our endorsements are going to be earned. They’re not going to be freely given, as they have been in the past,” Fain told The Washington Post last summer.
Biden has received a stream of earlier-than-typical union endorsements this election cycle, including a June endorsement from the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest labor federation, and more than a dozen other unions. But a handful of influential unions, including the Teamsters, the American Postal Workers Union and the International Association of Fire Fighters, have chosen to continue to wield their endorsement as influence in Washington.
“The union share of the vote is incredibly important,” said Steve Rosenthal, a Democratic political strategist in the labor movement for decades. “In the most critical battleground states, the so-called blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that President Biden needs to win to be reelected and that were the reason Trump was elected in 2016, a big share of the votes are from union households.”
Brian Rothenberg, a former spokesperson for the UAW and a public relations consultant, said internal surveys early in election seasons typically show about a third of UAW members supporting Democratic presidential candidates, a third supporting Republicans and the remaining third as swing voters. However, past internal surveys after elections show that about 60 percent of current and retired members usually voted for Democratic presidential candidates in November.
Biden has frequently touted his ties to labor unions, while straining at times to make inroads with working-class union members. His biggest wins for the labor movement include approving trillions of dollars in spending on infrastructure, semiconductor and climate packages that incentivize companies to hire union workers, as well as installing a labor advocate to lead the National Labor Relations Board, who has made it easier for workers to join unions.
Trump has also called himself “pro-worker,” positioning himself as an ally of the working class, while also supporting numerous policies as president that constricted union power. He has received few union endorsements outside of law enforcement unions. His visit to Michigan during the UAW strike featured a rally with autoworkers at a nonunion shop, as union leaders warned the former president to stay away."
P6I8JUBTXD_QJWLHHS83O6QU9A,Arizona Republican Party chair resigns after Kari Lake recording is made public,Maegan Vazquez,"January 24, 2024 at 6:24 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/kari-lake-jeff-dewit-arizona-republican-party/,"Arizona Republican Party Chairman Jeff DeWit announced his resignation Wednesday after a recording was made public that appeared to show him attempting to entice Republican Kari Lake to sit out the 2024 election for the state’s U.S. Senate seat.
The release of the recording came days before former president Donald Trump was scheduled to headline a fundraiser for the state party and as thousands of party activists  prepared to gather this weekend for an annual meeting that will help shape the party’s direction.
The publication of the recording and DeWit’s resignation mark major challenges for a state Republican Party struggling to bounce back from years of tough election losses. And what happens politically in Arizona, a swing state, could have broader consequences for both the presidency and the Senate majority in 2024.
In the recording, published by the Daily Mail on Tuesday, DeWit tries to dissuade Lake, who lost the gubernatorial election in Arizona in 2022 and has served as a surrogate for Trump in this election cycle, from seeking a Senate seat in 2024. He suggests she instead run for governor again in 2026.
“There are very powerful people who want to keep you out. … But they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is in a big way. So, this conversation never happened,” DeWit says in the recording.
Kari Lake struggles to court moderates, imperiling GOP Senate pickup
He later continues, “So the ask I got today from back east was: ‘Is there any companies out there or something that could just put her on the payroll to keep her out?’”
Lake responds, “This is about defeating Trump, and I think that’s a bad, bad thing for our country.”
In another portion of the exchange, DeWit says: “Just say, is there a number at which —” to which Lake interjects: “I can be bought? That’s what it’s about.”
“You can take a pause for a couple of years. You can go right back to what you’re doing,” DeWit continues. But Lake repeatedly rebuffs his offers, saying it is “not about money. It’s about our country.”
DeWit, in a statement Wednesday, accused Lake of releasing a “selectively edited audio recording” of a one-on-one conversation that took place more than 10 months ago inside Lake’s home. He also claimed that he received an ultimatum from Lake’s team to resign Wednesday “or face the release of a new, more damaging recording.” The recording that was made public, he said, “is not only taken out of context but also undermines the integrity of private discussions critical for party leadership.” He also states that he was employing Lake at his private company when the conversation occurred.
“The ethical breach in her recording of our conversation, while Lake was my employee, raises serious legal and moral concerns. This act of recording was not just a betrayal of trust but also a violation of the fiduciary responsibilities of an employee. Contrary to accusations of bribery, my discussions were transparent and intended to offer perspective, not coercion,” DeWit said.
In a live stream on Rumble on Wednesday night, Lake confirmed that she previously worked with DeWit while she was a communications adviser for FeedMe, but she denied DeWit’s assertion that he was her supervisor.
In his statement, DeWit accused Lake — who launched her Senate campaign in October — of being “on a mission” to destroy him since he advised her to postpone the congressional bid and aim for the governorship.
“I said things I regret, but I realize when hearing Lake’s recording that I was set up,” said DeWit, who became chairman of the state party in January 2023. “I believe she orchestrated this entire situation to have control over the state party, and it is obvious from the recording that she crafted her performance responses … to portray herself as a hero in her own story.”
Lake’s campaign called the recording an attempt to bribe the Senate candidate, adding in a statement that Lake “rejected DeWit’s multiple attempts to offer her money and corporate board seats in exchange for Kari not running for public office.”
The campaign also denied threatening or blackmailing DeWit, stating: “It is unfortunate that DeWit hasn’t recognized how unethical his behavior was and still hasn’t apologized to Arizona Republicans. DeWit’s false claims are just par for the course. The Arizona GOP must be relieved to have his resignation. Now we can focus on getting ethical leadership and win big in 2024.”
In her live stream Wednesday night, Lake said she doesn’t know who was behind the attempt to bribe her.
“I don’t know. I wish I did know,” she said.
DeWit’s exit marks the second time in less than a month that a Republican Party state chair has left the position after being embroiled in a scandal.
Florida’s Republican Party removed its chairman, Christian Ziegler, from his job earlier this month, after he was accused of raping a woman who had previously engaged in a three-way tryst with him and his wife, Bridget. Christian Ziegler denied the allegations, and Sarasota police last week declined to file rape charges against him. But the cellphone video Ziegler took of the encounter led police to forward a probable-cause affidavit for video voyeurism, a third-degree felony, against Ziegler to the Sarasota County state attorney’s office.

PADKRC6ZEI_1ES6J91MVE4YE87,The dramatic change between Mark Rothko’s early and late works,_,"January 24, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/mark-rothko-paintings-on-paper-rothko-room/,"Visitors who stroll through the National Gallery of Art’s “Mark Rothko: Paintings on Paper” in the proper chronological order will eventually arrive at a chapel-like gallery. It’s lined with oil paintings on paper in which complexly layered brown rectangles sit atop equally mottled gray ones. These pictures were made in 1969, around the same time as a series of black-and-gray acrylic paintings on canvas.
The colors of the two series have been widely perceived as morbid. When Rothko showed them to a group of friends and critics, they reportedly were alarmed.
The artist was in ill health at the time, and he had recently separated from his wife of 25 years. A few months after completing the two sets of paintings, he died by suicide.
That Rothko foretold his death in gray, brown and black is a tidy conclusion to his life story, but it’s one this revelatory exhibition doesn’t support. Beyond the brown-and-gray room is one more gallery, which contains radiant pictures whose hues are lighter and brighter. Most surprising are one that’s mostly an expanse of pastel blue, with a darker blue bar below, and another that’s principally a delicate pink, sandwiched by strips of watery light blue at top and bottom. These are colors of sun, sky and water, not night and shadow.
No one knows for certain which paintings were made last, but both the dark and light ones were produced in the same few weeks, according to the show’s curator, Adam Greenhalgh.
“A definitive chronology is hard to determine, but the two series are closely related, the development of their compositions and the exploration of their distinct palettes simultaneous,” wrote Greenhalgh, an associate curator at the museum, in response to my question about the decision to conclude the show with the more colorful works.
Rothko was born in 1903 in what is now Latvia, and came to the United States a decade later. He’s known primarily for paintings that float pulpy rectangles on a contrasting color field. He rejected suggestions that these luminous pictures might be seen as abstracted landscapes — which is indeed tempting — or that they were simply color studies. The artist held that his paintings expressed intense human emotions and that both making them and viewing them could be a “religious experience.”
Some 115 Rothko works, most of them in that signature format, are on display in a major retrospective at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. More than a few of the pictures in that show are on loan from Washington. The National Gallery owns the largest number of Rothko artworks of any public institution, and the Phillips Collection’s Rothko Room, opened in 1960, was the first suite of the artist’s pictures to be permanently installed anywhere.
“Paintings on Paper” might seem a fill-in for the paintings that are temporarily in France, but it’s far more than that. The result of years of scholarship, the beautifully mounted show includes pictures that have never been publicly displayed before. It establishes connections between Rothko’s best-known paintings and the very different work he did before he devised his mature style.
Rothko worked on paper periodically but especially favored it in his final years. Between 1967 and 1970, he executed about 275 paintings on paper and only 30 on canvas. Of the 93 pictures in the catalogue, 30 are from that final period.
The show opens with soft-shaped impressionist watercolors, including portraits, nudes and landscapes, made in the 1930s. Next are more angular 1940s pictures, most of which combine ink and watercolor and are heavily influenced by such European surrealists as Joan Miró, André Masson and Yves Tanguy, as Greenhalgh notes in his catalogue essay.
These early works probably wouldn’t be in the possession of a major museum if they weren’t by a man who became one of the most revered mid-century American painters. But Rothko’s sensitivity to color is lustrously evident in his 1930s and ’40s output. One reason the show closes with the pastel paintings, Greenhalgh wrote, was that he thought they “resonated with the colorful figurative works from the 1930s in the first room of the show, directly below.”
The palette is also brightened at the Phillips, which lent three of its four Rothko Room pictures to the Paris exhibition. They’ve been replaced temporarily by works owned by the artist’s children, Kate Rothko Prizel and Christopher Rothko.
Most striking is a predominantly yellow 1955 painting that’s bisected by a pinkish bar outlined with stripes in a slightly whiter version of the same color. The deviation from the artist’s customary layout is intriguing, but what’s most vivid is that field of golden yellow. Whether it evokes gentle light or scorching heat is for each observer to decide. Rothko’s religious experiences are offered without a particular creed, just elegant form and enveloping color.

Er, 2024 election. (Did a friend forward this to you? If so sign, up here.)
Meet the new election, same as the old election ... only older.
Donald Trump’s win in the New Hampshire GOP primary — along with President Biden’s landslide write-in win on the Democratic side — goes a long way toward ensuring a rematch that I am well aware voters seem to be dreading.
But here we are anyway, after Trump’s 11-point triumph last night joined his 30-point win in the Iowa caucuses last week. Seemingly even better for him, New Hampshire’s electorate was unusually conducive to a candidacy like Nikki Haley’s because it’s relatively moderate; her loss in a state like that just reinforces how elusive her path to victory is. Both Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and the Biden campaign agree the GOP nomination contest is effectively over.
But as for what Trump’s wins mean for the general election?
Trump’s New Hampshire win wasn’t quite as resounding as the polls suggested it would be. Haley did well enough to have a semi-plausible reason for sticking around, which she claims she will. Also, 46 percent of New Hampshire GOP primary voters chose to cast their ballots against a former president who, by all accounts, is on a glide path to the nomination.
So how much should we read into Trump’s healthy but not quite overwhelming wins in the first two states?
The first thing I want to emphasize is that New Hampshire’s GOP primary electorate is unusual. Exit polls showed nearly half of voters were not registered Republicans, one-third described themselves as moderates or liberals, and 6 percent personally identified as Democrats (they could vote as long as they were registered as independent).
You’re not going to see numbers that high in virtually any other key GOP contest. This contest featured an inordinate number of voters who might balk at Trump.
But even considering that, both the Iowa caucuses last week and New Hampshire on Tuesday suggested Trump will need to patch things up with a significant chunk of voters that he’ll need in the general election.
Five Takeaways from the New Hampshire primary
In Iowa, a Fox News voter analysis found 20 percent of Republican caucus-goers said they would be so dissatisfied with Trump being nominated that they wouldn’t vote for him in November. That number shot up to 35 percent in New Hampshire.
In comparison, just 13 percent of New Hampshire Democratic primary voters said the same of Biden.
This is a bit different than some evidence we saw last year. Then, polling suggested Democratic primary voters were even less sold on renominating Biden than Republicans were on renominating Trump. But the numbers from the early primary states suggest the reluctance to actually, ultimately pull the lever is greater on Trump’s side of the aisle.
Second, election-day surveys showed 31 percent of Iowa caucus-goers and 42 percent of New Hampshire GOP primary voters said Trump wouldn’t be fit to serve as president if he’s convicted of a crime. This could cause trouble down the line for Trump, given the number of legal cases in which he is currently entangled.
In both cases, the number who viewed a conviction as disqualifying is bigger than national polls have suggested. A November New York Times-Siena College poll, for instance, showed Trump losing about 20 percent of his support in such a scenario — and that was on the high end.
(Tuesday’s results also showed 73 percent of moderate/liberal voters and 64 percent of voters who don’t align with the MAGA movement said a conviction would render Trump unfit to serve.)
The last note of caution I’ll mention for Trump is the sheer split between independents and Republicans in New Hampshire. As Steve Kornacki noted, the astounding 71-point difference between how independents voted (Haley by 21 points) and Republicans voted (Trump by 50) is unprecedented in the 21st century. The gap in 2000, when John McCain did a lot better among independents, was around half that.
That huge gap suggests that, even accounting for how New Hampshire’s unique electorate, it was unusually divided along partisan lines in ways that could linger for Trump.
All of this goes a long way toward explaining the immense and instant pressure on Haley to drop out — complete with the head of the RNC issuing her extraordinary plea. Haley’s presence in the race, at the very least, threatens to prolong a contest that the data suggest is dividing the party in pretty significant ways. And that’s not what you want to talk about when you’re trying to get in general-election mode.
In the service of pushing Haley out, things are apparently going to get pretty ugly — in altogether familiar ways.
Trump has already pushed a baseless birther charge against Haley. He’s also launched into an extremely unsubtle attempt to otherize her by citing her Indian heritage. It’s effectively the same playbook he used against Barack Obama, Ted Cruz and Vice President Harris.
And Trump mined yet more rather dark territory on Tuesday night. He criticized Haley’s clothing as cheaper than it appears. He also baselessly suggested that scandal lurks beneath the surface with her, citing “five reasons” she would be under investigation if she wins — “not big reasons,” he qualified, but “little stuff that she doesn’t want to talk about.”
Trump has pulled many of these stunts before — think threatening to “spill the beans” on Ted Cruz’s wife in 2016, and suggesting last year that Ron DeSantis was gay and/or a pedophile — and he seems to be signaling that he’ll go there if Haley draws this out.
Trump won in 2016 despite pulling from this playbook. But that doesn’t mean it’s particularly helpful for a guy whose temperament and comments about women and racial issues have long given voters pause.
It wasn’t surprising given it involved the incumbent president. But Tuesday featured a rarity in American politics: a write-in candidate winning an election.
While the write-ins are still being tabulated, it looks as though Biden will defeat Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) in New Hampshire by about 50 points. (Biden didn’t compete in the state because of a primary calendar dispute.)
That’s something that has happened very infrequently on the national stage. Some other notable write-in winners from history:"

PHRA9B888A_ESF5WBT0BXTV2WF,Opinion Rumors of China’s decline are premature and dangerous,_,"January 22, 2024 at 3:01 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/china-decline-davos-fontaine/,"Richard Fontaine is chief executive of the Center for a New American Security and co-author with Robert Blackwill of  “Lost Decade,” a forthcoming book about the U.S. pivot to Asia and the rise of Chinese power.
Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Chinese Premier Li Qiang pitched his country as a solid investment destination. The Chinese economy, Li said, has “huge potential,” and choosing it “is not a risk, but an opportunity.”
His audience listened skeptically. After decades of unstoppable Chinese economic, demographic and military growth, the past two years have seen more trouble than triumphs. That has led some analysts to worry not about the rise of Chinese power but instead the irrevocable decline of China’s economy.
These fears are utterly premature. Worse, if they represent the assumptions on which U.S. policy is based, America will fail to rise to China’s challenge. The chief near-term risk is not that Beijing’s ascent will fizzle, but rather that Washington will fail to muster the strength necessary for an adequate response.
True, the logic of China’s decline seems straightforward. Long gone are the double-digit growth rates its economy enjoyed for decades; growth has fallen to just over 5 percent by official figures (others believe the rate might be as low as 1.5 percent). Official youth unemployment is at 15 percent, debt problems plague the economy and the real estate sector has cratered. The country’s population declined in 2022 for the first time in 60 years and fell last year by more than 2 million. Efforts to boost population growth have proved ineffective and a fifth of the Chinese population is more than 60 years old. Writing in the Financial Times, investor Ruchir Sharma captured the sentiment. “It’s a post-China world now.”
Sharma’s not alone. President Biden called China a “ticking time bomb,” and suggested that Beijing “probably doesn’t have the same capacity that it had before.” The New Yorker’s Evan Osnos, an astute observer of Chinese affairs, writes that “the feeling of ineluctable ascent has waned. To spend time in China at the end of Xi’s first decade is to witness a nation slipping from motion to stagnation.” Some foreign policy analysts predict that the world will soon witness “peak China.” Others say that we already have.
Despite these challenges, Beijing retains enormous advantages. Its economy remains very large — larger by some measures than our own — and while growth has moderated, Chinese gross domestic product growth was likely higher last year than in the United States.  China remains the top trading partner of more than 120 countries and continues to innovate in such key technologies as artificial intelligence and quantum computing while working around U.S.-led controls on items such as advanced semiconductors.
China continues to translate these advantages into strategic power. While smaller than the Pentagon’s, its defense budget is growing, and the Pentagon projects it could keep growing for at least five or 10 years. Beijing now possesses Asia’s largest air force and the world’s largest navy — more than 370 ships and submarines. (The U.S. Navy remains larger in tonnage but, unlike the Chinese fleet, has struggled to grow in number.) China is rapidly expanding its arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, including new intercontinental ballistic missiles. Beijing pursues military installations and bases in numerous countries across multiple regions.
Its ambitions under President Xi Jinping, moreover, remain grandiose. Last year, Beijing convened and expanded the BRICS group of developing countries, offering leadership to key non-Western countries. Chinese vessels act aggressively in the South China Sea, ramming Philippine ships in contested waters. The Pentagon reports dozens of unsafe intercepts of U.S. aircraft, and Chinese warplanes now routinely cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait. This past week, Beijing stripped away the tiny Micronesian nation of Nauru, one of the few remaining countries to recognize Taipei, two days after Taiwan’s presidential election. Chinese leaders tout their leadership in contrast to a fractious West clinging to its historical prerogatives, especially in the Global South.
China’s economic doldrums could persist and someday cut into defense spending, constrain its international activism and perhaps render it a less formidable challenger. But there is little sign of that now and it would be folly to rely on such an outcome.
China continues to rise and seems bent on regional domination and international revisionism. In the grand U.S.-China contest that increasingly drives international politics, however, Beijing’s absolute strength is only half of the equation. Relative power ultimately matters most in contests of this sort, and so America’s own strength will be all-important. Here we have work to do.
American power — the size and vibrancy of our economy, our military capability and capacity, the strength of our alliances and coalitions, and our ability to muster the political unity necessary to solve problems — is fully capable of dealing with even a rising China. Yet these advantages do not combine on their own. We should use the Chinese challenge to stir ourselves to success.

PLJEWIPWQL_P54APU5BV4XT73J,My adjustable chair’s gas cylinder stopped working. What can I do?,Jeanne Huber,"January 26, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/01/26/advice-repairing-adjustable-office-chair/,"Q: I bought one of those popular, ergonomic, stylish — and expensive! — Aeron chairs for my home office during the pandemic. About a year later, one day the seat went down but wouldn’t raise back up. After some Googling, I discovered that it’s fairly common for the gas cylinder that raises and lowers the seat to go kaput. There appears to be quite the aftermarket in replacement cylinders, along with countless videos explaining the not-so-simple process of replacing it.
I bought a replacement cylinder (and kit) with clear instructions from one office-supply source, and I replaced the thing. But the chair is still stuck in the down position. I’m frustrated to have paid so much money for something that now is useless. Is there anything I can do to fix the chair?
A: You’re right: The proliferation of companies that offer replacement cylinders certainly hints that this is a widespread problem. But Herman Miller, which makes Aeron chairs, has a 12-year warranty on all parts, including the cylinders and the labor to replace them. So if you bought your chair from an authorized retailer, the simplest solution is to contact the company where you bought it. The warranty states that it’s void if a customer tries to replace parts, but perhaps you could talk your way through that or at least get help, even if you have to pay for it. Herman Miller has a “find a store” directory on its website. Or you can call Herman Miller with your order number and manufacturing date, and the company will connect you with the appropriate dealer or retailer. The date is on a label under the seat.
There is also a robust business in refurbishing Aeron chairs and offering them for sale. The Herman Miller website lists the chair for between $1,410 and $1,755, with current sale prices of $1,128 to $1,404. But if you paid half that or less, you probably bought from a refurbisher, so the Herman Miller warranty won’t be in effect.
As you discovered, you can buy replacement cylinders online. But the complication is that the cylinder design has changed over the years. Some are single-stage and others are two-stage, telescoping cylinders. Some have an activation button, while others have a cable release. Herman Miller is not alone in having this variability. Steelcase, which also makes office chairs that are height-adjustable via a gas cylinder, has also used a variety of cylinders for different chair types.
To help identify which cylinder the owner of an Aeron chair might need, some sellers note the year of manufacturing, but the confusing thing is that different resellers cite different dates as the way to determine which cylinder you need. For example, the website chairpartsonline.com shows one cylinder listed as “replacement gas lift cylinder for Herman Miller Aeron Chair” for $39.99, but says it works only on chairs made before 2012 that have an activation button. The website aeronchairparts.com, which despite its name is not associated with the manufacturer, also offers cylinders that only work on chairs made before 2012. But Crandall Office Furniture uses June 26, 2013 as the dividing line, with a $54.99 part suitable for chairs made before that date and a $59.99 cylinder suitable for chairs made after that date.
Crandall has a YouTube video that shows how it refurbishes Aeron chairs before selling them. It buys the chairs by the truckload, presumably from companies that are going out of business or switching to different chairs. Refurbishing includes taking the chairs apart, cleaning the mesh and frames, touching up paint, replacing the pads, checking and adjusting the tilt, and — yes — replacing the cylinder. Crandall offers a 12-year warranty on its refurbished Aeron chairs, but it doesn’t include labor, so it isn’t as all-encompassing as the Herman Miller warranty for new Aeron chairs.
Of course, if you bought your chair somewhere else, it might not have a warranty. And whether that would still be in effect would depend on the terms; the fact that you tried to replace the cylinder may have voided it. But regardless, checking with the seller should give you specifics about the cylinder you need, and maybe help in installing a replacement correctly.
If you bought your chair from a refurbisher, you can’t get help through a Herman Miller store because of “liability complications,” Laura Yagerman, who handles media inquiries for Herman Miller, said in an email. “In several cases we have seen that resellers combine parts and pieces from different chairs together to make a refurbished chair, so it may not be simple to identify the correct part. With that in mind, owners of refurbished chairs should connect with their point-of-sale business for their recommendations.”
Yagerman said Herman Miller cylinders should last for 12 years or longer. Some companies that sell replacement cylinders say they need to be replaced every four to five years. It’s not clear whether that is because of manufacturing differences, actual experience or a difference in setting customer expectations.
However, it’s important to get a replacement cylinder matched not only to the chair style but to the height and weight of the user. Aeron chairs come in A, B and C sizes, with A, or small, suitable for people 4 feet 10 inches to 5 feet 4 inches tall who weigh up to 300 pounds. Size C, or large, is for people 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet 6 inches who weigh up to 350 pounds. Size B is for those in the middle or who meet characteristics of A and B or B and C. The cylinder size affects the minimum and maximum lift as well as sturdiness for a given weight.

PMOABE1P8J_GPL733PNTU1J7JQ,Haley faces growing pressure from Republicans to drop out of presidential race,Amy B Wang,"January 24, 2024 at 4:17 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/haley-pressure-republicans-trump/,"Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley is facing growing pressure from fellow Republicans to drop out of the presidential race after placing second in the New Hampshire primary, with key GOP leaders urging the party to unite around a single candidate as quickly as possible.
After two nominating contests, Haley is the only major challenger to Donald Trump remaining in the Republican primary — with the former president garnering decisive wins Tuesday in New Hampshire and also in last week’s Iowa caucuses. Though Haley came closer to Trump in the Granite State than some pre-primary polling indicated, she faces an uphill battle in the next states to hold nominating contests. That slate includes her home state of South Carolina, where Trump maintains a commanding lead in the polls.
1/5
Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, told Fox News on Tuesday that she did not see “the math and the path going forward” for Haley to win the party’s nomination but stopped short of explicitly calling for Haley to drop out.
“I think she’s run a great campaign. But I do think there is a message that’s coming out from the voters, which is very clear: We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is going to be Donald Trump, and we need to make sure we beat Joe Biden,” McDaniel said.
She noted that  Haley had poured resources into New Hampshire and garnered the support of Gov. Chris Sununu (R) along with independent and unaffiliated voters in the state — and still came in second.
“I just think if she came in second here, I don’t see the path,” McDaniel said. “... This isn’t the RNC speaking. This isn’t the establishment speaking. This is the voters speaking.”
Haley has vowed to stay in the race for the long haul and has vehemently pushed back on the notions that she would drop out or be content with being named a vice-presidential candidate. At her New Hampshire watch party Tuesday night, Haley was upbeat, congratulating Trump on his projected win — saying “he earned it” — but also declaring that the race was “far from over.”
“There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina,” she told cheering supporters. “... I’m a fighter, and I’m scrappy. And now we’re the last one standing next to Donald Trump.”
Still, the pressure campaign from Trump’s supporters began as Haley gave her speech to supporters. Within 30 minutes, three Republican senators publicly signaled their desire to see Haley quit.
“I have seen enough,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) wrote on X, formerly Twitter, at 8:05 p.m. “To beat Biden, Republicans need to unite around a single candidate, and it’s clear that President Trump is Republican voters’ choice.”
A few minutes later, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) piled on. “At this point Haley can either drop out or help the Democrats,” he wrote on the platform.
Another 10 minutes later, Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who had not previously backed a candidate in the primary, announced on X that she was endorsing Trump and that it was “time for the @GOP to unite” to defeat Biden.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R), who is from Haley’s home state and who long ago backed Trump, joined his fellow Republicans’ call Tuesday night, writing on X: “The sooner we unite, the better.”
The chorus of Republicans publicly calling for the party to rally behind Trump only grew louder, with Sen. Eric Schmitt (Mo.), Rep. Dan Bishop (N.C.) and Rep. Harriet Hageman (Wyo.) all declaring the primary over in social media posts.
Haley, her campaign officials and top surrogates have all continued to express optimism for the nominating contests ahead, saying they did not want to see a Trump “coronation.” Haley spent Wednesday morning speaking to Republicans in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which will hold its caucuses on Feb. 8 to determine how to award its  delegates.
Haley’s allies also pointed to her stronger-than-expected performance in Iowa, where she won eight delegates, and in New Hampshire, where she is projected to come within 11 percentage points of Trump, despite pre-primary polling showing that Trump had a 28-point lead. (The poll was conducted before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced over the weekend that he was suspending his campaign.)
In a memo Tuesday outlining the state of the race, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney noted that South Carolina and Michigan each have open primaries, meaning anyone can vote in the GOP primary as long as they have not already voted in the Democratic one — a more welcoming landscape for Haley, who has fared better with independent and unaffiliated voters than Trump.
And on March 5, or Super Tuesday, 11 of the 16 states and territories will hold open or semi-open primaries, representing “significant fertile ground” for Haley, Ankney wrote.
“After Super Tuesday, we will have a very good picture of where this race stands,” Ankney added. “At that point, millions of Americans in 26 states and territories will have voted. Until then, everyone should take a deep breath.”
On Wednesday morning, Sununu, the governor who endorsed and campaigned alongside Haley in his home state, said the notion that Haley would drop out now was “nonsense.”
“With all due respect to Ronna McDaniel, to say that we’re just going to call it after two states, [with] 40 states to go ... because it’s getting too close? That’s nonsense,” Sununu said on Fox News. “You got to let the voters decide, not a bunch of political elites out of D.C.”
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters Wednesday that she was happy to hear that Haley was determined to stay in the race but acknowledged that she had not formally endorsed her.
“I think the more people see of her, particularly since she appears to be the only alternative to Donald Trump right now, the more impressed that they will be,” Collins said.
But a mounting concern for Haley, even if she does not want to leave the race, will be holding on to donors who said Wednesday that they worried about her chances in her home state of South Carolina.
Metal magnate Andy Sabin, who had previously donated the maximum amount to Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-S.C.) presidential campaign before Scott dropped out, had also donated a small amount to Haley. But Sabin, who previously said that Haley needed to win New Hampshire to pose a real challenge to Trump, said he would no longer contribute to her campaign.
Sabin, who has been vocally critical of Trump in the past, said he had resigned himself to supporting Trump by encouraging people to vote for the former president — but the Republican donor drew the line at financial support.
“I’m not going to give him a nickel, which I’ve said,” Sabin told The Washington Post. “But I’m going to do everything I can to get him elected.”
Multiple advisers to political megadonors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said they think significant future funding for Haley is unlikely after her New Hampshire performance.
“Without a New Hampshire win, she doesn’t have the momentum she needed to win South Carolina,” one adviser said. “And without a lane to South Carolina, she has no chance on Super Tuesday.”
But not everyone has given up on Haley. Eric Levine, a prominent Republican fundraiser, said he was continuing to raise money for her, despite the disappointment over Haley losing New Hampshire.
“As long as she’s in the race, I am with her,” he said.
Americans for Prosperity’s super PAC, the flagship group of the political network led by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that contributed its sophisticated ground operation and political networking power to Haley’s operation in Iowa and New Hampshire, said it plans to continue its work for Haley in South Carolina. The group noted the “steeper road ahead” in a statement released after the New Hampshire results were announced. But the organization has already contacted about 300,000 South Carolinians as of Wednesday, said spokesman Bill Riggs.
Mark Harris, the lead strategist of the pro-Haley super PAC SFA Fund, said he expects continued support — “people are jazzed up,” he said — but added that he knows that Haley, as “an insurgent candidate,” will be outspent.
“Our donors have been in this from the long haul,” he told reporters Wednesday. “They believe in Nikki Haley. They believe in a new direction for the country.”

PQ8KU8H0DQ_QX5KKTP02OYMDX7,Opinion A dry Panama Canal shows how climate change will scramble globalization,Editorial Board,"January 25, 2024 at 7:28 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/panama-canal-climate-change-drought/,"Global shipping companies excited by the potential new routes that climate change and melting ice are opening up around the North Pole have gotten walloped by some unexpected bad news. The Panama Canal might be on its way out as one of the most critical routes of global trade, impaired by, yes, climate change. An epic drought in what was supposed to be Panama’s rainy season has brought the level of Gatún Lake — the freshwater reservoir that feeds the locks needed to move ships along the canal — to perilous lows, almost 6 feet below where they were a year ago. This has bottled up traffic in a waterway that handles about 5 percent of global maritime trade, including nearly half the containers shipped from ports in Northeast Asia to the eastern United States.
Long queues of idle ships have formed at the ends of the canal. While recent rain allowed traffic to begin to reverse the steep decline that started in autumn, at 24 ships per day it remains well below the pre-drought transit of about 36. Tonnage of cargo through the canal fell from the start of the usual rainy season in May to September, pushing shippers to look for alternative routes and snarling supply chains in sectors such as agriculture and energy.
The Panamanian government is scrambling to engineer a fix and save a canal that generates more than $3.3 billion in tolls, a major contributor the country’s economy. Still, the prospect of continued drought raises a critical question: To what extent can a long-term solution be engineered in the face of inevitable changes to the climate?
This is not just Panama’s problem. Drought in the Amazon rainforest this fall congested river shipping routes and threatened Brazil’s agricultural economy. Germany has proposed dredging parts of the Rhine after the worst drought to hit Europe in 500 years depressed water levels in 2022 and forced ships to sail at only 25 percent of capacity. The historic drought that afflicted the Mississippi, which carries nearly 500 million tons of cargo per year, required dredging of shipping channels to keep the barges moving.
The Panama Canal is in a particularly vulnerable position, requiring enormous amounts of fresh water to operate the locks that raise ships to cross this strip of land between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Much of this water is flushed out to sea — mixed with seawater and thus too briny to be diverted to agriculture or human consumption.
The short-term fix is to release water from Lake Alajuela into the canal. But more water will be needed. And the government is considering more extreme measures, including a multibillion-dollar plan to dam the Indio River and create a reservoir from which to pump fresh water through a mountain into Lake Gatún. Another idea is to seed clouds to bring the rains back.
The canal’s customers are getting antsy. Maybe Panamanians can engineer a fix that buys some time. But it’s not certain that Panama can come up with a definitive answer. Coming on top of other challenges — including the United States’ new protectionism and its rising tensions with China, as well as Houthi attacks snarling trade through the Suez Canal — the Panama drought adds to a rising uncertainty over the future of globalization.
Sure, some lucrative shipping routes have opened up in the Arctic. But what happens to the global economy if, along with everything else, companies must turn to moving cargo overland or shipping it around South America through the Strait of Magellan?
It might seem callous to worry about the impact of climate change on global trade. Drought is causing no end of human suffering; Just in the Horn of Africa, 23 million people were severely food-insecure at the end of 2022 because of drought. Droughts, storms and floods forced nearly 33 million people to migrate that year.
And yet it would be foolhardy to ignore the impact of a changing climate on the driving forces of globalization. Threats to global growth will make it harder to address the plight of the most vulnerable. An impaired world economy will be hard-pressed to respond to poverty and hunger.
Reengineering the environment is unlikely to offer a full solution, though. Maybe seeding clouds could help the Panama Canal. Other responses might present themselves in time. But creative engineering is likely to be needed all over the world in the coming decades to confront a variety of new climate-related humanitarian and infrastructure challenges. Ultimately, prevention, by arresting the emission of planet-warming greenhouse gases, is the only way to stop the list of looming climate-related threats to the global economy from getting even longer.

PSNZO1PC0C_9GCXMZ6ZR7LJFR7,Opinion N.H. Republicans should be honest about what backing Trump would mean,Editorial Board,"January 22, 2024 at 6:06 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/22/new-hampshire-trump-haley-republicans/,"The two remaining contenders for the Republican presidential nomination each warned of “an unholy alliance” in their closing pitches to New Hampshire voters ahead of Tuesday’s primary. But they had very different enemies in mind.
Arguing to continue arming Ukraine, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley decried “an unholy alliance” among Russia, China and Iran aimed at undermining the cause of democracy and human freedom.
Meanwhile, former president Donald Trump condemned “an unholy alliance” aimed at denying him another term in the White House. In Mr. Trump’s telling, Never Trumpers and the billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, through his group Americans for Prosperity, are conspiring with “globalists” and “communists” to encourage independents to support Ms. Haley in the GOP’s primary.
These dueling narratives depict the choice Republicans are facing. Ms. Haley talks about the real world and countering the United States’ adversaries. Mr. Trump looks inward, consumed by grievances and promising retribution against his domestic critics.
It is possible that this contrast could persuade New Hampshire’s sometimes unpredictable voters to give Ms. Haley a win on Tuesday, keeping alive her effort to pull the party away from its ruinous allegiance to Mr. Trump. Such an outcome would be a welcome surprise.
Yet elected Republicans are betting on the favorite, as party officials consolidate around the former president. Many Republicans, albeit not in public, rationalize their capitulation: Mr. Trump is only joking when he talks about revenge; he’s too old or too lazy to be as dangerous as he promises; he only wants to be a dictator on his first day, and, besides, their base wants a strongman. They argue that the economy was doing well under Mr. Trump until covid-19 hit; that he nominated the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade; that Congress and the courts will constrain him; and that he will give up power peacefully in January 2029 because he’ll be ineligible to run for another term.
Republican officials endorsing Mr. Trump — and New Hampshire primary voters casting ballots — should be honest with themselves. Mr. Trump is the same person who brought shame upon the country at Helsinki, when he refused to condemn Russia for interfering in the 2016 election; after Charlottesville, when he said “there were very fine people on both sides” of violent clashes around a racist march; and on Jan. 6, 2021, when he encouraged the Capitol invaders in his quest to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The revelations about the pressure he placed on swing-state public officials to defy the will of the voters suggest he is willing to manipulate and erode the institutions of democracy and, after his 2020 attempt, might have more success the next time he tries.
Reporting from Mr. Trump’s first term suggests that many of his worst ideas were stopped by staffers who simply ignored his commands. During a second term, he likely would not surround himself with reasonable or serious people, as Trump flunkies prepare lists of extremists with whom to fill the government. His allies are formulating plans to deconstruct the federal government, weaponize the Justice Department, roll back environmental protections, nullify global alliances and more. Mr. Trump could well be more dangerous now than he was in 2016 and 2020, in part because he and his people have had time to plan and avoid what they consider the mistakes of his first term — such as picking attorneys general who Mr. Trump felt were inadequately loyal to him.
Mr. Trump has been referring to Ms. Haley by her first name, Nimarata, and suggesting that, as the daughter of immigrants, she might be ineligible to serve as president, even though she was born in the United States. It’s a reprise of the birtherism he peddled against Barack Obama. Endorsing Mr. Trump, however reluctantly, is signing up for more of the same of this kind of racism.
Ms. Haley has belatedly criticized Mr. Trump in recent days for cozying up to dictators, from Russia’s Vladimir Putin to China’s Xi Jinping to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. A second Trump term would make the United States decidedly less safe, as he degraded alliances with America’s friends and played into the hands of the country’s adversaries.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) won the New Hampshire primary in 2008 despite advocating the unpopular, but correct, position of pouring more troops into Iraq to defeat the insurgency. The state has a proud tradition of rejecting extremism. Reasonable Republicans and independents there have a chance to reject Mr. Trump and what  he represents. They don’t need to join an unholy alliance.

Q11FIP1HBO_B992MSM0HY3KXNX,"Arthur W. ‘Nick’ Arundel, newspaper publisher and philanthropist, dies at 83",T. Rees Shapiro,"February 10, 2011 at 3:14 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/newspaper-publisher-helped-to-preserve-va-piedmont-land/2011/02/08/AB1grZF_story.html,"Arthur W. “Nick” Arundel, 83, founder of the Washington area Times Community newspapers who used his wealth to preserve thousands of acres of Virginia countryside from development, died of pulmonary failure Feb. 8 at his home in The Plains, Va.
At its peak, Times Community owned 17 papers, including the Loudoun Times-Mirror, Fauquier Times-Democrat and Fairfax County Times, which Mr. Arundel’s company sold to The Washington Post in 2009.
Mr. Arundel (pronounced AIR-uhn-dell) was the son of multimillionaire Pepsi-Cola bottling magnate Russell Arundel. He served as chairman of his father’s company, PepCom Industries, once the largest East Coast bottler of Pepsi, before the business was sold in 1980.
In 1982, Mr. Arundel bought 800 acres of boggy Piedmont land in a bankruptcy auction on the steps of the Fauquier County courthouse. At first destined to be split into 500 home plots, the parcel is now known as Great Meadow, a bucolic events facility that hosts summer twilight polo matches, a Fourth of July fireworks spectacle, and the spring and fall Gold Cup thoroughbred races. In all, Mr. Arundel helped place 5,000 acres into conservation easement.
His foray into journalism began in the late 1950s when he worked as a copy boy for the Washington bureau of CBS News and later as a reporter for what became the United Press International wire service.
In the early 1960s, Mr. Arundel formed a communications company after buying a failing Northern Virginia country music radio station with one disc jockey. When he learned that his DJ had been killed in a car crash, Mr. Arundel went to the station the next morning and ordered a station announcer with a deep, booming voice to read wire-service stories on the air.
“When I bought it, it was a bankrupt little hillybilly station,” Mr. Arundel told Editor and Publisher magazine in 1993, explaining how WAVA became one of the first all-news radio stations in the Washington market.
Mr. Arundel had bought the Loudoun Times-Mirror in 1963. The Leesburg-based publication was Mr. Arundel’s first stake in print journalism and was the flagship of his Times Community chain.
The core publications of the network included the Reston Times, the Fauquier Times-Democrat, the Rappahannock News and the Clarke Times-Courier. At one point, his newspapers had a combined circulation of 273,000.
“We call ourselves not local papers,” Mr. Arundel told Editor and Publisher in 1993. “We call ourselves local, local, local papers.”
Much of the editorial content in Mr. Arundel’s newspapers focused on land-use planning and zoning issues — popular topics among readers in the rapidly expanding region.
A former Marine Corps officer, Mr. Arundel ran his business with a militaristic attention to detail and efficiency that made his newspaper chain routinely turn a profit. Many employees complained, however, that salaries were too low.
Mr. Arundel sold his radio station in 1977 to focus solely on his newspapers. In the end, he discovered he preferred ink to airwaves.
“That print story, that newspaper, that magazine, you can pick it up in your hands and you can crumple it,” he said in 1993. “Whether you just wrap the fish in it or start the fire with it, it still is a hard, little piece of information you can tuck in your drawer for your children and generations to come.”
Arthur Windsor Arundel was born Jan. 12, 1928, in Washington.
He was a 1947 graduate of Sidwell Friends School and a 1951 graduate of Harvard University.
As a Marine Corps officer, Mr. Arundel served in the Korean War and received the Purple Heart after he was wounded in combat. In the mid-1950s, he participated in missions in Vietnam.
He married Margaret McElroy in 1957. She survives, along with their five children, Sally DeWees of Wilmington, Del., Wendy Arundel of Sherborn, Mass., Tom Arundel of Washington, John H. Arundel of Alexandria, associate publisher of Washington Life magazine, and Peter W. Arundel of McLean, president and chief executive of Times Community; a sister, Jocelyn Sladen of Warrenton; and 11 grandchildren.
Mr. Arundel was a past president of the Friends of the National Zoo and was a longtime advocate for the preservation of exotic animals.
When Mr. Arundel was 9, The Post ran several stories on the youngster’s solitary campaign to bring giraffes to Washington. His editorial crusade, carried out in the pages of his self-published “Nicky’s News,” caught the attention of the National Zoo staff.
A few months later, Mr. Arundel’s wishes came true when four giraffes were imported from Sudan.
In 1955, he personally donated two baby gorillas to the National Zoo. He bought them from natives during an expedition to Central Africa and transported them to Washington on a commercial airplane, the babies sitting in his lap."
Q3FUW6SW7D_5RWG2PLDW6OFZM5,"Ukraine shot down Russian military jet, killing 74, officials say",Mary Ilyushina,"January 24, 2024 at 6:02 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/russia-military-plane-crash-belgorod/,"RIGA, Latvia — A Russian military plane crashed Wednesday in the western Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine, killing 74 people on board, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that also accused Ukraine of shooting down the aircraft.
The ministry said the plane, an Ilyushin Il-76, was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transported to the region for a subsequent swap, as well as six crew members and three other individuals.
In a video address Wednesday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had summoned his top military and defense chiefs for a report “on the situation with the plane.”
Zelensky did not specifically confirm the deaths of POWs, but spoke in a grave tone. The president said that he had spoken to Ukraine’s military leadership regarding its “use of the air force” — an implicit acknowledgment that Kyiv downed the aircraft — and that the military intelligence directorate “is engaged in finding out the fate of all prisoners.”
He accused the Russians of putting Ukrainian prisoners in danger. “It is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society,” Zelensky said.
Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence confirmed that a prisoner swap was scheduled to take place Wednesday.
The directorate, however, said that it “lacks credible and comprehensive information regarding who exactly was on board the plane and in what quantity.”
“Ukraine fulfilled all agreements for exchange preparations. Russian prisoners were timely delivered to the agreed-upon exchange point, where they were kept safe,” the intelligence agency said in a statement. “Per the agreements, the Russian side was responsible for ensuring the safety of our defenders. Simultaneously, Ukraine was not informed about the necessity of securing the airspace over the city of Belgorod during the specified period, as has been communicated in the past.”
Russia also did not inform Ukraine about how it planned to transport the prisoners, according to the directorate’s statement, adding that “landing a transport plane in a 30-kilometer combat zone cannot be considered safe and should be discussed by both parties, as it jeopardizes the entire exchange process.”
In an earlier statement, the Russian Defense Ministry said “the Ukrainian leadership knew very well that, according to established practice, today Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to the Belgorod airfield for exchange.”
In Ukraine’s northeast, fears rise of second Russian occupation
The swap was supposed to take place at the Kolotilovka border checkpoint, which separates Russia’s Belgorod region from the Sumy region in Ukraine, the ministry added.
None of the claims, either about who was aboard or about the cause of the crash, could be independently verified.
A plume of smoke seen in a video of the plane crash as well as traces of damaging elements on the fuselage skin are consistent with an aircraft being shot down, according to analysis by the Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian open-source intelligence group that has been tracking the hostilities in Ukraine since 2014.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine of committing “a terrorist act” and doubled down on the assertion that Ukraine was informed of the routes and means of transportation being used to position the prisoners for the trade.
“The attack on the plane was a deliberate and conscious action,” the Foreign Ministry said. “The terrorist attack clearly demonstrates the inability of the Kyiv regime to negotiate.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov requested an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting in connection with the crash.

The Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement early Wednesday that it was still analyzing reports about the crash.
“Before official statements or comments by authorized individuals or authorities are released, we urge the media and citizens to refrain from spreading unverified information,” it said. “Emphasizing that the enemy actively conducts information special operations against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society.”
While the cause of the crash could not be confirmed, senior Russian officials, without providing evidence, said the plane was shot down by Ukrainian forces using either German or U.S.-made missiles.
Short video clips of the crash site published on Russian state media and Telegram channels showed scattered debris on a snowy field but little else from the scene.
Russian air passengers face peril as planes show strain of sanctions
One official, Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of the defense committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament, said that a second plane had narrowly escaped a similar disaster.
“There was the second Il-76 plane following, which was carrying about 80 more prisoners of war. It was rerouted in time,” Kartapolov said.
“The leadership of Ukraine was well aware of the impending exchange; they were informed about how the prisoners would be delivered,” Kartapolov added. “But the Il-76 plane was shot down by three missiles from either a Patriot or an Iris-T antiaircraft missile system made in Germany.”
The speaker of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said lawmakers would hold their U.S. and German counterparts accountable.
“The defenseless pilots of our military transport plane who were conducting a humanitarian mission have been shot using American, German missiles,” Volodin said during a parliamentary session. “Lawmakers of these countries must realize their responsibility, where this is all leading.”
Belgorod region has served as a staging ground for the Russian forces since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the regional capital, also called Belgorod, is the only major Russian city that has come under sustained assault with a recent increase in Ukrainian shelling. On Dec. 30, 25 people were killed in a rocket and missile attack there.

Q9Y05IYC97_MOQML2ZK9IC4RQE,"As more virus cases trace their origins to Egypt, questions rise over government measures",Sudarsan Raghavan,"March 9, 2020 at 2:44 p.m. EDT",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/as-more-virus-cases-trace-their-origins-to-egypt-questions-rise-over-government-measures/2020/03/09/d77fc718-61f3-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html,"CAIRO — For days now, the Egyptian government has stated that a Taiwanese American woman was the source of the coronavirus infections of 45 passengers and crew members aboard a Nile cruise ship, suggesting that Egypt was a victim of the global spread of the epidemic.
On Sunday, Taiwan disputed that assertion. After isolating the strain of the virus from the woman, known as Case #39, Taiwanese researchers concluded that it was different from those of other infected Taiwanese, the island’s Centers for Disease Control said in a statement. In other words, she was not the origin of the infection on that ship.
“It is determined that Case #39 contracted the novel coronavirus in Egypt, and developed symptoms after returning to Taiwan and that this is an imported case,” the statement read.
Egyptian officials said they based their conclusion about the woman on discussions with World Health Organization officials. Nevertheless, the dispute underscores questions about the spread of the virus in Egypt — the Arab world’s most populous nation, with more than 100 million people — and the way the government is handling the threat.
Egypt tries to reassure tourists as coronavirus numbers spike
As the virus travels worldwide, Egyptians have expressed concern about a lack of transparency from the government and wonder whether it is concealing the true extent of the virus’s spread in the nation. Unlike many other countries in the region, and across the world, Egypt has not closed schools, paused Friday prayers or suspended sporting events to limit the transmission of the virus. It was only on Monday night that the government decided to ban large public gatherings.
The fears have heightened since Friday, when the number of coronavirus infections jumped from three to 55, including those Nile cruise cases. Dozens of foreigners, including more than two dozen Americans, remain quarantined aboard the ship in the southern city of Luxor. A German tourist who traveled from Luxor to the Red Sea town of Hurghada died Sunday from complications brought on by the virus, becoming Egypt’s first coronavirus fatality.
As many as 28 people from Canada, France, Greece and the United States have contracted the virus after visiting Egypt in recent weeks.
Egyptian officials say they have been transparent, noting that the government has created a website to inform the public of its efforts and has tested more than 2,000 people who have come in contact with infected people.
But only over the weekend did the government increase its efforts — after the Nile cruise infections emerged.
On Monday, the first measures were taken in one city: Tourism officials announced that all hot-air balloon rides in Luxor would be halted, in an apparent effort to prevent people from being squeezed together.
They also said that they would improve sanitation at all hotels in Luxor and on cruise ships, as well as test passengers and crew members before they depart their ships. Authorities have canceled the Luxor African Cinema Festival.
Yet all the famous sites in the city — including the Valley of the Kings, as well as the Luxor and Karnak temples — remain open, even though they are normally crowded with thousands of tourists, according to visitors there.
“The feedback I get from my patients shows that there is a state of fear and skepticism among the public when it comes to fully trusting official statements regarding the coronavirus in Egypt,” said Mohamed Ashraf, 33, an orthopedic specialist. “Some of the patients I have seen suspect that the cases are much more than those the government has announced.”
The government can largely blame itself for the public’s skepticism. Under President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, information is closely controlled and truth is manipulated, even sacrificed, if it damages the country’s image or all-important economic engine.
When a bomb brought down a Russian passenger plane departing the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheik in 2015, killing all 224 people aboard, the government initially denied that terrorists were responsible, even as Western intelligence agencies corroborated the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility.
The following year, Egypt blamed a bomb when an EgyptAir plane traveling from Paris crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, killing all 66 people aboard, and obstructed the official probe. But French investigators determined that technical failures brought down the plane.

Amid the coronavirus crisis, other countries in the region have grown worried about Egypt because of its dependence on tourism. Millions of Egyptians work in neighboring nations and in the Persian Gulf region, traveling back and forth. In recent days, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia have placed restrictions on visitors from Egypt. Saudi Arabia requires that Egyptian workers entering the kingdom have a certificate from Egypt showing they had tested negative for the coronavirus.
Under pressure, the Egyptian government on Monday night announced the cancellation of all large public events, including opera performances, as well as restrictions on the movement of large groups of people between provinces.
For ordinary Egyptians, such measures, while welcome, have come late.
“I did not see any awareness campaigns on TV on how people should deal with the virus,” said Amani Moussa, 28, a painter. “I was buying something from the market yesterday, and the seller was using his teeth to actually hold the bag in which he collected my vegetables. So people are not careful.”
Ashraf, the orthopedic specialist, said that “most people are truly upset that the schools have not been suspended yet, because they see other countries have done so.”
But what he is most concerned about are the crumbling government facilities. The vast majority of them, he said, “lack good ventilation systems, and these places could turn into a ticking bomb if the virus spreads.”

QDZD19I92R_7FZ4LVSD3LKCI2F,Bob Menendez’s golden rule,Jesús Rodríguez,"January 23, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/01/23/bob-menendez-reelection-bid-amid-federal-charges/,"More than four decades ago, before his suicide, before all this, Mario Menendez had some advice for his son.
“There’s only one thing the government can’t take away from you, the police can’t take away from you, the army can’t take away: It’s your word.”
Bob Menendez is thinking of his father’s words from a navy leather armchair in his office on Capitol Hill, a place some people, including dozens of colleagues, don’t think he deserves to be anymore. Not since the Justice Department indicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery and honest services fraud and extortion, as well as acting as an unregistered foreign agent of the Egyptian government while serving as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — all of which Menendez denies.
“Think a lot about what you’re going to give as your word, but once you give it, then keep it, and be a man of your word,” the New Jersey Democrat continues, quoting his father’s wisdom. Now his voice is shaky. His throat won’t let the next word go, so the sound that comes out is a whimper. His mouth twists into a wordless sob. “Remembering my father,” he mumbles.
Mario Menendez hadn’t been certain that giving up what little they had and starting over in America would mean more stability than weathering the conflict between Fulgencio Batista’s military dictatorship and Fidel Castro’s uprising, his son would later write, but his wife, Evangelina, persuaded him to leave Cuba for Puerto Rico and then New York City. Bob was born there on New Year’s Day, 1954, and the family settled in a red-brick tenement in Union City, N.J., across the Hudson River.
Mario became a carpenter. Evangelina found work as a seamstress.
Their son grew up to be mayor of their city, a New Jersey state legislator and, eventually, a U.S. senator.
Mario died when Bob was 23, before seeing him reach those heights, but his son socked away that advice about integrity and thought of it whenever people came to him asking for favors or endorsements.
“When I gave them my word,” Menendez says in his office, regaining his composure after a few seconds, “it was as good as gold.”
Things that Menendez socked away as a senator, including literal gold, are part of the federal case against him; prosecutors allege that Menendez used his power and influence to benefit three business executives in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, mortgage payments, a luxury car for his wife and — intriguingly — gold bars (more on those later).
Menendez has denied the allegations in news conferences and court filings, but the indictment has nevertheless cast a shadow over his prospects for reelection in the fall. An October Stockton University poll found that 71 percent of New Jersey residents say he should resign, and both that poll and a November Rutgers-Eagleton poll found his favorable ratings in the single digits.
He rose in New Jersey politics as part of an anti-corruption alliance that ousted a Union City boss who had been convicted in a racketeering case in which a 28-year-old Menendez gave testimony. Now, Menendez’s American success story is at risk of becoming a cautionary tale of corruption, decadence and hubris.
“Embedded in that story are definitely all the elements of a Greek tragedy: the same purpose for which the character and the Greek tragedy started is what ultimately undermines the character,” says Frank Argote-Freyre, a former Menendez staffer. “Rather than reforming the system, the system seems to have changed him, based on these allegations.”
Then again, this is not Menendez’s first federal indictment. He’s beaten federal charges before without giving up his Senate seat. And even when some Democrats doubted his political future, he went on to lock down reelection.
“My history will not be defined by this case,” Menendez says in his office. “And I have every expectation that we’re” — his voice tightens — “gonna win.”
Menendez was not forged just by the words of his father. He was also forged by Hudson County, a cutthroat political fiefdom where it’s hard to win anything unless you have powerful friends standing behind you. The local mayors — nicknamed “the 12 Cardinals” — are considered more influential than some members of Congress, and their aides are expected to devote day and night to electing local candidates.
Menendez’s half-century in politics began here. After being elected to his local school board at age 20, he became a protégé of William Musto, the mayor of Union City, whose 2006 New York Times obituary described the pair as being “like father and son” (though Menendez says he didn’t see it that way). He later turned on Musto, he wrote in a memoir, after being bothered by what he believed to be shady dealings between the mayor and the president of the school board. “I refused to look the other way, and began to complain in public about illegal financial dealings,” Menendez wrote.
The U.S. attorney filed corruption charges against Musto, and prosecutors won a conviction thanks in part to Menendez’s testimony. (“I have never violated a public trust,” Musto reportedly said before being sentenced to seven years.) Whether Menendez had acted out of principle or political expediency when it came to Musto was “always an open — and maybe unanswerable — question,” wrote New Jersey politics watcher Fred Snowflack in a 2017 post on InsiderNJ.com. But “whatever the real reason, things turned out well for Menendez.”
Cuban Americans were a growing population in Union City, and in 1986, Menendez ran for his mentor’s old job — his second attempt — and became New Jersey’s only Latino mayor. “Just to become mayor in a little town, it was a big fight,” said Rafael Fraguela, who knew Menendez first as a student council president at their high school and later followed him into politics. Alliances in the local party split, Fraguela said, with some Democrats believing the seat “belonged to a non-Cuban or non-Hispanic.”
He became an assemblyman next, then a state senator. By 1992, he’d caught the eye of Ray Lesniak, the chair of the New Jersey Democratic Party, then in charge of redrawing the electoral maps. Menendez was a hard-nosed guy who could turn on the charm. “I saw him as a star — the star — in the Hispanic community at the time,” Lesniak recalls. And so the 13th Congressional District took the shape of a fish hook, Lesniak threw his weight behind Menendez before the seven-term incumbent even announced he was stepping down, and voters sent Menendez to Washington.
Havana on the Hudson indeed saw him as a star. Menendez “wouldn’t be able to walk very far” on the streets of Union City without Latinos coming up to greet him, according to Argote-Freyre, who was his press secretary in those days. They’d interrupt his lunches at El Único, on Park Avenue, and ask about relations with Cuba, about the political status of Puerto Rico, about the potholes he could no longer fix because he was no longer mayor.
“I can guarantee you that Bob Menendez never laid eyes on a gold bar when we were going around through Union City,” Argote-Freyre said.
In an office up Kennedy Boulevard, past two cemeteries and a boarded-up jewelry shop whose sign still reads “DINERO POR ORO,” Anthony Vainieri Jr. was sitting at his wide wooden desk one December afternoon. Just outside his door was a darkened lounge with upholstered benches and flower vases. It didn’t seem like a likely destination for politicians, but they do come around. The governor was here a few weeks ago. And Menendez has been here too.
“For wakes,” Vainieri said.
Wakes.
“That’s what I’m talking about,” he said. He gestured at the unpeopled room outside. “It’s a funeral home. He’s been 100 times.”
Vainieri knows a lot about death: literal, figurative. Besides running the funeral home, he chairs the Hudson County Democratic Organization, a powerful committee that has historically functioned as a political machine here. He said he was the one to deliver the bad news to Menendez’s staff that Hudson County Democrats were no longer backing him.
“I supported him in every one of his elections,” Vainieri said, “but definitely cannot support him this time around. The charges are too serious.”
The first time the feds investigated Menendez, in 2006, the same year he was appointed to the Senate, the probe centered on an allegation that Menendez had helped a nonprofit obtain millions of dollars in federal funding, then collected rent from it — in effect funneling the government dollars into his own pocket. In 2011, prosecutors closed the investigation without charges as he was gearing up for his first Senate reelection bid.
Within a few years, Menendez was back in the crosshairs. The 2015 federal indictment homed in on his relationship with a Florida ophthalmologist who lavished him with gifts and trips to an ultraexclusive villa in a Dominican sugar-mill town. Prosecutors alleged that the senator had used his office to benefit the eye doctor’s businesses and help him secure U.S. visas for several of his girlfriends. But at his 2017 trial the jury deadlocked, and the Justice Department later dropped the charges.
Menendez’s friends largely stood behind him through his legal travails, and the senator seemed to resent certain others who did not. “To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat, I know who you are,” Menendez said, victorious on the courthouse steps. “And I won’t forget you.”
“I think with him, loyalty is a two-way street,” said William O’Dea, a Hudson County commissioner. “He demands loyalty — great loyalty — but he also gives great loyalty.”
“His reputation is that he’s fiercely loyal to people that are loyal to him,” said Steven Fulop, Jersey City’s mayor and a current gubernatorial candidate, who’s clashed with the Menendezes over the years. “And can be very, very aggressive when you’re his enemy.”
After the indictment dropped in late September, Hudson County might have been the place where the senator stood the best chance of persuading old friends to take him at his word that he would clear his name. But the mayors of Hudson County all felt it was time to move on. On Nov. 15, they announced they were endorsing Tammy Murphy, the wife of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and a former Goldman Sachs banker, for the seat Menendez has held for 18 years.
At a time when the senator needs loyalty more than ever, Menendez seems to see the governor’s break with him as a betrayal.
“When Governor Murphy was sued after he won his first term, there was accusations that in his campaign, there were reports of sexual assault and whatnot,” Menendez says, referring a campaign worker’s 2019 lawsuit that led to a $1 million settlement. “I didn’t jump to the — I found it serious, but I didn’t jump to the conclusion that, in fact, he knew about it and he permitted it to take place.”
The senator adds that it “would’ve been impossible” for Murphy to have read the indictment before calling on him to resign on the same day, “because I hadn’t read it.”
“So it was premeditated,” he says. “And then to see that his wife is the one that he promotes to run? He’s been trying to get to Washington for some time. I guess this is what he sees as his avenue to achieve that.”
A spokesperson for Phil Murphy said he wouldn’t “dignify the senator’s attacks with a response” and noted that the governor said on a podcast that he’d personally called Menendez before putting out his statement.
The governor and the 12 Cardinals are not alone in their decision not to stand behind Menendez this time. Just one member of New Jersey’s congressional delegation is still overtly supporting the embattled senator: his son, Democrat Robert Menendez Jr. Lesniak, who helped the elder Menendez get to Congress in the 1990s, has called for him to resign. So has LeRoy J. Jones Jr., the current chair of the New Jersey Democratic Party, as well as the state’s junior senator, former Newark mayor Cory Booker, Menendez’s close ally. (In his statement, Booker had fond words about their friendship, but said Menendez ultimately had to make a sacrifice.)
“This is where loyalty didn’t matter — it was expediency,” Menendez says of those who turned on him.
Ravi Bhalla, the mayor of Hoboken, used to be willing to tolerate Menendez’s legal dramas. He stood just behind him at his reelection victory speech in 2018, after Menendez’s first trial ended with a hung jury, because he still thought the senator could help his constituents. No longer.
“It was a line that was drawn for me,” said Bhalla, who’s now challenging Robert Menendez Jr. for his House seat, “where I decided that this is not somebody that we want to represent the state of New Jersey.”
And where does he draw the line, exactly?
“Gold bars.”
“Cold, hard cash lining his Senate jacket pockets.”
“A Mercedes gifted to him.”
“The list goes on.”
Would you like to know about the gold bars now?
Prosecutors claim that a New Jersey real estate tycoon, Fred Daibes, gave Menendez the gold bars as bribes to get him to interfere in Daibes’s federal prosecution for fraud. Menendez allegedly did so by recommending that a sympathetic lawyer be nominated to be a U.S. attorney. Daibes has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
Andrei Bobkoff, a Belarusian immigrant in his 30s, has lived in New Jersey for about five years, but he hadn’t heard the name Bob Menendez until the indictment came down. His group chats, he says, lit up with photos and jokes about the senator because, well, Bobkoff deals in gold. And so do his friends.
He runs the Honest Coin Shop in West New York, which borders Union City. The shop is really a “media room” in the building where he lives; he brings people here to make deals. Bobkoff recently sold his last gold bar at a coin show in Parsippany after the indictment. (In a text, his business partner said that Menendez’s indictment boosted demand, and the gold-bar market quickly dried up.) The sale wasn’t anything too special — the bar went for $2,000 to another dealer.
But the 13 bars in the senator’s house?
“Those were unusual bars. Those were bars that were definitely not made at some point in the modern days,” he says. In other words: more valuable than bars of a more recent mintage. He looks at the prosecutors’ photos, Googles the price of gold, and estimates that each of the one-kilo ingots could fetch around $64,000.
The kinds of people who hold onto gold bars can be classified into two broad categories, Bobkoff says. The first kind keeps them as family heirlooms, passed down through generations by a distant relative who, say, immigrated to America. The other kind are the hoarders. “They just want protection from the day when the U.S. economy collapses. I know that sounds crazy.”
Menendez wouldn’t address the gold bars with us, promising a “convincing” explanation at his trial, which is scheduled for May, the month before the New Jersey Democratic primary. As for the cash, the senator previously said that he’d withdrawn it from his personal savings account and socked it away for “emergencies” and “because of a history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.” (For what it’s worth, Donald Scarinci, who first met Menendez at 16 and has remained a loyal confidant, said: “As long as I’ve known him, he’s saved cash.”)
Menendez’s diaspora defense for his cash-hoarding strains credulity to Eliana Fernandez, the organizing director at the immigrant rights group Make the Road New Jersey. “It might be something that maybe some families do if they don’t have resources or access, so they can safeguard their belongings,” she said. “But I don’t think the correlation for something as big as this would be justifiable.”
Still, Fernandez had been reluctant to talk about the cash the feds say they found in Menendez’s home. The senator has been a vocal supporter of her group’s causes, including against the last privately operated immigrant detention center in New Jersey, near the group’s headquarters in Elizabeth. An immigrant from Ecuador, she can work legally because of DACA, the federal deportation-relief program that came to life thanks in part to Menendez’s advocacy. Whoever replaced him, she said, would have “big shoes to fill” with respect to immigration advocacy.
Menendez’s roots still matter to some people. Especially those who appreciate how being the child of Cuban immigrants might have shaped his politics.
More than the office he occupied, Latinos considered him a friend,” said Idida Rodriguez, a veteran Democratic consultant in New Jersey who worked to elect Menendez in his 2006 Senate run. “People felt close to him. Even if they didn’t know him, they felt they had a personal relationship to him. Latinos are very loyal.”
Up the street from Vainieri’s funeral home, at the West New York Town Hall, Albio Sires, a longtime friend and Menendez’s successor in the House, said he wasn’t going to comment on Menendez “because I don’t want to.” Teresa Ruiz, the state senate majority leader who received a “trailblazer” award from Menendez in 2020, wouldn’t sit for an interview after weeks of calls with her staff. A Newark Latino official declined to comment because it was better to “let things take their course,” and three Latino former staffers either declined to speak on the record or did not return requests for comment.
“People don’t want to talk about it because it’s like a member of the family, you know?” said Argote-Freyre.
Janet Murguía, a longtime friend and president of UnidosUS, wasn’t prepared to say whether Menendez should remain involved in politics. But she did say this much: If Menendez were to leave the Senate, “We’d be losing the most politically astute, most knowledgeable of the legislative process and most effective advocate of any Latino member to ever serve in Congress.”
Back in his office, Menendez says New Jerseyans could still reelect him “if we get our chance, in a timely fashion,” to fight the charges in court. He’s bullish he could beat the case before it gets to trial. As for his popularity, “I have never run where my poll — I mean, it wasn’t single digits — but I had never run where my poll was ever particularly good.”
The day after Menendez turned 70, the Justice Department announced a new superseding indictment against him. It added no new charges, but alleged that Menendez had taken more bribes for aiding Qatar, citing among other evidence a text exchange between Daibes and Menendez in which the developer offers him a selection of luxury wristwatches ranging in value from about $10,000 to nearly $24,000. In another text exchange cited by prosecutors, between the real estate tycoon and Menendez’s wife, Nadine, Daibes called the senator “as loyal as they come.”
A week later, Menendez strode onto the Senate floor, where he delivered a 20-minute defense. He accused the government of filing indictment after indictment to “keep the sensational story in the press” and convict him in the court of public opinion. Near the end of the speech, his voice started to waver. “After 50 years of public service, this is not how I wanted to celebrate my golden jubilee,” he said. “But I have never violated the public trust. I have been a patriot for, and of, my country.”
Some voters might take Menendez at his word. Others might weigh the evidence."
QF02N09VA7_QYWI8CT8MQ2FCXD,Trump says he opposes RNC proposal to name him the party’s presumptive nominee,Maegan Vazquez,"January 25, 2024 at 8:45 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/trump-rnc-resolution-nominee/,"Donald Trump voiced his opposition to a resolution being proposed to the Republican National Committee that would name him the presumptive GOP presidential nominee even though rival Nikki Haley remains in the race. The effort by national party officials was seen as a symbolic show of support for the former president and would allow more party resources to be devoted to Trump’s campaign.
The RNC confirmed earlier Thursday it planned to consider a resolution declaring Trump the party’s presumptive nominee — even though 48 states have yet to cast their ballots in the primary race. The proposed resolution, which was first reported by the Dispatch, garnered swift criticism from RNC members in states across the country.
But on Thursday night, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the RNC should not move forward with its consideration of the proposal.
“I feel, for the sake of PARTY UNITY, that they should NOT go forward with this plan, but that I should do it the ‘Old Fashioned’ way, and finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX,” he wrote.

Before Trump weighed in, RNC spokesman Keith Schipper said in a statement that the resolution would be taken up by the RNC’s Resolutions Committee, which would “decide whether to send this resolution to be voted on by the 168 RNC members at our annual meeting next week.” Schipper emphasized that RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel does not offer resolutions but that they are brought forward by RNC members.
That resolution has now been withdrawn, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.
Haley’s campaign, in an email Thursday evening, blasted the proposed RNC resolution.
“Trump’s establishment lackeys are pushing for a toothless resolution to deny millions of Republican voters from having a say in the presidential contest,” the campaign said.
Haley herself weighed in Friday, knocking Trump for the sequence of events that led to the withdrawal of the resolution.
“They got so much pushback that he had to backtrack,” Haley said on Fox News. “I mean, he’s totally unhinged.”
If the resolution had been adopted by the broader pool of RNC members at its winter meeting in Las Vegas next week, it would have started the process of having the national party integrate with Trump’s campaign as though Trump was already the elected nominee. Trump’s current campaign operation has not yet integrated itself with the RNC, and Democrats have had a significant head start in fundraising and organizing because they have operated internally as if President Biden would be the nominee since he took office in 2021.
This action typically does not happen until a candidate has garnered 1,215 delegates in nominating contests.
Haley is the only major challenger to Trump remaining in the Republican nominating contests. And although she came closer to beating him in New Hampshire than some pre-primary polling indicated, she still faces an uphill battle in the remaining contests.
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R), who endorsed Haley and campaigned alongside her in the Granite State, called the resolution “absolutely awful.”
Haley is “not going anywhere because Ronna McDaniel says so or Trump tries to keep manipulating things,” he told CNN on Thursday before the former president publicly declared his opposition to the proposed resolution. The party, Sununu argued, was “moving the goal post. They’re changing the rules. But when you do that, that’s usually done because they’re afraid.”
McDaniel recently signaled her support for getting the party to coalesce behind the former president.
She told Fox News on Tuesday night, after Trump was declared the winner of the GOP primary in New Hampshire, “I’m looking at the math and the path going forward, and I don’t see it for Nikki Haley.”
McDaniel said it was time for the party to “unite around our eventual nominee, which is going to be Donald Trump.”
The RNC is putting the finishing touches on a joint fundraising agreement with state parties that will allow the nominee to accept checks up to $836,300 from wealthy donors, according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
While she’s facing increasing pressure from Republicans to drop out, Haley has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race for the long haul, saying that voters do not want to see a Trump “coronation.”
After initial news about the resolution broke, RNC members from Mississippi, Tennessee and New Jersey publicly criticized the proposal.
Gordon Ackley, the chairman of the Republican Party in the U.S. Virgin Islands, also voiced his concerns about the resolution, writing on X, “The Virgin Islands will go ahead with the caucus on February 8.”
“It is unfortunate other Republicans want to deny their voters the opportunity to be heard and cast a vote. Regardless of who you support, there is a process that must be followed,” added Ackley, who welcomed Haley for a GOP state committee virtual event earlier this week.
Haley’s campaign appears to be leaning into the potential to scoop up votes in open or semi-open primaries, given that she has fared better with independent and unaffiliated voters than Trump.
Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney noted in a memo earlier this week that South Carolina and Michigan each have open primaries — a more welcoming political landscape for Haley. And on March 5, or Super Tuesday, 11 of the 16 states and territories will host open or semi-open primaries, representing “significant fertile ground,” Ankney wrote.

QHAHBWV3KJ_326XHSOE0614N8G,Jury orders Trump to pay E. Jean Carroll more than $83 million for defaming her,Shayna Jacobs,"January 26, 2024 at 2:28 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/26/trump-e-jean-carroll-defamation-trial-closing-arguments-jury/,"NEW YORK — A civil jury on Friday ordered Donald Trump to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll more than $83 million for defaming her, a hefty financial penalty that doubled as a remarkable denunciation of his rhetoric.
The federal court jury’s verdict delivered a stinging courtroom loss to the former president as he closes in on another Republican presidential nomination. At the same time, it illustrated the degree to which Trump’s year could be defined as much by courtrooms as the campaign trail.
Trump is facing a tangled web of potential financial and legal jeopardy, including four criminal cases and a civil fraud case that could also end with a monetary penalty.
This case marked the second time in less than a year that jurors have concluded that Trump wronged Carroll and owed her recompense. She accused him in 2019 of sexually assaulting her two decades earlier, and Trump responded with a string of denials and vituperative attacks on her that continue to this day.
Carroll filed two civil lawsuits as a result, saying Trump’s denials and remarks “shattered my reputation” while prompting a flood of harassing and threatening messages from his supporters.
After one of her lawsuits went to trial last year, a jury found that Trump sexually abused and defamed Carroll and awarded her a combined $5 million in damages. Because of that verdict, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who oversaw both cases, said the separate jury hearing this trial would only have to determine whether Trump owed Carroll additional damages — and if so, how much.
Jurors needed about three hours to say he did — and much more than last year. Most of the $83.3 million in damages on Friday was $65 million in punitive damages, along with $18.3 million in compensatory damages.
Trump, who is appealing the verdict from last year, quickly vowed to do the same with this latest outcome, posting on social media that it was “ridiculous” and saying that the courts were being “used as a Political Weapon.” He has denied wrongdoing in all cases, civil and criminal, and claimed that he is being politically targeted.
After the verdict was announced, Trump attorney Alina Habba directed her criticism at the judge and suggested that Kaplan had restricted her ability to put on a case.
Before the trial got underway, Kaplan wrote that the case would not re-litigate Carroll’s accusations, saying that “the material facts concerning the alleged sexual assault have already been determined, and this trial will not be a ‘do over’ of the previous trial.” He also blocked Trump from offering testimony or evidence “suggesting or implying that he did not sexually assault” Carroll.
After Habba exited the courthouse Friday following the verdict, she said: “Before I walked into court, that judge decided every single defense President Trump had — we were not allowed to raise in front of the jury.” The case, she said, was “a violation of our justice system.”
1/6
Carroll did not speak while leaving the courthouse but released a statement later through her attorneys saying that it was “a great victory for every woman who stands up when she’s been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down.”
Trump has already given the $5 million he was ordered to pay in damages in last year’s Carroll trial to the federal court in New York, where it is being held while his appeal is litigated. While Friday’s verdict is much larger, Trump has often touted his personal wealth, and a Washington Post tally last year found that in a financial filing, he disclosed about $1 billion in earnings.
The damages awarded Friday came as he awaits a decision in an unrelated civil case. Trump and his company face a lawsuit accusing them of years-long financial fraud. New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), who filed that lawsuit, has asked New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, who is hearing the case without a jury, to hand down a $370 million penalty. Engoron said he hopes to issue his decision by Wednesday.
This trial, meanwhile, began last week when a panel of nine jurors — seven men and two women — were seated to hear the case. Their identities were kept hidden, much like the jurors’ identities were shielded in Carroll’s case last year. Kaplan noted, among other things, the intense scrutiny that members of the jury would receive, Trump’s habit of publicly attacking everyone including judges and jurors, and the possibility that people on the panel could face harassment.
Carroll’s attorneys said that after she accused Trump of assault, his denials only enhanced the trauma she was already enduring. She testified last year that Trump violently attacked her during a chance encounter at Bergdorf Goodman, an upscale Manhattan department store, in the mid-1990s.

At the time she made her accusation public in 2019, Trump was in the White House and “had the biggest microphone on the planet” — which he used to excoriate her, Shawn Crowley, one of Carroll’s attorneys, said during this trial.
Habba, in turn, said that Trump was merely defending himself and that Carroll’s profile grew, rather than took a hit, describing her as “more famous than she has ever been in her life and loved and respected by many, which was her goal.”
Trump continued to pillory Carroll throughout the trial, filling his social media timeline with dozens of attacks. His commentary on the issue crowded out his rhetoric on political issues, even as he still faces a contest against former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who is challenging him for the Republican nomination.
Trump chose to put appearing in court for this trial ahead of additional campaign stops in New Hampshire, a sign of his political team’s comfort with his lead as well as the importance of the case to him. People close to Trump said that he regretted skipping other optional court dates in the past, and that he came to believe his media coverage and treatment from the legal system were both better when he appeared in person.
While Trump did not testify during last year’s trial or attend the proceedings — staying away even as he threatened to come and “confront” Carroll — he attended this trial on multiple days, including when Carroll testified last week. Kaplan threatened to eject Trump from the courtroom at one point if he did not remain quiet during her testimony.
This week, a visibly angry Trump took the stand and testified for just a few minutes before leaving the courtroom, muttering “This is not America” multiple times.
Kaplan had repeatedly warned Habba that Trump could address only a limited number of topics on the stand. And while lawyers discussed the boundaries of his testimony, Trump sat at the defense table and audibly muttered that he had “never met” Carroll. Kaplan scolded the former president to keep his voice down.
On Friday, another attorney for Carroll, Roberta Kaplan — who is not related to the judge — said her client sought relief from Trump’s ongoing attacks. He has continued to denounce Carroll, including in a televised appearance last year shortly after the verdict in her other case.
“While Donald Trump doesn’t care about the law, he certainly does not care about the truth, he does care about money,” Kaplan said during her closing remarks.
While she was speaking, Trump stood up and left the courtroom. He returned later for Habba’s closing remarks.
His attorney said Trump’s motive was not to ruin Carroll’s career but to defend himself from what he maintains is a false accusation. And Habba argued that Carroll is seeking attention and that she “loves her new reputation and her life.”
Jurors began deliberating about 1:40 p.m. and returned with a verdict about three hours later. Trump was not in the courtroom to hear it.

Equally important for Trump may be that he held off Haley in New Hampshire’s large suburban counties, which are part of the Boston metropolitan area in neighboring Massachusetts. A weak showing in the suburbs could have been an indication that Trump would struggle to recapture those critical voters in areas that swung heavily to Joe Biden in 2020.
Trump’s clear path, Haley’s refusal to bow and other takeaways
But New Hampshire’s suburban voters supported Trump. His winning margin in the major metro suburbs adjoining Massachusetts was slightly higher than his performance in the rest of the state.
In the last presidential election, the suburbs around the nation’s largest metro areas pushed strongly to the Democratic side. Biden won those counties by almost 2.4 million votes, compared with margins of about 400,000 for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. If Biden maintains that bulge in the suburbs this year as the Democratic nominee, Trump will need even more votes from smaller cities and rural areas.

Nationally, Trump won medium metropolitan areas of less than 1 million people decisively in 2016, by a margin of more than 1.1 million votes. In 2020, however, Biden blunted that advantage. On Tuesday, those voters in the New Hampshire primary joined suburban voters in favoring Trump.
How different groups voted in the New Hampshire primary, according to exit polls
The general election may hang on whether suburban and medium-metro voters return to Trump, giving him the boost he received in 2016, or whether they maintain the shift that drove Biden’s victory in 2020. The pattern for 2024 is far from decided, but at least in the New Hampshire Republican primary, voters in those areas gave Trump strong support.

Trump won his biggest margins in the less dense portions of New Hampshire’s northern region and southwest. He won just about 50 percent of the vote in the denser cities and towns closest to Boston and around the state capital, Concord. Although rural areas have generally favored Trump, he also decisively won in New Hampshire’s largest city, Manchester, and the surrounding region.

The injury was not life-threatening. Lawmaker Bae Hyun-jin was bleeding and conscious as she was taken to a Seoul hospital, according to officials at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital. The male suspect was taken into custody at the Gangnam Police Station for investigation.
The suspect sought to confirm the politician’s identity before striking her by asking, “are you lawmaker Bae Hyun-jin?” according to South Korean outlet Yonhap News, citing Bae’s office. The suspect is believed to be a minor, Yonhap added. Her office could not immediately be reached.
Surveillance video footage released by her office shows a masked person following Bae out of a building entrance and striking her repeatedly in the head as she fell to the floor.
South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung stabbed in neck during Busan visit
The injury was about half an inch long. Although it is relatively small, doctors said Bae was shaken by the assault and they were monitoring potential hemorrhage in her brain.
The attack comes about three weeks after the Jan. 2 attack on Lee Jae-myung, a prominent South Korean political figure and leader of the opposition party. He narrowly lost the presidential election in 2022.
A 66-year-old man approached Lee during his visit to the southern port city of Busan while pretending to be a supporter, then stabbed him in the neck with a knife. Lee was discharged from a hospital about a week later, and the suspect is under police investigation.
Bae, 40, was elected to the National Assembly in 2020 after a career as a television newscaster. She is a member of the conservative People Power Party, a minority party in parliament and the party of the South Korean president.
“The impact of terrorism isn’t a matter of political camps or political parties. Everyone agrees it should not exist, and that we should find a solution,” said Han Dong-hoon, leader of the People Power Party, in a briefing to reporters.
Lee called the attack “unbelievable” and an act of “political terrorism.”
South Korean politics have become increasingly divisive and bitter ahead of April’s parliamentary elections, in which the Democratic Party’s majority is at stake. After the attack on Thursday, some politicians began calling for safety measures for lawmakers on the campaign trail.
Despite the back-to-back incidents this month, attacks on political figures are rare in South Korea, and past assaults have drawn international attention.
In 2022, liberal lawmaker Song Young-gil was also struck in the head with a blunt object, by an elderly man during a campaign rally in Seoul.
In March 2015, a man slashed U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in the face, arm and leg with a kitchen knife at a breakfast forum in Seoul. The man later stated that he was attempting to disrupt U.S.-South Korean military exercises and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
In 2006, a man wielding a knife slashed conservative opposition party leader Park Geun-hye in the face as she met with voters. Park was later elected president but was impeached in 2016 and sentenced to prison for corruption and abuse of power."
QMNZK1HBYK_B784ABBLCFQQH0Q,"Opinion NATO ramps up for twin challenges, Russia and ... maybe Trump",Lee Hockstader,"January 24, 2024 at 2:41 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/24/nato-europe-russia-trump/,"BRUSSELS — The Netherlands is touristy and tiny, smaller than West Virginia, but during the Cold War it spelled trouble for the Soviet Union. Its no-nonsense armed forces fielded nearly 1,000 tanks, including hundreds of top-shelf ones designed to help its NATO allies slug it out with Moscow’s army on the northern German plains.
Two decades after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, the Netherlands’ active-duty tank inventory had dropped to zero — a small example of the massive disarmament and military downsizing that took place across Europe after the Cold War ended. “This feels like a funeral,” a Dutch tank commander said at a 2011 ceremony marking the moment when the last lumbering tracked vehicles were decommissioned before they were sold off.
Now, the man who took office as the Netherlands’ prime minister just before it mothballed its last tanks, Mark Rutte, is the odds-on favorite to head the U.S.-led NATO, which is again locked in a long-term test of wills with the Kremlin. And here at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the question is how Rutte, who will soon leave office as Europe’s second-longest-serving premier, would deal with what many regard as a pair of grave threats if he is picked to lead the alliance.
One is President Vladimir Putin’s blood-soaked invasion of Ukraine and Russia’s stunningly swift pivot to a war economy, with soaring military spending that many Europeans fear is a prelude to further Russian aggression against NATO’s vulnerable eastern flank. The other is the specter of a second term for Donald Trump, who disdained the alliance, skewered members that spent paltry amounts for their own defense and shredded seven decades of NATO deterrence doctrine by threatening “never” to help Washington’s European allies if they were attacked.
When I was at NATO headquarters last spring, everyone was focused on Ukraine. Now, one ambassador to the alliance told me, “every discussion we have is about Trump.”
Those are vastly different threats, but their dovetailing effect is driving a historic rearmament by NATO’s European members. Their collective defense spending, which began gradually rising after Putin invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula a decade ago, is now accelerating rapidly.
Still, few believe it’s growing fast enough to fund the bloc’s redrawn, highly detailed regional war plans — 4,000 pages of classified documents drafted under the direction of U.S. Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, supreme allied commander in Europe. Few think Europe is prepared to address the gathering threat posed by an axis of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. And no one views it as adequate to replace tens of billions of dollars in proposed new U.S. aid for Ukraine now frozen on Capitol Hill by hard-line Republican lawmakers.
This year, 20 of NATO’s 31 members, including the United States, are expected to meet or exceed the bloc’s defense spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product that was set 10 years ago after Putin annexed Crimea. That reflects about $450 billion in additional spending over a decade by Washington’s NATO partners — a number the alliance likes to tout but comes to just 4.25 percent in average annual increases.
And while Europe’s collective economic might is many times greater than Russia’s, its push to increase defense budgets pales beside Moscow’s roughly 70 percent boost in military spending this year compared with 2023.
Senior NATO officials now think the gathering strategic threats and the alliance’s own blueprints to defend its borders justify a much greater commitment. They are discussing a minimum increase of one-third over today’s collective military spending by non-U. S. members to build muscle in five key areas: air and missile defense, long-distance firepower, IT and communications, logistics, and heavy ground combat forces.
That buildup over a decade or more would saddle NATO’s non-U.S. members with a bill of at least $100 billion annually, requiring a seismic political, economic and psychological pivot. It would very likely mean cuts in Europe’s generous social welfare programs and could blunt intensifying efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, which European officials say could cost $1.6 trillion annually.
Europe has deep pockets, but they’re not deep enough to meet those military, social and environmental goals simultaneously.
Facing down NATO’s enemies doesn’t translate into armies on the scale of the Cold War, when big European countries had hundreds of thousands of men under arms. But even in an era of tech-driven wars, the buildup NATO foresees would require massive modernization and expansion of forces that atrophied for more than 30 years.
That would be the top priority for Rutte if he is selected to succeed Jens Stoltenberg as NATO’s secretary general. A close second on the priority list, if Trump is elected, would be managing a mercurial president — a job for which Rutte, who deployed both flattery and a firm hand in dealing with Trump when he was president, might be quite well suited."
QPLTOTJ4JC_OK6VD4ZID8QH92B,Opinion Congress used to care about the ‘dreamers.’ What happened?,Editorial Board,"January 26, 2024 at 2:22 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/26/congress-border-deal-daca-immigration-dreamers/,"Congress’s border deal talks might be ongoing, but in one essential area, legislators are moving backward: The  ‘dreamers,’ undocumented immigrants who came to this country as children, have been left out of the conversation.
Since the first version of the Dream Act was introduced almost a quarter-century ago, support for the young people who are Americans in every sense but the legal one has been a bright spot of bipartisanship amid acrimony. Almost every immigration compromise that legislators have contemplated has included a pathway to citizenship for these 3 million or so individuals — including a 2022 framework constructed by Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who was a Democrat at the time. Yet today, as lawmakers scramble to secure the votes for a package focused on security and asylum, the issue has scarcely been mentioned. Meanwhile, trouble in the courts leaves the fate of the dreamers as uncertain as ever.
President Barack Obama’s program to help the dreamers, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), was supposed to be a temporary solution to a problem Congress would, eventually, solve. By granting work authorization and immunity from deportation to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as minors, met certain educational requirements and presented no threat to public safety, the executive action offered a cohort of motivated noncitizens the opportunity to grow freely in the only nation they’ve known.
The idea was that legislators would transform this reprieve into a road for dreamers to become citizens. Instead, Congress did nothing. The half a million or so current DACA recipients must renew their status every two years, while approximately 2.5 million dreamers brought here too late to qualify for DACA remain at constant risk of being sent “back” to somewhere they’ve scarcely lived. There are also 100,000 more dreamers who do qualify for DACA but whose applications went unprocessed thanks to covid-era delays. Now, they’re at risk of deportation, too.
It gets worse: Even those 500,000 current DACA recipients could soon lose their status. A federal judge in Texas recently ruled President Biden’s reinstatement of DACA (the program was suspended during Donald Trump’s tenure in the Oval Office) a violation of federal law. Recipients can keep their status as litigation continues. But the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit will hear the case next. After that, the case could reach the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority might yank the program out from under immigrants who’ve relied on its protections to start careers and families. More than 300,000 U.S.-born children have at least one parent with DACA. Suddenly, they could be forced to leave everything behind.
The issue isn’t only that this situation is unjust, though it is. The issue is also that leaving the dreamers to languish is a tremendous waste — of talent, enterprise and devotion to the United States. DACA costs the federal government next to nothing. Its recipients don’t receive the benefits, from Pell Grants to go to college to Medicare to cover their doctors’ bills, that citizens do. But they pay $495 to renew their status every two years, and they pay their taxes. Two dreamers have won Rhodes scholarships. Hundreds are doctors and medical students; thousands work in health care in other capacities. Three-hundred forty thousand were deemed essential workers during the pandemic. Many dreamers who attend college major in education and go on to teach.
The country needs more doctors. It needs more teachers, and it needs teachers bilingual in English and Spanish especially. Many dreamers would love to fill these roles but cannot; many DACA recipients are already filling them today, and forcing them out will hurt their employers, their patients, their students and more.
Why, then, is Congress forgetting the dreamers this time around? However poisoned against immigrants the political conversation may have become, lawmakers from conservative districts shouldn’t be afraid to vote for a position that the vast majority of Americans support. Congress has plenty of options before it: Some version of the Dream Act would be the best of them. Such a policy would allow everyone who came here as a child the ability, by meeting educational, workforce or military requirements, to apply for permanent legal status — starting, most likely, with a green card.
But there are more modest alternatives, if this is too much for legislators to countenance, such as allowing the current DACA recipients a pathway to citizenship or allowing the 100,000 whose applications are in limbo the same privilege. At the very least, Congress could codify DACA so that the current recipients can keep their status — can stay, as advocates refer to it, “DACA-mented” forever without worry. Even the federal judge who struck down DACA in September recognized that these young immigrants have come to rely on the program. The country also relies on them.

Ron DeSantis (R) may have endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican Party’s presidential nominee — but he appears ready to use his veto pen to squash a proposal to help pay the candidate’s mounting legal fees.
Jimmy Patronis, the state’s chief financial officer and a member of the governor’s Cabinet, has promoted a bill to create a “Freedom Fighters Fund” that would provide up to $5 million in “financial support to Florida residents running for President who face legal, partisan, political attacks by the Department of Justice or State Attorneys.”
“It’s in Florida’s best interest to make sure their champion for the President is allowed a fair shot at the White House without being taken down by some fake witch hunt,” Patronis said Monday.
But DeSantis’s campaign account on X, the site formerly known Twitter, quickly chimed in, sharing a story from Politico with the headline, “Some Florida Republicans want taxpayers to pay Trump’s legal bills,” and making his position clear.
“But not the Florida Republican who wields the veto pen,” he quipped.
Democrats in the state legislature also reacted with disapproval.
“Absolutely not,” Rep. Anna Eskamani (D), of Orlando, tweeted.
Patronis was one of the first Florida elected politicians to quickly endorse Trump after DeSantis withdrew from the race on Sunday. State Sen. Ileana Garcia (R) from Miami filed a bill titled “Grants for Victims of Political Discrimination” to support Patronis’s idea. The bill appears to be tailored to Trump’s particular circumstances.
By Monday evening, however, she wrote on X that she’d be withdrawing her support.
“This bill was filed on January 5th amidst a crowded primary, including two Florida residents,” she wrote. “My concern was the political weaponization against conservative candidates.”
She went on to state that Patronis had brought her the bill at a time when “all candidates were committing to campaign through the primary.” She said that the single Florida resident running now for president “can handle himself.”
The bill moved to a committee earlier this month but now has no sponsor.
Republicans in Florida are calculating the best way to move forward in a state where DeSantis remains a powerful executive in Tallahassee, but at the same time support Trump, who has been the favored presidential candidate among many GOP voters here since the race began. Trump moved his official residence to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach in 2019."

The decision comes three months after members of Maryland’s congressional delegation implored the federal agency to have mercy on families who have been fighting for access to the entire amount of their savings. Maryland 529, the agency charged with running the state’s two college savings plans, suspended earnings on 31,000 prepaid tuition accounts in 2022, saying a calculation error incorrectly inflated balances.
“The IRS’s announcement is good news for Maryland,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D), who led the group of lawmakers in the request. “It will provide special tax relief to … many parents and students who were caught up in the earlier system errors and facing significant tax consequences through no fault of their own.”
Parents have waged a relentless battle to force Maryland to make good on a promise to apply a 6 percent earnings rate to accounts in the Maryland Prepaid College Trust. They accused Maryland 529 of a breach of contract. After Maryland Treasurer Dereck E. Davis (D) took over the troubled agency last summer, he agreed to retroactively apply the earnings rate to the frozen accounts.
But that wasn’t the end of the turmoil. Families who had rolled over, or planned to roll over, their money to the state’s traditional 529 plan were at risk of hefty tax bills. The IRS limits owners of 529 accounts to one tax-free rollover per beneficiary within 12 months and imposes a 10 percent penalty on additional rollovers.
Last year, about 500 families with prepaid accounts had rolled over the principal balance of their accounts into Maryland’s traditional 529 plan to continue to grow their savings. To get the retroactive earnings, they had to file a claim with the state and then roll over that money again — which would have triggered the penalty.
The tax also would have fallen on account holders with multiple prepaid plans if they chose to roll over some or all of those accounts. The prepaid trust, unlike the state’s traditional 529 plan, lets families lock in future tuition payments by purchasing semester credits by either the semester, the year or multiple years. As a result, 3,697 prepaid trust beneficiaries have more than one account.
To avoid financial hardship, the IRS will not penalize prepaid account holders who employ more than one rollover between Dec. 31, 2021, and Jan. 1, 2025.
The ruling is a relief to Michael Dubsky of Carroll County. The father of two has three prepaid plans for his daughter and four for his son, totaling about $155,000. Without the IRS ruling, Dubsky could have been on the hook for $15,500 in taxes from rolling over the plans.
“This is a big win, and I give thanks to Congressman Raskin and his staff for helping,” he said. “People have been caught up in this mess for too long.”
Rollovers are especially attractive as the treasurer prepares to wind down the trust and reset the earnings rate to zero this summer. All account holders will have to transfer their money to the 529 investment plan to continue earning money on their accounts at that point. Now they will be able to do so without worrying about the tax burden.
“We were pleased to hear the news today from the IRS,” Davis said in a statement. “Our office was proud to proactively work with Congressman Raskin’s office and supported the effort to deliver this tax relief to account holders.”"

Regular readers of The Post’s food coverage and anyone who has ever joined our weekly cooking chats are probably already familiar with me and my work. But now that I’ll be taking over the Dinner in Minutes column, trying to fill the shoes left by former recipes editor Ann Maloney, I thought I’d give you a refresher about me and explain the types of recipes I plan to highlight in this space.
I was born and raised in Chicago and went to college in St. Louis, so soul food and hearty Midwest dishes form the foundation of my culinary philosophy. To me, that means there’s generally a thread of comfort in many of the recipes I create. On top of that, I spent about 13 years in New York City, which introduced me to a more global pantry and deepened my love for streamlined cooking due to the tiny kitchen I had to put up with for most of my time there. (My D.C. apartment kitchen is so much bigger.)

I’m an omnivore but have become more conscious about my consumption of meat and seafood. I also have a fin fish allergy, so I won’t be featuring them during my tenure. Outside of what I can’t consume, there isn’t really much I won’t eat.
1/3
In terms of flavor profiles, I enjoy the big and the bold as well as dishes that are simple and subtle — and everything in between. I’m a curious cook who loves to experiment in the kitchen and also finds pleasure in revisiting old favorites. Long story short, I love it all! I’m excited about the first set of recipes I have lined up to share with you, but if there’s anything you’re interested in — a cuisine, ingredient or dish (that we don’t already have in our database of more than 10,000 recipes) — send me an email or leave a comment.
The mission of the Dinner in Minutes column is to provide readers with reliable weeknight recipes that will (hopefully) quickly become family favorites and can be made in 45 minutes or less. I plan to share a variety of dishes to suit myriad tastes, but I think this is one that almost everyone will love. For my first act, I’m highlighting an Italian American classic: fettuccine Alfredo. It’s creamy, comforting, easy to prepare and a worthy addition to your dinner repertoire.
A post shared by Voraciously (@eatvoraciously)
The dish was created — or updated, rather — in the early 20th century by Roman restaurateur Alfredo di Lelio. It is based on fettuccine al burro, which is simply pasta coated in a sauce of butter and cheese. That’s it. Just three ingredients (plus salt). However, di Lelio increased the amount of butter for a richer, creamier sauce. The story goes that he prepared it as a way to nourish his wife after she gave birth to their son and lost her appetite — and, needless to say, she found it again with each forkful of comforting carbs and dairy. This updated version landed on his restaurant’s menu, and when it made its way to the United States, its name was updated to reference di Lelio.
The key to a silky sauce in the original version is creating an emulsion with the pasta cooking water, butter and cheese. However, this requires a skilled hand lest you end up with a broken sauce. For a less finicky, albeit nontraditional Alfredo sauce, cooks at some point started adding heavy cream. And as someone who is all about making things easier, I add it, too. Other additions often include black pepper, garlic, some sort of meat and/or vegetable, and a flourish of fresh parsley.
My version starts by cooking chicken or mushrooms in a skillet until nicely browned. (Chicken is probably more popular, but I prefer mushrooms.) The Alfredo sauce is then prepared in that same skillet, which can add even more flavor if there are browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, depending on the material it’s made out of, that then get incorporated into the sauce. Lastly, the pasta and some of its cooking water join in on the fun while the fettuccine finishes cooking and marries with the sauce. (Remember, you always want to finish pasta in the sauce if it’s warm.)
Yes, one could argue that this recipe is a far cry from the original, but it still possesses the same comforting, nourishing spirit — and can be on the dinner table in just 30 minutes.

RDUEGBU192_F1SNVZ61FORBJ0L,Life at Sea passengers say canceled 3-year cruise owes them millions,_,"January 23, 2024 at 12:07 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/01/23/life-at-sea-cruise-passengers-fraud-allegations/,"More than a month after a Turkish cruise company reneged on the promise of a lifetime — a three-year trip around the world in more than 140 countries — customers who spent millions in deposits are asking a U.S. attorney for help getting their money back.
In a saga seemingly destined to join the canon of Netflix scandal documentaries, Miray Cruises’s failure to launch the Life at Sea sailing has left dozens of passengers without homes, jobs, cars, retirement funds and life savings.
A letter sent to Markenzy Lapointe, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, identifies 78 of the passengers for the Life at Sea sailing as “Victims of Miray.” The letter, which was reviewed by The Washington Post, says passengers lost an estimated $16 million from Miray actions that amount to misrepresentation and fraud. The group includes citizens from the United States, Australia, England, Singapore and India, among other countries. The majority of the customers were seniors over 65.
“The failure of Miray to refund passenger money as promised has caused a significant number of residents to literally become homeless,” the letter says. “Many are living out of suitcases in motels or in spare rooms because of the generosity of friends.”
Miray said in a statement to passengers earlier this month the refunds are slow-rolling due to banking and credit card problems, according to the letter. Spokespeople for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. It’s unclear if Lapointe’s office will take up an investigation. The passengers’ letter, which is intended to serve as a formal criminal complaint, says they suffered damages worse than victims of the botched Fyre Festival in the Bahamas; organizer Billy McFarland went to federal prison for wire fraud.
“They’ve not only dashed our hopes and dreams and upset the course of our lives, but they keep wasting our time,” passenger Shirene Thomas, a 58-year-old retired social services worker, told The Post. She said she moved out of the house she was renting, sold her car and condensed her life into five boxes for the trip. She’s currently living with a friend in North Carolina.
Between June and August of 2023, Thomas said she made 27 individual transactions across eight credit cards to Miray, amounting to nearly $157,000 for the three-year trip. (Miray was offering slight discounts to customers who paid upfront for the three years.) “It took so much time and now as you can imagine, it’s taking even more time to file disputes with 27 different transactions and provide them all the documentation.”
So far, only four passengers have seen any of their money returned to them, the letter says.
“One of the harder parts of it all was the lack of communication and being gaslit,” Thomas says. “It would have been much easier if they had just come out and said this was falling through, but that was not what they did.”
In March 2023, Miray, a company that typically runs cruises around the Aegean Sea, announced the 1,095-day cruise for as low as $30,000 a year, including lodging, food and other accommodations. While the concept wasn’t particularly new, what Miray was offering and the price it advertised were somewhat rare. (Thomas says that the price tag didn’t end up being entirely accurate, as it reflected the price of only some double occupancy cabins.) Prospective passengers were informed that they would be sailing on the Gemini, a vessel owned by Miray. The boat was scheduled to set sail in November.
As the months elapsed, passengers paid their deposits, acquired new visas, packed up their lives and prepared for sea. Some re-homed pets. Some sold houses. Others dipped into their retirement funds. Meanwhile, the original management team behind Life at Sea quit, apparently over disputes regarding the Gemini’s seaworthiness. During this time, most communication with passengers happened via webinars with new Miray executives, including former CEO Kendra Holmes and COO Ethem Bayramoglu.  In July, they announced they’d found a bigger boat to embark on the journey.
In October, passengers shipped off their belongings to Istanbul or Miami (where the vessel was stopping after Turkey). Miray’s owner, Vedat  Ugurlu, then announced that the voyage would be delayed until Nov. 11. Many passengers had already bought plane tickets or were in temporary lodging in Istanbul waiting for departure. According to the letter submitted to the U.S. attorney’s office, Ugurlu claimed funds were being finalized for the purchase of the boat – but that the trip was still a go.
On Nov.19, the letter says, Ugurlu announced the complete cancellation of the voyage; plans to secure a larger vessel had fallen through. Miray promised passengers a full repayment of the trip and any additional funds that would be paid out in three installments, the first coming on Dec. 22, with payments following in January and February.
In a statement to passengers on Jan. 14, Miray said disputes over credit card chargebacks have delayed the refunds and prevented the company from processing any transfers. Even still, the passengers claim, the company has engaged in “significant and repeated illegal activity,” for marketing a three-year cruise without having a ship first.
Kara Youssef and her husband, Joe, are one of the few who have seen a fraction of the money they sunk into Life at Sea come back to them. The couple had been living in Turkey for two years at the time the cruise was announced. They used up most of their retirement fund, dug out a significant chunk of their savings and sold both properties they owned in Turkey to fund the trip. Since Oct. 28, they’ve been living out of three suitcases in a hotel paid for by Miray.
“Our biggest concern at this point is we’re not going to have anywhere to go very soon,” Youssef told The Post. “It’s not that we’d be homeless, but we may not be allowed to go back to our lives since we sold the property we did our [Turkish] residency under.”
On Saturday, more than a month after the first repayment was supposed to turn up in all passengers’ accounts, Youssef was able to arrange an in-person meeting with Bayramoglu, the COO, who paid her 10,000 in cash — 12 percent of what she and her husband had paid for the cruise. She said the remainder is supposed to come in February at the latest.
“I think that Miray has made some horrible management decisions and has been atrocious in their communication, but if they make their payment, if they refund their passengers, as far as I’m concerned, I’m good,” Youssef says. “I’m not trying to ruin them to make them pay or anything like that.”
Not all passengers signed onto the complaint; George Fox, a 67-year-old Maine resident, told The Post he takes responsibility for the money he lost on the cruise. He had always been skeptical it would happen — the change of management and boat gave him pause, as did his bank’s refusal to wire Miray $30,000 for a deposit — but he says he doesn’t believe it was the result of intentional fraud.
“Everybody that signed up for this, they knew that it was a risk,” says Fox, who after growing dubious of the launch, changed his plans and decided he’d embark in Florida, once the ship had successfully set sea. “It was just a lot of things that kind of came together and didn’t come together. It’s just one of those things … I mean, what can you say? It’s a crazy world.”

RGTFN0URIL_FZMMPZUPKG3IIAG,Opinion Was Abraham Lincoln an incorrigible racist?,_,"July 14, 2017 at 2:39 p.m. EDT",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/was-abraham-lincoln-an-incorrigible-racist/2017/07/14/8247b2a4-4245-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html,"Manisha Sinha, the Draper Chair in American History at the University of Connecticut, is the author, most recently, of “The Slave’s Cause: A History of Abolition.”
The black intellectual and activist W.E.B. Du Bois identified the problem of the 20th century  as the problem of “the color line.” Its roots lay in the conflict over slavery and black citizenship in the early American republic. Statesmen, abolitionists, slaveholders and the enslaved themselves participated in this debate, which eventually begat the Civil War and emancipation.
In this dual biography of Abraham Lincoln and John Quincy Adams, Fred Kaplan, who has previously written biographies of both men, compares Lincoln unfavorably with abolitionists on the great issues of the day.  Unlike the abolitionists, Lincoln — in Kaplan’s telling — opposed emancipation and black rights through much of his life not because he was an anti-slavery moderate, as most historians have argued, but because he was an incorrigible racist and anti-abolitionist.    Seeking to revise hagiographic views of Lincoln, whom he calls an “antislavery moralist,” Kaplan places Adams, whom he dubs an “antislavery activist,” with the abolitionists, even though Adams throughout his long political career never considered himself among their ranks.
How Lincoln grew during his wilderness years into a politically savvy statesman
The title of this book is a misnomer, as it is not a sustained look at the relationship between Lincoln and the abolitionists. Abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass pop in and out of the book, but one gets no sense of the movement. Instead, Kaplan, a professor emeritus of English at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, deploys the views of abolitionists and Adams selectively, mainly to highlight Lincoln’s shortcomings and his allegedly unchanging conservatism on slavery and race. Unlike Douglass, Kaplan places Lincoln not at the head of a great anti-slavery movement but as a lifelong proponent of a lily-white America.
That Lincoln was not an abolitionist, even though he morally abhorred slavery, is not news to historians. Kaplan highlights Lincoln’s role as a lawyer for a slaveholder seeking to remand his slave, Jane Bryant, and her four children back to slavery; Bryant had lived in Illinois and married a free black man.  The author is on less sure ground when he discusses Lincoln’s reaction to the murder of  Elijah Lovejoy, the abolitionist editor killed while defending his printing press from a mob in 1837. Not only did Lincoln vote against anti-abolitionist resolutions in the Illinois legislature, he also penned a protest arguing that slavery was an “injustice and bad policy” but that abolition may increase rather than abate its evils. In a speech a year later, Lincoln condemned mobs that “throw printing presses into rivers” and “shoot editors.” Yet Kaplan with typical overstatement concludes that Lincoln saw  slavery and abolition as equally evil. In fact, while Lincoln consistently condemned slavery as wrong, he came to appreciate the role abolitionists played in the coming of emancipation during the Civil War. But Kaplan lumps Lincoln in the same category as his co-counsel in the Bryant case, Usher Linder, the pro-slavery state attorney general who persecuted Lovejoy and made sure his murderers got off scot-free.
Adams fares better in Kaplan’s book. Like many of the Northern founders, including his father, Adams put the interests of the nation above his qualms over slavery early in his career. Kaplan is at his best in describing anti-slavery in New England and Southern slaveholding moderates as those “who opposed slavery in principle but happily profited from it.” By the 1830s, Adams was a fellow traveler of the abolitionist movement but not a member. Kaplan spends a lot of time writing about Adams’s reaction to the Missouri crisis and Lovejoy’s murder, but says surprisingly little about his virtually one-man opposition to the gag rule against abolitionist petitions in the House of Representatives and absolutely nothing about his defense of the Amistad slave rebels before the Supreme Court.
Kaplan’s understanding of the interracial abolitionist movement is outdated, quaint and erroneous, which undermines his attempt to set it up as a foil to Lincoln. He dismisses Lovejoy as a moral absolutist, misidentifies the American Anti Slavery Society as the American Abolition Society  and claims that some abolitionists were colonizationists. Abolitionists rejected the program of the American Colonization Society, founded in 1817 to repatriate all free blacks back to Africa.
Book review: ‘The Remarkable Education of John Quincy Adams,’ by Phyllis Lee Levin
Kaplan praises Adams’s rejection of colonization in contrast to Lincoln’s long-standing support of it. Lincoln admired Henry Clay, the slaveholding Whig senator from Kentucky, a founding member and president of the American Colonization Society and author of the most important sectional compromises before the Civil War, as his beau ideal of a politician. In the crisis decade before the war, however, Lincoln began sounding a lot more like Adams than Clay. One can trace his evolution in the politics of anti-slavery from his reluctant support of the Fugitive Slave Law to his eloquent denunciation of the Dred Scott decision. Kaplan rarely engages with Lincoln’s words, which lay bare the dilemma of a moderate wrestling with his competing loyalties to the Union, the Constitution and anti-slavery. During the war, Lincoln would move from the non-extension of slavery to abolition, and from colonization to black citizenship, but Kaplan is not impressed by his capacity, as Garrison put it, to grow in office. He reproduces abolitionists’ denunciations of Lincoln for his slowness to act but rarely their praise of him when he adopted emancipation. Lincoln fulfilled Adams’s prediction of the destruction of slavery during a military conflict that would allow the president to evoke his war powers under the Constitution to abolish slavery. In this sense, Lincoln was a political heir to Adams.
Kaplan also does not note that abolitionists such as Owen Lovejoy, brother of the martyred Elijah, and Charles Sumner emerged as confidantes of the president, but he faults Lincoln for making the worst vice-presidential choice in U.S. history, Andrew Johnson, during his reelection bid in 1864. But neither Lincoln nor the abolitionists foresaw that he would be assassinated and that Johnson, the wartime governor of Union-occupied Tennessee known for his hatred of the slaveholding elite, would become president and issue wholesale pardons to them. (Tennessee,  contrary to Kaplan’s claim, did secede from the Union.) And just when he should have left his narrative well alone, Kaplan indulges in a bit of counterfactual history, gratuitously predicting that if Lincoln had lived, he would not have prevented the overthrow of Reconstruction, Jim Crow or even the criminalization of blackness, because for him only white lives mattered. The black abolitionist H. Ford Douglas, who criticized Lincoln’s failure to support black citizenship before the war, knew better. The war he predicted would educate Lincoln on colonization. It would also lay the foundation for an interracial democracy that the nation still aspires to achieve.

It doesn’t look promising.,Aaron Blake,"January 21, 2024 at 6:13 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/haley-gets-her-two-person-race-with-trump-it-doesnt-look-promising/,"The good news for Nikki Haley is that, despite her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses last week, it turns out she was right that this is now a “two-person race.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his campaign Sunday afternoon, two days before the New Hampshire primary.
The bad news is that Haley probably won’t like how that two-candidate race shakes out — and it could be clear very quickly that this is, in actuality, a one-candidate race.
DeSantis becomes the third candidate to drop out in the last 11 days, following Chris Christie before Iowa and Vivek Ramaswamy the night of Monday’s caucuses. Apart from some little-known candidates, that distills it to the two-person campaign all of Donald Trump’s opponents have long aimed for.
But while there was once a time in which that two-person race looked promising — for DeSantis, at least — that is not the case today with Haley, Trump’s former United Nations ambassador.
Haley has always trailed significantly in hypothetical head-to-head matchups with Trump, as far back as last spring. And despite her momentum in New Hampshire — and to some degree nationally — that gap has grown.
The most recent national survey testing that situation, in mid-December from Yahoo News and YouGov, showed her trailing Trump 70 percent to 19 percent — a 51-point deficit. (Like other polling, it suggested DeSantis had slightly more hope in such a race, trailing by 34 points.)
Trump’s edge over Haley and DeSantis might be bigger than you think
The relatively few head-to-head polls we have show similarly overwhelming gaps in such a race.
Of course, Haley’s campaign hasn’t been at all competitive nationally. To the extent there is a path to victory, it’s in defeating Trump in New Hampshire and recasting the race from that point — ideally with another strong showing next month in Haley’s home state of South Carolina, where she was governor from 2011 to 2017.
The only recent poll we have directly testing Trump and Haley head-to-head in New Hampshire would seem significantly more promising for Haley. It’s from mid-December, and it showed Trump at 48 percent and Haley at 45 percent — a margin-of-error race. But it was from the outside group Americans for Prosperity, which had just endorsed Haley.
The picture was bleaker in a poll released Sunday from CNN and the University of New Hampshire. It already showed Trump nearing majority support and a clear victory. He led Haley 50-39 in a race that included DeSantis, who drew just 6 percent support.
But much of DeSantis’s meager vote share would seem headed Trump’s way; twice as many DeSantis supporters named Trump as their second choice (62 percent) than named Haley (30 percent). The would put Trump above 50 percent — just as he was in Iowa — and grow his already double-digit lead.
(We don’t have good recent nonpartisan polling in South Carolina. But Trump already has majority support there in virtually every poll, even in a more-crowded race, and a poll from his super PAC last week showed him leading Haley 68-28 head-to-head.)
The second-choice breakdown is similar in national polling, suggesting DeSantis’s exit should accrue to Trump’s benefit because DeSantis voters are predisposed toward Trump. DeSantis’s endorsement of Trump on Sunday could help push them in that direction.
More practically speaking, DeSantis’s exit means there might not be much to debate come Tuesday night; we’ll have a clear picture of whether there’s any path forward for Haley. If she can’t beat him in a one-on-one race in a state where the electorate should be unusually favorable toward her, it would be pretty clear that it’s not going to happen for her when the race turns to other, less-favorable states."

The attackers later launched mortar rounds at a nearby CIA compound. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the violence, making it the first time since 1979 that a U.S. ambassador was killed in the line of duty. On June 15, 2014, U.S. Special Operations forces captured one of the suspected ringleaders of the attacks.
Here is how the events played out.
Sept. 11, 2012
9:40 p.m.: Unidentified gunmen launch an assault on the U.S. diplomatic compound in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, quickly overwhelming the U.S. and Libyan forces who were providing security. Inside the compound, security forces are separated from U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. U.S. personnel who retreat to another building come under siege for two hours before a CIA security team and some Libyan security forces repel the attackers.
10:30 p.m.: Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith have taken refuge in the main building in the compound, behind a fortified door with metal bars that keeps the attackers from breaking in. But the militants set fire to the building. Within minutes, Stevens and Smith are overwhelmed by smoke.
11 p.m.: A U.S. surveillance drone arrives over Benghazi. Then-Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, meet with President Obama.
1 a.m.: A U.S. rescue team arrives in Benghazi from Tripoli, Libya’s capital. Nearly 30 Americans are rescued from the compound. Shortly thereafter, Stevens is taken to Benghazi Medical Center and pronounced dead on arrival, according to a hospital source. (A Libyan doctor tells the Associated Press that Stevens died of asphyxia, probably caused by smoke inhalation.)
1:45 a.m.: The AP moves a news alert, reporting the death of at least one American in the Benghazi assault.
4 a.m.: Gunmen launch an assault using mortars against the CIA annex. Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods, both former Navy SEALs, are killed. Two other Americans are wounded.
4:08 a.m.: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issues a statement. “I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. . . . The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.”
Sept. 12, 2012
Obama announces that Stevens was among those killed in the Benghazi assault. In his statement, the president says, “I strongly condemn the outrageous attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi.” His statement also says: “While the United States rejects efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others, we must all unequivocally oppose the kind of senseless violence that took the lives of these public servants.”
October 2012
Ahmed Abu Khattala, a “senior leader” of the Benghazi branch of the militant group Ansar al-Sharia, is identified as one of the ringleaders of the attack on the diplomatic mission."
RQ187YN2WQ_1Q269NRSUCHUR4M,Watchdog calls Montgomery schools’ handling of misconduct complaints ‘chaotic’,Nicole Asbury,"January 24, 2024 at 7:23 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/24/montgomery-schools-complaint-handling-inspector-general-report/,"Montgomery County Public Schools officials were warned multiple times since 2019 about problems with how the district investigates employees’ reports of misconduct but did little to fix the problems, according to a new report by the county’s inspector general.
The 17-page report released Wednesday evaluated whether the school system’s Department of Compliance and Investigations had effective procedures in place. It found case files maintained in “chaotic condition,” employees with little guidance on how to investigate complaints, and no system in place to keep track of a complaint’s progress or to monitor trends.
A private law firm warned Maryland’s largest school system of some of these problems in July 2019, according to the inspector general’s report. The school system was warned three more times in later years.
“Unfortunately, it does not appear that any substantive action was taken to address the previously noted findings and recommendations,” the office of Inspector General Megan Davey Limarzi wrote in its report.
Read the inspector general's report
The new report is part of a two-phase investigative inquiry into the school system the county inspector general launched in September after The Washington Post reported about allegations of misconduct by former Montgomery middle school principal Joel Beidleman. The first investigation focused on all allegations about Beidleman sent to the district by July 2023 and any previous allegations that were not investigated. In November, the office said it found evidence that Beidleman violated the system’s sexual harassment and bullying policies.
Many teachers said a principal sexually harassed them. He was promoted.
The second inquiry scrutinized the school system’s handling of misconduct complaints against employees, but it did not delve into specifics of how the school system handled complaints involving Beidleman. A district spokesman said Wednesday that Beidleman no longer works for the school system.
Schools Superintendent Monifa B. McKnight wrote in a letter to the county inspector general that she accepted the office’s findings. She said she would collaborate with the school board to “make the necessary systemic changes.” She wrote that some of the issues that were previously flagged about the compliance unit may not have been addressed because of executive staff turnover.
“I am fully committed to directing staff to act on them,” McKnight wrote.
The county watchdog reviewed investigations and complaints dating from July 2020 to September 2023, then picked a random sample of 10 percent of the case files to closely examine.
The county watchdog wrote that the unit’s files were “a disorderly collection of investigative documents, general information, paperwork recording parts of disciplinary proceedings, and a hodgepodge of communications from MCPS staff.”
Of the 82 files reviewed, 27 were related to actual investigations conducted by staff members — and those files were inconsistent, the report said. Many of the files were missing crucial documentation — including the original complaint, a summary of an investigation and evidence that supported the unit’s conclusions, according to the county watchdog. In one example, five files purportedly showed an employee was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, but there was no proof an investigation actually happened.
The report also found that staff members from the compliance unit “did not always adhere to MCPS regulations related to protecting the confidentiality of complainants.” In one example, a staff member from the unit told a would-be witness that their name would not be kept anonymous. The witness then declined to provide any information.
Montgomery watchdog recommends school system revise policies
While reviewing the unit’s records, the county watchdog also identified inconsistencies in how the school system investigates alleged employee violations of Title IX — a federal law that bars sex discrimination. Such complaints are traditionally filed to the school system’s Title IX coordinator, who is based in a unit that investigates incidents involving students. If a complaint involves an employee, the Title IX coordinator typically would refer it to the Department of Compliance and Investigations. But “DCI staff told us they only conducted investigations involving violations of Title VII and do not conduct any Title IX investigations,” according to the county report.
The county inspector general’s office recommended the school system change its policies to clarify how investigations should be handled, establish a database to keep track of complaints and detect repeat offenders, and revisit previous recommendations made to improve the unit.
While reviewing the school system’s record, investigators said they were “hamstrung by MCPS’s email retention policy,” which automatically deletes emails after a year. McKnight has said the school system is changing the policy to keep emails dating back to three years.
The report was released amid uncertainty about the future of the school system’s leadership. Earlier this week, McKnight released a statement that said the school board wants her to step away from her role as superintendent. In an interview Tuesday alongside her attorney, McKnight said she has not been provided with justification to step down and intends to keep doing her job.
Asked if the forthcoming inspector general report was tied to the school board’s request, McKnight’s attorney Jason Downs said, “We won’t base any of our opinions on speculation.”
Karla Silvestre, the school board president, did not immediately respond to a request to comment Wednesday. On Monday, the board said it was aware of McKnight’s statement to the media but would not comment further because it is a personnel matter.
Some community members hoped the second report would contain more detail into what transpired during Beidleman’s promotional process. County Council members Evan Glass (D-At Large) and Dawn Luedtke (D-District 7) said in a joint statement they still have “unanswered questions … that must be answered to have full accountability and transparency within our school system.”
County Executive Marc Elrich (D) told reporters Wednesday that he found the inspector general’s report “distressing” and also noted that the issue laid out in the document stretched back to the tenure of previous superintendents. “I’ve got questions, and not all of them are answered at this time,” he said.

“Terrorists opened fire on a bus carrying people,” Coptic Christian Archbishop Makarious of Minya, a town roughly 150 miles south of Cairo, said in a phone interview. The pilgrims, said community leaders, were returning from a visit to Saint Samuel the Confessor Monastery in a remote patch of Egypt’s western desert.
Six of those killed were from the same family, according to a post on the Facebook page of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt.
On Friday evening, Egypt’s Islamic State affiliate, which has vowed to target the nation’s minority Coptic Christians, claimed responsibility for the attack through its Amaq news service. It was the first attack claimed by the militant group this year outside northern Sinai, where it is fighting Egyptian security forces. In a statement, the militants claimed that they had killed 13 and wounded 18, and that the attack was in response to the jailing of females they claim to be their supporters by the Egyptian government.
After Egypt church bombings, Israel closes southern border with Sinai
Friday’s violence comes more than a year after a similar assault on Christian pilgrims traveling to the same monastery. In May 2017, gunmen attacked buses carrying worshipers, leaving at least 28 people dead. Since December 2017, the last major assault on Christians, there has been a relative lull in the targeting of the Coptic community. Friday’s attack, many fear, could signal the launch of another deadly campaign by the Islamic State against Christians.
President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi on Friday sought to allay the concerns of a community that has staunchly supported him, even as they have been under attack by Islamist extremists for the past two years. Egyptian officials and analysts view the Islamic State's targeting of Christians as an effort to expand beyond their traditional theater of operations in the northern Sinai and foment religious divisions among Egyptians.
“I mourn with deep sorrow the martyrs who were killed today by treacherous hands which aim to undermine the solid fabric of the nation, and I wish speedy recovery for the injured,” Sissi said in a statement. “I confirm our determination to continue our efforts to combat dark terrorism and apprehend the culprits.”
Campaign against Islamic State in Egypt is creating a humanitarian crisis, rights group says
The death toll Friday could have been much higher. There were several vehicles carrying Christian pilgrims, but the militants targeted two buses, said Bishop Aghathon Tala’at, a Christian community leader. One bus escaped when its driver swerved onto another road. But the second bus, carrying at least 20 passengers, was stopped by the militants, who were in two SUVs, Tala’at said in a phone interview.
“A number of masked men got out of them, took the mobile phones of the passengers and then shot all the men dead,” said Tala’at, who is the bishop of Maghagha, a nearby town with a hospital where many of the wounded were treated. “They were wearing militarylike uniforms, survivors told me.”
Images of the bus distributed on social media showed a bloody scene, including a wounded child. The execution-style killings mirror the attack in May 2017 in which gunmen, also dressed in fatigues, killed some victims with single gunshots to the head.
Since 2016, Islamic State suicide bombers in Egypt have targeted churches in Cairo, Alexandria and Tanta, killing scores. Last month, an Egyptian military court sentenced to death 17 people convicted in those attacks. The defendants were charged with belonging to the Islamic State and orchestrating the assaults on the Christian community, which makes up about 10 percent of the population.
Egypt launches major offensive against Islamic State militants
Attacks by the Islamic State prompted Sissi’s government to launch a major military operation this year in Egypt’s restive northern Sinai province, the stronghold of the militants. A wave of Islamist militancy has pervaded the country since the military overthrow of the elected president, Mohamed Morsi, and the subsequent crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood party’s supporters.
The Islamic State has also targeted Sufi Muslims, which the group considers heretics. In November 2017, militants attacked a Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai, slaughtering more than 300 worshipers. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Egypt’s modern history.
After every assault on the Christian community, Egypt’s security forces bolster security around churches and other holy sites throughout the country. Friday’s violence was an indicator to many that such measures have not worked.
After the attack, Tala’at said, some people angrily took to the streets and blocked a road, demanding better security for their community. The remote area in the western desert, where militant groups have long targeted Egyptian security forces, has poor cellphone reception and unpaved, often unlit roads.
“There has to be a security solution,” Tala’at said. “The road is not paved well, there is not enough lightning, and there is no cell network, either. This is why it is targeted.”

RTC344BN2T_EJ8A0K5V7WTRO33,Should Big Tech get the utility treatment? Courts may soon decide,Cristiano Lima-Strong,"January 25, 2024 at 9:04 a.m. EST",20231226,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/should-big-tech-get-utility-treatment-courts-may-soon-decide/,"Happy Thursday! Shovel shaming is real; holler if you know (and send news tips to): cristiano.lima@washpost.com.Below: Amazon is limiting police access to doorbell footage, and Apple and Spotify plan product changes ahead of new European rules. First:
The long-running debate over whether Silicon Valley giants like Google and Meta should be regulated more like public utilities reignited this week as critics of the tech titans urged the Supreme Court to pick a side in the argument in a blockbuster social media case.
The court this year is slated to decide the fate of laws in Florida and Texas barring platforms from banning politicians or removing users based on their viewpoints, rulings that could have sweeping implications for online speech and tech regulation more broadly.
Both laws describe major social media sites as “common carriers” and impose heightened utility-style restrictions on them, including limits on what content they can remove. The laws, passed by GOP-led legislatures, are intended to tackle allegations of tech “censorship.”
Republicans, including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, have suggested that such a designation could bar companies from engaging in discrimination based on political views.
But in a twist this week, a collection of left-leaning advocates and scholars called on the court to side with the states in their interpretation that social media can be regulated like a common carrier or public utility, such as water and gas.
In an amicus brief to the court, the liberal Open Markets Institute think tank argued that states should be able to exert their “police power to charge internet platforms with common carrier responsibility to operate in the public interest.”
A group of legal scholars and the left-leaning American Economic Liberties Project think tank argued in a separate brief that states should have the power to impose “neutral nondiscrimination laws,” which they called “central to most utility regulation.” The briefs argued that kneecapping states’ authority and granting companies sweeping protections from regulations would hamstring broader efforts to hold them accountable.
Both organizations receive funding from the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic group that eBay founder Pierre Omidyar launched, among other foundations.
The Chamber of Progress, a left-of-center trade group that receives funding from tech companies including Google, Apple and Amazon, blasted the groups’ remarks, arguing that they embraced “radical right” viewpoints that would ultimately open the door to more hate speech and misinformation. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
The dispute has a long history, with critics on both sides of the aisle arguing for years that imposing “common carrier” rules on major tech companies could mitigate an array of harms, including around content moderation and competition.
But with more high-profile cases coming to a head, the courts could soon settle the debate.
It’s unclear to what extent the Supreme Court, which is set to hear oral arguments in the Florida and Texas cases next month, will engage with the “common carrier” debate.
Lower courts previously split on the matter: The 11th Circuit rebutted as “unconvincing” the state of Florida’s assertion that platforms are common carriers, while the 5th Circuit sided with the state of Texas on the matter.
But if the high court sidesteps the issue, another major showdown looms.
While Florida and Texas sought to designate tech companies as common carriers by passing new state laws, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost (R) in 2021 filed a lawsuit seeking to have Google declared a utility in court.
The case is set to go to trial in early September. That could set the table for a more decisive ruling if the Supreme Court does not settle the issue first.
Amazon announced Wednesday that it will no longer allow police departments to request footage from users’ Ring doorbells, “retreating from a practice that was criticized by civil liberties groups and some elected officials,” Bloomberg News’s Matt Day reports.
Until now, law enforcement was able to seek videos from users on a voluntary basis under the company’s Request for Assistance tool, which Amazon is set to disable, according to the report. The shift means police will instead need to seek a warrant or show evidence of an emergency to attain such footage.
The company “didn’t say why Ring was disabling the tool,” according to the report. “Yassi Yarger, a spokesperson, said Ring had decided to devote its resources to new products and experiences in the Neighbors app that better fit with the company’s vision.”
In response to incoming European competition rules, Apple plans to add fees and restrictions when it starts letting users download apps outside of its ecosystem, the Wall Street Journal’s Aaron Tilley, Salvador Rodriguez, Sam Schechner and Kim Mackrael report.
“The new policies, which will apply only in Europe, set up a major test of the legislation and how it will be enforced as Apple faces challenges from courts, regulators and software-makers globally about its tight control of third-party software,” according to the report.
The revelation arrives as major tech companies brace for the European Union’s landmark competition rules, known as the Digital Markets Act, which are poised to take effect in March and will impose heightened restrictions on the largest firms.
“Apple has defended its policy of controlling downloads via the App Store, saying it is necessary for keeping the iPhone safe and relatively free from viruses,” according to the report. “Critics have called Apple’s system anticompetitive, saying it collects unnecessarily high commissions and unfairly competes with Apple’s own apps.” The plans have yet to be publicly announced.
Music streaming platform Spotify plans to unveil a revamped iPhone app in March that “takes advantage of options that weren’t possible before the EU’s Digital Markets Act takes effect,” Axios’s Ashley Gold reports.
“Spotify will soon be able to advertise promotions and enable purchases for products like audiobooks in the app without having to go through Apple, and without paying Apple a 30% commission,” according to the report. “Spotify and other apps like Sonos have been fighting for policies like the DMA for years.”
“With the Digital Markets Act rolling out, your Spotify is about to become a whole lot better, and that means more opportunities for developers and creators everywhere,” the company said in a release.

RTJKWFA2B1_YWA9MQ0IMWWK8WB,Colorado voters press Supreme Court to bar Trump from return to office,Ann E. Marimow,"January 26, 2024 at 12:34 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/trump-colorado-ballot-supreme-court/,"A group of Colorado voters on Friday asked the Supreme Court to bar Donald Trump from the state’s primary ballot, telling the justices in their brief that he is ineligible to return to the White House after spearheading the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
The high court is set to consider on Feb. 8 the unprecedented question of whether a post-Civil War provision of the Constitution disqualifies Trump from holding office. The case will shape the course of the 2024 presidential election, in which Trump is on track to secure the Republican nomination for the third consecutive cycle.
The justices are reviewing a Colorado Supreme Court decision finding that Trump engaged in insurrection and is disqualified from the primary ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which initially was adopted to prevent Confederate leaders from returning to the halls of power.
Whatever the court decides is likely to settle the issue in other states, where similar efforts are underway to remove Trump’s name from election ballots. Maine’s secretary of state reached the same conclusion as Colorado’s high court. But the decisions in both states were put on hold while litigation continues, so for now Trump’s name is slated to appear on the ballots for the March 5 primaries in those states.
With primary voting already underway, the justices fast-tracked the case for oral argument next month. Trump easily defeated Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire GOP primary this week after a decisive win in Iowa’s caucuses.
It is unclear whether Trump will attend the argument at the high court, but he has already tried to leverage his legal battles for political gain by making court appearances in his criminal and civil cases in Washington and New York in recent weeks.
The provision at issue before the Supreme Court bars former government officials, who pledged to support the Constitution, from returning to office if they have engaged in insurrection. Until the 2021 attack on the Capitol, the prohibition had been largely dormant for 150 years.
The Colorado voters say that the Constitution is clear and that Trump cannot return to office after summoning and encouraging an angry crowd of his supporters to prevent the peaceful transfer of power and the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election.
“Section 3 does not give a free pass to insurrectionist Presidents,” according to the brief from four Republican and two unaffiliated voters behind the lawsuit, represented by a Colorado-based legal team working with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Nobody, not even a former President, is above the law.”
Trump’s position, they said, is less legal than political in that he “not-so-subtly threatens ‘bedlam’ if he is not on the ballot,” in his own filing with the court last week.
“We already saw the ‘bedlam’ Trump unleashed when he was on the ballot and lost. Section 3 is designed precisely to avoid giving oath-breaking insurrectionists like Trump the power to unleash such mayhem again,” the voters’ attorneys told the court.
The voters used their brief in part to remind the justices of the timeline before and during the attack. Photos embedded in the filing show the mob amassing outside the Capitol, a police officer being crushed in a metal door frame and several of Trump’s tweets, including his call to supporters to “be there, will be wild.”
The justices are being asked to decide the central issue of whether Trump engaged in insurrection, but the high court could choose a narrower path to resolve the case.
In their opening brief, Trump’s attorneys said the former president called for “peaceful and patriotic protest” on Jan. 6, and they gave the justices several options for keeping him on the ballot without reaching the question of whether he participated in an insurrection.
They argued that Section 3 does not apply to the presidency because the president is not an officer of the United States, that Trump did not take the type of oath required for the provision to disqualify him, and that only Congress — not the courts — can enforce Section 3.
In response, the voters’ attorneys wrote that the plain meaning of “officer of the United States” in the provision is anyone who holds federal “office” — including the president. It makes no sense, they said, to read the provision as “disqualifying all oath-breaking insurrectionists except the one holding the highest office in the land.”
States traditionally have broad power to run presidential elections, and the Colorado voters noted the high court’s rulings upholding the authority of states to set ballot access rules. Allowing state officials to disqualify candidates without a separate act of Congress, they wrote, is consistent with past court decisions. States, for instance, disqualify candidates who do not meet the minimum age or citizenship requirements.
Trump’s lawyers also argued that the provision bars insurrections from holding, not running for, office.
But the voters told the court that putting off a decision about Trump’s eligibility until after the election would be a recipe for “mass disenfranchisement, constitutional crisis, and the very ‘bedlam’ Trump threatens.”"
RZ3G6YZTFD_8JF76OKFNLHWWC0,"What’s BDS, the movement to boycott Israel with a new social media following?",Frances Vinall,"January 23, 2024 at 10:26 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/bds-movement-israel-boycott-brands/,"Opponents of Israel’s punishing war in the Gaza Strip have called for boycotts of companies they claim support Israeli policies, and have drawn millions of views on social media.
Customers, particularly in the Middle East, have refrained from patronizing companies like Starbucks and McDonald’s. The coffee giant has said in response to criticism that it is against all violence, while the fast-food chain has said it doesn’t support either side in the conflict.
The calls have dovetailed with an almost two-decade-old movement — called BDS for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions — that protests Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories by targeting businesses and institutions accused of aiding violations of Palestinian rights.
Over 18 years, BDS has pressured some companies to end investment in Israel, and others to pull operations out of the occupied West Bank. But the BDS movement’s overall effect on Israel’s economy is hard to conclusively measure and could be minimal, analysts say.
BDS is an organization run by a committee and has specific targets and strategies. It includes a coalition of Palestinian organizations, but is decentralized by design, endorsing a system in which activists decide what to target and how, if they agree with BDS’s principles.
It has found an influx of new adherents. By two months after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the beginning of the war, the hashtag #boycottisrael had about 340 million views on TikTok, and #BDS at least 3 billion, although the latter captures some posts on other topics. By January, there were almost half a million posts hashtagged #boycottisrael and 887,000 hashtagged #BDS on Instagram.
Some users, but not all, name-check BDS and direct followers to its website, despite largely not coordinating with its leadership. The BDS official account shared a post on Instagram last year voicing support of recent “grassroots” social media campaigns and endorsing new boycotting targets that had emerged organically.
“All peaceful popular efforts, including boycott and divestment … are justified and called for,” it said on Instagram in November, while simultaneously calling for a more targeted approach than it had sometimes seen on social media since Oct. 7.
Here’s what to know about the campaigns to boycott Israel:
TikTok was slammed for its pro-Palestinian hashtags. But it’s not alone.
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

Marimow,"January 22, 2024 at 12:03 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/richard-glossip-execution-supreme-court-oklahoma/,"The Supreme Court said Monday it will review the long-running appeal of Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma death row inmate whose execution the justices stopped last year.
The court delayed Glossip’s execution after the state’s Republican attorney general told the justices that prosecutorial misconduct in the case would make putting the inmate to death “unthinkable.”
Glossip’s case, which will probably be heard next term, has drawn national and international attention because of the bipartisan intervention on his behalf. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner F. Drummond said independent investigations reviewing the case cast serious doubt on whether Glossip received a fair trial on a 1997 murder charge.
The reports said prosecutors deprived Glossip’s lawyers of key information about a crucial witness and failed to correct false testimony in the case. Glossip, now 60, was first convicted of the murder in July 1998.
In its brief order Monday, the Supreme Court said it would consider whether Glossip’s death penalty conviction should be reversed because of the state’s admitted errors.
Glossip was convicted of murdering his boss, Barry Van Treese, in a room of the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City, which Van Treese owned and Glossip managed. It is undisputed that Glossip did not swing the bat that bludgeoned Van Treese. That was a drug-addled handyman named Justin Sneed.
After Sneed’s arrest, he said he carried out the assault at the direction of Glossip, who Sneed said promised to pay him $10,000 for the murder. Sneed pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison as part of a negotiated deal.
Glossip’s attorneys said Monday that their client’s conviction must be reversed in part because the state did not disclose crucial evidence about Sneed’s psychiatric condition.
“Mr. Glossip has faced execution nine times, even though the State knew full well that the evidence used to convict him and sentence him to death was false,” his lawyer John Mills said in a statement Monday. “The State now agrees this failure, and the cumulative effect of other errors in the case, require a new trial for Mr. Glossip.”
Drummond, Oklahoma’s attorney general, said in a separate statement that “public confidence in the death penalty requires the highest standard of reliability, so it is appropriate that the U.S. Supreme Court will review this case.”
Glossip has been on death row for more than 25 years and has maintained his innocence. In 2015, he was hours from being executed when prison officials discovered they had received the wrong lethal drug, a mistake that led in part to a seven-year moratorium on executions in the state. The justices ruled 5-4 against Glossip that year in a challenge to the state’s method of execution.
He was again set to be executed last spring when the Supreme Court intervened.
Drummond then asked an Oklahoma appeals court to vacate Glossip’s conviction and said he is entitled to a new trial. The appeals court rejected the state’s request and said Glossip’s execution should go forward.
“That decision cannot be the final word in this case,” Drummond told the justices. “The injustice of allowing a capital sentence to be carried out where the conviction was occasioned by the government’s own admitted failings would be nigh unfathomable.”
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch will not participate in the case, the court’s order said Monday, probably because of his involvement in an earlier proceeding related to Glossip when he was an appeals court judge."
S3P9L19YNJ_7ZW61FJB8VQW2TW,Top N.H. election official prepares for the primary. And its aftermath.,Rhonda Colvin,"January 23, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-primary-trump-biden/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan is confronting a campaign in 2024 like no other. He’s already handled some thorny issues his predecessors never had to.
Within the past year, Scanlan, a Republican appointed by his state’s legislature, has had to make a call on whether to keep former president Trump on the state’s ballot after lawsuits based on the 14th Amendment were filed in New Hampshire and other states. On the other side, Scanlan defied the Democratic National Committee’s decision to make South Carolina the first official primary state. New Hampshire will go ahead Tuesday and hold a primary anyway, though President Biden can only win as an unofficial write-in candidate.
The Democratic Party is running on democracy. Long-shot candidates cry hypocrisy.
There’s also a bigger spotlight this year on the high number of New Hampshire’s unaffiliated voters, who may choose to vote in the Republican primary and help determine its winner.
The Washington Post talked to Scanlan about 2024 and its demands, as well as why he thinks New Hampshire should remain the first presidential primary in the nation. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Question: Undeclared voters make up a sizable part of New Hampshire’s electorate, and that’s been long-standing. Are you prepared or thinking about challenges to the results if whoever comes in second is unhappy with the results?
Answer: There may be challenges depending on the outcome, we’re prepared to address those. If a candidate has questions about the validity of the vote, especially if it’s close, any candidate that receives more than 9% of the vote can request a recount.
New Hampshire's process of allowing undeclared voters has been in place for decades. It is nothing new. I think it's important to have undeclared voters as a part of the presidential primary process because it is designed to select a nominee that is acceptable to the party, but also gives an indication of the success a person might have for running in a general election in New Hampshire.
Q: Former President Trump and other Republicans sent you a letter asking you to keep him on the ballot. Could you tell us why you decided to keep [Trump] on the ballot after calls to remove him?
A: I conferred with the attorney general of New Hampshire on this topic, and after reading New Hampshire law and looking at the United States Constitution, we decided that in New Hampshire, the requirement to run for president of the United States is the requirements that are in Article Two, Section One of the United States Constitution, which says that a candidate must be 35 years old. They must be a natural born United States citizen, and they must have lived in the country for 14 years. And that’s it.
When it comes to the 14th Amendment, it’s a little bit more abstract than the qualifications in Article Two, in that it says that if an individual has participated in an insurrection, they cannot hold an office. I believe that there needs to be due process as part of that discussion. And the determination should not be placed on one individual to make that decision. To have a system play out where a candidate is not allowed in some states to be on the ballot but is in others, it’s going to create chaos. It’s going to create anger among our voting population.
Q: Do you wish the U.S. Supreme Court would have weighed in on this before you had to make the decision on your own?
A: Well, that certainly would have been helpful. I made a decision to leave President Trump on the ballot. Somebody could have challenged that decision in court. In fact, they have, although it has not advanced beyond the New Hampshire courts. It is a clumsy process to have this play out in the nomination process and not in a more uniform, substantial way.
Q: You decided to go against the Democratic National Committee’s vote to have its first primary in South Carolina. Why did you do that, and also, do you think that it risks confusing Democratic voters when they ask for a Democratic ballot and the incumbent president isn’t on there?
A: I think the New Hampshire voters know what’s going on. With that debate with the Democratic National Committee, what the rest of the country has to understand is that New Hampshire has held the first-in-the-nation primary since 1920. But the real reason why New Hampshire is important — and this is what everybody misses — we are a small state geographically and population wise, and it is very easy to get on the ballot in New Hampshire. It doesn’t matter where they live or what their background is, they can come here and get their name on the ballot.
It’s important that a place like that exist and happen early in the process, because if by chance, they can do well here, if they can connect with the voters and they can jump-start a campaign, they can have it play out in the remaining states in the country.

SDLF2HK3MG_VWWUC0R73BVBJEK,Execution of Saudi prince brings praise for the monarchy,Heba Farouk Mahfouz,"October 22, 2016 at 8:35 a.m. EDT",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/22/execution-of-saudi-prince-brings-praise-for-the-monarchy/,"CAIRO – Saudi Arabia’s rulers are not as popular as they used to be in the kingdom. With low global oil prices, officials have been forced to cut spending dramatically in a nation where most people depend on the government for salaries, education and other forms of welfare.
But the rare execution of a Saudi royal last week appears to have helped resurrect the monarchy’s popularity – at least according to the reaction on social media.
Prince Turki bin Saud al-Kabir, who was found guilty of shooting to death a Saudi citizen during a brawl, was executed last Tuesday as per a royal order by King Salman. He became the first member of Saudi royalty to be executed in the kingdom since 1975.
The Execution Of Saudi Prince Proves That Nobody Is Above The Law in their Kingdom https://t.co/63TXdxklox
That drove Saudis to launch a hashtag in Arabic on Twitter that roughly translates to ""decisive Salman orders retribution for a prince,"" a reference to Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. For days now, the hashtag has been trending in Saudi Arabia, with tweets sent by citizens, officials and royal family members praising the king for his ""integrity.""
One video shows King Salman telling officials that ""any citizen can sue the royal family and seek justice."" The video has gone viral in the kingdom.
Some on social media described the execution as ""evidence of the justice which sharia law affirms,"" referring to the conservative Islamic codes that govern Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations. Others said the ruling demonstrated ""the king's integrity in treating all citizens equally"" and that ""nobody is above the law.""
#Video #message of Saudi King goes viral after #prince’s #execution https://t.co/VGpna3nxUA #global #salman
Saudi courts have brought other royal family members, estimated to number a few thousand, to justice. In 1975, a prince who assassinated his uncle, King Faisal, was beheaded. Two years later, a princess was executed for adultery.
But other royals were pardoned at the last minute by victims' families. This time, though, the victim's family turned down an offer of ""blood money,"" reportedly in the millions of dollars to pardon the prince. Then, both the kingdom’s appeals court and the Supreme Court affirmed the death penalty.
At a time when the monarch is implementing unprecedented austerity measures, even royal families welcomed the execution as decisive and fair.
Saudi Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud: The execution of my cousin shows no one is above the law https://t.co/ORo4xA95uu via @NewsweekEurope
""This is the law of God Almighty, and this is the approach of our blessed nation,” wrote Khalid al-Saud, a royal family member, according to Reuters.
Another Saudi royal member, billionaire businessman Al Walid Bin Talal, recited a Koranic verse: ""there is life for you in retaliation.”
Details of the prince’s last hours were revealed on social media, another rare development for the conservative, often secretive kingdom.
Mohammed al-Masloukhi, the Imam of Al Safa mosque, who was present while the victim's family was being offered the ""blood money,"" described the prince's ""heartbreaking last moments with his family members"" who visited him for one last time in prison.
Al-Masloukhi said the convicted prince then prayed, reciting Koranic verses until sunrise. He was executed four and a half hours later.
The execution, tweeted al-Masloukhi, was carried out in presence of the prince's father, who ""broke down in tears"" while the victim's father watched with ""a fixed expression on his face.""

SK47V3WMVZ_K4JK8H40DOX1I91,"Dawoud Bey turns to landscape, well trodden and haunted",Philip Kennicott,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/01/24/dawoud-bey-photography-exhibit-virginia/,"RICHMOND — The horizon is a rare event in the landscape photographs of Dawoud Bey, one of this country’s preeminent photographers, whose previous work has been mainly focused on portraiture.
You can see a bit of the line where earth meets sky in the background of “Conjoined Trees and Field” from “In This Here Place,” a series that documents the landscape of slave plantations along the lower Mississippi River. Perhaps there’s a suggestion of horizon at the far end of a gash of illuminated water in another image, “Irrigation Ditch,” from the same series, which looks like a wound or fissure in the land, and may reference a 1951 Robert Frank photograph called “Street Line/New York.”
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
Not until a photograph called “Untitled #25 (Lake Erie and Sky),” perhaps inspired by the poetic seascape photographs that Hiroshi Sugimoto has been making for decades, do you see the horizon in its full, linear expanse, a just barely perceptible line separating fields of gray sky from churning water. That image is the last in a 2017 series called “Night Coming Tenderly, Black,” which documents sites along the Underground Railroad, ending with a view of Lake Erie, where enslaved people embarked for Canada and freedom.
Both series, and a new one called “Stony the Road,” are on view in an engrossing exhibition titled “Dawoud Bey: Elegy” at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
Bey works in black and white, making richly textured silver gelatin prints. The luminosity and depth of these images are increasingly a rarity in photography, now dominated by the flat, brilliant precision of digital printing. The traces of light captured in silver gelatin prints seem to hover in planes just below the surface of the paper, and Bey is a masterful printer, such that his photographs often feel three-dimensional, as if the leaves of a tree in the foreground are literally closer to the surface of the photograph than the dark of the forest behind them.
Bey, who is African American, also makes large prints, mimicking the heroic scale of America’s great, romantic landscape photographers, but the impression his images leave is very different. Bey’s camera never commands or dominates the landscape, never incorporates its breadth or depth. It doesn’t surveil, scan or survey, and though he often focuses on the ground — earth carpeted with leaves and pathways through dark places — you never feel as if the images are made from on high.
When the Roman empire was African
Rather, he looks into and through the landscape, as ordinary people do when they walk amid it. He captures details, sometimes nervously, as one might when exploring an unknown trail or taking a new way home at nightfall. Vines cross your path, a leaf dances in a pinprick of sun, a patch of turbid water like polished gunmetal promises a clearing in the distance. This leaves the impression that you are seeing the world not as the camera sees it, but through the eyes of someone standing exactly where the camera stands. Nature is processed not with a lens, shutter, paper and chemicals, but through the alchemy of another person’s psyche. It is haunted.
“All of this work is made intentionally from a vantage point that relates to the close and intimate encounter of that space for those enslaved Africans who were moving through those spaces,” says Bey in a catalogue interview.
The Southern landscape as haunted is territory rich with possibilities. Sally Mann has made spectral trees and forests befogged with darkness into metaphors for the unresolved traumas of history. The mug shot muteness and formality of Bey’s portraits of slave cabins from “In This Here Place” recall the images of vernacular structures photographed by William Christenberry. The decision to document sites along the Underground Railroad at night for the 2017 series “Night Coming Tenderly, Black” echoes the work of Jeanine Michna-Bales, who has been making nocturnal images of these places for more than a decade for her thoroughly researched “Through Darkness to Light” project.
Bey’s work is distinguished not so much by its conceptual novelty as by its perfection of finish, its reticence and its invitation to spiritual work on the part of the viewer. The printing is extraordinary, especially the limits-of-perception clarity of the images made at night, in which Bey is explicitly wrestling with the virtuoso precedent of Roy DeCarava when it comes to printing dark tones.
This level of finesse seals the world in photographs of curious silence. If you were to approach these images without knowledge of what they represent, they could be anything. The slave cabins might well be any worker’s home, humble, shabby, solid, even inviting if you imagine the smells and sounds of domestic life within. Any photograph divorced of its caption, its provenance or metadata, exists in a realm of extended possibility. We can imprint almost any meaning we wish.
The Met reopens its European galleries, refreshed
Bey’s work, which focuses on places where African Americans experienced the worst traumas of slavery, is particularly disciplined in its refusal to be explicit. The exhibition catalogue quotes historian Robin D.G. Kelley about art and messaging: “The most radical art is not protest art but works that take us to another place, envision a different way of seeing, perhaps a different way of feeling.”
Bey’s work envisions, through the literal darkness of night and the metaphorical darkness of lost time and people, new ways of seeing. By scrubbing out the telltale signs of the modern world and framing this work as images of the world as seen by enslaved people, Bey creates a spiritual invitation. This is what the ancestors saw, and if we can see the world through their eyes, perhaps we can feel the world they felt.
Taking up that invitation, of course, requires one to believe, or pretend to believe, that we can find connection with people who are long dead. Even if you don’t believe that is possible, the work still stands as a determined effort to elicit an active empathy.
Indeed, the world Bey depicts is even more bleak if you don’t believe there’s any hope of communing with the people who walked these paths. When we look on these places of pain, we see a landscape that can never be redeemed. Yes, it witnessed trauma, but that trauma can never be healed because those who felt it are simply dust among the leaves and humus in the soil. No matter how unflinchingly we stare at the sorrow of human existence, the ancestors are simply gone, and nature is always indifferent. We haunt the land, not the other way around.

SOI36BXMDL_SXP4TAUUFLTZD50,"Federal officials consider adding 10 more species, including a big bumble bee, to endangered list",_,"January 24, 2024 at 2:57 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/01/24/endangered-species-petitions-additions-us-fish-wildlife-service/7ec2563a-baf1-11ee-b176-fe5fd794e716_story.html,"MADISON, Wis. — Federal wildlife officials announced Wednesday they will consider adding 10 new species to the Endangered Species Act, including a big bumble bee that serves as a key pollinator across the United States.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said they had completed 90-day reviews of petitions to add the species to the list and determined that listing may be warranted. The finding triggers reviews of the species’ status.
One of the more prominent species up for consideration is the Southern Plains bumble bee, a large black-and-yellow bumble bee that inhabits open prairies, meadows and grasslands in the Midwest, the mid-Atlantic states and the Plains states from Texas to North Dakota. It’s also found in the grasslands and savannas in the southeastern U.S., including Florida. Queens can grow as large as an inch (26 mm); workers can grow to as large as three-quarters of an inch (18 mm).
The Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2022 to include the bee on the Endangered Species List. According to the center, habitat loss and degradation as well as pesticides have led to sharp population declines in the southern Plains states, including Texas and Oklahoma as well as in Alabama and Mississippi.
The other species under review include the betta hendra and the betta rutilans, freshwater fish found in Borneo; the Hickory Nut Gorge salamander, an amphibian found in western North Carolina; the pygmy rabbit, a small rabbit found in mountainous areas of the western U.S.; and the Railroad Valley toad, a small toad that lives only in the wetlands of the Lockes Wildlife Management Area in Nye County, Nevada.
Also up for review are the Southwest spring firefly, an invertebrate native to Arizona that faces habitat loss due to alteration or loss of ground and surface water flows, livestock grazing and mining; the white-margined penstemon, a rare perennial plant found only in the Mojave Desert; and the yellow-spotted woodland salamander, which lives on the Appalachian plateau in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials decided not to review the status of the Eastern hellbender, an aquatic salamander that lives in streams across 15 states. The agency included Eastern hellbenders who live in Missouri on the Endangered Species List in 2021.
More than 1,300 species are listed as either endangered or threatened in the U.S. under the Endangered Species Act. Listing protects organisms from being harmed, killed, imported or exported. Listing also mandates development and implementation of population recovery plans."
SR20NXT0FY_SXOERSLNE4M29PW,The biggest questions about the election now,Amber Phillips,"January 24, 2024 at 5:21 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/biggest-questions-about-election-now/,"This might be the least-exciting presidential primary season in recent history. Donald Trump is on track to lock up the Republican nomination after just two states.
But the general presidential election has the potential to be insane: Trump could be on trial for — and potentially convicted of — trying to overturn the 2020 election, or for hiding classified information from the government. He and President Biden are the two oldest presidents in modern memory. And the Supreme Court could blow up everything with several major decisions about the election.
Here are some immediate questions about the 2024 race.
The pressure is building for her to drop out. Still, Trump’s former U.N. ambassador argues that there are still dozens of states left to vote, and that Haley got 43 percent of the vote in New Hampshire — a not-insignificant number. (But it was still about 11 percentage points behind Trump, when her supporters were hoping for a margin of five or less.)
The next few primaries will be decisive. Nevada votes in a couple weeks, but everyone is watching South Carolina at the end of February. Haley served as the governor of the state, and it’s one she probably needs to win (or almost win) to continue. Then in early March, more than a dozen states vote on one day known as Super Tuesday. Trump could have the nomination nearly locked up after that.
“She can hang around until Super Tuesday,” one Republican strategist said of Haley. “After that, she’s done.”
But Haley might want to stay in the race, on the off-chance that this unpredictable campaign suddenly doesn’t have a nominee. Because it’s possible.
An election-related conviction could be the one thing that pushes Trump-leaning voters away from him, some polls suggest. Or not. Even if he’s convicted during the campaign, Trump could run for president; there’s nothing in the U.S. Constitution preventing this.
We also don’t know when any of his trials will take place. Trump’s legal team has been adept at delaying them. One of the more consequential trials, over his efforts to stay in power after losing in 2020, was scheduled for March. But it’s on hold as the Supreme Court considers Trump’s side argument that he should be immune from prosecution for actions he took as president.
That will be answered by answering another question: Did his role in encouraging the attack on the Capitol make him an insurrectionist? The Colorado Supreme Court said yes, ruling that under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, he therefore can’t be on the ballot. The U.S. Supreme Court will have the last word. It hears arguments in early February on this. It would be a pretty big surprise if the justices kicked Trump off the ballot entirely. But it’s a possibility. Or maybe they rule in an inconclusive way that leaves it up to state election officials to decide.
This is, like, the third presidential election in a row where voters seem dejected by their choices. That could shape the race in a number of ways: People might skip voting, which could make it an extremely close race, says Doug Heye, a Republican strategist. “Do voters sit out in higher numbers, to where an extra two percentage points in Arizona becomes very significant?” he said.
It also makes third-party candidates more appealing, and thus more likely that one could be a spoiler by stealing votes from Biden or Trump. (More likely Biden.)
And about their ages? Biden is 81, the oldest president ever. Trump is 77, which would make him the second-oldest president ever. Every strategist I’ve talked to is on high alert for either candidate to give a speech that doesn’t make sense, or take a high-profile stumble, in a way that causes a massive voter shift."

T291IEY7Y3_A27CVDBQK6N37GK,Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months for contempt of Congress in Jan. 6 probe,Spencer S. Hsu,"January 25, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/25/peter-navarro-sentence-contempt/,"Peter Navarro, a White House aide to then-President Donald Trump who claimed credit for devising a plan to overturn the 2020 election, was sentenced to four months in prison Thursday morning for ignoring a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.
“Dr. Navarro, you are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution,” U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta said. While Navarro received all due process that he and all Americans are entitled to, Mehta continued, “Regrettably, when you were called up to go to testify, you didn’t show a coequal branch of government [Congress] the same degree of respect.”
Navarro became the second senior Trump aide sentenced for stonewalling Congress’s Jan. 6 investigation, joining Stephen K. Bannon, a former Trump political adviser with whom Navarro said he worked on a plan to delay and ultimately change the outcome of Congress’s formal count of the 2020 presidential election results.
Like Navarro, Bannon was sentenced to four months behind bars, and both men have appealed their convictions. Navarro asked the court to put his sentence on hold pending appeal as Bannon’s judge did, which Mehta is considering. Either man could become the first person incarcerated for defying a congressional subpoena in more than half a century, under a rarely prosecuted offense punishable by up to a year in prison.
Navarro was also ordered to pay a $9,500 fine.

Navarro, 74, was found guilty in September of two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to produce documents or testify after receiving a House subpoena in February 2022. Lawmakers had asked Navarro, a former trade and pandemic adviser who served throughout Trump’s term in office, about his claim of working with Bannon on an operation called “the Green Bay Sweep.” The plan aimed to get Trump loyalists in Congress to contest ballots from six swing states that Biden won and throw the election to the House, though claims of voter fraud were repudiated by state officials and the courts.
Prosecutors accused Navarro of pursuing a bad-faith strategy of “utter contempt” and “utter disregard” for Congress, putting allegiance to Trump and partisan politics over country in refusing to cooperate with House investigators probing the Jan. 6 attack that came after Trump urged his supporters to march to the Capitol. Five people died in or shortly after the rioting, which led to assaults on least 140 police officers, caused $3 million in damage and forced the evacuation of lawmakers.
“The committee was investigating an attack on the very foundations of our democracy,” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb Jr. told the judge, urging him to make clear that “no one is above” the rule of law that is essential to a functioning democracy and to sentence Navarro to six months in prison. “It is imperative for the court to make it clear that people cannot defy Congress and ignore their legal obligations.”
Navarro’s attorneys asked for probation, saying the judge at one point seemed to acknowledge that Navarro genuinely thought Trump had invoked executive privilege, a provision under the Constitution’s separation-of-powers principle to preserve the confidentiality of White House discussions from Congress.
Mehta ultimately rejected Navarro’s claim, finding after an evidentiary hearing that whatever Navarro thought, he failed to prove the existence of a conversation or a formal invocation of privilege by Trump that directed Navarro not to cooperate with lawmakers.
“I did not know what to do” when subpoenaed by Congress, Navarro told Mehta in a brief statement after his defense initially said he would not speak on advice of counsel.
“Is that the entire lesson from this process? … Get a lawyer? I think in a way it is,” Navarro said, in between making public appeals outside the courthouse for funds to help pay what he said were already nearly $1 million in legal bills. “Nobody in my position should be put in conflict between the legislative branch and the executive branch.”
Defense attorneys Stanley E. Woodward Jr., John P. Rowley III and John S. Irving argued that the case raised a serious and novel question about whether Navarro properly invoked executive privilege, with Woodward calling Thursday’s sentencing a “pit stop” on the way to higher court review.
“Dr. Navarro’s trial and conviction involves a series of firsts: the first time an incumbent President waived the executive privilege of a former president; the first time a senior presidential adviser was charged with contempt of Congress by the Justice Department, let alone the Justice Department of a political rival,” his attorneys wrote to the court.
Before charging Navarro, a Harvard-trained economist and author of several books on U.S.-China trade policies, the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington opted not to take legal action against two other Trump officials who were referred by the House Jan. 6 committee for contempt prosecutions: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and communications chief Dan Scavino. Both had received letters from a lawyer for the former president directing them not to respond to subpoenas from the committee, citing executive privilege.
Had Trump issued a similar letter to Navarro, “the record here would look very different,” Mehta said earlier. The judge noted that the Biden administration also had made clear it was not asserting the privilege in his case, saying it was not in the national interest.
Mehta called Navarro’s protestation of ignorance hard to believe, because two months before he got his subpoena, Bannon was charged with snubbing the House without a letter from Trump. Navarro’s attorneys also knew from experience with past clients that the words “executive privilege” are not “magical incantations” or “a get-out-of-jail-free card,” but require working with Congress question-by-question to resolve, the judge said.
“It’s not just [writing] ’executive privilege’ by email, ‘Go away,’ ” Mehta said.
Prosecutors argued that Navarro, acting without an attorney, rebuffed the committee’s request and erroneously relied on a news statement issued by then-President Donald Trump in November 2020 that said Navarro did not have to cooperate with a different committee investigating the pandemic response.

The final hearing: The House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol held its final public meeting where members referred four criminal charges against former president Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department. Here’s what the criminal referrals mean.
The riot: On Jan. 6, 2021, a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. Five people died on that day or in the immediate aftermath, and 140 police officers were assaulted.
Inside the siege: During the rampage, rioters came perilously close to penetrating the inner sanctums of the building while lawmakers were still there, including former vice president Mike Pence. The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and videos to create a video timeline of what happened on Jan. 6. Here’s what we know about what Trump did on Jan. 6."
T2JMF827ZC_0IPQMUCHRQ0QTDA,D.C.’s Metro is a slippery mess. Blame the wild weather.,Danny Nguyen,"January 26, 2024 at 5:21 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/26/dc-metro-stations-slippery-weather/,"One Metro rider said they slipped and broke their wrist on the floor of a Metro station. Another said she slipped as she walked up a station escalator.
It’s not a coincidence.
The abrupt change in the weather that transported D.C. from snowy winter to humid summer in a matter of days, combined with the melting snow and salt residue from the street, have made the tiled floors in Metro stations particularly slippery, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which oversees Metro. From Saturday to Friday, the temperature climbed by more than 50 degrees.
Reports of widespread slipping over the past couple of days follow a week that began with 3 to 5 inches of snow on the ground and ended with 80-degree weather, the highest temperature observed in January in D.C. since record keeping began in 1872. It typically doesn’t get this hot until late March.
Washington soars to 80 degrees, setting January temperature record
When Susan Burke, who has lived in D.C. for three years, slipped at the Federal Triangle station on her way to work Wednesday, she thought there was something wrong with her new shoes. She had to make “a very concerted effort to even move forward because it was so slippery,” she said.
But it couldn’t have been her shoes that made her slip, she thought; she had owned the same kind before. “Maybe I need to scuff them up outside first,” she pondered.
“And then I was inside work, and I wasn’t slipping anymore,” Burke said, deciding it had something to do with the Metro station. Her suspicions were largely confirmed when she saw online discussions of locals lamenting the same issue.
“This is an extremely unusual occurrence,” said Sherri Ly, a WMATA spokeswoman, in an email. While the region has faced heavy rain and snow many times before, the extreme swing in the weather has made conditions far worse, she said.
But this isn’t the first time transit riders have complained about slippery tiles. A rider sued WMATA after she slipped and fell on the floor tiles of the Archives Metro station in 2011. The case was settled out of court. Several months before that, Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille (D) slipped on a wet platform at the Braddock Road Metro station.
Metro began installing new subway tiles with small grooves in 2019 to capture water and make the surface less slippery in snow and rain.
Finally, some good up-close looks at Metro's new floor tile from its Instagramhttps://t.co/K20rNrfzWN pic.twitter.com/XeVXFpTDnT
“Our teams are monitoring conditions throughout the system, and staff are working to power wash, clean and dry floors,” Ly said. “We have also posted wet floor signs and are advising customers through social media, vehicle and station public address announcements to continue to use caution when entering, exiting or traversing through our stations and facilities.”
“Maybe,” Burke said, “they could put down a rug for people to wipe their feet.”"
TCZPFKNUL5_IVLMGT8LUQWBQE4,NYPD investigates alleged chemical attack on pro-Palestinian protesters,Ben Brasch,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/24/columbia-palestinian-gaza-israel-campus/,"Soph Askanase remembers the smell — “a mix of sewage, rot and dead animal” — coming on suddenly.
The stench hit the Columbia University student during a pro-Palestinian rally on campus Friday. About 300 people had gathered on the steps of the Low Library, protesting Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza.
“I could hear protesters asking each other if they could smell it, too,” said Askanase, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace and Columbia University Apartheid Divest. “I really thought it was leaked sewage or something dead near us.”
Hours later, the scent had not lifted — and some of the protesters had begun to suffer nausea, burning eyes and stomach pain. Several were hospitalized, according to organizers.
Now, university and New York law enforcement officials are investigating reports that those at the demonstration were sprayed with a chemical substance in what the university’s interim provost, Dennis A. Mitchell, said Monday could be “serious crimes, possibly hate crimes.” He added that the school had banned “the alleged perpetrators,” whom he did not identify, from campus as the investigation continues.
“We condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community,” Mitchell wrote in a statement.
No arrests had been made as of Tuesday, New York Police Department Detective Annette Shelton said.
Israeli hostage families have ‘nothing left to lose’ in push for new deal
The incident comes as tensions remain high over the Israeli bombardment of Gaza that the enclave’s Health Ministry says has killed more than 25,000, launched after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that Israel estimates killed about 1,200. Since the first days of the war, American college campuses have been inflamed by tensions over the situation in the Middle East. Protests have been held in support of both Israel and Palestinians, and donors and politicians have paid close attention to the stances taken by university officials.
At Columbia on Friday, hundreds of students gathered around 1 p.m. to encourage the school to divest from Israel and speak out against the killings of Palestinians. Cameron Jones, a lead organizer for Jewish Voice for Peace who helped put together the event, said the first 30 minutes were ordinary.
It was at 1:45 p.m. that he said he smelled something “like human poop mixed with decaying animals.” He pointed it out to a friend, who acknowledged the smell, but both were so focused on the rally that they initially didn’t think much of it.
The first report came in to police at 1:50 p.m., with a caller saying that “an unknown substance was sprayed into the air,” New York Police Department spokeswoman Thiffany Monderson said Tuesday.
Police received one report of someone experiencing irritated eyes and nausea, but five more with similar reports have come forward since the incident, Shelton said. Jones, the protest organizer, said that in addition to the eight people hospitalized, others visited urgent care.
Officials declined to comment on possible motives or elaborate beyond the statement shared Monday.
One student told The Washington Post she reported to police that she was harassed by two men at the protest.
Lea, a sophomore who spoke on the condition that her last name be withheld because of safety concerns, said she was standing with a sign that read “CU Jews for Ceasefire” when the men approached her and began questioning her Judaism.
The student, who grew up an Orthodox Jew, said she started talking to the men in Hebrew: “They told me, ‘What happened to you? Who spoiled you? Who ruined you?’”
In the days that followed the protest, attendees puzzled over what had caused the smell — and why some of them felt sick. In a group message between protesters, one wrote: “i’m alone now and can still smell it on me [let me know] if same happened for u guys,” one texted.
People offered all sorts of rationalizations: Some thought it was a stink bomb; another said “maybe we just stink.” Some felt isolated, wondering whether they were alone in feeling unwell. “i thought i was losing my mind,” one texted the group.
They traded messages describing some of their symptoms and encouraged one another to visit urgent care.
When Askanase and four other protesters reported their symptoms to campus police and the NYPD on Sunday evening, they brought a jacket that had been doused with the foul-smelling substance. Askanase said that even being in a room with the jacket made some of them feel ill.
“Three of us ended up in the hospital that night,” Askanase said. “I woke up the next day feeling foggy even though the rally at this point was three days ago.”

TJMX0M7FEG_6QVZWA0L5BE9E1E,"Of all my chance encounters as a reporter, none was as unlikely as this",Joe Heim,"January 24, 2024 at 8:05 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/01/24/heim-father-wedding-vietnam-bai/,"What I love most about being a reporter is that I usually learn something new or meet someone new or go somewhere I might not otherwise have gone with every story I write. I’ve been lucky enough to do that here at The Washington Post for the past 25 years.
But of all the random things I’ve learned and interesting people I’ve met working on stories, nothing seems quite as unlikely as what occurred this past weekend.
I typically don’t work on weekends, but on Saturday I was assigned to write a story about a Lunar New Year celebration being held by the Vietnamese American community in Northern Virginia. The two-day annual event has grown into a big deal over the past eight years. More than 20,000 people were expected to attend. Sounded fun.
A couple of days beforehand, I called Thinh Dinh, one of the organizers of the event, to work out logistics. Thinh was friendly on the phone and happy that we were covering the festival, a fundraiser for his Vietnamese Catholic church community.
On Saturday morning, I arrived and met Thinh at the Dulles Expo Center, where the celebration was being held. He greeted me with a warm smile and a pat on the back. We chatted for a few minutes, and I mentioned that my parents had gotten married in Vietnam in 1965. Thinh, 60, was interested and asked why they had been there. I told him that my mom, Ginger, had been a State Department nurse assigned to the U.S. Navy hospital in Saigon and that my dad, Matt, worked for Catholic Relief Services.
Thinh’s eyes widened. “Really?” he said. “My dad worked for Catholic Relief Services in Saigon too.” In the ’60s, I asked? Yes, he told me. Whoa.
He rescued a family from Vietnam in 1975. On Thanksgiving they thank him.
I asked Thinh what his dad’s name was so I could see if my dad, who is 89, knew him. He told me it was Bai Dinh or Dinh van Bai, but that he also went by Joseph Bai.
I texted my dad, who was at his home in Pennsylvania, to ask if he remembered the name. It seemed like a bit of a long shot, but there was a chance. My dad texted back immediately. He did! They hadn’t worked together long, but he remembered Joseph Bai. He told me he was a “very pleasant guy and always smiling.”
And then a few minutes later, my dad texted me a photograph. It was from my parents’ wedding day and showed my dad with people on the staff of Catholic Relief Services who had come to the small ceremony and reception. “I think that’s Joseph, second from the right,” he wrote.
I showed the photo to Thinh, and his face lit up. “That’s him!” he said. We were both astounded to look at a photo from almost 59 years ago and a half a world away with both of our fathers in it. I don’t know what the odds are on such a thing. But it felt like magic.
The paths that brought Thinh and me together Saturday couldn’t have been more different. Thinh told me that he; his father; his mother, Mary Cuong Nguyen; and his three siblings escaped Vietnam in 1975, packed into one of the last helicopters to depart the U.S. Embassy before Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese. Their three-month journey to the United States for resettlement took them to the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, Fort Chaffee in Arkansas and then to Chesapeake, Va., where the family settled and built a new life.
I was eating at a diner when a man handed me my schoolwork from 40 years ago
Upon arriving in Chesapeake, Thinh said, his dad got a job as a night watchman at a warehouse, earning $2.30 an hour. A few days later, he landed a second job as a mechanic for a local yacht-building company. Later he became an inspector for a marine survey company, where he worked until retirement. Thinh said education was very important to his father, and Thinh and his siblings all went on to get degrees in electrical engineering from Old Dominion University. Thinh eventually got a job at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where he works now.
My parents left Vietnam a few months after their wedding and moved to Morocco, Kenya and Haiti before returning to the United States in 1976 with their five children in tow and settling in the Philadelphia suburbs. My dad, who had worked for Catholic Relief Services for 15 years, became a real estate agent. My mom was a public health nurse. I got a degree in English from Villanova University and, after a career switch, landed at The Post in 1999.
Sadly, Thinh’s father died in 2014 from complications following routine surgery. And my mom, who would have loved this hard-to-fathom story and always wanted to make a return visit to Vietnam, passed away last year. They are still very much with us. Thinh later told me that the family hadn’t been able to bring a lot of their belongings with them from Vietnam, so they don’t have many photos of their father as a young man. This one, he told me, is “priceless.”
On Monday, I emailed Thinh to ask what he thought when he saw the photo of our fathers together.
“My first reaction was ‘WOW’ what a coincidence, then I realized there must be a grander purpose for God to arrange this implausible meeting,” he replied. “You have indeed started a great story that have all of my extended family excited to see where it leads.”
We hope to get our families together soon."

They had moved to the city from Brazil for his job at the International Monetary Fund, and the house at 4433 Cathedral Ave. NW, now on the market for $4.7 million, was “love at first sight.”
But it was a few years before they purchased the house, in D.C.'s Wesley Heights neighborhood. In 2006, the asking price was $100,000 more than it is today. Portugal offered about a million less, and when his offer was refused, he offered to increase it. And then he raised and the owner refused until the 2008 housing market crash made it possible to buy the house for “significantly less” than the original offer.
Portugal and his wife were the second owners of the house, which was custom-built in 1988 for a real estate lawyer. They lived there “very happily” for three years. In 2011, Portugal left Washington for a job with a not-for-profit association of Brazilian banks, and they rented the property with hopes of returning. But his wife died in 2021, and he decided to sell.
The Tudor-style brick house has cathedral ceilings, hardwood floors, ample windows and several skylights. It is more than 8,000 square feet and has four finished levels, including the lower level. Pre-listing renovations include fresh paint and a new roof.
A stone path and arched entryway lead to the front door, which opens to a foyer on the main level. To the left, a library with built-in shelving connects to a study. To the right, the living room has a fireplace and an 11-foot ceiling. At the back of the main level, the kitchen has two dishwashers and an island with seating. A breakfast nook leads to a deck with yard access. The dining room leads to a screened porch with two skylights. This level also has a family room with a fireplace and access to a patio, and it has a powder room.
The primary bedroom — on the second level above the lower level — comes with a sitting room and a fireplace. The suite includes two walk-in closets and a bathroom with a skylight, a soaking tub and a two-sink vanity. This level also has an office with a cathedral ceiling, two more bedrooms (each with a walk-in closet and a bathroom), and a laundry room.
The third level has a vaulted ceiling, six skylights, and two bedrooms with walk-in closets and a shared bathroom. Washington National Cathedral is visible from windows on this floor.
The lower level, partially underground on the hilly property, has a recreation room with a wet bar and access to a stone path. It also has a den, two full bathrooms, a seventh bedroom (for those keeping track) and an office.
A stone path through the backyard leads to a pond with a waterfall in which Portugal kept fish. The lot, nearly a third of an acre, also includes a driveway and an attached two-car garage.

TME4F62Q56_4GM6S9PNHSV1N2R,Giant ship blocking Suez Canal is freed; incident on key trade route cost the global economy billions of dollars,Sudarsan Raghavan,"March 29, 2021 at 1:08 p.m. EDT",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/suez-ship-canal-ever-given-stuck/2021/03/29/0dd5babe-9017-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html,"ISMAILIA, Egypt — The mammoth cargo carrier blocking the Suez Canal was finally freed on Monday afternoon, nearly a week after it wedged sideways, blocking a key waterway and causing billions of dollars worth of damage to global trade.
Ship tracking data showed the Ever Given heading north at a speed that soon reached 7.5 knots, the equivalent of roughly 8.5 miles per hour. Nearby vessels blared their horns in celebration.
""We pulled it off!"" Dutch salvage company Boskalis, which had been hired by the ship's owner to assist with the high-stakes operation, said in a news release.
The victory followed a tense six days as the flow of goods between Europe and the Middle East and China in the crucial waterway came to a standstill, with the pressure on Egypt growing each day as the costs of the delay mounted.
Dredgers, tugboats and salvage crews worked frantically overnight on Sunday and had succeeded at freeing the boat’s stern by Monday morning, aided by the unusually high spring tide that arrived with the full moon.
At that point, Egyptian officials declared the operation a success. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabie, chief of the Suez Canal Authority, commended workers for achieving this “heroic feat” and performing “their patriotic duty impeccably.”
While the head of the Dutch salvage team warned that dislodging the boat’s bow could be far more complicated, a sense of optimism began to creep in, and Bloomberg News reported that one car carrier that had detoured away from the Suez Canal had taken another U-turn and was headed back for Egypt.
How did a ship get stuck in the Suez Canal?
“Egyptians have succeeded today in ending the crisis of the stranded ship in the Suez Canal,” Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi said in a statement.
He portrayed the efforts as a patriotic victory that assured the world that Egypt could be trusted with overseeing the 13 percent of all global trade that passes through the crucial waterway.
Later on Monday, it became clear that there was in fact reason to celebrate: Tugboats successfully reoriented the ship and pulled it into the center of the canal, then began towing it to the Bitter Lakes to the north, where it will be able to undergo an inspection without blocking traffic.
About 7 p.m., the Ever Given sailed past Fayed, a town on the shore of the Great Bitter Lake, under a large orange moon. “It went that way,” said a cook grilling meat at an outdoor restaurant, pointing north. “It is so big!”
Billions of dollars in trade have been lost each day from the grounding of the carrier, one of the largest container ships in the world. As of Monday morning, 367 vessels were trapped in a massive maritime traffic jam in the canal, according to Leth Agencies. Many other shipping companies opted to detour around the southern tip of Africa, adding a week or two to their journeys and driving up fuel costs.
Finally, the ship was moved by us, the Egyptians. All thanks to our friends for the support 🇪🇬☝️#SuezBLOCKED #Suez #Egypt #EVERGIVEN #SuezCanal #shipping #مصر #BreakingNews #قناه_السويس #كلنا_معك_يا_مصر #السعودية #الامارات #مصر_هتعدي_وقد_التحدي pic.twitter.com/m5SjR0flUC
Canal officials confirmed Monday that the shipping channel was still navigable and had not been damaged by the Ever Given, and ship-tracking data showed that traffic had resumed by Monday night. Three livestock carriers with live cattle on board were given priority to make their way through the newly reopened canal.
The Suez Canal Authority said it will send through 113 ships per day. It will take three to four days to clear the backup, and experts expect a new set of headaches as vessels that were held up in the Suez all arrive in ports at the same time and find they have no room to dock and unload their cargo.
Shipping giant Maersk told customers on Monday morning that it “could take 6 days or more” for the jam in the Suez to be fully unsnarled.
The steep financial losses caused by the delays are also expected to lead to a cascade of insurance claims, which could raise thorny questions about who should be held liable for the incident.
With the Ever Given freed, the spotlight is likely to shine on the ongoing investigation into how the vessel got stuck, leading to billions of dollars in losses globally. While strong winds during a dust storm are widely seen as a major factor, the Suez Canal Authority has said that human or technical errors cannot be ruled out.
One focus of the investigation will probably be the role of the two Egyptian canal pilots who were supposed to help the boat’s captain navigate the canal, and whether any communication failures occurred.
The International Chamber of Shipping on Monday called for the results of any investigations to be made public “to ensure any vital lessons are learnt.”
Monday’s successful turnaround came after a series of delays, over several days, that were due to technical and weather challenges preventing the extraction of the vessel from the sand and mud of the canal.
Over the weekend, as progress seemed to stall, Sissi had ordered workers to prepare for an alternative scenario that would have involved lightening the ship by unloading its 18,000 containers. That could have taken days, even weeks, and required large cranes or specialized helicopters, according to industry experts.

TPLJV0IZEZ_8QW51L400KOYVMQ,Opinion Ouch. That ‘free’ annual checkup might cost you. Here’s why.,_,"January 24, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/24/affordable-care-act-free-preventative-care/,"Elisabeth Rosenthal is senior contributing editor at KFF Health News and author of “An American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back.”
When Kristy Uddin, 49, went in for her annual mammogram in Washington state last year, she assumed she would not incur a bill because the test is one of the many preventive measures guaranteed to be free to patients under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The ACA’s provision made medical and economic sense, encouraging Americans to use screening tools that could nip medical problems in the bud and keep patients healthy.
So when a bill for $236 arrived, Uddin — an occupational therapist familiar with the health-care industry’s workings — complained to her insurer and the hospital. She even requested an independent review.
“I’m like, ‘Tell me why am I getting this bill?’ ” Uddin recalled in an interview. The unsatisfying explanation: The mammogram itself was covered, per the ACA’s rules, but the fee for the equipment and the facility was not.
That answer was particularly galling, she said, because, a year earlier, her “free” mammogram at the same health system had generated a bill of about $1,000 for the radiologist’s reading. Though she fought that charge (and won), this time she threw in the towel and wrote the $236 check. But then she dashed off a submission to the KFF Health News Bill of the Month project, on which I work:
“I was really mad — it’s ridiculous,” she later recalled. “This is not how the law is supposed to work.”
The ACA’s designers might have assumed that they had spelled out with sufficient clarity that millions of Americans would no longer have to pay for certain types of preventive care,  including mammograms, colonoscopies and recommended vaccines, in addition to doctor visits to screen for disease. But the law’s authors didn’t reckon with America’s ever-creative medical billing juggernaut.
Over the past several years, the medical industry has eroded the ACA’s guarantees, finding ways to bill patients in gray zones of the law. Patients going in for preventive care, expecting that it will be fully covered by insurance, are being blindsided by bills, big and small.
The problem comes down to deciding exactly what components of a medical encounter are covered by the ACA guarantee. For example, when do conversations between doctor and patient during an annual visit for preventive services veer into the treatment sphere? What screenings are needed for a patient’s annual visit?
A healthy 30-year-old visiting a primary-care provider might get  a few basic blood tests, while a 50-year-old who is overweight would merit additional screening for Type 2 diabetes.
Making matters more confusing, the annual checkup itself is guaranteed to be “no cost” for women and people age 65 and older, but the guarantee doesn’t apply for men in the 18-64 age range — though many preventive services that require a medical visit (such as checks of blood pressure or cholesterol and screens for substance abuse) are covered.
No wonder what’s covered under the umbrella of prevention can look very different to medical providers (trying to be thorough) and billers (intent on squeezing more dollars out of every medical encounter) than it does to insurers (who profit from narrower definitions).
For patients, the gray zone has become a billing minefield. Here a few more examples, gleaned from the Bill of the Month project in just the past six months:
Peter Opaskar, 46, of Texas, went to his primary-care doctor this year for his preventive-care visit — as he’d done before, at no cost. This time, his insurer paid $130.81 for the visit, but he also received a perplexing bill for $111.81. Opaskar learned that he had incurred the additional charge because when his doctor asked if he had any health concerns, he mentioned that he was having digestive problems but had already made an appointment with his gastroenterologist. So, the office explained, his visit was billed as both a preventive physical and a consultation. “Next year,” Opasker said in an interview, if he’s asked about health concerns, “I’ll say ‘no,’ even if I have a gunshot wound.”
Kevin Lin, a technology specialist in Virginia in his 30s, went to a new primary-care provider to take advantage of the preventive-care benefit when he got insurance; he had no physical complaints. He says he was assured at check-in that he wouldn’t be charged. His insurer paid $174 for the checkup, but he was billed an additional $132.29 for a “new patient visit.” He said he has made many calls to fight the bill, so far with no luck.
Finally, there’s Yoori Lee, 46, of Minnesota, herself a colorectal surgeon, who was shocked when her first screening colonoscopy yielded a bill for $450 for a biopsy of a polyp — a bill she knew was illegal. Federal regulations issued in 2022 to clarify the matter are very clear that biopsies during screening colonoscopies are included in the no-cost promise. “I mean, the whole point of screening is to find things,” she said, stating, perhaps, the obvious.
Though these patient bills defy common sense, room for creative exploitation has been provided by the complex regulatory language surrounding the ACA. Consider this from Ellen Montz, deputy administrator and director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in an emailed response to my queries and an interview request on this subject: “If a preventive service is not billed separately or is not tracked as individual encounter data separately from an office visit and the primary purpose of the office visit is not the delivery of the preventive item or service, then the plan issuer may impose cost sharing for the office visit.”
So, if the doctor decides that a patient’s mention of stomach pain does not fall under the umbrella of preventive care, then that aspect of the visit can be billed separately, and the patient must pay?
And then there’s this, also from Montz: “Whether a facility fee is permitted to be charged to a consumer would depend on whether the facility usage is an integral part of performing the mammogram or an integral part of any other preventive service that is required to be covered without cost sharing under federal law.”
But wait, how can you do a mammogram or colonoscopy without a facility?
Unfortunately, there is no federal enforcement mechanism to catch individual billing abuses. And agencies’ remedies are weak — simply directing insurers to reprocess claims or notifying patients they can resubmit them.
In the absence of stronger enforcement or remedies, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services could likely curtail these practices and give patients the tools to fight back by offering the sort of clarity the agency provided a few years ago regarding polyp biopsies — spelling out more clearly what comes under the rubric of preventive care, what can be billed and what cannot.
The stories we receive at KFF Health News are likely just the tip of an iceberg. And while each bill might be relatively small compared with the stunning $10,000 hospital bills that have become all too familiar in the United States, the sorry consequences are manifold. Patients pay bills they do not owe, depriving them of cash they could use elsewhere. If they can’t pay, those bills might end up with debt-collection agencies and, ultimately, harm their credit score.
Perhaps most disturbing: These unexpected bills might discourage people from seeking preventive screenings that could be lifesaving, which is why the ACA deemed them “essential health benefits” that should be free.

“As a result of continued violence after Oct. 7 … we can confirm the deaths of 23 American citizens — 21 who have served in the IDF, one who served in the Israeli National Police, as well as the recently reported death of Mr. Jabbar,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in his Monday press briefing. He was referring to 17-year-old Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, a Palestinian American teenager who was fatally shot in the occupied West Bank last week.
At least 552 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, and at least 2,672 have been injured, according to the Israel Defense Forces.

After receiving draft notices as part of a wider mobilization, about 10,000 people living in the United States have reported for duty with the IDF, Israeli officials said in November. Many had previously done service in the IDF or remain reservists. Historically, about 1,200 Americans serve in the IDF at a given time, according to a 2022 study published by the journal Sociological Forum. Many are, or become, dual citizens.
At least 32 Americans were killed by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. At least 10 Americans are believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7, with two released under a hostage exchange deal late last year.

The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.

But as in the cases of other recently released political prisoners, Alaa Abdel Fattah will not be entirely free: He is required to report to his local police station at the end of each day for the next five years.
Abdel Fattah played a leading role in the 2011 Arab Spring revolts that ousted Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Three years later, Abdel Fattah was jailed for taking part in a peaceful demonstration at a time when Egypt’s government had banned public gathering and unauthorized protests.
His imprisonment was considered unjust by human rights activists and his supporters. Tens of thousands of opponents and critics have been jailed by current President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi’s regime, widely seen by critics as the most authoritarian in the country’s modern history.
Trump to welcome Egypt’s Sissi back to White House, continuing break with Obama
On Facebook, supporters of Abdel Fattah set up pages calling for his release, including one labeled “Free Alaa.” On Friday, his sisters and lawyer jubilantly declared that he had returned home, posting videos of him walking out of the police station and shaking hands with friends. His family also thanked those who pushed for his freedom over the past several years.
“We are truly grateful to all this support,” Mona Sief, Abdel Fattah’s sister, posted on her Facebook page.
It’s unclear how much time Abdel Fattah will be allowed to spend in society. He has to report to the police every day. At the very least, he will need to sign a logbook at the station. At worst, he will be required to spend the night. That’s what happened to Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zaid, widely known as Shawkan, who was freed from jail three weeks ago also after serving a five-year sentence.
Abdel Farrah’s lawyer fears the worst. He expects his client to spend his nights under the watchful eye of Egypt’s security apparatus.
“This is a man who will have to spend half of his day, daily, at the police station,” said the lawyer, Taher Aboelnasr. “For half of his day, he has no right to act freely. He has no control over it. He can’t even travel.”
Egypt’s parliament votes to lift term limits from president, allowing Sissi to rule till 2034
Sanaa Sief, another sister of Abdel Fattah, wrote on her Facebook page that her brother will remain suppressed. Referring to him, she wrote, “the person under probation is a person still serving time. He is not a person who will get released and live as a normal and free human being. He is spending half his time ‘under their grip.’ ”
Sissi, a former general, led a military coup that ousted democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. The following year Sissi was elected president, and swiftly launched a campaign to silence his opponents and critics, targeting media organizations, human rights and pro-democracy activists and nongovernmental organizations.
Abdel Fattah, an influential blogger on social media, had long fought for civil rights. He has been detained for short periods by several governments, including Mubarak’s, for his outspokenness. In 2014, when Egypt was under a temporary military-backed government before Sissi's ascent to office, Abdel Fattah was convicted and sentenced to five years for taking part in a protest against trials of civilians under military tribunals.
While in prison, Abdel Fattah’s father died. His son Khaled, named after a pro-democracy activist who help trigger the populist revolution against Mubarak, was only 2 years old when he was jailed.
On Friday, one photo was widely circulated on social media: It was of a smiling Abdel Fattah playing with the feet of his now 7-year-old son at his home.

TWR3FW3DT2_9QMYS6TDUEZCV12,Biden to deploy CIA director to help broker major Gaza deal,John Hudson,"January 25, 2024 at 11:17 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/25/william-burns-cia-gaza-israel-hostages/,"President Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious deal between Hamas and Israel that would involve the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza and the longest cessation of hostilities since the war began last year, according to officials familiar with the matter.
Burns is expected to travel to Europe for the talks and meet with the Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs, David Barnea and Abbas Kamel, and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The planned gathering has not been previously reported.
Egypt and Qatar have been key interlocutors between Israel and Hamas, the militant group whose deadly cross-border attack on Oct. 7 set off the war in Gaza. The two countries helped secure an initial pause in hostilities and hostage release in November. But tensions between the Israelis and Qataris are on a razor’s edge after leaked audio of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu captured the Israeli leader disparaging Qatar in a conversation with Israeli hostage families.
Here are the hostages released by Hamas and those remaining in Gaza
Burns’s discussions in Europe are expected to build on his phone conversations with counterparts, as well as the work of the White House’s top Middle East official, Brett McGurk, who this week has held related meetings in Qatar’s capital, Doha, and in Cairo.
Israel’s latest proposal includes a 60-day pause in fighting in exchange for the phased release of the more than 100 captives, beginning with civilian women and children and followed by civilian men, military women and men, and the remains of those who have died since their abduction. Such a pause would allow Israel to continue fighting after the two-month lull in line with Netanyahu’s vow to achieve “total victory” by destroying Hamas.
The CIA declined to comment.
The Israelis also have proposed that senior Hamas leaders agree to leave Gaza, but one official familiar with the negotiations said the idea was a nonstarter for the group and its military leaders, who are prepared to die as martyrs in the Palestinian enclave. Hamas also rebuffed Israel’s 60-day pause proposal, saying the next hostage release should involve a permanent cease-fire, the official said.
But multiple officials said negotiations on those key points remain active.
Samir Farag, a former Egyptian general and defense official, said both Hamas and Israel have shown a willingness to return to the negotiating table.
“Everybody wants peace — the Palestinians, Hamas and the Israelis. But everybody wants to win in the negotiations,” he said. “We are trying to reach a middle ground.”
Hamas’s possession of the hostages puts the group “in a very strong position,” Farag said.
“I think Netanyahu is under pressure, because the street in Israel, everybody wants to release the hostages,” he added. “So he has to do something, otherwise he’s in big trouble — especially because he lost a lot of soldiers in the war over there.” Some of the terms of the negotiations were reported by Axios and CNN.
The planned meeting between the spy chiefs and the Qatari prime minister reflects how far talks between Israel and Hamas have advanced in recent days, according to another U.S. official. “I do think that there have been enough exchanges of ideas and proposals that we are nearing the serious phase of negotiations,” the official said.
Strong disagreements remain about whether a pause in fighting could evolve into a lasting cease-fire, but the U.S. official said it could be achieved. “One can have cautious optimism that if you can get this thing to stop for two months, maybe you can get this thing to stop,” he said.
The discussions come as Israel’s forces encircle the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, where they believe top Hamas commanders are located. The United Nations accused Israel of shelling a U.N. compound housing 30,000 displaced people on Wednesday, which sparked rare condemnation from the United States. Israel denied it was responsible for any “aerial or artillery strike” on the area.
Humanitarian organizations have reported that thousands of civilians are trapped in the city, many in hospitals. Across Gaza, more than 25,700 people, most of them civilians, have died since the fighting began, according to Palestinian health officials.
The violence has coincided with anger from Qatar over Netanyahu’s leaked remarks accusing Doha of failing to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. He also said the Persian Gulf state was worse than the United Nations and the Red Cross, institutions Israel routinely accuses of anti-Israel bias.
“You haven’t seen me thank Qatar, have you noticed? I haven’t thanked Qatar. Why? Because Qatar, to me, is no different in essence from the U.N., from the Red Cross, and in a way it’s even more problematic,” said Netanyahu, according to audio obtained by Israel’s Channel 12.
Qatar said on X that it was “appalled” by the remarks, which spokesman Majed Al-Ansari called “irresponsible and destructive,” but “not surprising.” If Netanyahu’s comments were “found to be true,” Ansari said, “the Israeli [prime minister] would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives.”
An Israeli official did not immediately respond to a question on the leaked audio.
A U.S. official said the spat, though unwelcome, would not derail negotiations.
Despite U.S. pressure on Israel, casualty count in Gaza remains high
The spy chiefs and Qatari prime minister also met shortly before the conclusion of November’s deal, which involved the release of more than 100 captives in exchange for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. The pause also allowed critical flows of humanitarian aid to northern Gaza, where inhabitants are approaching near-famine conditions. Burns and McGurk both played a role in securing that deal.
After a flurry of diplomacy this month, both parties appear to be close to an agreement, Farag said. But Hamas “asked for a guarantee, because sometimes they deliver the hostages and after that [Israel] will attack them again.”
The United States is the only actor positioned to offer such a guarantee, Farag said. Even if Netanyahu has paid little heed to American entreaties on Israel’s conduct of the war and the entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza in recent months, he said, Egypt believes the United States retains crucial leverage by virtue of its military assistance to Israel. He referenced a famous quote by the late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, who took part in talks brokered by President Jimmy Carter that led to the 1978 Camp David Accords and a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt the following year.
“We do believe that as President Sadat said, 99 percent of the solutions in every place in the world come from the United States,” Farag said.
He added: “The Americans, they are very powerful, believe me. They can do whatever they want. The Israelis, now they are facing a lot of problems — economic, because all the people that are working now in the army. But who is supporting Israel? The United States. Who gave them all of the munitions? … If the Americans said no, then it would stop.”
But Biden has appeared unwilling so far to put that kind of serious pressure on Netanyahu’s government, he said.
Michael Milshtein, a senior fellow at Reichman University and former head of Palestinian affairs for Israeli military intelligence, said he believes a deal could be reached in the coming weeks. “In Israel, there are more and more voices that really want to promote such a deal, and I think that Hamas also understands that the next stages of the conflict can cause this organization severe damages,” he said. “Both sides want to consider this idea.”
Parker reported from Cairo. Susannah George in Doha and Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.

TYIYM1E3ZW_LP35WVYVZNKIR4X,Trump’s New Hampshire victory brings Biden rematch into focus,Dan Balz,"January 23, 2024 at 11:23 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/trump-new-hampshire-victory-analysis/,"MANCHESTER. N.H. — New Hampshire voters have often been chosen to play the role of spoilers, upending the script of a presidential nominating contest by embarrassing the front-runner. On Tuesday, that was not to be. Donald Trump easily dispatched Nikki Haley, a victory likely to shift the focus of 2024 politics to his expected November faceoff against President Biden.
The victory on Tuesday made Trump the first non-incumbent Republican candidate to win both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary — and to win both with a majority of the vote. In doing so, Trump has maintained a pace that would allow him to effectively wrap up the Republican nomination faster than any previous non-incumbent.
In victory, however, Trump was anything but gracious. On stage, he was angry — angry that Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations and former governor of South Carolina, had delivered her post-election remarks before him and that they had the air of a victory speech, angry that she vowed to keep her campaign going against the odds. Trump was petulant and dismissive, barely able to enjoy the clear victory he had posted. The more Haley carries the fight forward, the more likely it is to irritate him.
Both the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign are eager to see the general election come into sharper focus. For Trump, shedding his rivals allows him to concentrate on the battle ahead rather than continuing to spend significant time and money on what appears to be a foregone conclusion.
For Biden, the sooner he can focus voters on the possibility of Trump returning to the White House, the more his team thinks voters will recoil. Trump’s performance on Tuesday night was exactly what they hope will register increasingly with voters.
A general election between Biden and Trump will be grinding. Most Americans wish their choice would be anything but a 2020 rematch. The longest general election in history is not likely to be remembered for its uplifting spirit. But few elections have come with stakes and significance as great as what lies ahead.
The general election will be unusual in another important respect. There will be much more focus, pro and con, on Trump than on Biden. It is in Trump’s nature to make himself the center of attention and in Biden’s interest to let him. Biden has not been a forceful presence, seen by many of his detractors as too old and weak to seek a second term. In 2020, because of the pandemic, he was able to stay out of the limelight and let Trump damage himself. Will that be the same dynamic this time?
The Republican race has consolidated remarkably quickly. Even before the first primary on Tuesday, the once-large GOP field had been reduced to just two candidates, after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, once seen as Trump’s strongest challenger, unexpectedly suspended his campaign on Sunday afternoon.
Polls show that many voters see Trump as more capable at handling the economy and stronger to deal with the surge of illegal immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Biden’s team wants Americans to recall other aspects of Trump’s presidency and post-presidency, from his lies about a stolen election in 2020 to his erratic behavior to his grievance-laden rhetoric and appeals.
As strong as Trump has been in the nomination contest, the general election balance sheet is far less positive. His assets begin with his strong and loyal base. His supporters have shown themselves to be extremely enthusiastic about him. And while he badly lost the popular vote in 2020, the shift of about 44,000 votes in battleground states could have changed the outcome in the electoral college.
That points toward a general election battle waged in the trenches of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and, possibly, North Carolina. It also points to another potentially close contest for an electoral college majority.
Trump’s liabilities are significant, starting with the four criminal indictments and 91 felony counts s in state and federal courts. The timing of those trials remains fluid, leaving open the question of whether any jury will render a verdict before the election. Republicans are taking a gamble by putting their hopes of winning back the White House — not to mention holding their slim House majority and winning control of the Senate — in the hands of Trump. They seem oblivious to this.
Biden, too, is a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. His overall approval ratings are extremely low. He has failed to persuade voters to give him credit for those parts of the economy that look strong. He is dogged by complaints about high gasoline and grocery prices and his age at 81 is a cause for concern even among voters who say they will be with him.
His greatest asset is that his likely opponent does more to motivate the Democratic base and some anti-Trump independents that Biden himself does. And if Biden will be on defense on the issue of immigration, unless a deal is cut soon in Congress, he and the Democrats will be on offense on the issue of abortion.
Democrats will seek to make abortion a central part of the choice in the fall. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the summer of 2022, thanks to the three conservative justices Trump nominated, Republicans have suffered at the polls when the issue has been the centerpiece of campaigns, and antiabortion measures have failed at the polls.
Trump’s victory in New Hampshire was built on the strength of his margin among registered Republicans in the state, another reminder of his success over the past eight years in consolidating a reshaped party. Preliminary network exit poll findings showed that, among registered Republicans, his margin over Haley was almost 50 percentage points.
That is a big reason, as he has marched toward the nomination, that more and more Republican elected officials have fallen in line behind him. They have bowed to the former president, despite whatever private doubts they may harbor about his fitness for the presidency, because they fear his followers.
But Haley’s support among New Hampshire’s independent voters points to a potential problem for Trump in a general election. On Tuesday, those who have registered to vote as undeclared supported Haley by a margin of 65 percent to 34 percent, according to the preliminary network exit poll findings. She also won a majority of voters with college degrees, but Trump won an even bigger majority among those without college degrees.
Many of those among the pool of undeclared voters in New Hampshire once called themselves Republicans. Their antipathy toward the former president will be a problem for Trump in the fall.
Haley spoke to her supporters in Concord, N.H., soon after the polls closed, declaring that the Republican race is far from over and indicating that she is eager to join the next battle, in her home state. But the South Carolina electorate is far more conservative than New Hampshire’s and, therefore, far less friendly to her.
That sets her up for potential embarrassment at the hands of voters who put her in the governor’s mansion unless she can shake up the race and break through with Republican voters. Increasingly, she will be under pressure to quit the race.
DeSantis faced the same pressure after Iowa, vowed to keep going into South Carolina and beyond — and then quit before the balloting began in New Hampshire.
With Biden not on the ballot here and the Democratic race drawing little interest, Haley’s strategy was to attract as many undeclared voters, many of whom are hostile toward Trump, as possible to back her candidacy.
For part of the past week, the campaign in New Hampshire was a pale imitation of past contests, with Haley starting her post-Iowa activity slowly, DeSantis often absent and Trump following his pattern of limited rallies and little direct voter contact.
After her slow start, Haley, spurred by the energy of Gov. Chris Sununu, her most prominent supporter, kick-started her campaign late last week and maintained a decidedly accelerated pace until Tuesday. On both Sunday night and Monday night, she drew large and enthusiastic audiences in Exeter and Salem in a sign of what appeared to be gathering momentum behind her.
The polls, however, kept telling another story, that of a front-runner who continued to maintain a double-digit lead. Haley’s hope was to cut that to single digits and at least get some bragging rights coming out of New Hampshire. She didn’t quite make it, and as she considers her options in the weeks ahead of South Carolina’s primary, Trump and Biden will be plotting how to defeat each other.
Trump and Biden won their respective New Hampshire primary elections. Here are the results, biggest takeaways and what exit polls showed.

Who is running? The top contenders for the GOP 2024 nomination are former president Donald Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was dropping out just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. For the Democrats, President Biden is running for reelection in 2024.

U15OQI4J50_VGCVD4UUGJQ2JXE,Egyptian photojournalist released after more than 5 years in prison,Sudarsan Raghavan,"March 4, 2019 at 6:40 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egyptian-photojournalist-released-after-more-than-5-years-in-prison/2019/03/04/8aa5354c-c014-4f31-a17b-01a6135bcb34_story.html,"CAIRO — Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abu Zeid, the most high-profile journalist imprisoned by Egypt, was released Monday after more than five years in jail for what human rights groups say was simply doing his job covering anti-government protests.
A picture of a smiling Abu Zeid, widely known as Shawkan, with his father and brother was posted on a family-run Twitter account shortly after his release with the hashtag #Shawkan_is_Free.
“Thank God that it is over,” declared Taher Aboelnasr, his lawyer. “I pray to God that things become easier for him from now on and his life gets better.”
For years, human rights groups, the United Nations, journalist organizations and legions of supporters have waged a campaign to release Shawkan. He became a visible symbol of the ongoing authoritarianism of President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, who has jailed tens of thousands of opponents and critics of his regime, including many journalists.
In the end, Shawkan, 32, was released only because he had completed his prison term before finally being formally sentenced last September. Nevertheless, he will be required to report to a police station for the next five years at the end of each day and spend the night there. His lawyers plan to challenge the measure.
“We are relieved to hear that Shawkan is finally free after spending over five years in jail and call on authorities to end their shameful treatment of this photojournalist by removing any conditions to his release,” Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a statement. “The Egyptian government should take steps immediately to improve its image, which has been badly tarnished by this unjust imprisonment — and it can start by releasing all journalists jailed in relation to their work.”
In latest blow to press freedom, Egypt deports New York Times reporter
At least 26 journalists are currently jailed in Egypt for the doing their work, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Committee to Protect Journalists has put the number of journalists in jail at 25.
Shawkan was arrested on Aug. 14, 2013, while covering clashes between Egyptian security forces and supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi, after police and army units tried to violently disperse sit-in protests at Cairo’s Rabaa al-Adawiya Square.
Morsi, the elected leader, had been deposed that year in a military coup led by Sissi.
More than 800 protesters were killed in what Human Rights Watch described as “one of the world’s largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history.”
Shawkan, along with hundreds of others, was charged with taking part in unauthorized protests, possessing weapons and belonging to the now banned Muslim Brotherhood, which Morsi led.
Shawkan has denied the allegations and said he was there to take photos for a British-based photo agency, Demotix.
On Monday, 214 other people who were arrested along with Shawkan and served a similar sentence were also released. Seventy-five others in the mass trial were sentenced to death and are now appealing their verdict, according to activists and lawyers.
Shawkan was supposed to have been released in September, but a six-month jail sentence was tacked on because he couldn’t afford to pay the fine, human rights activists said.
Two foreign journalists arrested with him were released that same day. The watchdog group Amnesty International said the prosecution during his trial failed to provide sufficient evidence of Shawkan’s alleged crimes. The group described the mass trial as “a mockery of justice.”
“As a prisoner of conscience, he should never have been forced to spend a single minute behind bars — let alone five and a half years,” Amnesty International’s North Africa Campaigns Director Najia Bounaim said in a statement. Bounaim described Shawkan’s five-year-long probation — which requires him to spend 12 hours a day, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., at a police station — as “ludicrous” and urged they be lifted immediately.
Egypt is one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists said. The Sissi government has jailed 19 journalists on charges of false news, the most in the world, the organization said. In recent months, Egyptian journalists have been imprisoned for covering election irregularities, police abuse and interviewing a gay man on a television news show.
Foreign journalists, too, have been targeted. A Times of London journalist was expelled from the country last year. And last month, a New York Times journalist was barred entry into Egypt, detained for hours and deported.
Sissi in the past has justified the ongoing crackdown of opponents, activists and critics as necessary to stabilize the country economically and politically, as well as to undermine terrorists targeting the country. Last week, at a summit in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, he warned European officials not to lecture Egypt on its human rights record, declaring that the Arab world’s situation was different from the West.
After his release at 6 a.m. Monday, Shawkan went to his home that he hadn’t seen since his arrest. Pictures posted on social media showed a joyful Shawkan taking selfies with relatives and friends, and playing with his niece.
By 6 p.m., though, he will be back at the police station to spend his first night.
“Can you imagine? For five and half years he has been behind bars, and he still has to suffer during his probation period,” said Aboelnasr, his lawyer.
“I pray that this is the last case of its kind,” he continued. “I pray no one gets to live this experience.”

U7XP0IGWD8_UPHQMC0FVTQKHWV,U.S. signals it is open to withdrawing some troops from Iraq,Dan Lamothe,"January 25, 2024 at 11:11 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/25/iraq-syria-pentagon-military/,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin left the door open Thursday to reducing the U.S. military presence in Iraq, saying that meetings set to begin soon between officials from the two countries will enable a “transition to an enduring bilateral security partnership” that builds on years of joint operations against the Islamic State.
Austin, in a statement released by the Pentagon, said U.S. troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the government in Baghdad. Forthcoming meetings of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission, a group comprising national security officials from both governments, will look at the presence of U.S. forces in the country while considering the threat the militants pose, requirements that remain and the Iraqi military’s capabilities, Austin added.
The comments come during a volatile time. Many Iraqi officials have called for the ouster of U.S. forces after a months-long cycle of violence, inflamed by the Israel-Gaza war, between Iranian-backed militias and U.S. forces. Austin continues to convalesce at home after an extended hospitalization following complications from surgery to treat prostate cancer.
U.S. military positions in Iraq and Syria have been attacked at least 153 times since October by militant groups trained and supplied by Iran, including incidents Thursday in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil and at Ain al-Asad Air Base in the western part of the country. Pentagon officials note that about 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Iraq and that 900 are deployed to Syria as a buffer to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State. But Iraqi officials have increasingly responded with anger when the United States has retaliated with airstrikes. The militias have tied their attacks to the war in Gaza and to U.S. support for Israel’s campaign against Hamas.
Iraqi officials, in a statement, acknowledged the beginning of the meetings but left it unclear whether they will ask for U.S. forces to leave.
The statement, released by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, said that “in line with the growing capabilities of the Iraqi forces,” the Iraqi government is announcing “the success of continuous negotiations” that began in August about future steps.
The meetings of the commission are aimed at formulating “a specific and clear timeline determining the duration of the presence of the international coalition advisors in Iraq, initiating a gradual and thoughtful reduction of their presence on Iraqi soil, concluding the military mission against [the Islamic State], and transitioning to comprehensive bilateral relations with coalition countries in politics, economics, culture, security, and military affairs, aligning with the vision of the Iraqi government,” the Foreign Ministry said.
The Iraqi parliament has voted to eject U.S. military forces from the country. But U.S. officials have said they have received no formal notification.
A Pentagon spokeswoman, Sabrina Singh, denied Thursday that the meetings are a negotiation to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq.
“This is about the future and making sure that Iraq is set up for success in defending its own security and sovereignty, and how the U.S. can support Iraq in doing that,” she said.
Officials stressed that the military talks had been in the works well before Hamas’s attack in Israel on Oct. 7 plunged the region into turmoil and exacerbated long-running tensions between the U.S. military and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq.
The U.S. response to ongoing militia attacks intensifies the challenges faced in Baghdad by Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who must juggle the demands of the United States, Iraq’s chief Western ally, and those of Iran, Iraq’s powerful neighbor that wields major political influence in his country.
Washington and Tehran have long had an adversarial relationship over Iran’s nuclear program, its support for armed groups across the Middle East and other issues.
“We’ve been discussing this for months,” a senior defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “The timing is not related to recent attacks.”
U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity in a conference call organized by the Pentagon, were reluctant to offer additional details about what shape the new arrangement in Iraq could take. The wave of militia attacks prompted a delay in the commission meetings in the fall, but they will now commence, a senior defense official on the call said.
“There’s no way for us to forecast exactly where that leads, or on what timetable that leads,” the official said.
The lack of clarity left open the possibility that the United States could withdraw troops from some locations in Iraq, and potentially from Syria. U.S. forces in Syria rely on logistical support from American personnel in Iraq.
A senior military official, speaking on the same conference call, said that about 70 Americans have been injured in the militia attacks since October, with one soldier seriously wounded. The continuing presence, he said, has played a role in preventing nearby Islamic State cells from carrying out larger attacks.
The discussions cap two decades of U.S. military involvement in Iraq. President George W. Bush ordered the invasion of the country in March 2003 based on faulty intelligence that then-leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction.
The invasion unleashed a violent insurgency that left more than 4,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead. At the height of the U.S. surge, more 170,000 American troops were on the ground.
President Barack Obama withdrew remaining U.S. troops, who were commanded by Austin when he was a four-star general, in late 2011. U.S. troops returned to Iraq in 2014, after Islamic State militants seized control of roughly a third of the country.

U8U0UMI0AA_VM8CTWERAR8VIHA,Conn. mayor wins do-over race after GOP seized on Democratic ballot-stuffing,Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff,"January 25, 2024 at 10:52 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/25/bridgeport-mayor-election-fraud-allegations/,"A Connecticut mayor whose September primary election win was invalidated after ballot-fraud allegations won a do-over primary Tuesday, months after his case became a flash point in conservative arguments about debunked theories of voter fraud.
As Donald Trump barrels toward the Republican nomination and continues promoting debunked claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him, he and his allies have seized on this case out of Democratic-leaning Bridgeport. They see the case — which resulted in a mayor formerly convicted of conspiracy winning a general election that had been voided by the courts — as evidence that Democrats are committing widespread fraud. Elections experts say those claims are baseless and that the Bridgeport case is unique.
“There is no indication to say that what took place in Bridgeport is happening nationally,” said David Levine, a senior fellow with the German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy. “But election deniers just need a toehold to get greater traction on a bigger claim. For those that want to make mountains out of molehills, it’s incumbent on them to bring the evidence to support those accusations.”
Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim, whose supporters allegedly stuffed absentee ballots on his behalf, won reelection over John Gomes in the Tuesday Democratic primary, according to the Associated Press.
Gomes lost to Ganim in their first faceoff Sept. 12 by 251 votes out of 8,173 cast. Soon after, Gomes’s campaign released videos showing a woman putting documents inside a drop box outside a city hall annex. She did it three times between 5:42 a.m. and 6:38 a.m. on the morning of Sept. 5. The same woman then appeared to go inside the annex and give more documents to a man who later deposited them into the absentee ballot box.
That seemingly broke a Connecticut law that requires absentee voters to personally drop off their filled-out ballots or assign relatives, caregivers, election officials or police to do so. Gomes, the incumbent’s former acting chief administrative officer, challenged the results in a lawsuit against the city, and in November a judge ordered a new primary after he found evidence of wrongdoing.
“The volume of ballots so mishandled is such that it calls the result of the primary election into serious doubt and leaves the court unable to determine the legitimate result of the primary,” Superior Court Judge William Clark wrote.
The decision came less than a week before the November general election. The judge said he did not have the power to postpone it, so voters went to the polls in an election that had no standing.
Ganim similarly alleged that supporters of Gomes committed election fraud, though no evidence has surfaced to substantiate those claims. The mayor, long embattled and previously convicted of corruption, also has said his supporters broke the law but that he had “no knowledge of what was going on.”
Gomes called the Ganim administration “corrupt” in a Wednesday interview with The Washington Post while alleging there could have been additional fraud in the do-over primary. Ganim did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump, Elon Musk, the legal defense fund of MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell and Republicans in Connecticut, among others, have used the Bridgeport fraud allegations to question how common cheating is nationally. They have also used the case in fundraising appeals.
“This is just a ‘tiny’ part of what’s happening in our country with voting,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It’s all a giant scam!”
Claims of voter fraud more broadly have continued even as some Trump lawyers have been criminally charged and censured, and as right-wing outlets such as Newsmax slowed their spread of the unsubstantiated theories in the face of lawsuits and threats of legal consequences. About two-thirds of Republicans, polls show, believe that the 2020 presidential election was rigged.
Some Connecticut Republicans have used the incident to instill doubt in ballot boxes and absentee voting generally. Among them is state Rep. Doug Dubitsky (R).
“How do we know that it’s only Bridgeport?” Dubitsky said during a legislative debate over the city’s controversy, according to the AP. “This exact same thing could be happening in every single municipality in this state. We should get rid of these boxes completely.”
In 2023, at least 14 states passed laws that made it harder to vote. Those limitations included requiring more information on a mail ballot application, narrowing the window to request a ballot and banning drop boxes, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
In Connecticut, Levine, of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, said it was particularly important for the state to ensure there was no additional fraud in the redo primary, since more eyes would be on Bridgeport this time around. In response to the allegations, the State Elections Enforcement Commission launched an investigation, and legislators and the secretary of state installed election observers and issued clearer guidance on absentee voting that they said would make the election more secure.
State Sen. Marilyn Moore (D), who ran against Ganim for Bridgeport mayor in 2019, pointed to the video cameras catching the alleged cheating and the response of the courts and state as evidence that the system is working, and that election fraud is still rare.
“We want to make it convenient to vote, and also make sure there is integrity in our elections,” Moore said. “But I do not want to see us ban the ballot boxes.”
Ganim finished roughly 1,100 votes ahead of Gomes.
This is not the first time the incumbent mayor or officials in Bridgeport, the state’s largest city, have been the subject of allegations of election fraud or corruption. Ganim was mayor from 1991 until 2003 before he was convicted of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. He served seven years in prison before winning election again for mayor in 2015.
In 2019, three people tied to his campaign were accused of illegally collecting completed absentee ballots from voters, among other charges. Last summer, elections officials recommended the people for criminal charges, though a judge found that there was not enough evidence to overturn that election.
But ballot fraud in the city goes back further, at least to the 1980s, and as recently as 2022, when another such allegation prompted a judge to order another primary  in a race for the state legislature.
It is unclear exactly how Bridgeport’s mayoral race will move forward, though a general election is scheduled for next month. Ganim could face a Republican, another candidate and Gomes, who is currently listed on the general election ballot as an independent. Gomes told The Post he has not yet made a decision on whether he will join them and challenge his former boss for the fourth time in months."
UECKG5OGOM_7XO4SGBX9V45BBL,Arroz con pollo is the Cuban comfort dish that lifts rice to its full potential,Tanya Sichynsky,"March 6, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2019/03/06/arroz-con-pollo-is-the-cuban-comfort-dish-that-lifts-rice-to-its-full-potential/,"This recipe is featured in Voraciously’s Meal Plan of Action newsletter series. Each week, for 12 weeks, our easy-to-follow game plan focuses on one ingredient, shows you how to give that item a little TLC on a Sunday afternoon and explores how a week’s worth of deceptively easy (and, above all, tasty) dinners can be built around it.

For years, I have harbored a seemingly unpopular opinion in shame. But one of the cornerstones of being online is the broadcasting of your deeply held (if faulty) beliefs with unshakable pride, so *straps on helmet, elbow pads, knee pads* here goes nothing.
Rice is just okay.
Get the recipe: Arroz con Pollo
When it comes to cooking grains at home, I’m of two philosophies: The grain — which in many households is long-grain white rice — should either be 1) boiled together with a dish’s other ingredients to absorb their flavors or 2) cooked plainly in advance and ultimately fried.
Sign up for Voraciously’s Meal Plan of Action newsletter series
The greatest example of the first approach is a Cuban classic I grew up on and, scientifically, the ultimate comfort dish: arroz con pollo. Truly great rice is rice that’s boiled with rendered chicken fat, stock, beer, tomato sauce and saffron. If you disagree, please do not hesitate to @ me. But at least make this recipe first.
Like any respectable Cuban dish, arroz con pollo starts with a combo of garlic, onion and bell pepper sauteed in a little fat. This holy trinity is called sofrito; much like a French mirepoix, it serves as the foundation on which you’ll build a flavorful meal. After a bit of browning and sauteing, there’s little work left for you as the rice cooks. It’s an appealing set-it-and-forget-it dinner option if there ever was one, which is why I insisted on learning my own Cuban mother’s recipe. And whether you’ve got kiddos or large adult sons, this dish will feed (and fill up) a crowd.
Good news for those of us who love to make meals ahead: Arroz con pollo is better the next day. Storing the dish in a large, oven-safe glass container in the fridge will make for easy reheating. If you live for crispy chicken skin, you can finish things off by re-searing the thighs skin sides down in a cast-iron skillet for a minute or two after you’ve warmed things through.
Cuban beans and rice bring together two pantry staples in one perfect pot of comfort
As far as specialty ingredients go, saffron — a spice that’s popular in Spanish and Middle Eastern cooking — imparts an unmistakable color and flavor. A little tomato sauce will color our rice slightly, but that coveted yellow hue can’t happen without those luxurious threads. Skip it, and you’ll have one of those “Something’s missing, but I can’t place what” moments. You don’t want that.
Affordable options are available; you can get a small vial of saffron threads at Trader Joe’s for $5.99. And a little goes a long way (for this recipe, you’ll want to use what I’m going to call a “baby pinch”), so once you have it on hand you can experiment with adding it to other rice dishes, vegetables and even sweet treats.

UFHB7URAD0_TTA7U8QU36W6HIH,French proposal for free fertility tests at age 25 outrages women’s groups,Annabelle Timsit,"January 25, 2024 at 11:36 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/25/france-fertility-tests-birth-rate-macron/,"French President Emmanuel Macron, in his first prime-time news conference since forming a new government, laid out some of the biggest challenges he believes France faces, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East — and rising infertility.
Calling infertility a “scourge,” Macron proposed a “major plan” designed to help reverse France’s declining birthrate, which could include offering 25-year-olds free fertility checks as part of their routine medical checkups.
The proposal, which has not been implemented, set off a strong reaction in France. Some women said the government shouldn’t be pressuring them to think about fertility so early. And women’s rights groups complained the French government should be focused on doing more to make it more affordable to have children, or to tackle the climate crisis that threatens the Earth they will live on.
Though the tests would be offered to men and women, many in France also complained that conversations around boosting fertility tend to disproportionately target women.
In a message to the government, Anne-Cécile Mailfert, president of the Women’s Foundation advocacy group, said: “Leave our uteruses in peace.”
In an interview with French television station BFM, Mailfert said if France were “more pro-child” — including by providing quality public education and housing — more people would choose to have children.
Amélie Beauchemin, a 30-year-old lawyer in Paris, said it is “completely crazy” for a country like France — where the average age that women have their first child is 31 — to encourage 25-year-olds to think about their fertility.
“It’s much too early,” she said.
China wants more babies. Women want the right to say no.
Macron, as part of a broader plan to boost birthrates, said his government will look to replace parental leave with a new “birth leave” that would be better paid and allow parents to return to work earlier. The government is also considering support measures for people seeking to have children through procedures such as IVF, according to French media. The Health Ministry will now draw up a more detailed plan for implementing these ideas and submit it to the government in the coming months.
In his speech, Macron called infertility the “taboo of the century” and said it is contributing to France’s declining birthrates.
A parliamentary report published in 2022 estimated that nearly 14 percent of French adults between 20 and 49 “have encountered infertility problems in their relationship requiring medical help.” The problem is global: The World Health Organization said last year that roughly 1 in 6 adults worldwide experienced infertility.
Rising infertility comes as France, like many other countries, is facing demographic decline. Only 678,000 babies were born in 2023 in France, and there were 47,000 more live births than deaths — the lowest level since the end of World War II, according to its national statistics institute. Policymakers worry that fewer babies means fewer young workers down the line to pay into the country’s expensive social security system and fund the pensions of older people, who are living longer than ever.
Experts say there is no one-size-fits-all explanation for why women around the world are having fewer children.
Beauchemin, the French lawyer, criticized the government’s focus on infertility as “reductive.” She wants to have a child in the near future, but says many in her generation do not because they are concerned about the cost of child care, the effect on their career and the risks caused by climate change.
“You have to make people want to have children. It’s not just a question of whether we have the mechanical and scientific ability to have them,” she said.
Still, the free tests may be useful — and less jarring — if offered to slightly older people, she said. “If right now I had the opportunity to go for a free fertility checkup, I would definitely do it,” she said.
Macron in his speech acknowledged that infertility is not the only reason fewer French are having children. “Morals are changing, we are having children later and later,” he said. Behind the country’s falling birthrate “are anxieties” and “perhaps choices made in the past,” he added, in what appeared to be a reference to cuts in child subsidies implemented by previous governments.
Millennials aren’t having kids. Here’s why.
Yet the message from the government urging people to have more children is “an injunction that will weigh first and foremost on women” and put focus on their choices, including their career prospects, Mailfert told the France TV channel.
“As soon as we talk about birthrates, the question immediately comes up: At what age do women have children, they have them too late, they prioritize their professional lives — in short, it really focuses on women,” she said.
Mailfert also accused Macron of misusing the language of wartime — he called in his speech for a “demographic rearmament” for the nation — for what is a profoundly personal and human decision. “Women don’t have children so that they can become soldiers,” she said. “And children are not weapons.”"
UHQY5MFH5Z_RV2113XGW2LIVLH,Biden’s age may be hurting him with independents in New Hampshire,Colby Itkowitz,"January 23, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/biden-age-new-hampshire-democratic-primary/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — When Claire Preece went to see Nikki Haley speak this week, the registered independent was still conflicted over whether she would vote in Tuesday’s Republican or Democratic primary. But she knew one thing for sure: Joe Biden is too old to earn her vote again.
“You know, you’ve done your job,” Preece said of Biden. “My goodness, it’s time. I retired from nursing when it just got to be too much. It’s done. You’ve done your part. … [Biden] needs to retire. He’s not appropriate anymore.”
Biden’s age comes up over and over again on the campaign trail among Trump-supporting Republicans, but also among independents who backed Biden in the last election and now feel he is too old to run again. For New Hampshire voters leaning toward voting for Haley, many cited her age — she’s 52 — as a major incentive.
1/5
Haley is most directly positioned to benefit from real concerns about Biden’s age in the Granite State, where independents can choose between the Republican and Democratic primaries. Voters here are worried about the president falling or another medical emergency, and they use words such as “old” and “tired” to describe him. Across the state at recent campaign events, many of them seemed interested in the former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina governor, who was described as part of a new generation.
Haley is leaning into that opening, stepping up attacks on Biden and Donald Trump, hitting them on their older ages. At all of her recent campaign events, she has said some variation of, “People don’t want two 80-year-olds running for president” — a line that often generates applause and laughter from the crowd. Haley will also often say that Vice President Harris will become president if the country reelects Biden, a not-so-subtle suggestion that he could die in office.
But it’s unclear how independents — who form roughly 30 percent of the American electorate — will behave in the general election if, as polls suggest, the matchup is ultimately between Biden and Trump.
Live updates on the New Hampshire primary election
Biden’s age has loomed over his reelection efforts, seemingly his biggest political vulnerability. Public polls consistently show voters, as many as 3 out of 4, believe he is too old to run the country for another four years. Since he first started running for president in 2019, Biden has often responded to concerns about his age with two words: “Watch me.”
In recent months, Biden has acknowledged that questions about his age are “totally legitimate,” but he has tried to defuse them with humor while also emphasizing his experience. Several months ago, Ben LaBolt, White House communications director, said about the attacks on Biden’s age: “No president has ever come to the job with more experience, and President Biden has leveraged that experience into a record of accomplishments that few presidents have matched.”
Brian Kearns, an independent from Rochester backing Haley, said he voted for Biden in 2020 but has “no idea” what he would do if faced with another rematch.
“His leadership has not been what I thought it would be,” Kearns said of Biden. “When he was vice president, he seemed more alert, a smart guy, [and now] you just don’t see that.”
Those sentiments were echoed by other New Hampshire independents, though some of them said they would back Biden over Trump if they end up facing each other in the general election.
Martina Kenny of Bedford, N.H., an independent planning to vote for Haley in the primary, voted for Biden four years ago and said she would again if her choice is between him and Trump. But if Haley were to win the GOP nomination, she said, she would probably vote for her because she is worried about Biden’s age.
“I guess my concern obviously would be [Biden’s] health, you know, that if anything ever happened, I mean, not to say that can’t happen to anybody, but as you get older, you’re more susceptible to falls and breaks and heart attacks,” Kenny said just before Haley spoke at a campaign event on Friday night. “I would be concerned about, you know, who’s going to take over if something ever happened to him. Nikki just seems, she’s young, she’s vibrant, she’s a fresh face, and we need that in this country.”
Roland Nutter and his wife, Debbie, from Pepperell, Mass., crossed state lines to attend a Haley event in Hollis, already big fans of hers. Nutter is a registered Republican but said he has not supported Trump in the last two elections. He doesn’t think Biden has done a bad job as a president but said, “My biggest concern is his age.”
“We need a younger generation,” Nutter said. “I thought we had passed a torch a while ago.”
The issue of Biden’s age is also central to Minnesota Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips’s sales pitch in his long-shot challenge to Biden in the Democratic primary. “At that stage of life, it is impossible ultimately to conduct, to prosecute the office of the American presidency in the way that this country in the world needs right now. That is an absolute truth,” he told Axios in a recent interview.
At a Phillips event on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Jane Levesque said she had switched to the Democratic Party because of Trump. She called Trump a “constant liar” and said she abhorred how he called his opponents names, such as when he referred to Biden as “Sleepy Joe.” But now, as Biden’s contemporary, she is concerned about his age.
“As an 82-year-old, I know what it’s like to be old and tired,” said Levesque, adding that she would be voting for Phillips.
Her husband, Adrian Levesque, 85, standing beside her at a Phillips event, said he shares his wife’s desire for someone new. He thought Haley could offer a fresh, badly needed perspective to the Republican Party.
“She’s young. She’s a new generation,” he said.
Several days ago, waiting to see Haley in person for the first time, Preece offered a similar assessment.
“We gotta get somebody who isn’t a heartbeat away from the casket,” she said.

UKDGH3VW0W_7J10M42QJ0WES4E,"Trump leads by wide margin in N.H. primary, Post-Monmouth poll finds",Dan Balz,"January 22, 2024 at 12:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/trump-leads-new-hampshire-post-monmouth-poll/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — With the contest for the Republican presidential nomination now a two-person race, Donald Trump holds a clear lead among New Hampshire voters over Nikki Haley, his last remaining challenger, ahead of Tuesday’s primary here, according to a Washington Post-Monmouth University poll.
The poll finds 52 percent of potential primary voters supporting Trump, while 34 percent are backing Haley. In the poll, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is at 8 percent, but the survey was completed before DeSantis delivered his surprise announcement Sunday that he was suspending his campaign.
1/5
Haley’s support has nearly doubled from 18 percent in November, appearing to benefit from the withdrawal of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie. But Trump’s support has grown by six percentage points over the same period. Trump may have benefited from the withdrawal and endorsement of entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and could gain more with the exit of DeSantis, who immediately endorsed Trump. If DeSantis’s supporters in the poll are allocated based on their second choice, Trump’s support rises by four points while Haley’s increases by two points.
Trump is buoyed by strong support from the party’s conservative base, while Haley has been consolidating support among moderates and independent voters who plan to participate in the GOP primary.
Live updates from the New Hampshire primary election
New Hampshire offers Haley the best opportunity to slow the momentum of the former president. Any independent, or unaffiliated, voter can participate in the Republican primary on Tuesday and she has been banking on a big turnout to boost her standing enough to genuinely challenge Trump. But there is little evidence that she has gained significant ground on Trump since her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses last Monday.
Trump’s supporters appear more committed to turning out than Haley’s do. While Trump leads Haley by 18 points among all potential voters, his advantage grows to 28 points among voters who say they are “extremely motivated” to vote in the Republican primary. Trump won the primary here eight years ago with 35 percent of the vote.
Haley’s favorability ratings have declined among New Hampshire potential GOP primary voters: 46 percent of them are favorable of the former U.N. ambassador, down from 56 percent in November.
Her unfavorable ratings have increased from 31 percent in November to 40 percent now, putting her at a net six points positive compared with a 25-point positive margin two months ago. The decline has come as Trump’s campaign has increasing attacked her, including a flurry of ads that are running constantly here.
Trump’s favorability rating is 23 points net positive, with 59 percent of New Hampshire Republican primary voters rating him favorably and 36 percent unfavorably, unmoved since November.
Detailed poll crosstabs here
New Hampshire’s undeclared voters, those who are not registered as Republicans, have often played significant roles in presidential primaries. They made up as many as 45 percent of primary voters in previous New Hampshire primaries and the Post-Monmouth poll finds 47 percent of potential Republican primary voters are not registered Republicans.
The Post-Monmouth poll finds that these undeclared voters support Haley over Trump by 10 points, 48 percent to 38 percent, an improvement for her since November. But Trump boasts a much larger 42-point lead among the 53 percent of the sample who are registered Republicans: 64 percent to 22 percent for Haley, essentially unmoved from November.
Haley’s advantage with undeclared voters will be key to her performance Tuesday, and other polls show varying estimates for her support. A Suffolk University/Boston Globe/NBC-10 poll taken Jan. 18 and 19 found similar results, with Haley leading by eight points among these voters, but a CNN-UNH poll in the field Jan. 16-19 found Haley leading by 28 points with this group.
New Hampshire’s relatively large share of moderate-to-liberal Republican voters also provides an opening for Haley. She has seen her share of the vote increase among this group from 35 percent in November to 56 percent in this most recent Post-Monmouth poll. But Haley is struggling with conservatives, who make up a larger portion of the potential electorate, with Trump enjoying a 68-point lead among very conservative voters and a 29-point lead among somewhat conservative voters.
About half of potential Republican voters in the New Hampshire primary believe the false idea that Biden won the 2020 election “due to voter fraud” (51 percent), while 42 percent say he won the election “fair and square.” That is a smaller percentage than among Iowa Republican caucus participants who said Biden was not legitimately elected, but it is still a reminder of how Trump’s lies about the 2020 election have infected the attitudes of Republicans.
Those who believe false claims of voter fraud continue to be Trump’s strongest supporters, with 82 percent backing him for the party’s nomination and only 14 percent saying they support Haley and DeSantis. Those who believe Biden won the election fairly support Haley by a large margin: 71 percent compared with 14 percent for Trump.
About a quarter of potential GOP voters in New Hampshire (26 percent) say Trump committed a crime in his response to the 2020 presidential election. Another 27 percent say he “did something wrong but not criminal,” and 45 percent say he “did nothing wrong.”
Trump leads Haley on trust to handle four different issues among New Hampshire GOP voters. He enjoys the widest margin on trust to handle immigration policy (62 percent to 26 percent), which has been a focus of Trump’s attacks against Haley. He also enjoys a big advantage on economic policy (58 percent to 29 percent).
Trump has a wide margin over Haley, who served as his U.N. ambassador, on trust to handle foreign policy (57 percent to 32 percent). Their closest issue is abortion: 40 percent prefer Trump and 29 percent prefer Haley, while 22 percent say they trust both equally.
New Hampshire Republican primary voters are relatively more liberal on abortion than Republicans elsewhere. That is a potential opening for Haley, who strongly opposes abortion but has urged Republicans to find a better way to talk about the issue at a time when Democrats have been successful in painting the party as extreme on the issue.
Over half of potential Republican voters in the state (56 percent) say they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with 43 percent who said the same in a Post-Ipsos-538 poll of likely Republican voters nationwide in December. The Post-Monmouth poll found that 54 percent of New Hampshire Republican voters say they are at least somewhat concerned the Republican Party is focusing too much on abortion.
GOP voters in New Hampshire who think abortion should be mostly or always legal support Haley over Trump by 49 percent to 38 percent. Among those who think abortion should be mostly or always illegal, Trump has 72 percent support to Haley’s 14.
Looking at other demographic groups, Trump maintains a similar lead among both men and women. He maintains a 33-point lead among voters without four-year college degrees, down from 46 points in November. Haley fares better among college graduates with 43 percent, but Trump is nearly even with her at 39 percent support among this group.
Trump has a 52-point lead among White evangelical Christians, but still has a 10-point lead among those who are not.
Fewer than 1 in 4 New Hampshire Republican voters say they were personally contacted to vote for a particular candidate (23 percent), down from 49 percent who said the same in a 2016 Monmouth poll. Of those who were contacted, more say they heard from Haley’s campaign than any other.
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) enjoys 74 percent approval among Republican voters, but that does not translate into much more support for Haley. Just 10 percent of potential GOP voters say his endorsement of her candidacy makes them more likely to support the former South Carolina governor.
This Washington Post-Monmouth University poll of 712 potential voters in New Hampshire’s Republican primary was conducted Jan. 16-20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. The sample was drawn from a database of New Hampshire registered voters who were registered as Republicans or undeclared; potential voters include those who say they are certain, probable or have a 50-50 chance of voting in the Republican primary. Interviews were completed by live callers on cellphones and landlines, as well as through an online survey via cellphone text invitation.

Schatz wants to send Israel a message,Leigh Ann Caldwell,"January 26, 2024 at 6:23 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/sen-schatz-wants-send-israel-message/,"Good morning, Early Birds. Karma is the breeze in our hair on the weekend. See you on Monday. Tips: earlytips@washpost.com. Was this forwarded to you? Sign up here. Thanks for waking up with us.
In today’s edition … Trump knocks border talks again; pro-Ukraine conservatives hit back ... Biden sticks close to Washington for many events … but first …
🚨: The International Court of Justice will soon issue a ruling on South Africa’s request for provisional measures in its genocide case against Israel, our colleagues Claire Parker and Emily Rauhala report: “Friday’s decision will not be a verdict on the question of genocide — that could take years. Rather, the court could issue what are called “provisional measures” ordering, say, a cease-fire, or for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza — or not. Whatever the outcome Friday, the ICJ case has added to international pressure on Israel to scale back or end its war against Hamas, which health officials in Gaza say has killed more than 26,000 people — most of them women and children.”
Eight questions for … Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii): Schatz plans to offer an amendment to an impending national security supplemental that would reiterate the U.S. position favoring a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Forty-nine Democrats have signed on to the measure. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and all Senate Republicans have not.
We spoke with Schatz about the measure’s purpose and if Democrats' symbolic messages to Israel are making a difference. This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.
The Early: Isn’t a two-state solution already U.S. policy?
Schatz: It reiterates that that’s United States policy, and five or 10 years ago, this wouldn’t have been necessary. But two things have changed. The first obviously is October 7, and all the death and destruction on both sides that is tearing the country asunder and causing people to lose hope. And the second is the prime minister’s recent statements, I think, demand a response.
Editor’s note: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected the prospect of a Palestinian state on Saturday, saying, “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of the Jordan [River].”
The Early: Netanyahu's comments over the weekend aren't much different than what he has said for a long time.
Schatz: No, but the timing and the context I think were unusually provocative. He didn’t have to say what he said when he said it. People are hanging on all of our every words as it relates to this conflict. I think everybody has to remain open minded at the tactical level, about how to get there, but absolutely determined that the only way this ends well is for two peoples to be able to live side by side with peace and security.
The Early: It seems, though, that the Israeli people actually don’t want to talk about a two-state solution right now either.
Schatz: Look, the country was traumatized. If I were an Israeli citizen, I can imagine that the only thing I’d be thinking about is making sure Hamas was not in a position to ever do this again, and getting those hostages home. And so the idea that an organized, murderous attack on more than 1,000 citizens could precipitate a diplomatic solution is really hard to swallow. So I understand that in terms of the sequence of events that it's not time to talk about that.
But the prime minister put this question on the table and I think it's important for everybody to remember that the prime minister is an important person in this conversation, but he is not the final arbiter of what may or may not happen. This is going to be a multilateral process. And American objectives matter here.
The Early: This weekend, there’s going to be a conference in Israel devoted to building settlements in the West Bank. Can your resolution or the U.S. in general have any sort of impact on that action?
Schatz: I can't predict how it will impact the conference this weekend. But I will say that the illegal settlements and settler violence sets the cause of Israel back and is both morally and strategically untenable. It simply has to stop. If you are an Israeli who wants peace and stability, you have to get these illegal settlements under control and allow Palestinians who are minding their own business to continue to mind their own business. There's no strategic justification for it. There is no historical justification for it. This is just people taking land with either violence or the threat of violence.
The Early: Does President Biden need to do more to pressure Israel?
Schatz: At the beginning, the sort of ‘hug Bibi’ strategy was the only one available to us. Because if had we tried to intervene and threaten or talk them out of it, it was a nation traumatized and they were not prepared to listen to anybody about how to protect their own citizens.
But time has passed, and conditions on the ground for Palestinians are horrific, and international public opinion is going in the wrong direction as it relates to Israel and so I think it's time to recalibrate. Israel is telling us that they're going to change the nature of the offensive operations. But we haven't seen that yet. And for me, the hug Bibi strategy only works if Bibi wants to be hugged.
The Early: There’s a growing sentiment among Democrats that is being expressed through resolutions like this one. But there seems to be no real widespread effort to change the $14 billion funding request on the table. Why?
Schatz: I don’t think we’re there yet. I’m not there. I think we ought to use our leverage as friends. I think we ought to communicate directly with our allies. But I’m not suggesting that we pull aid from Israel. And I think there are very few people in the Congress who take that position.
But there's already been a sea change and a recognition that to be an ally and a friend of Israel is not to give them a blank check for whatever they want to do, because sometimes they take actions that are not in their own country's best interests. It's our job to talk our friends back into a strategy that will work for them.
The Early: Is that possible without conditioning or limiting money?
Schatz: I think so. But I think it takes two to tango. We recognize their sovereign rights to conduct foreign policy as they see fit, but we are not silent partners here that just provide the resources for whatever they may want to do. We do have a say here, and it is in no one’s interest to allow the continued suffering of Palestinians — and it is certainly in no one’s interest to foreclose the possibility, remote as it may be, of [a] more hopeful, more peaceful future. And that’s what the two-state solution is about.
The Early: Isn’t the United States right now a silent partner if it sends $14 billion of aid to Israel?
Schatz: I don’t think it’s fair to say that [Secretary of State] Tony Blinken or the president or [national security adviser] Jake Sullivan or [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin haven't expressed their views. They've been pretty aggressive publicly, and privately. I think it's fair to say that that Israel is not always listening to our good advice.
Former president Donald Trump again urged Republicans to reject any border deal, writing on Truth Social last night that the legislation being finalized by a trio of bipartisan negotiators in the Senate “will be meaningless.” He wrote that the “ONLY HOPE” to secure the border is “to vote for TRUMP2024!”
This is the second time in just over a week Trump publicly slammed the border negotiations, continuing to undercut the talks even as he focuses his reelection campaign on the influx of migrants to the border.
Trump’s influence over the border talks is growing now that he is the likely Republican presidential nominee, a sentiment Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged earlier this week in a closed-door meeting. With Trump’s support, right-wing media had been trying to undercut a deal for the past couple of weeks. But now there are calls from some conservative corners to keep working toward a border deal and Ukraine aid.
The next 72 hours will be crucial for the fate of a border deal and Ukraine aide.
National security adviser Jake Sullivan will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi today and on Saturday in Bangkok, according to a National Security Council spokeswoman. The meeting, first reported by the Financial Times, follow Biden’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in November in Woodside, Calif., during which the two leaders agreed to take steps to repair their countries’ relationship.
White House Bureau Chief Toluse Olorunnipa files this week’s notebook:
Biden has long talked about his desire to spend the second half of his first term traveling the country to tout his legislative accomplishments. He and his aides have often fallen back on a well-worn complaint about how the political battles and negative sentiment a president faces in Washington are not reflective of what’s happening in “the real world” outside the Beltway.
But often for Biden, getting “out of Washington” does not mean going very far at all.
On Tuesday, he held a joint campaign rally with Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden and Second Gentlemen Doug Emhoff focused on abortion. The location: Manassas, Va., less than an hour’s drive from the White House.
The rally crowd featured several abortion rights activists and other supporters, including many familiar faces to Biden — including longtime D.C. political figures and organizers who made the trek out to Manassas for the event.
It’s only the most recent example of the president venturing just barely outside the Beltway as he balances his desire to travel with the demands — and massive footprint — of the presidency.
Biden has traveled to Maryland and Virginia dozens of times since taking office, far outpacing his travel to most other states. Biden’s trips have been notable for his use of nearby locales to promote his own policies.
In December, he traveled to Bethesda, Md., twice. Not counting his trips to Camp David and Joint Base Andrews, Biden traveled to Maryland at least 11 times in 2023. The state was tied with Pennsylvania for the president’s second-most traveled states (behind his home state of Delaware). Those trips included visits to Baltimore to tout infrastructure and Lanham, Md., to needle the GOP over debt.
Biden, who traveled to Virginia at least seven times in 2023, has done fundraisers, wreath-layings and troop visits in the state.
One benefit of the close-to-home approach: It often allows Biden to travel without having to power up Air Force One, and lets him get back to the Oval Office quickly for additional meetings. It can also make it easier to coordinate joint appearances, like Tuesday’s in Manassas, since top officials spend most of their time in Washington.
Campaign officials said the Virginia location was resonant because the state’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, had sought to prove last year that a 15-week abortion restriction was a commonsense position backed by a majority of voters. Youngkin’s party lost several seats in the November legislative agenda, and Democrats captured control of the House of Delegates.
Still, as the 2024 campaign heats up, political pressures may force Biden to venture further outside the Beltway. Many key swing states expected to be up for grabs in November are far beyond D.C.’s suburbs.

UOZQ2KONBT_CIILSR4DKC9VT1Y,There is now even less uncertainty that Republicans want to nominate Trump,Philip Bump,"January 24, 2024 at 4:34 p.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/24/there-is-now-even-less-uncertainty-that-republicans-want-nominate-trump/,"Given how Donald Trump has solidified Republican support over the past eight years, it’s easy to forget how rocky the path was to his first nomination.
Trump lost Iowa in 2016 before winning New Hampshire. In neither race did he get a majority; in fact, he barely got more than a third of the vote in New Hampshire. He had more opponents, yes, but he still didn’t beat 50 percent in any state until mid-April 2016. That was in his then home state, New York.
For a while, there was speculation that Trump would fail to get the delegates he needed before the convention, meaning a potential fight on the convention floor. (This is why he originally brought in now-disgraced aide Paul Manafort to manage the delegate fight.) That didn’t happen, mostly because Republican voters coalesced around his candidacy.

This year is different. Trump got a majority of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire. In the former, there were several other major candidates still in the race — more than when he won New York in 2016, in fact. In the latter, he only faced one major candidate, but that race should carry an asterisk when using it as a measure of Republican support.
To summarize all of this succinctly: Trump’s Iowa and New Hampshire finishes are not a robust indicator of weakness.
I wrote about Iowa last week, when observers kept pointing to his low vote total to suggest that it was a warning sign for November. That doesn’t seem to be accurate, for the reasons I explained then. So let’s look instead at New Hampshire.
Suffolk University, polling for USA Today and the Boston Globe, repeatedly polled the New Hampshire race over the course of the month. During that time, three major candidates dropped out: former New Jersey governor Chris Christie; biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy; and, two days before the primary, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a result, Trump and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, his only remaining GOP opponent, gained support.
According to Suffolk’s polls, Trump gained it faster after the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses, presumably because Ramaswamy’s and DeSantis’s bases of support preferred him to Haley.
The actual results, though, were narrower than that last Suffolk poll. (They were closer to the final 538 polling average.) This suggests that Suffolk’s estimates of who would turn out might have been off, with the pollster assuming a more Trump-friendly electorate.
What might have been missed? Perhaps the large number of non-Republicans who participated Tuesday.
According to exit polling from Edison Research, only about half of those who voted in the Republican primary Tuesday identified as Republicans. The rest self-identified as independents or Democrats. Those non-Republicans made up a much larger chunk of the turnout in Iowa; there, entrance polls estimated that 8 in 10 voters were self-identified Republicans.
The breakdown of voter identification and support measured by Edison Research looks like this. The size of each pie chart is scaled to the percent of all voters in the contest.
Two things might jump out here. The first is that Haley’s percentage among those self-identified independents in New Hampshire was way higher than in Iowa — and, again, that chunk of voters was far larger than in the previous week’s caucuses. The second is that Trump’s support among Republicans in New Hampshire was about equal to his support plus DeSantis’s in Iowa.
That’s not a clean bit of arithmetic, certainly. Trump’s New Hampshire support might have been expected to be close to how he, DeSantis and Ramaswamy did in Iowa, but it was well short of that. Nonetheless, in Iowa and New Hampshire, at least three-quarters of his support came from Republicans. While a similar percentage of Haley’s Iowa support came from Republicans, 7 in 10 of her New Hampshire votes came from people who said they weren’t Republicans.
The 538 national polling average now indicates that Trump is the preferred candidate of 7 in 10 Republican primary voters. This is well above where he was at any point in 2016, when he never reached 50 percent in national polling averages. It also is roughly where he landed among Republicans in New Hampshire.
No candidate is a perfect fit for every voter — even Trump. Republicans may have liked Trump and DeSantis but preferred the Florida governor’s policies. But his departure meant Trump was likely to benefit. That’s how the primary process works, and that was a reason that the former president’s support in Iowa was just above 50 percent.
The primary is also about the Republican Party picking its presidential nominee. While the narrowed field in New Hampshire was closer than polling predicted (and certainly closer than Trump wanted), it doesn’t reflect particularly soft Republican support for Trump.
Trump was polling at 47 percent in RealClearPolitics’s last polling average in May 2016. Just over eight months later, he was president.
Trump and Biden won their respective New Hampshire primary elections. Here are the results, biggest takeaways and what exit polls showed.

As you’re playing that Carrie Underwood song again in Spotify’s app, imagine seeing a half-price promotion for a digital music subscription.
It doesn’t yet exist on your iPhone. So far, Apple hasn’t let you see a Spotify sale offer like that.
Imagine downloading one app that lets you play a bunch of games like “Candy Crush” and “World of Warcraft.” Xbox made an iPhone app like that, but Apple never let you try it. Instead you download and pay for each game app separately.
What you can and can’t do with your apps is dictated by Apple and Google rule books that are longer than the U.S. Constitution.
The companies say their control gives you one place to find apps while protecting you from bad apps that could steal your money or your personal information. (Their protections are good but imperfect.)
Those rules also help Apple and Google steer the internet economy and generate more than $40 billion in yearly revenue from their app stores.
Apps are so handy, and Apple and Google demand so much silence, that it’s hard to know what money-saving deals or imaginative ideas you might be missing.
Now, because of legal changes starting to bubble up for Europeans and Americans, you can start to glimpse an alternative app reality.
Those first glimmers, including complicated changes that Apple announced Thursday for iPhone users in the European Union, won’t immediately and dramatically change your app experiences.
Eventually, though, you could have more options to download apps, pay less to buy digital stuff from apps and use features that weren’t possible before. Or very little might change, because Apple and Google won’t loosen their iron grip without a fight.
If you’re in the United States and have an Android phone, peek at Spotify’s app. It was one of the first Android apps to give you a side-by-side choice when you make a digital purchase.
You can tap to buy a Spotify subscription by paying Google — which is how you might buy other app things like special levels in “Candy Crush.” Or you can tap a different button to enter your credit card information and buy the subscription from Spotify.
If you buy with Spotify, the first month of your subscription is free. If you pay Google, you get a different deal for new subscribers and accumulate rewards points to redeem for stuff like freebies in other apps. It’s your call.
In Spotify’s iPhone app, you can’t buy anything — you’ll see no discounts, nada.
The Spotify app choice in Android may not wow you, but it’s a crack in the app store status quo.
Consider that you can buy a blender from many different stores. But if you want to download an app, you have been able to get it only from Apple or Google, with some complicated exceptions.
And generally if you have bought something digital from an app — a streaming video subscription, an online fitness class or an audiobook — you’ve had to buy it from Apple or Google.
(If that purchase is a physical good like a DVD, an in-person fitness class or a paperback book, Apple and Google have nothing to do with it.)
It works this way because Apple said so 15 years ago, Google mostly followed and they stuck to it even as lines have blurred between the virtual and physical worlds.
Apple is now being forced to let people in the European Union download iPhone apps from places other than the official app store. That’s a first. Apple emphasized, with some justification, that this could be risky for you.
In Europe and the United States, Apple has proposed for the first time to let you click a link in apps like Spotify to buy subscriptions or other digital goods from Spotify’s website.
One problem: Apple’s proposals so far are so unappealing to some app makers that none of these app changes might happen. We’ll see if regulators push back.
For iPhone users anywhere in the world, you might be able to play a bunch of games from one app, as Xbox tried to offer several years ago. (Several app companies I spoke with were confused how Apple’s proposal to comply with new laws might affect their apps or you.)
Android app rules will change, too, under the same European law and as a result of a proposed legal settlement and court verdict reached last month in the United States. In America, for example, Google has proposed giving all apps the choice — as Spotify did under a special arrangement — to give you side-by-side payment options.
Apple and Google aren’t giving up their app control or their $40 billion annual app haul.
Some app makers have howled, including on Thursday, that Apple and Google are twisting legally mandated app changes to their benefit. They say Apple and Google are not giving you real choices to download apps or cheaper options to pay for digital stuff. Some Apple and Google critics worry that the companies will further enrich themselves and have more, not less, control over your apps.
I can’t predict how this will shake out for you. But after years of app dysfunction, any changes — no matter how messy and imperfect — feel like the potential beginnings of a fresh app spring."

The U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. announced the arrests on Thursday, saying in a statement that Jayvon Thomas, 20, and Lavar Hunter, 19, both from Maryland, were each charged with first-degree murder while armed.
The charges stem from a shooting of Anwar Wingate, 24, that occurred Nov. 19 in the 2100 block of 8th Street NW, near the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. Prosecutors described Wingate as a professional boxer who went by the name “The Silent Assassin.”
Prosecutors said in a statement that Wingate was “shot in the neck after he tried to fight off the two men who were able to get the jump on him by catching him off guard.” Authorities said police arrested both men in Maryland on Wednesday.
Records filed in D.C. Superior Court show a magistrate judge ordered Thomas and Hunter detained and set a hearing date for Feb. 2. Prosecutors said both men pleaded not guilty.

The electric-vehicle maker ushered in steep price cuts to maintain demand throughout 2023, resulting in 38 percent growth in vehicle deliveries that hardly translated into additional revenue, prompting worry from investors and analysts.
On Wednesday, Tesla reported quarterly results that missed analysts’ expectations, including annual revenue that grew by merely 3 percent despite significantly higher sales volume, and a forecast for a potential “notably lower growth rate” than in 2023 as it invests in a next-generation vehicle it says it will begin building in 2025.
EV transition cools as demand slows and automakers trim production
Meanwhile,  Musk is asking for more control over the company after drawing down a significant portion of his Tesla stock amid his purchase of Twitter in 2022.
“Tesla is currently between two major growth waves,” Musk told investors Wednesday. The company is preparing to ship a new iteration of its driver-assistance system, he said, and is making progress toward its next vehicle.
Wall Street observers expected better news out of the earnings call. Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities, said executives failed to address short-term concerns, even though he remains sold on the company’s long-term value.
“We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure and fluctuating demand. … instead we got a high-level Tesla long-term view with another train wreck conference call,” Ives wrote Thursday.
The company’s falling margins and “constant never-ending price cuts” are concerns, Ives wrote.
Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, said the company’s outlook gave investors pause.
“This was the most sobering guidance I’ve seen from Tesla,” he said.
Want to try an EV? Rentals are getting cheaper.
Musk also faced questions about his public demand for 25 percent of the company’s voting shares. Musk said Wednesday he wants the power to resist activist investors who may have “strange ideas” about how to run Tesla.
“I don’t want to control it, but if I have so little influence over the company at that stage, I could sort of be booted out by some random shareholder advisory firm,” Musk said.
Tesla laid out other plans for 2024 on the call, including rolling out the latest version of its Full Self-Driving Beta software, the company’s advanced driver-assistance system, to around 400,000 users.
But the company has faced new challenges with regulators when it comes to its driver-assistance software, Autopilot, which can maneuver its vehicles from highway on-ramp to off-ramp, maintaining a set distance and speed and even making lane changes. Full Self-Driving brings those capabilities to surface streets, allowing the vehicles to navigate from point to point, following road signs and making turns. Drivers must pay full attention at all times while using the software.
Tesla agreed last month to recall 2 million vehicles, nearly every car it has produced, over concerns that Autopilot did not adequately safeguard against driver misuse. The recall, conducted via a remote update, followed a series of meetings with regulators in late 2023 amid a larger investigation into Autopilot.
Days before the recall was announced, The Washington Post published an investigation identifying at least eight fatal or serious crashes involving Autopilot in locations where the software was not intended to be used."

“When companies sneak hidden junk fees into families’ bills, it can take hundreds of dollars a month out of their pockets,” President Biden said in a statement last week. “That might not matter to the wealthy, but it’s real money to hardworking families — and it’s just plain wrong.”
Most Americans agree; data from Pew Charitable Trusts released in June shows that 84 percent of people surveyed told pollsters that the government should do something to bring down overdraft fees, and 54 percent wanted the government to take action on other bank fees as well.
Unfortunately, good politics don’t necessarily make good policy. And I’m worried this move might end up hurting some of the very people it’s supposed to help: low-income Americans on the fringes of the banking system.
These people are far and away the heaviest users of bank overdrafts. The Financial Health Network, a personal finance nonprofit, says the group most likely to overdraft includes “financially vulnerable” households that struggle to pay their bills every month and typically make less than $30,000 a year. Almost half of financially vulnerable households with checking accounts overdrafted in 2022, and of that group, two-thirds overdrafted at least three times, one-third did so six or more times, and one-fifth overdrafted 10 times or more. With an average overdraft fee of $26.61, hundreds of dollars in fees can land on the most cash-strapped customers. Capping those fees — possibly as low as $3 —  would be a huge boon to families who really need the help. Who could oppose that?
Well, as with any nice-sounding policy, it’s important to consider the alternatives, both for the customer and for the banker.
For depositors, overdraft fees can be an expensive alternative to even worse options, such as payday loans or having their electricity shut off (and paying a reconnection fee to turn it back on). And “the best of bad alternatives” can also be sort of true for bankers, who must find some way to defray the cost of providing what is basically an unsecured loan to people who are, as we’ve seen, often financially struggling and might be unable to repay the money. The fees also help pay for “free” checking (which costs banks quite a bit of money to provide).
If we cap overdraft fees, how will banks make up the lost revenue?
From profits, you say, and fair enough, but Patrick McKenzie, who writes the Bits About Money newsletter, points out that the reason your bank is so obsessed with getting you to sign up for paperless statements is that the profit margins on checking accounts are so thin, they can be meaningfully improved by saving the cost of 12 stamps a year. “Margins on small bank accounts are very thin,” he wrote recently, and “credit losses can easily be larger than several years of them.”
Now the government wants to make those accounts even less profitable. It seems possible banks would look to limit their losses by getting rid of those customers or making up the revenue somewhere else — or possibly both. This seems to have happened in the past, judging from what we saw when federal regulators preempted some state fee caps in 2001. According to researchers from the New York Fed, the exempted banks both raised overdraft fees and expanded available overdraft credit, while lowering minimum balance requirements. The rate at which checks were returned for insufficient funds declined by 15 percent. And the share of low-income households with a bank account rose by 10 percent, suggesting that minimum balance requirements had kept those households from opening accounts.
That doesn’t mean that no one would benefit from this rule. High overdraft fees can also deter people from opening a bank account, and it’s possible that effect would outweigh any contraction of credit. The financial industry has also changed a lot since 2001, with nonbank alternatives, such as Cash App, that might offer the marginal bank customer a better replacement than an old-fashioned check-cashing store. But there would still likely be winners and losers, and I don’t know whether the former’s gains would outweigh the latter’s losses. I’m not sure the administration does, either."

They’re just chilling.",Kelsey Ables,"January 23, 2024 at 4:45 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/23/frozen-alligators-water-brumation-hibernation/,"In the muggy months, the alligators of the American South are on the prowl, known to lurk in swimming pools and terrify suburban neighborhoods — but when the temperature drops, they’re just chilling. Literally.
After much of the United States plunged into a freeze last week, gators in North Carolina and Texas have been spotted in their coolest winter look: submerged under ice, with just their snouts poking out to breathe. Videos of the “gator-cicles,” as the staff of a North Carolina park called them on social media, are circulating widely online, sparking amazement, fear and intrigue in brumation — the reptilian version of hibernation.
In a video posted this week that shows menacing-looking alligators beneath the frozen surface, a staff member from the Swamp Park in Ocean Isle Beach, N.C., said that when it gets cold enough for the water to ice over, the gators “will instinctively tilt their nose up, to the point where it’s out of the water, so they don’t just suffocate.”
“Think of it as a cute little danger snorkel,” he said.
Alligator missing top half of its jaw is recovering at Fla. gator park
The organization, which cares for rescued alligators — or swamp puppies, as they are known in the South — later posted another video showing a gator slowly but surely “starting to ‘thaw’ out.”
A widely viewed video posted last week by TikTok user Eddie Hanhart shows another partially frozen alligator at the Gator Country sanctuary in Beaumont, Tex. “We bundle up but this is what the American alligator does,” he said in the video. “See he knew he was gonna freeze last night, so what he does is he went and found him a nice comfy spot.”
Reptiles such as alligators — which can be found as far north as North Carolina and as far west as eastern Texas — go into brumation in the winter months. Only coldblooded animals — such as turtles, snakes and frogs — brumate, a state that is similar to hibernation but different in certain ways, including that coldblooded animals will move around on warmer winter days because they depend on the environment for temperature regulation.
“For example, you might spot a lizard out on a rock during January, getting some sun to warm itself,” the University of Texas at Austin’s Biodiversity Center explains on its website.
Eric Nordberg, who heads the Reptile Ecology and Environmental Disturbance lab at the University of New England in Australia, wrote in an email that during brumation, reptiles or amphibians “reduce their body temperature (which is tightly linked to environmental temperatures), heart rate, breathing, [and] metabolic rates.” In doing so, they conserve energy “when they cannot be foraging, moving around, or mating due to the cold temperatures.”
Some alligators create mudholes for shelter on colder days, but the Swamp Park in North Carolina explained by email that their alligators are in enclosed sanctuaries, so they don’t have mudholes to go to. Instead, they make do in the water.
As the park wrote on social media, “the key to life is adaptation.” (Swamp Park also made headlines in 2018 when its alligators were spotted in brumation during a cold snap.)
Brumation behaviors “greatly depend on how extreme and long the cold temperatures persist in the environment,” Nordberg said. Alligators in Texas are considered “mostly inactive” from mid-October until early March, according to Texas Parks and Wildlife.
When the alligators eventually emerge from brumation, they are lethargic, like they’ve waked from a long slumber. And — not unlike many of us after the winter months — cold reptiles are “very slow and unable to do much of anything” until they warm up, Nordberg said, “mostly by basking in the sun.”"

VHSC1P7RZM_7PEUHWYNEC3BX66,"With Rupee Beer, two brothers are trying to put the India back in IPA",_,"January 25, 2024 at 12:00 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/01/25/rupee-beer-indian-ipa/,"When brothers Van and Sumit Sharma opened Rupee Beer Company in March 2020, they understood there would be a certain expectation among American drinkers. They anticipated it when they named the brewery after the currency of their parents’ native India, designed the labels featuring that moniker in elegant Hindi script, and started serving it in their family’s Portland, Maine-area Indian restaurants.
In fact, when the Sharmas are pouring Rupee at tastings and festivals, they hear the assumption uttered aloud. “It happens all the time,” says Sumit Sharma. “People come over and say, ‘I can’t wait to try your IPA.’”
Perhaps the tipplers can be forgiven for jumping to conclusions. The IPA, shorthand for India pale ale, has long been the dominant craft beer style in the United States, guzzling a 46 percent share of dollar sales in the craft segment, according to Chicago-based market research firm IRI, with amber ales, seasonals and wheats tied for second with just 10 percent apiece. Odds are, if you’re in line for a craft beer anywhere in this country, it’ll be a strong, hoppy IPA.
So, imagine twice the confusion when Rupee patrons sip the Sharmas’ flagship beer and taste a much lighter and less potent lager.
They shouldn’t be shocked. By and large, beer drinkers in India don’t opt for IPAs; they drink lagers. The country’s most popular domestic beer is Kingfisher, a pale European-style lager in the vein of Budweiser or Heineken, which are also among India’s top-selling brands overall. The Sharmas purposefully set out to brew a sweeter and smoother craft lager, with imported basmati rice instead of the usual barley, to complement the powerful flavors of the traditional Indian dishes on their parents’ restaurant menus.
By contrast, India pale ale has virtually nothing to do with the culture and tastes of its namesake: It was a colonial British export meant for troops stationed in the jewel of their South Asian empire. For that matter, the IPAs that have recently conquered the New World — both the bitter hop-forward West Coast versions that ignited the Craft Beer Revolution and the hazier, juicier New England style that has risen to power — taste nothing like those original ales that Brits shipped to the subcontinent.
This misunderstanding is not lost on the Sharmas — and it also represented an opportunity. In November, to commemorate Diwali, the brothers released Rupee’s first India pale ale, designed to taste more like the original English ales that were shipped to the colonies. The move was partly a response to market demands and to grow the Rupee brand and portfolio. But as third-culture kids with connections to both India (where their parents are from) and England (where Van was born), running a brewery in the U.S., the Sharmas also understand that they are uniquely positioned to reclaim this part of their culture.
“We put the history on the can, making sure we present the beer in an impactful way,” says Van Sharma. “We’re telling the world, ‘This is Rupee,' while also helping educate people on the history of the British Empire.”
Beer in its present state is a European innovation. The Sumerians are thought to have invented brewing 10,000 years ago, and there is evidence of the practice bubbling up independently in ancient civilizations from China to the Southwest U.S., but the lagers, ales, porters and stouts we drink today are derived from styles established in Europe — and they came to most of us via colonization.
The problem the British were facing in the early 1700s was how to get their beer in drinking condition to their far-flung colonists. Brewers knew that ale would turn sour in casks on the four-month ocean voyage through tropical and equatorial heat en route to Asia. They also understood that spoilage could be mitigated by boosting the amount of alcohol and hops, the bittering agent that also acts as a preservative. But that boost alone wasn’t enough to result in a hoppy pale ale; most of the beer being shipped eastward was darker porter, the libation of the British working and soldiering class. “Over time, the beers being taken to India evolved,” says food and beverage writer Ruvani de Silva. “The recipes were finessed into something lighter and better suited to the heat.”
Still, there was not one specific type of ale bound for Bombay or Calcutta. British beer historian and author Martyn Cornell says various ales made by multiple brewers were referred to generally as “pale ale for India” or “pale ale prepared for the East and West India climate.” It wasn’t until around 1835 that an advertisement for East London’s Bow Brewery “East India Pale Ale,” appears in the record, indicating that a taste for this type of beer had come home to Britain (it never sold well in civilian India).
The love affair was tepid and relatively short-lived. English IPAs never eclipsed the popularity of other bitter beers, like mild ales and the classic English bitter, which was essentially a more affordable version of IPA. By the time World War I spurred a government cap on brewing and increased taxation on beer proportionate to its alcohol content, the stronger, pricier IPA as Brits had come to know it all but vanished.
Those three letters didn’t return to beer-vernacular prominence until the early 1980s in Washington State’s Yakima Valley, where homebrewer and craft beer pioneer Bert Grant was about to start a revolution with his locally (over) hopped ale. “It was the template for a boom in very hoppy beers,” says Cornell. “Grant called it an IPA. No one who knew any better was there to correct him.”
When the Sharmas tasked master brewer and consultant Alan Pugsley of Pugsley Brewing Projects International with creating their Rupee IPA, he drew on his personal experience at the famed Ringwood Brewery in the Southern England county of Hampshire in the early 1980s. “Due to my English heritage and their heritage, I set out to make a traditional English IPA,” he says. “It’s a lost style, like many classics, in the U.S.”
They call the result an English-Indian IPA, a beer that is not overwhelmingly bitter or strong (only 5.6 percent alcohol by volume; many American IPAs check in at 7 percent and above). The hops feature more in the aroma, which yields to a pleasant, balanced sweetness and a smooth finish that, like all Rupee beers, is designed to pair well with spicy vindaloo and chana masala.
On the back of the can, which is available in four-packs at various national chains, including Total Wine, and at independent stores and Indian restaurants in 14 East Coast states, the Sharma brothers tell the true story of the style, closing with the proclamation that “Rupee is putting the India back in India Pale Ale!” They acknowledge it’s a bold claim in a country where some drinkers may not know what “IPA” stands for.
“There’s this sort of disconnect in thinking of IPA as British and American,” says de Silva, who is of South Asian descent. “It’s not necessarily a pleasant connection with the subcontinent. Colonizing, stripping the land of its assets, terrorizing and massacring the population. When we see the story of IPA, it has a double-edged meaning. Rupee is trying to tell this story while incorporating Indian cultural history.”
In many ways, Rupee’s mere existence is a stand against the Western beer establishment. According to an audit conducted by the Brewers Association, which represents craft breweries in the U.S., only 2 percent of craft breweries are owned by people of Asian descent. Rupee is not only a presence infusing Indian culture into American beer, it’s also a beacon for South Asian emigrants who want to see themselves in the products they consume.
“They represent our values,” says Ankit Desai, owner of Uncorked Wine & Spirits, which operates six stores in the Washington, D.C. area and carries Rupee. “South Asians own a lot of wine and beer stores. I’m Indian. I come from that culture. A lot of our clientele is South Asian. We promote the brands we feel connected to.”
Thus far, the promotion seems to have paid off. Less than a month after Rupee released its IPA, Sumit reported that the company had already sold out of preorders. The instant popularity has pushed the Sharmas to make the style they expected to be a seasonal Diwali release a year-round flagship alongside their original lager. And the brothers say the place they’ve seen the biggest splash is in Indian restaurants.
“Our on-premise vendors are saying that their Caucasian customers have been asking for an IPA,” says Sumit. “This product has filled a void.”"

Hours later, Transportation Minister Hisham Arafat resigned, according to a cabinet statement.
The National Railway Authority said in a statement that the blaze erupted after the train struck a concrete barrier at Ramses Station, in central Cairo. The train’s fuel tank apparently exploded, creating a huge ball of flames that engulfed the platforms and nearby buildings.
Egypt’s prosecutor general said Wednesday evening that a preliminary investigation indicated that a fight between two train conductors caused the crash.
The conductor of the train that crashed had stepped off it, without applying the hand brake, to confront a conductor who was blocking the way with his rail car, Nabil Sadek said in a statement.
“The driver left the rail car without taking any measures to put on the brakes,” Sadek said.
Images on Egyptian television and social media showed heavy plumes of black smoke rising from the station as ambulances and fire engines arrived.
Surveillance-camera videos that later circulated on social media revealed the chaos inside the station. One video showed a massive ball of flames engulfing a platform as passengers fled. A man covered in flames is seen stumbling as other passengers try to douse him with water.
“Suddenly everything turned orange,” said Hend Ahmad el-Taher, 30, a teacher, who was in a cafeteria waiting for her train to depart when the explosion occurred. “People in flames were running and screaming.”
Egypt’s railway infrastructure has long been neglected, and previous train accidents have been blamed on a lack of investment and poor management of the railway network. Arafat had recently asked President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi for more money to rebuild the rail infrastructure.
The Wednesday explosion and the minister’s resignation are likely to renew questions about Sissi’s economic priorities. He has spent billions on major projects, including building a new capital and bolstering the military. But the government has focused little on refurbishing ­dilapidated infrastructure or spending on public education and health care in a country where 90 percent of the population lives in poverty.
Train accidents are alarmingly common in Egypt and have been increasing. In 2017 alone, 1,793 such accidents occurred, according to government statistics. In 2011, in comparison, there were 489 ­accidents.
In August 2017, 43 people were killed when two passenger trains collided near the northern coastal city of Alexandria. And in 2002, a fire swept through an overcrowded train near Cairo, killing more than 370 people. It was the nation’s deadliest train accident.
On Wednesday, most of those killed were on the platform, waiting for their trains or heading toward the exit.
“I ordered my coffee and was about to pay for it and get back to my train,” Taher recalled. “But God worked His ways and the guy at the cafeteria took too long to get my coffee. In just one second, what happened happened. I could have been out on the platform.
“It was a nightmare,” she added. “Even the people who got out safe were terrified.”

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.
Israel’s embattled leader has long opposed the emergence of an independent Palestine. For years, right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advocated against statehood for millions of Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation, worked to undermine the Palestinian national movement as it splintered between Islamist militant faction Hamas in Gaza and the feeble leadership of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and allied with a far-right Jewish settler movement that has systematically made a future Palestinian state more inviable.
Now, as Israel wages its punishing war against Hamas in Gaza, Netanyahu has faced renewed international calls to help resurrect the two-state solution: The vision of a pair of territorially distinct states, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians, that’s widely embraced by the international community, including the United States.
Arab governments indicated that they would only invest in rebuilding and stabilizing Gaza after the war — which has seen more than 25,000 Palestinians killed and much of the territory flattened — if Israel engages in a meaningful political process with the Palestinians. The White House, too, at least pays lip service to the “aspirations of the Palestinian people” and wants postwar Gaza to be administered by the Palestinian Authority as part of a broader rapprochement that revives the prospect of a two-state solution and further integrates Israel into its Arab neighborhood.
In private, senior Biden officials have pushed this plan to Israeli and Arab counterparts. On a Friday phone call with Netanyahu, President Biden reportedly floated the idea of a two-state solution where Israel’s security would be “guaranteed” — a recognition of Netanyahu’s long-standing suspicion of the threat any independent Palestinian entity poses to Israel. When asked by a reporter on Friday whether the two-state solution was an impossibility under Netanyahu’s watch, Biden replied, “No, it’s not.”
Deep divisions emerge in Israeli government over Gaza war strategy
It didn’t take Netanyahu long to contradict Biden. “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area west of [the river] Jordan — and this is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state,” he wrote on social media Saturday, nipping Biden’s hopeful talk in the bud.
In a statement in Hebrew the next day, Netanyahu pointed to his track record of thwarting the two-state solution. “My insistence is what has prevented — over the years — the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,” he said. “As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.”
On Thursday, before speaking with Biden, Netanyahu had already laid out his rejection of the White House’s efforts. “For 30 years, I have been very consistent, and I’m saying something very simple,” he said at a news conference, arguing that any sovereign Palestinian entity was an unacceptable security threat to Israel. “This conflict is not about the lack of a state, a Palestinian state, but about the existence of a state, a Jewish state.”
Netanyahu was joined on social media by a chorus of parliamentarians in his right-wing coalition, who all echoed his rejection of Palestinian statehood in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack. “I say clearly to everyone who is still stuck on October 6th: we will never allow the establishment of a Palestinian state,” tweeted Miki Zohar, Israel’s minister of culture and sport. “This is our commitment to the murdered martyrs and fallen heroes.”
The Israeli right undermines Biden’s Middle East agenda
The phrase “from the river to the sea” has sparked controversy in both Israel and the United States, where pro-Palestinian protesters have invoked the slogan in demands for freedom and rights for Palestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Many Israelis equate these demands to calls for the erasure of the Israeli state, citing Hamas’s own past rhetoric. U.S. House lawmakers pushed legislation deeming the slogan “antisemitic.”
But Netanyahu and his ruling Likud party have their own fixed vision of what should exist between the river and the sea — Likud’s original party platform insists that “between the Sea and the Jordan there will be only Israeli sovereignty.” And the reality cemented under successive Netanyahu governments is one of Jewish supremacy and Israeli control over a large population of Palestinians whose lives are circumscribed by Israel’s security imperatives.
It’s a scenario a growing body of international officials find untenable. “The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable,” U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said over the weekend. “The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all.”
According to the Financial Times, E.U. officials circulated a document ahead of a Monday meeting of foreign ministers calling on the bloc to think through potential steps if Netanyahu’s government maintains its stance on Palestinian statehood. “Brussels proposed that EU member states should ‘set out the consequences they envisage to attach to engagement or non-engagement’ with their proposed peace plan,” noted the FT.
Israeli calls for Gaza’s ethnic cleansing are only getting louder
Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival, amid fresh protests calling for his resignation. Many Israelis are critical of his fractious handling of the country before the Oct. 7 attack and resent his diffident treatment of the families of hostages held in Gaza.
“Politically, [Netanyahu] sold himself as Mr. Security, but that was obliterated on October 7th,” a leading conservative in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, told the New Yorker’s David Remnick. “Now he is Mr. Standing Up to America Who Will Impose on Us a Palestinian State. He is pivoting. After his grand failure, he needs a new story. He is going to try to sell the story that the security establishment failed, not him, and he is the only one to kill a Palestinian state.”
A canny operator, Netanyahu may yet see a path to clinging on to power, keeping the war rumbling while awaiting the potential return of his friend, former president Donald Trump, to office and a change in the political dispensation in Washington. As it is, critics of the Biden administration from the left believe the White House is complicit in the staggering devastation of Gaza and too weak to check Netanyahu’s uncompromising, hard-right agenda.
The United States should “take at face value [Netanyahu’s] government’s categorical rejection of Palestinian statehood and its written coalition guidelines that assert ‘the Jewish people have an exclusive and inalienable right to all parts of the Land of Israel,’” wrote Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator. “Washington should instead challenge Israel to set out a proposal for how all those living under its control will be guaranteed equality, enfranchisement and other civil rights.”"
VQRE81BG7A_VLP62Z96MVO4L46,Nobel laureate Arno Penzias dies at 90; helped find traces of Big Bang,Martin Weil,"January 23, 2024 at 1:50 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/23/arno-penzias-big-bang-nobel-died-obituary/,"Arno A. Penzias, who fled Nazi Germany in childhood, settled in the United States and in 1978 shared the Nobel Prize in physics for helping find vital early evidence of the Big Bang Theory about the creation of the universe, died Jan. 22 at an assisted-living center in San Francisco. He was 90.
The cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, said his son, David Penzias.
Along with a Bell Laboratories colleague, astronomer Dr. Robert W. Wilson, Dr. Penzias conducted groundbreaking work widely considered fundamental to one of the landmark discoveries of modern science. Their efforts offered support for the current theory of the origin and development of the entire universe and all that lies within it.
In the work for which they were eventually honored with the Nobel, Dr. Penzias and Wilson built and operated a highly sensitive radio telescope. With it, they picked up faint emanations permeating space — radiation, many scientists think, produced by the cataclysmic explosion known as the Big Bang and that set the universe into motion.
The atoms and molecules that compose the universe are themselves composed of particles that carry electrical charges. In motion, charged particles may generate electromagnetic radiation.
Light is only one of the many forms of such radiation. Light has long been collected from distant places on Earth and in the heavens by optical telescopes. But radiation of other frequencies and wavelengths, undetectable by the eye, can be gathered, detected and amplified by what are known as radio telescopes.
Such devices are akin to their optical counterparts but provide information unavailable to optical telescopes. Antennas, analogous to those that can pick up TV or radio signals, serve as the signal-gathering lenses or mirrors of these telescopes.
The discovery made by Dr. Penzias and Wilson came from pointing their device at the sky, and detecting a mysterious and unexplained electromagnetic background that in the world of microwave technology appeared at first as mere noise.
It was in 1964, at the Bell Labs in Holmdel, N.J., that Wilson and Dr. Penzias made their celebrated discovery using their horn-shaped antenna. Even they were startled by what they found.
The mysterious radiation they collected from space in the form of microwave signals came not, as had been suspected, from some single, narrow region of the cosmos. Instead, it came from everywhere. Although faint and no longer possessed of the titanic energies that had created and once characterized it, the radiation pervaded the universe.
The 1978 Nobel citation honored them “for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation.” Their discovery helped dispel what was known as the steady-state theory, the long-held view of a placid, unchanging universe, and led to the widespread adoption of the more dynamic and dramatic Big Bang Theory. (A third scientist, Pyotr Kapitsa of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow, also shared the prize in 1978 for unrelated discoveries involving low-temperature physics.)
Curiously and interestingly, the same cosmic signals that led to Dr. Penzias and Wilson’s discovery had been, to some extent, detected and detectable before.
In the original over-the-air TV sets, the signals from the cosmos, scientists say, formed at least part of the hissing, crackling static that could be witnessed after broadcasting ceased for the night, or on an unused channel.
An early response to the puzzle of the origins of the microwave background was to consider all possible sources, terrestrial and interstellar, of these extraneous signals, and then to rule out the ones shown not to meet the necessary criteria.
Ultimately, scientists have come to accept this pervasive microwave energy as a vestige of the Big Bang, a faint, perhaps cryptic message from the time of creation, thought to be more than 13 billion years ago.
In an episode that demonstrates the often mundane aspects of scientific research, Dr. Penzias and Wilson noted the pigeon droppings repeatedly found at a sensitive part of their antenna. This departure from the sterile perfection of their equipment was — in its turn and along with the other possibilities — duly ruled out as a contributor, albeit a sort of scatological one, to the mysterious background. So Dr. Penzias and Wilson began looking for theoretical explanations.
It was around the time of the Penzias-Wilson discovery that Robert Dicke, a physicist at Princeton University, postulated an idea that linked the possible existence of background radiation to the Big Bang theory. Dicke, according to the American Physical Society, had begun himself to look for the cosmic evidence. When he went to Bell Labs, he recognized that the evidence had already been found by Dr. Penzias and Wilson.
He let them know about his own work, according to the physics society, while acknowledging theirs to his Princeton colleagues, with the wry observation: “We’ve been scooped.”
The two groups published their results at the same time.
Arno Penzias was born in Munich on April 26, 1933. His father, who owned and operated a leather wholesale business, provided what Dr. Penzias described as a comfortable middle-class living for his family. His mother, a Catholic, had converted to her husband’s Jewish faith.
His family was sent to the Polish border in 1938 as part of a Nazi program to deport Jews of Polish background and who did not hold German passports. By his account, the family missed the deadline by an hour at the border and was turned back, on grounds that no more immigrants were to be accepted.
That, the family believed, may have saved their lives. When his father was ordered to leave the country within six months, he began making arrangements for his sons to leave for Britain as part of the kindertransport program to rescue German-Jewish children.
On leaving home in 1939, 6-year-old Arno said he told his slightly younger brother in German, “Jetzt sind wir allein” — “now we are alone.”
The family was reunited soon thereafter in England before sailing to the United States in December 1939 on a ship, on which his father had presciently booked passage 18 months earlier. They settled in the Bronx the next month, where his parents became superintendents of an apartment building. His father later worked in the carpentry shop of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and his mother cleaned homes and did sewing at a coat factory.
“Arno was always a thinker and very ambitious,” his father told the Palm Beach Post after his son received the Nobel. He recalled that Arno, on his own, found out that he was eligible to attend Brooklyn Technical High School, which had a renowned science and engineering program. From the Bronx, Arno trekked three hours a day by foot and subway to the school. “He just thought [school] would give him more,” his father said. “The travel didn’t mean anything to him.”
Arno became a naturalized citizen in 1946, adding “Allan,” the Americanized name he liked to be called, as his middle name. At his father’s behest, he studied chemistry in the hope of earning a good living in engineering. But during his freshman year at tuition-free City College of New York, he switched to physics because he was bored by chemistry.
“Physics was unglamorous then,” he told the New Yorker. “This was before Sputnik. … The top kids seemed to be attracted to it for aesthetic reasons. I didn’t get into it, at first, for those reasons, but I found that, as I studied it, it was something I liked. The competition was extraordinarily tough.”
He graduated in 1954, then spent two years working on radar in the Army Signal Corps, before obtaining a master’s degree in physics in 1958 and a doctorate four years later, both from Columbia University.
Much of his early work, including his Army service, involved him with microwave research and technology, and that placed him on the path that led to the Nobel. At Columbia, the physics department was deeply engaged in microwave research with a faculty that included some of the luminaries of the field. Under one Columbia mentor, Charles Townes, an inventor of the maser, he was immersed in the study of microwaves and radio astronomy.
In 1961, Dr. Penzias joined Bell Laboratories, the research center that was maintained by the old Bell System, and which studied the fundamental science behind such technologies as microwaves, electronic signals and modern telecommunications.
The renowned laboratories in Holmdel, he said, had one-of-a-kind facilities that “made it an ideal place” to finish the radio astronomy observations he had begun but not completed during his Columbia PhD work.
For example, Bell already had a large antenna suitable for radio astronomy. That antenna had been intended for use in communication with Earth satellites. Dr. Penzias described it as a superb tool for pursuing his own interests, and it became available to him. He remained at Bell for 37 years, working in such areas as interstellar chemistry before moving up the management ranks.
In the mid-1990s, he moved to Silicon Valley, where he became prominent as a thinker on the development of new technologies and an adviser to start-up companies.
His first marriage, to Anne Barras, ended in divorce. In 1996, he wed Sherry Levit, a Silicon Valley executive. In addition to his wife, of San Francisco, survivors include three children from his first marriage, David Penzias of Newton, Mass., Mindy Dirks of Monte Sereno, Calif., and Rabbi L. Shifra Weiss-Penzias of Santa Cruz, Calif.; two stepchildren, Carson Levit and Victoria Zaroff, both of San Francisco; a brother; 12 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
A book Dr. Penzias published in 1989, “Ideas and Information,” may seem to have particular relevance at a time of increasing interest in such topics as artificial intelligence. “In essence,” he wrote in his Nobel biographical statement, “the book depicts computers as a wonderful tool for human beings but a dreadful role model for what we humans know as intelligence. In other words, ‘If you don’t want to be replaced by a machine, don’t try to act like one!’”"
VRV7OJFWA2_BQ5R2P9DK3IT3MX,U.N. agency fires workers accused of joining Oct. 7 Hamas attack,Louisa Loveluck,"January 26, 2024 at 4:26 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/unwra-oct-7-alleged-participation/,"JERUSALEM — The U.N. agency for Palestinian affairs said Friday it was terminating the contracts of several staff members after Israel alleged agency workers had participated in the Hamas attack Oct. 7 that left 1,200 people in Israel dead and triggered the current fighting in Gaza.
“Any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, said in a statement. He said he had ordered an investigation “to establish the truth without delay.”
UNRWA did not say how many employees had come under suspicion; the United States put the number at 12. The agency employs around 13,000 people in Gaza, where it provides food assistance, health care and education.
The State Department said it was pausing new funding for the agency while it reviewed the allegations and the steps the United Nations was taking to address them.
The United States is UNRWA’s largest donor; Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described the agency’s mission as “essential.” Any suspension of U.S. aid, even if only temporary, could weaken the agency’s ability to respond to what aid workers have described as dire humanitarian need. More than  93 percent of the population faces “crisis levels of hunger,” and 1.9 million people have sought refuge in UNRWA shelters.
“These shocking allegations come as more than 2 million people in Gaza depend on lifesaving assistance that the Agency has been providing since the war began,” Lazzarini said. “Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world.”
Israel’s campaign to eradicate Hamas from Gaza has caused the deaths of more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza ministry of health. Most were civilians.
Aid officials say their personnel have been targeted while conducting lifesaving activities. One hundred and fifty-two UNRWA staffers have been killed, the agency says, and at least 357 displaced civilians have been killed while sheltering in its facilities.
The agency made the allegations, the termination of its workers and the investigation public hours after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to do more to prevent the deaths of civilians in Gaza and allow more aid into the besieged enclave.
A State Department spokesman said the United States was “extremely troubled” by the allegations and welcomed the investigation. “The United States has reached out to the Government of Israel to seek more information about these allegations, and we have briefed Members of Congress,” spokesman Matt Miller said in a statement. “We will remain in close contact with the United Nations and Government of Israel regarding this matter.”
A spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it expected an “urgent examination” of the allegations. He did not provide further information.
“It is crucial that UNRWA conducts a thorough internal investigation into the activities of Hamas operatives and other terrorist elements within its ranks to ensure that the humanitarian activities of the organization are not exploited for malicious purposes,” spokesman Lior Haiat said.
The Biden administration has been Israel’s most important ally throughout the war. It has expedited the transfer of American weapons while urging Israel to do more to limit civilian casualties. Critics of Israel’s military operation noted the timing of the allegations, which were made public on a day when the ICJ’s ruling would otherwise have dominated the news from Gaza.
The United States has given UNRWA more than $1 billion since 2021. A National Security Council spokesperson said in November that the State Department maintained “rigorous oversight” over the agency’s policies, programs, and finances.
Risk-mitigation measures, he said, included closely monitoring the organization’s activities through partner vetting, anti-terrorism certifications, and close cooperation with Israeli authorities.
“UNRWA is an essential component to any plan that seeks to maintain stability in the region and protect civilians,” he said.
Jeff Stein and John Hudson in Washington contributed to this report.
The ICJ will rule Friday on South Africa’s request that the court order Israel to suspend its military campaign. The court will not be ruling on whether Israel has committed genocide — a verdict that could take years.
Israel has stepped up its assault on Hamas in recent days as Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

VT69850W5B_2MMO4C2PE3QCGUS,Why thick fog is blanketing a record stretch of the U.S.,Ian Livingston,"January 25, 2024 at 12:36 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/25/record-fog-united-states-explained/,"Since Tuesday, record amounts of fog have blanketed the Lower 48 states, lowering visibility, disrupting flights, causing vehicle accidents and even delaying schools.
At least two decades have passed since the United States was this foggy.
On Thursday morning, dense fog advisories affected nearly a third of the United States population (more than 100 million people) and parts of 27 states. These advisories covered the entirety of Iowa, Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi, Illinois, Indiana and Tennessee and portions of many other states from Texas to New York.
A mashup of webcams from AccuWeather showed the fog enveloping many major cities east of the Rockies, including Cincinnati, Nashville, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Oklahoma City, New York City, Washington and Chicago.
Thursday marked the third day in a row of this record-breaking fog outbreak, largely the result of a storm drawing tremendous amounts of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico overtop a shallow layer of cooler air left behind by last week’s Arctic blasts. This same storm has unloaded as much as 10 inches of rain along the Gulf Coast and triggered serious flooding.
Dense fog, according to the National Weather Service, drops visibility to a quarter mile or less for an extended period of time. This week’s fog has caused numerous travel troubles, including flight delays and cancellations as well as vehicle accidents:
Chicago has been hit particularly hard by flight issues. On Tuesday, 8 percent of flights out of O’Hare International Airport were canceled and 37 percent delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware. A similar numbers of flights were affected Wednesday and Thursday morning.
Around Cleveland, some schools were delayed for a second straight morning Thursday because of the low visibility.
Advection fog is the cause. Unlike radiation fog, which typically forms overnight when skies are clear and winds are calm in the spring and fall, advection fog develops when warm, moist air is transported over a layer of cold air near the ground.
This week’s advection fog episode is a textbook case as warm and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico has been pumped over what was a record snowpack last week across the Lower 48 by a zone of high pressure off the Mid-Atlantic coast.
“The setup for the ground surface will be a snow-covered ground or a saturated ground that has been chilled by cold temperatures before the winds shift back from a southerly type direction,” wrote meteorologist Jeff Haby in an online tutorial published by the Weather Service.
If winds aren’t too strong and the ground remains cool, advection fog can persist for days, as it has this week.
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings set records for the number of dense fog advisories nationally, according to Daryl Herzmann, a systems analyst who manages a weather hazard database at Iowa State University. Each day surpassed the record set the day before. The fog advisory database dates back to January 2005.
Herzmann told the Capital Weather Gang that more than 1,500 Weather Service forecast zones, analogous to counties and sometimes sub-counties, were under a fog advisory early Thursday.
Thursday’s fog advisory tally topped the 1,341 zones under advisories on Wednesday and the 1,107 zones Tuesday, according to Herzmann.
Fog coverage should diminish as a storm system sweeps from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast by the weekend, increasing winds to mix out the soupy air.
Snowmelt in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest has also been rapid over the past couple days because of the warm air surging northward. As the snowpack disappears in more places, cold temperatures near the ground will moderate, lowering the fog potential."
VWFSOX2S7M_Q0UCBJS6LWEOC77,Murder conviction tossed in case of ex-diplomat’s daughter,Dan Morse,"January 23, 2024 at 4:49 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/23/sophia-negroponte-murder-conviction-overturned/,"The murder conviction of Sophia Negroponte, the daughter of former U.S. director of national intelligence John Negroponte, was thrown out by a Maryland appeals court Tuesday.
An opinion from three judges of the Appellate Court of Maryland sent the case back to Montgomery County for a new trial because the jury was allowed to hear portions of interrogation video showing police questioning Sophia Negroponte’s credibility as well as testimony from a prosecution expert witness who also questioned her credibility.
“The detectives commented that they found [Negroponte’s] version of events ‘hard to believe’ and that it looked like appellant was not being honest. Under our long-established precedent, these kinds of assertions are not relevant and bear a high risk of prejudice,” the court wrote.
Negroponte was convicted of second-degree murder in January 2023 in the killing of Yousuf Rasmussen, 24. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison. The trial in Montgomery Circuit Court focused heavily on whether she purposely tried to kill her friend by stabbing him in the neck or whether he was accidentally cut in a drunken fight in February 2020.
“My wife Diana and I sincerely welcome this decision by the Appellate Court of Maryland,” John Negroponte said Tuesday.
The Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office tried the case. Prosecutors there are exploring their options. “We are examining any possible appeals of this decision, but we remain absolutely prepared to retry the case if necessary,” state’s attorney’s office spokeswoman Lauren DeMarco said Wednesday.
Negroponte, 30, Rasmussen and another friend were in an Airbnb she was living in at the time on the night of the stabbing.
At trial, the other friend who was there that night testified that Negroponte kept initiating arguments with Rasmussen and that “no one became ‘overly intoxicated.’”
The altercations progressed through the night and ended with Rasmussen getting stabbed in the neck with a kitchen knife. The friend testified that Negroponte had grabbed a chef’s knife in the kitchen before Rasmussen was injured, but Negroponte testified that Rasmussen swung a knife at her that she had placed out for cheese. Negroponte said she had been very intoxicated that night and couldn’t remember certain details of the evening.
Negroponte’s attorneys “argued that Mr. Rasmussen’s death was the result of a chaotic series of fights instigated by Mr. Rasmussen and fueled by significant intoxication by all parties involved,” according to the appellate court’s opinion.
In appealing, Negroponte’s attorneys argued that the jury should not have seen six statements from her interrogation by two detectives calling her accounting of events into question. Detectives remarked that it was “odd” that she didn’t remember certain portions of the evening, that certain things she said didn’t “make sense” and that her saying she didn’t remember certain things “makes it look like you’re not being completely honest.”
The court agreed that the detectives’ comments should not have been included at trial.
“The fact that appellant repeated an allegedly implausible story — that she did not remember the moment of the stabbing — and that she changed her recollection of detail was relevant,” the court wrote. “The expressions of disbelief by the detectives, however, were not.”
Prosecutors had argued that the skepticism from detectives put her interview into context and that the officers did not assert that Negroponte was lying.
“Rather, they expressed natural skepticism to odd assertions by appellant,” the court wrote in summarizing the state’s argument. “The State argues that appellant added new details each time the detectives expressed skepticism.”
The appellate court indicated that the detectives didn’t necessarily engage in improper questioning — just that the jury should not have heard or seen certain parts of it.
“Notably, this Court has made clear that our holdings on the admissibility of officer statements of disbelief are not based on any police misconduct,” the court wrote. “Therefore, the question is not whether the police were confrontational or aggressive in a way that might have affected appellant. … Rather, the issue is what effect hearing the assertions of belief by police officers may have on the jury. Thus, the fact that the interview was not hostile is irrelevant to our determination.”
Negroponte’s attorneys also questioned the testimony of Christiane Tellefsen, a forensic psychiatrist who testified for prosecutors.
Tellefsen testified that Negroponte’s explanation for how much she drank is “most likely unreliable,” according to the opinion. When asked to elaborate, despite an objection from the defense, Tellefsen said that Negroponte was “suffering from alcohol use disorder,” which she said makes people “tend to both underestimate and overestimate what they had been drinking.”
Tellefsen also said that because Negroponte “is a defendant in a murder trial ... you have to take what she says with a grain of salt because she has an incentive to embellish or diminish the amount of the alcohol she used because she’s in that situation.”
Negroponte’s defense had requested the comment be struck and asked for a mistrial based on Tellefsen’s comment that Negroponte was less credible as a defendant in a murder trial, but Circuit Court Judge Terrence J. McGann allowed the case to go forward.
Negroponte’s lawyers in the appeal argued that certain statements from the expert were prejudicial because credibility was at the core of the case.
But attorneys for the state had argued Tellefsen’s testimony was an appropriate rebuttal to defense expert Michael O’Connell, who testified that Negroponte didn’t have a meaningful understanding of her Miranda rights because she was intoxicated.
“In support of this argument, the State notes that [Tellefsen] limited her opinion to appellant’s credibility as regards her drinking because that was the evidence that undergirded Dr. O’Connell’s conclusions,” the appellate court judges wrote.
Tellefsen’s comment on taking what Negroponte said “with a grain of salt” may have been “cabined to credibility on the subject of alcohol,” the court wrote. “But, given the centrality of alcohol in appellant’s case, the comment was nonetheless a comment on appellant’s credibility about a material fact” and, therefore, inadmissible.
Andrew D. Levy, one of Negroponte’s appellate attorneys, said reversal centered on whether it’s proper to introduce opinions about a defendant’s credibility during a trial. Rendering that judgment, Levy said, is generally the province of the jury.
“It’s just a red line that the courts in Maryland have drawn,” Levy said. “The jury is the one who decides who to believe.”
The reason, Levy said, is that opinions aren’t evidence.
Echoing the Appellate Court of Maryland’s ruling, Levy said it wasn’t that detectives did anything wrong by telling Negroponte during their questioning that they doubted her. The unfairness, he said, was that those statements weren’t redacted for the trial.
The same went for allowing an expert witness to tell jurors that Negroponte’s version of events was unreliable. “That was really prejudicial testimony,” Levy said.
The issues were particularly important in this case because there was such a difference between Negroponte’s account and testimony from the only other witness, Levy said, calling the case a “he said, she said.”
“Her credibility was really at issue in this case,” Levy said.

VXPXH0ZV8S_EEWQ10PEMJHREAL,Scientific breakthrough may save northern white rhino through surrogacy,_,"January 24, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240124,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/24/white-rhino-embryo-surrogacy/,"NAIROBI — Scientists have made history by successfully transferring a rhinoceros embryo for the first time, conservationists announced Wednesday, an achievement that could help save the embattled species from the growing threat of poachers.
The development is a milestone that scientists say opens the way to saving the endangered northern white rhino. Only two females exist in the world, Najin and daughter Fatu, and both are unable to carry pregnancies. Najin and Fatu live at Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy, which was also home to Sudan, the last male northern white rhino, which died in 2018.
Sudan’s death galvanized the world, motivating conservationists to try to save the species. Before that, in 2009 scientists had believed that there were only eight northern white rhinos alive on the planet, and they were all in zoos. When these rhinos did not breed, a team with a project called BioRescue went to Kenya in 2014 and decided to start working on another plan to save the species.
“This animal played a crucial role in a complex ecosystem before it got extinct for a while. It lived in the landscape and architecture of central Africa — bringing back the northern white rhino to this ecosystem will help to heal the ecosystem,” Thomas Hildebrandt, head of the project, told The Washington Post.
In 2019, scientists harvested oocytes — developing eggs — from Fatu and Najin, flying them to Avantea, a lab in Italy where they used the sperm of dead northern white rhinos for artificial insemination. The eggs were fertilized, with two resulting in viable embryos. A third embryo was created in 2020 using the same technique. There are now 30 embryos from the northern white rhinos that can be used to produce babies, and all are oocytes from Fatu, Hildebrandt said.
In the procedure announced Wednesday, scientists transferred a southern white rhino embryo to make sure the procedure could work. This way, no northern white rhino embryos were wasted. The successful transplanting of the embryo and the pregnancy of the southern white rhino surrogate involved the transfer of two southern white rhino embryos into a southern white rhino surrogate named Curra. Two embryos were used to increase the chance of a positive result.
Future surrogates of northern white rhinos will probably continue to be southern white rhinos until the subspecies can naturally breed again and are released in the wild, Hildebrandt said, which is likely to happen in the next 10 to 15 years.
The population of northern white rhinos started to shrink in central and parts of East Africa in the 1960s due to intense poaching for rhino horns. The northern white rhino and the southern white rhino are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as subspecies of the white rhino.
With the latest development, scientists are now moving quickly. This year, there are plans to implant a surrogate with a northern white rhino embryo. Two surrogates named Arimet and Daly have been identified and will be likely recipients of the embryos.
A photo caption with this story previously gave the incorrect age of an embryo. It was 70 days old, not 66. The caption has been corrected."

Altman has discussed where and how to build new semiconductor factories, known in the industry as “fabs,” with members of Congress, according to people familiar with the discussion, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
Advanced semiconductor chips are essential to train and run the AI programs that enable generative AI products like ChatGPT. Altman and other tech leaders insist that AI will fundamentally change the world economy, and having a cheap supply of computer chips is crucial to maintaining U.S. competitiveness economically and militarily.
The United States plans to spend billions of dollars to increase domestic chip production, while at the same time blocking the export of advanced AI chips to China with the goal of keeping its military from having access to cutting-edge AI. Other governments are competing for influence, too, and investing in projects like Altman’s could increase their power over the future of the tech industry.
Altman is spearheading the initiative to raise billions or even trillions of dollars from investors around the world because he believes chips will become more vital to economic and technological development as AI continues to advance, one of the people said.
The project could build new factories or partner with existing chip-making companies, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest made-to-order chip company that manufactures around 90 percent of the world’s advanced chips, one of the people said. The venture could operate similarly to how Apple allocates huge amounts of money to TSMC to guarantee a stable supply of chips, the person said.
In December, The Washington Post reported that Altman had told venture capital investors Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla that he was planning to build a chip company. To fund it, he would potentially tap Middle East governments, including Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, as well as Silicon Valley investors. Bloomberg News reported last week that the project centered around building a “network of factories” to increase chip production.
The White House recently announced subsidies as part of its $52 billion Chips for America program. The initiative has become part of President Biden’s reelection campaign, as he aims to show voters he is capable of building up the economy and shoring up the tech industry.
A spokesperson for OpenAI declined to comment.
Building advanced computer chips is hugely expensive and complicated. They must be assembled in “clean rooms” that keep tiny particles and even static electricity from damaging the chips. A single fab takes 6,000 workers three years to build and costs $10 billion, according to Intel, one of the world’s biggest semiconductor companies.
U.S. chip companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices design and sell semiconductors, but still rely on outside manufacturers, especially TSMC, to make them. Nvidia’s AI chips are the gold standard in the industry and are seen as the best for training AI, and no other company has managed to match them.
Altman is known for ambitious dreams and plans. He has invested his personal money in a range of initiatives to commercialize expensive, futuristic technology, such as fusion reactors and supersonic passenger jets. In the past, he has advocated for a universal basic income for people whose jobs are displaced by AI and robots.
Altman has said the world does not have the capacity to build the amount of computer chips that will be necessary to support the AI revolution. Not all tech industry analysts agree. Some AI researchers expect the demand for AI chips to slow down as technologists find ways to run advanced AI with less computing power.
Right now, AI companies are clamoring for chips designed by Nvidia. But other chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are investing huge sums to build competing products, and Big Tech companies like Google and Amazon are designing chips of their own."

Jose Lazaro Cruz, now 60, was turned over to the U.S. Marshals Service on Thursday, officials said. He is charged with second-degree murder in the April 30, 1991, death of Ana Jurado, 24, who suffered a slashing wound to her neck and bled to death in the 3100 block of Cofer Road in the Falls Church area, according to police.
Lazaro Cruz was charged in the killing a month later, but he had fled to El Salvador, authorities said. In 2022, the Justice Department said Lazaro Cruz had been detained by Costa Rican authorities while crossing into that country from Nicaragua. More than a year later, police said they confirmed that Lazaro Cruz would be returned to Virginia.
It was unclear from online court records whether he is represented by a lawyer in the United States."
W7B64GTWEC_625XUC4B9Z60HQG,Expert strategies that (really) help kids reduce screen time,Geoffrey A. Fowler,"January 26, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/26/how-to-reduce-screen-time-kids/,"When researchers last year tracked the smartphones of 200 volunteers aged 11 to 17, they found teens weren’t just mindless screen zombies.
In fact, they used all sorts of strategies to try to disconnect: Some left on “do not disturb” to silence never-ending notifications. Others charged their phones outside their bedrooms to help them get sleep.
Turns out, teens want time away from phones and social media, too.
If it feels like everyone in your family is spending too much time looking at screens instead of each other, you’re not alone. Giant corporations are working against all of us to make social media, games and apps ever harder to put down.
1/7
“There is not a generational decline in willpower,” U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy said in a recent interview. “The platforms are designed specifically to maximize how much time we spend on them.”
The good news is that it’s never too late for a family tech reset. But you won’t find the solution only in parental controls and screen-time restrictions. The most effective approach is to listen to what your kids say about their online experiences and make rebalancing a project for the whole family. That includes parents taking a hard look at their own phone habits, too.
The four-step strategy we recommend below is based on interviews with doctors, parents and researchers who have studied what’s actually going on behind kids’ screens — and seen what really works to change behavior. This is targeted primarily at families with teens who already have phones or other devices. (When to give a kid their first phone or social media account is an important separate conversation.)
Parents have plenty of reason to be concerned about mental health, bullying and exploitation online. But try to remember: Screens aren’t always the enemy, even if children are using them differently from how you grew up. Many teens find community online. For some, it’s a constructive and even lifesaving place to explore identity.
That’s why the first step is to practice more empathy and less eye-rolling, said Emily Weinstein, the executive director of Harvard’s Center for Digital Thriving.
Parents have never been teenagers in the age of TikTok and artificial intelligence. So before you launch into rulemaking, it’s essential to do some fact-finding.
Talk to your teen about their online life the same way you would talk about school or extracurriculars. Where do they like to spend time? What need does a particular app or game fulfill? What real-world activities do they value, and how can tech get in the way?
To get the conversation started, call a casual family meeting. Tell your teen you want to hear their thoughts about the family’s tech use — what’s going well, and where they could use your help. Make sure you’re open to feedback about your tech use, as well.
Listen to what your kids already do on their own to tame their screen time. A good question Weinstein learned from her research with teens: What do you do when you really want to focus on someone or something you care about?
1 in 10 teens already use ChatGPT for school. Here’s how to guide them.
Call out what researchers call “technoference”: the moments when technology interferes with relationships and actual human connection.
As you process this information together, focus on building your understanding rather than immediately giving advice. Were you bullied as a teen? Were you curious about sex and other topics that were “too mature” for you? Your child is not reinventing the wheel here.
While interviewing dozens of teenagers for their book “Behind Their Screens: What Teens Are Facing (and Adults Are Missing),”   Weinstein and fellow researcher Carrie James were surprised to learn that many teenagers slept with their phones because they were worried about missing a text from a friend in crisis. If frustrated parents viewed the habit as simple “phone addiction,” they would be missing out on an important part of their child’s inner world, said Weinstein.
Let the family meeting be sacred ground where teens can share without getting in trouble.
Now you need an action plan. Critically, though, it shouldn’t just be rules handed down by parents. Think of it, instead, as experiments.
As a family, brainstorm some ways to reclaim your time and focus from devices. Failure is okay.
The focus should be as much about reducing screen time as it is replacing that time with something you would like more of, be it family adventures or sleep. “We can’t just expect that we’re going to reduce screen time by an hour and things are just going to get better in our family,” University of Michigan pediatrician Jenny Radesky says. “Then you just leave this vacuum of an hour where kids are going to be like, ‘I’m bored, I don’t know what to do.’”
Ideas from the experts include:
And before you start, pick a date on the calendar to agree to all get back together and talk about how the experiments impacted everyone’s mood. Talk about how it felt without the “digital pacifier” of a screen to look at in moments of awkwardness or social uncertainty — and whether it ended up giving you moments to connect.
When you find some experiments that work, turn them into rules that everyone agrees on.
Together, write a family tech plan (like these samples from Common Sense Media). Kids tend to know what’s right and wrong, and you can help them fill in the blanks.
Then you have to follow the rules, too. “Parents are the number one role models for their kids when it comes to technology,” says Jim Steyer, the founder of Common Sense Media.
If you’re not present and engaged, why should your kid be? They see you when you’re answering work Slacks while they are telling you about their day, or texting while you’re driving. In 2023, American adults used their phones an average of 4.3 hours per day, according to research firm Data.ai.
If you do need to pick up your phone during a communal moment for important grown-up reasons, say out loud why you’re doing so — like, “I’m looking up directions right now.”
Most social media and gaming sites come with safety and privacy settings. And while they won’t fix systemic issues with abuse and social media amplifying harmful information, they’re worth a regular checkup.
Where possible:
Admittedly, it’s tough to keep tabs on your teen’s social media experience from the outside. Dozens of parental-monitoring tools promise to scan your child’s messages for “inappropriate” content or feed you updates on their activity. Some parents follow their kids online from secret accounts — or just poke around teens’ phones when they’re not looking.
Our experts agree that surveilling a teen who isn’t already in deep crisis can do more harm than good. Even if you don’t trust them, it’s important they trust you, Radesky says. Instead of spying, tell your teen exactly what you will do to stay apprised of their online life, and where you will grant them privacy.
Most importantly, help teens identify what behavior is acceptable. Brainstorm together what type of online flirtation is appropriate. Discuss what they would do if someone made them feel uncomfortable, guilty, scared or attacked. And make yourself available to gut check their posts before they hit send.
The body can be a useful tool here. Help kids learn to take signals from their bodies by modeling it yourself. “Wow, time on that app really made me feel energized,” or “Gosh, my chest feels really anxious after watching that video.”
If you’re tired of constantly playing “bad cop” with your teen’s tech use, we’ve got some good news: Striking the right balance is challenging for you both, and you can navigate this new world as a team.

WI0ZLGE00O_B0QFIE1K6XJ00QM,New York City designates social media a public health hazard,Kelsey Ables,"January 25, 2024 at 4:54 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/25/nyc-social-media-health-hazard-toxin/,"New York City on Wednesday designated social media a public health hazard for its effect on youth mental health, becoming the first major city in the United States to take such a step, Mayor Eric Adams (D) said in an address.
“Companies like TikTok, YouTube, Facebook are fueling a mental health crisis by designing their platforms with addictive and dangerous features,” Adams said in the annual State of the City address.
In response, he said, New York City Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan “is issuing a health commissioner advisory officially designating social media as a public health crisis hazard in New York City.”
“Just as the [U.S.] surgeon general did with tobacco and guns, we are treating social media like other public health hazards and it must stop,” Adams said.
In an advisory issued the same day, Vasan outlined the deteriorating state of youth mental health in New York City and offered guidance to young people on encouraging healthy social media use, such as by implementing tech-free times and places; monitoring emotions during use; and sharing concerns related to social media and mental health with adults.
The crisis of student mental health is much vaster than we realize
Up to 95 percent of U.S. teens use some form of social media, many finding a place to connect with friends, discuss interests and keep up on trends. But with young people facing an unprecedented mental health crisis that some have linked to social media, there are growing concerns about the use of these platforms and the addictive habits they can form.
Several social media companies including TikTok and YouTube have responded to mounting scrutiny by adding new features to give parents more control over their children’s activity and limit the time they spend online, according to a Washington Post analysis.
TikTok, Google and Meta did not immediately respond to request for comment early Thursday.
In May last year, Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy issued an advisory that said there isn’t enough evidence to determine whether social media is “sufficiently safe for children and adolescents.” In an op-ed for The Post, Murthy wrote: “In light of the ongoing youth mental health crisis, it is no longer possible to ignore social media’s potential contribution to the pain that millions of children and families are experiencing.”
The advisory released Wednesday by the New York City health commissioner said that between 2011 and 2021, rates of high-schoolers in the city experiencing hopelessness increased by more than 42 percent and rates of suicidal ideation increased by more than 34 percent. “Young people who identify as Black, Latino, female or LGBTQ+ bear disproportionately high rates of experiencing hopelessness,” it said.
Officials say social media is hurting teens. Scientists say it’s complicated.
Ofir Turel, a professor at the University of Melbourne in Australia who studies the behavioral effects of technology, praised New York City’s advisory for acknowledging the possible risks of social media while not calling for its complete elimination.
Turel pointed to issues with “body image, social comparison, depression, [and] addiction-like use” as among the possible ills of social media, but he said “it has many positive aspects” too.
He advocated for what he called the “food regulation model,” which encourages healthy habits through approaches such as nutrition labels on foods, rather than imposing restrictions.
“While we are not very good at it, many people manage to have somewhat healthy food intake. Social media is the same,” he said. “We just need knowledge and incentives.”"
WSREGNRJ94_UOO86EJS6X2ZL3H,21 Israeli soldiers killed while trying to build Gaza buffer,Shira Rubin,"January 23, 2024 at 4:37 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/israel-soldiers-killed-gaza-war-hostages/,"TEL AVIV — The deadliest attack on Israeli soldiers in the war in the Gaza Strip has drawn attention to one element of Israel’s postwar plans for the enclave: a buffer zone along the border to protect Israeli communities from attacks.
Israel launched its campaign against Hamas after its fighters streamed out of Gaza in a surprise attack Oct. 7 to kill about 1,200 people in Israel and take about 240 hostage. Israeli leaders say their goal is to eradicate the group as a political and military force.
As part of the effort to build the buffer zone, Israeli reservists were rigging explosives to demolish two buildings inside the enclave’s perimeter on Monday when Hamas militants fired rocket-propelled grenades at the mission, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said. The first hit a building holding explosives, causing the collapse of two buildings and killing 21 soldiers. Another RPG round hit a tank, he added.
It was the single greatest loss of Israeli life in more than 100 days of war on Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Three more Israeli soldiers were killed in fierce fighting elsewhere.
The 24 deaths brought the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the ground operation began to 221. They include 21 Americans who were serving in the Israel Defense Forces, the U.S. State Department has said.
The Israeli campaign against Hamas, one of the most destructive wars this century, has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
Israel steps up Khan Younis assault; pressure mounts over two-state solution
The IDF has been destroying buildings in Gaza as part of the buffer zone effort, Hagari said in a televised statement.
The United States has opposed any permanent change to Gaza’s territory, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday appeared to accept a temporary buffer zone. He said Israelis who have been displaced by rocket attacks from Gaza and Lebanon must be able to return to their homes.
“It is totally appropriate, something that we support, that those people be able to return to their homes and that the necessary security arrangements be in place to give them the confidence to do that,” Blinken said at a news conference in Abuja, Nigeria.
But he said the reconfiguration could not be open-ended. “When it comes to the permanent status of Gaza going forward, we’ve been clear, we remain clear about not encroaching on its territory,” he said.
Israel planned in late November to construct a permanent buffer zone up to a mile wide inside Gaza. But the Biden administration told the Israeli government that every inch of Gaza must remain Palestinian territory after the war. If a permanent security zone was needed along the border, U.S. officials said, it should be on Israel’s territory.
Israel has informed the United States that the buffer being constructed inside Gaza is only a temporary security accommodation to eliminate Hamas firing positions close to the border, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic communications.
Evidence and testimony of atrocities committed by Hamas-led fighters on Oct. 7 continue to emerge.
On Tuesday, Israeli women who were held as hostages in Gaza told the Knesset that female captives were sexually abused.
Aviva Siegel, who was held in Gaza for more than a month, told lawmakers that captors attempted to dress women in “inappropriate clothes” and transform them into “their dolls, to whom they could do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted.” They also subjected male hostages to sexual abuse, she said.
Siegel was one of more than 100 Israelis released by Hamas during a week-long cease-fire in late November in exchange for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and the delivery of more aid to Gaza. More than 100 Israelis are believed to remain in Hamas captivity.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that the IDF was investigating the soldiers’ deaths.
“We must learn the necessary lessons and do everything to preserve the lives of our warriors,” he said in a statement. “In the name of our heroes, and for our own lives, we will not stop the fight until reaching absolute victory.”
“This is a war that will determine the future of Israel for decades to come,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday on social media. “The fall of our fighters is a requirement for achieving the goals of the war.”
Israel has withdrawn some forces from northern Gaza in recent weeks. Authorities say the next phase of the war will involve more closely targeted raids and assassinations than the broad air and ground campaign with which the IDF has razed much of the north.
But fighting continues, particularly in central and southern Gaza, around the city of Khan Younis and approaching Rafah, on the border between Gaza and Egypt, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken shelter.
Israel announced Tuesday that its ground troops had encircled Khan Younis in the south and with the air force had killed dozens of Palestinian militants. The city, the IDF’s main current focus, is believed to be housing Hamas military leader Yehiya Sinwar. The fighting there is expected to last for weeks.
As strikes continued, the IDF late Monday directed some residents of Khan Younis, including those in the city center, to evacuate to the seaside village of Mawasi, which it designated a “safer” zone. But on Tuesday, at least seven people were killed in a strike on a makeshift tent community there, according to Marwan al-Hams, director of Rafah’s al-Najjar Hospital, which received the dead and the injured.
Asmaa Khudair, 39, told The Washington Post that a missile “fell on us like fire,” starting a blaze that burned her daughter, niece and husband alive as ambulances were unable to reach the area.
Khudair, who spoke by phone from the hospital, said she fled with a 6-year-old daughter “while our bodies were burning with fire” and broke the fingers in her right hand in the process. “The tent caught fire, and I saw my husband’s body burning,” she said. “Our hearts burned.”
The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Who is Hamas leader Yehiya Sinwar? From enforcer to Oct. 7 mastermind.
Raed al-Nams, a spokesman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society in Gaza, texted that “the situation in Khan Younis is very hard until now. It is basically forbidden to enter or leave it.”
Israel has kept at least three brigades and additional special forces inside the enclave, the IDF said this month. But Hagari, the spokesman, said Tuesday that “more reservists will be required in all the combat arenas.”
He said the military strategy going forward would include “both freeing up reservists and focusing the activities.”
“We will be required to recruit reserve personnel again and act again in all the theaters of war, in the south and in the north,” he said. He added that Israel has another duty — to allow some of the hundreds of thousands who had enlisted after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack to return to their families, jobs and studies “to allow the state of Israel to fight for a long time.”
Berger reported from Jerusalem. Hazem Balousha in Amman, Jordan, and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

The Southwest Waterfront arts center, which in 2023 celebrated the end of Molly Smith’s quarter-century at the helm and the introduction of artistic director Hana S. Sharif, bested all companies with 32 nominations for the annual awards honoring the best in D.C. area theater. Arlington’s Signature Theatre came in second with 20, including 11 for Matthew Gardiner’s boldly intimate staging of the turn-of-the-century musical epic “Ragtime.”
Theatre Washington, the organization that administers the awards, also announced that former Washington Post theater critic Peter Marks will receive the Helen Hayes Tribute at this year’s ceremony, held May 20 at the Anthem and hosted by local actors Felicia Curry, Rayanne Gonzales, Maria Rizzo and Tom Story. Marks, who recently left The Post after a 21-year tenure, joins the likes of August Wilson, Angela Lansbury, Stephen Sondheim and James Earl Jones in receiving the honor.
“This award appreciates and honors Marks’ decades of knowledgeable and thoughtful writing,” Theatre Washington said in a news release. “He offered nuanced theatre criticism and reporting with respect, relish, and generosity.”
The Helen Hayes Awards launched in 1984 and, for the past decade, have been split into two designations: “Helen” for smaller productions with mostly non-equity actors and “Hayes” for larger shows with mostly equity casts. Solas Nua’s world-premiere drama “The Honey Trap” led all Helen productions with 10 nominations, including the Charles MacArthur Award for outstanding new play or musical.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
The nominations for “Swept Away,” a new jukebox musical about a 19th-century shipwreck, included nods for director Michael Mayer and three actors: John Gallagher Jr., Stark Sands and Adrian Blake Enscoe, all of whom will compete in the gender-neutral lead performer in a musical category.
“Ragtime’s” Nkrumah Gatling will also contend for that prize, with co-stars Awa Sal Secka, Dani Stoller, Matthew Lamb and Rizzo up for supporting performer in a musical. That quartet will face three actors from the Kennedy Center’s revival of “Monty Python’s Spamalot” — a spring production that earned a Broadway transfer — in Rob McClure, Leslie Rodriguez Kritzer and Michael Urie. (McClure also picked up a nod for performer in a visiting production for “Mrs. Doubtfire” at the National Theatre.)
“Shout Sister Shout!” at Ford’s Theatre and “Fela!,” an Olney Theatre Center and Round House Theatre co-production, joined “Swept Away,” “Ragtime” and “Spamalot” in the best musical (Hayes) category.
“Angels in America,” playwright Tony Kushner’s fantastical portrait of life amid the AIDS epidemic, landed nominations for five actors: lead performers Deborah Ann Woll and Nick Westrate and supporting performers Billie Krishawn, Justin Weaks and Susan Rome. “Angels” will face Studio Theatre’s “Fat Ham,” the Shakespeare Theatre Company’s “Here There Are Blueberries,” Woolly Mammoth Theatre’s “My Mama and the Full-Scale Invasion” and Signature’s “King of the Yees” for best play (Hayes).
The immersive refugee drama “The Jungle,” which followed engagements in London, New York and San Francisco with a Shakespeare Theatre staging, led all visiting productions with five nominations.
Theatre Washington also honored GALA Hispanic Theatre Executive Director Rebecca Medrano with the Victor Shargai Leadership Award during the nominations announcement at the Atlas Performing Arts Center.
Medrano has navigated GALA through myriad challenges over the past year, including the May death of her husband, Hugo — with whom she co-founded the Columbia Heights institution in 1976 — and the search for his successor as artistic director that ended with the December hiring of Gustavo Ott. Just days into Ott’s tenure, GALA last week said a cyberattack drained its coffers of more than $250,000, prompting the theater to call for donations it says are necessary for the company to stay afloat while it attempts to recover the funds.
The Helen Hayes Awards are determined by 49 volunteer judges, who considered 151 eligible productions. A list of nominees from all 41 categories can be found on the Theatre Washington website."
WZXE5Y8S8K_P9FU2TDA7CE4OOI,AI is destabilizing ‘the concept of truth itself’ in 2024 election,Pranshu Verma,"January 22, 2024 at 5:31 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/22/ai-deepfake-elections-politicians/,"Experts in artificial intelligence have long warned that AI-generated content could muddy the waters of perceived reality. Weeks into a pivotal election year, AI confusion is on the rise.
Politicians around the globe have been swatting away potentially damning pieces of evidence — grainy video footage of hotel trysts, voice recordings criticizing political opponents — by dismissing them as AI-generated fakes. At the same time, AI deepfakes are being used to spread misinformation.
On Monday, the New Hampshire Justice Department said it was investigating robocalls featuring what appeared to be an AI-generated voice that sounded like President Biden telling voters to skip the Tuesday primary — the first notable use of AI for voter suppression this campaign cycle.
Last month, former president Donald Trump dismissed an ad on Fox News featuring video of his well-documented public gaffes — including his struggle to pronounce the word “anonymous” in Montana and his visit to the California town of “Pleasure,” a.k.a. Paradise, both in 2018 — claiming the footage was generated by AI.
“The perverts and losers at the failed and once disbanded Lincoln Project, and others, are using A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) in their Fake television commercials in order to make me look as bad and pathetic as Crooked Joe Biden, not an easy thing to do,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “FoxNews shouldn’t run these ads.”
The Lincoln Project, a political action committee formed by moderate Republicans to oppose Trump, swiftly denied the claim; the ad featured incidents during Trump’s presidency that were widely covered at the time and witnessed in real life by many independent observers.
Still, AI creates a “liar’s dividend,” said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies digital propaganda and misinformation. “When you actually do catch a police officer or politician saying something awful, they have plausible deniability” in the age of AI.
AI “destabilizes the concept of truth itself,” added Libby Lange, an analyst at the misinformation tracking organization Graphika. “If everything could be fake, and if everyone’s claiming everything is fake or manipulated in some way, there’s really no sense of ground truth. Politically motivated actors, especially, can take whatever interpretation they choose.”
Trump is not alone in seizing this advantage. Around the world, AI is becoming a common scapegoat for politicians trying to fend off damaging allegations.
Late last year, a grainy video surfaced of a ruling-party Taiwanese politician entering a hotel with a woman, indicating he was having an affair. Commentators and other politicians quickly came to his defense, saying the footage was AI-generated — though it remains unclear whether it actually was.
In April, a 26-second voice recording was leaked in which a politician in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu appeared to accuse his own party of illegally amassing $3.6 billion, according to reporting by Rest of World. The politician denied the recording’s veracity, calling it “machine generated”; experts have said they are unsure whether the audio is real or fake.
AI companies have generally said their tools shouldn’t be used in political campaigns now, but enforcement has been spotty. On Friday, OpenAI banned a developer from using its tools after the developer built a bot mimicking long-shot Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips. Phillips’s campaign had supported the bot, but after The Washington Post reported on it, OpenAI deemed that it broke rules against use of its tech for campaigns.
AI-related confusion is also swirling beyond politics. Last week, social media users began circulating an audio clip they claimed was a Baltimore County, Md., school principal on a racist tirade against Jewish people and Black students. The union that represents the principal has said the audio is AI-generated.
Several signs do point to that conclusion, including the uniform cadence of the speech and indications of splicing, said Farid, who analyzed the audio. But without knowing where it came from or in what context it was recorded, he said, it’s impossible to say for sure.
On social media, commenters overwhelmingly seem to believe the audio is real, and the school district says it has launched an investigation. A request for comment to the principal through his union was not returned.
These claims hold weight because AI deepfakes are more common now and better at replicating a person’s voice and appearance. Deepfakes regularly go viral on X, Facebook and other social platforms. Meanwhile, the tools and methods to identify an AI-created piece of media are not keeping up with rapid advances in AI’s ability to generate such content.
Actual fake images of Trump have gone viral multiple times. Early this month, actor Mark Ruffalo posted AI images of Trump with teenage girls, claiming the images showed the former president on a private plane owned by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ruffalo later apologized.
Trump, who has spent weeks railing against AI on Truth Social, posted about the incident, saying, “This is A.I., and it is very dangerous for our Country!”
Rising concern over AI’s impact on politics and the world economy was a major theme at the conference of world leaders and CEOs in Davos, Switzerland, last week. In her remarks opening the conference, Swiss President Viola Amherd called AI-generated propaganda and lies “a real threat” to world stability, “especially today when the rapid development of artificial intelligence contributes to the increasing credibility of such fake news.”
Tech and social media companies say they are looking into creating systems to automatically check and moderate AI-generated content purporting to be real, but have yet to do so. Meanwhile, only experts possess the tech and expertise to analyze a piece of media and determine whether it’s real or fake.
That leaves too few people capable of truth-squadding content that can now be generated with easy-to-use AI tools available to almost anyone.
“You don’t have to be a computer scientist. You don’t have to be able to code,” Farid said. “There’s no barrier to entry anymore.”
Aviv Ovadya, an expert on AI’s impact on democracy and an affiliate at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center, said the general public is far more aware of AI deepfakes now compared with five years ago. As politicians see others evade criticism by claiming evidence released against them is AI, more people will make that claim.
“There’s a contagion effect,” he said, noting a similar rise in politicians falsely calling an election rigged.
Ovadya said technology companies have the tools to regulate the problem: They could watermark audio to create a digital fingerprint or join a coalition meant to prevent the spreading of misleading information online by developing technical standards that establish the origins of media content. Most importantly, he said, they could tweak their algorithms so they don’t promote sensational but potentially false content.
So far, he said, tech companies have mostly failed to take action to safeguard the public’s perception of reality.
“As long as the incentives continue to be engagement-driven sensationalism, and really conflict,” he said, “those are the kinds of content — whether deepfake or not — that’s going to be surfaced.”

X2VVWJPZTL_X4OASNWDZWL0GUN,A rural community fights to keep education options after college closes,_,"January 26, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/26/rural-colleges-close-chatfield-college/,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ohio — Ghosts populate the campus of Chatfield College.
They’re in the fading photos on the library walls of students who, over 177 years, attended the college and the boarding school from which it sprang, and of the Ursuline nuns who taught them, in their tunics and scapulars.
Amid seemingly endless acres of tobacco, soybean and wheat farms in a village in southwest Ohio with a population of 241, the now-closed college sits at the end of a narrow entrance road flanked by Bradford pear trees, colorless and bare in the winter gloom.
Chatfield has been shut down for a year now, although the buildings and grounds remain so neatly tended that they look as if they’re ready for the students to return. It’s among a fast-growing number of closed colleges in rural America, stripping communities of nearby higher-education options to which young people can aspire and eventually go.
In this case, however, something unusual has happened: The assets left by the defunct college are being used to help some local students continue their educations past high school.
It’s a story that underscores the role played by colleges and universities in rural America, what’s lost when they close and how advocates are trying to keep the proportion of rural high school graduates who go to college from falling further than it has.
“It was a really great starting point for me, and it could have been a starting point for other students,” said Anna Robertson, 23, who attended Chatfield until the end.
Locals once saw greater potential for the college, which was founded in 1845 as a boarding school by an English-born Ursuline nun named Julia Chatfield. In the early 20th century, it benefited from being close to U.S. 50, a heavily trafficked, major east-west route. And in 1971, it evolved into Chatfield College, which conferred two-year associate’s degrees.
“It was the heart of the area,” said Amber Saeidi Asl, who grew up next to the campus.
Just having a college nearby inspired her to go there, she said.
“A lot of kids that wouldn’t otherwise go to college felt comfortable coming here,” Mary Jacobs, a Chatfield graduate who later worked as its director of finance, said in a video history. “If it hadn’t been for this college, a lot of them wouldn’t have attended college at all.”
But the interstate highway system long ago supplanted U.S. 50. Even the village where the college was located, St. Martin, was dissolved in 2011; the campus was absorbed into Fayetteville.
Like other small, rural, tuition-dependent and religiously affiliated institutions, Chatfield grew more imperiled as Americans increasingly questioned the cost and value of postsecondary education. There are only about 80 two-year private, nonprofit colleges left, fewer than half as many as just 30 years ago.
Chatfield was also in a part of the country that has been among the most acutely affected by a decline in the number of high school graduates and their interest in going to college. The percentage of Ohio high school students going directly to college fell to 53 percent by 2020, the most recent year for which the figure is available — nearly 10 percentage points below its peak.
Even though Chatfield accepted everyone who applied, it was down to 129 students in its last semester, according to federal data. Nearly half took their classes exclusively online.
The college had an annual budget of around $4.5 million, and it lost $373,528 in 2020 and $850,282 in 2021, tax records show.
“We could see the enrollment trends,” said Robert Elmore, Chatfield’s last president. “We just didn’t see how we could sustain this and continue operating.”
So the school announced in the fall of 2022 that it would shut down at the end of that semester, taking 70 jobs with it. The closure barely made the headlines. But  Chatfield had joined more than a dozen other private, nonprofit universities and colleges in rural areas, or that serve rural students, that have closed or announced their closings since 2020.
Nearly 13 million Americans now live in places, mostly in the Midwest and Great Plains, where the nearest college or university is beyond a reasonable commute away, the American Council on Education reports. The nearest colleges to the Chatfield campus — a community college and a branch of the University of Cincinnati — are about 45 minutes away.
“For a lot of college students who are living in rural areas, it’s just not feasible to drive to one of the city universities,” Robertson said.
Helping people to overcome those kinds of obstacles is now the purpose of the nonprofit organization set up with the remaining Chatfield College endowment, which Elmore put at $4 million. The organization also claims the grounds and buildings as assets, valued along with the endowment at $11 million.
The organization, called the Chatfield Edge, has provided volunteer mentors, career counseling, assistance with admission and financial aid applications, and other help to 21 students, and scholarships of about $1,500 per semester to 19 of them, said David Hesson, director of programs, who was an associate dean at the college.
It’s not only about getting students to college; the Chatfield Edge will also help with trade school and certificate programs. The target is low-income high school students who would be the first in their families to go to college and students who are older than the traditional age. Robertson, who is finishing her bachelor’s degree at Asbury University in Kentucky, is among the beneficiaries.
“We said we don’t have to necessarily provide the education. But we could support them, and we know what that looks like, and we have the scholarship money to cover the gap,” Elmore said.
Other than Hesson and Elmore, the only former Chatfield employees left are a facilities director and the director of development. They work in the onetime student center. An Ursuline sister, Patricia Homan, has an office in a separate, otherwise empty building, and spends time in the library compiling an archive of the college’s history.
The small number of students helped so far speaks to the challenges faced by the Chatfield Edge and other organizations promoting access to college and other education after high school for young people growing up in rural places.
“A lot of the kids I knew grew up to do what their parents did,” said Saeidi Asl, who now volunteers as a mentor. “If your parents were farmers, you became a farmer. If your parents were truckers, you became a trucker.”
That was not the case for Destiny Jones, who also was at Chatfield when it closed.
“I didn’t think I was going to do well in the workforce without an education,” Jones said. “I’m a person who needs to be told how to do something.” Plus, “it was going to lead to a higher-paying job.”
Jones, who is 21, was speaking at a day-care center where she works during breaks to help make money for tuition at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, which she attends on her way to getting a degree in art education and becoming a teacher.
Going to Chatfield was much easier. “I didn’t feel like I had to stress about not being able to get there,” she said. Now, at Mount St. Joseph, “I definitely get pretty homesick, especially in the middle of the semester.” As someone who is close to her family, “I didn’t want to be away.”
Rural high school graduates are far less likely to go directly to college than their suburban counterparts, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center — 56 percent, compared to 62 percent, respectively. That’s down substantially in the past  three years.
A big reason for this is a lack of confidence, Hesson said. “They don’t think they can do it. It’s unknown.” And without a college close by, “you lose accessibility.”
Like Jones, rural students who do go to college generally prefer to stay close to home, research shows.
Robertson said she misses having a college closer to home than the Kentucky college where she goes now, which is 2½ hours away. It was also cheaper,  because she could commute.
Her new life “is a pretty different experience,” Robertson said. “I’m living away from home for the first time. It’s a much bigger campus. There’s more of a sense of anonymity. It can be a little lonely.”
Small rural colleges are more supportive, said Homan, the Ursuline nun and archivist, who also went to Chatfield and later worked there and at a tiny branch campus in Cincinnati that has also closed. “I was the cheerleader,” she said. “I found students if they didn’t show up. If they didn’t have bus fare, we would help them with that.”
Her experience of working in the area “is that the older generation says, ‘I don’t have a college education and I did fine.’ Students aren’t looking for a college education. It is not the aspiration.”
Many people, when they’re older, find they do need one, however. That was the case for Jackie Schmidt, who got her associate’s degree at Chatfield and went on to a successful career as an office manager and accounting manager before helping to start a contract manufacturing company. When she was laid off, she found “the jobs I thought I was qualified for required a bachelor’s degree.” But “I was intimidated at this age to be going back to school.”
Schmidt, now 56, found her way to the Chatfield Edge and, with its help, enrolled in an online bachelor’s degree program in business administration.
With rural colleges closing, she said she worried “not only for kids just getting out of high school but adults who decide they want to go back to school — what avenues do they have?”
Chatfield College created a sense of community not only for its students, but for the surrounding township, said April Houk, a Fayetteville resident, who lives a mile from the campus on a 1,300-acre farm. Her husband’s grandmother worked there as a cook, and Houk went to summer camps at Chatfield and was married in the chapel.
“We loved this place,” she said. “It really has a lot of history.”
She looked around at the all-but-abandoned campus. “It almost makes you emotional — the integrity it brought to the community.” Even though it’s no longer operating, she said, “I still say, ‘I live one mile from Chatfield College at the stop sign.’ It’s sad to have it gone.”
Without the college, “We lose that educational opportunity and the gifts that these young people have if they were educated,” said Homan, who is now on the board of the Chatfield Edge and Schmidt’s mentor. She, too, looked around the campus. “Oh my gosh, it’s quiet. But it lives on. It does. I know that.”

X4LG36PEY7_P4YBSLMMEPQ6OEK,Germany’s surging far right provokes a reckoning,Ishaan Tharoor,"January 23, 2024 at 12:00 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/23/germany-far-right-alternative-for-germany-afd-reckoning-protest-future/,"You’re reading an excerpt from the Today’s WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.
Over the weekend, it seemed a nation’s conscience had stirred into action. In cities across Germany, anti-fascist demonstrators took to the streets, protesting against the country’s far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD. The spark to the demonstrations came in the form of an investigate report published earlier this month that revealed how AfD members had participated in a November meeting with far-right extremists where they discussed plans to conduct mass deportations should they come to power.
That’s not the wholly fictive scenario it once used to be. The surging AfD is polling at 22 percent — a level of support greater than what each of the three centrist and center-left parties in the country’s ruling coalition currently command. It seems poised to break the “cordon sanitaire” erected around it by Germany’s more mainstream parties that have so far refused to entertain coalition talks with the far-right faction and possibly shoulder its way into power in state elections later this year.
That AfD officials were openly entertaining the idea of forced repatriation of migrants and even some German nationals of foreign origin horrified many in a country with a deep memory of its dark past. By some accounts, more than a million people participated in the anti-AfD protests.
“In Hamburg and Munich, rallies had to be dispersed because significantly more people than expected attended. Aerial images from across the country showed masses of people braving bitter January temperatures to fill city squares and avenues,” reported my colleague Kate Brady. “According to police figures, in Berlin on Sunday, about 100,000 people gathered on the lawns of the Reichstag, which houses Germany’s lower house of parliament.”
Signs and slogans at the rallies made clear what many Germans believe is at stake. Banners warned of the return of “Nazis” — and marchers summoned the legacy of the 1930s, when Adolf Hitler and his allies seized control via the ballot box. “Everyone, together, against fascism” was the chant in Berlin.
The investigative report by nonprofit research institute Correctiv detailed the extensive private discussions had between AfD members and a coterie of influential right-wing extremists and wealthy business executives at a November meeting in a hotel in Potsdam, outside of Berlin. This included talk of a “remigration” plan that would deport asylum seekers, non-Germans with residency rights and even “non-assimilated” German citizens.
Martin Sellner, a far-right extremist and leader of the Austrian “Identitarian Movement,” attended the gathering and floated a “master plan” that could even see these deportees sent to an imagined “model state” in North Africa. Whatever the unviability of the proposals, it echoed Nazi deliberations in 1940 to forcibly relocate millions of Jews to Madagascar. Sellner once maintained correspondence with Brenton Tarrant, the white nationalist gunmen who carried out the hideous 2019 killing spree at a set of mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Top AfD leaders have sought to distance themselves from the meetings, arguing that they were not officially sanctioned by the party and do not reflect its stated agenda. Alice Weidel, the party’s co-leader, said in a recent interview with the Financial Times that the AfD’s views were unfairly stigmatized and criticized the methods Correctiv used to infiltrate the gathering.
“It was just an attempt to criminalize the very idea of repatriating people lawfully who don’t have leave to remain here, or are subject to a deportation order,” said Weidel, whose close aide Roland Hartwig reportedly attended the November event. “The AfD is the party that stands for enforcing this country’s laws.”
Over 1 million rally in Germany against rising power of far-right party
That’s a claim bound to raise eyebrows. In three German states, party officials are known to be under surveillance by the German domestic spy agency for their “certified right-wing extremist” positions. Some of the party’s opponents want Germany’s judicial authorities to intervene and ban the party under provisions in the German constitution that allow for the banning of factions the “seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order.”
More than a million people have signed a petition calling on constitutional authorities to strip Björn Höcke, the AfD party chief in the state of Thuringia, of his rights to vote and participate in politics because of the “fascist” threat he poses for the country’s democracy and Germans of migrant background.
But there’s a high bar for such a measure and the German political establishment, including deputy chancellor Robert Habeck, is broadly leery of endorsing such efforts, fearful they may backfire. Already, the party is channeling the notoriety of being under surveillance in its favor, wearing the classification as “a badge of honor, using it as yet further proof that it’s the only real alternative to the other parties,” noted Georg Mascolo, political columnist at the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The party’s extended surge in the polls comes on the back of mounting discontent with the ruling coalition. “Even though 2024 is just a few weeks old, Germany has already been rocked by huge farmers’ protests, with thousands of tractors blocking cities and motorway junctions this past week alone,” detailed Spiked’s Fraser Myers. “It has been crippled by transport workers’ and doctors’ strikes. Factories in its much-vaunted manufacturing sector are shutting down and shipping production elsewhere. The federal government is struggling to reckon with a budget crisis and is ushering in a new age of austerity. Data released this week showed that Germany had the worst economic performance last year of any major economy.”
Germany’s far-right party wins mayoral election, showing group’s rising appeal
In this backdrop, the avowedly anti-establishment AfD is picking up momentum. “Calls for the AfD to be banned are completely absurd and expose the anti-democratic attitude of those making these demands,” Weidel said in a written statement to Politico, echoing the line one may hear from former U.S. president Donald Trump and his supporters as his legal travails follow over the course of this election cycle.
In her interview with the Times, Weidel looked confidently ahead to the coming months, when the AfD is expected to perform well in upcoming European parliamentary elections. She even raised the possibility of her nation following Britain out of the European Union. “If we fail to rebuild the sovereignty of the E.U. member states, we should let the people decide, just as Britain did,” she told the British newspaper. “And we could have a referendum on ‘Dexit’ — a German exit from the EU.”
For now, the AfD’s opponents hope to kneecap the far right before it gets close to achieving its goals. “You are a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” Lars Klingbeil, leader of the Social Democrats, told Weidel during a Bundestag debate last week. “But I’m telling you: your facade is beginning to crumble. People are finally getting to see the real face of the AfD.”"
XFT1TEDCK4_8HA1RKYCFZ9ARO4,"Can Mississippi strip felons, including tree thieves, of voting rights? Federal judges hear the case",_,"January 23, 2024 at 4:23 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/01/23/voting-rights-mississippi-felons/d2663510-b9af-11ee-b176-fe5fd794e716_story.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Whether permanently stripping voting rights from some Mississippi felons amounts to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment is being weighed by 19 federal appellate judges, some of whom said during a hearing Tuesday that it should be decided by lawmakers, not a court.
At issue before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans was Mississippi’s prohibition on voting for those convicted of any of a list of various felonies, including nonviolent ones such as forgery or timber theft. The outcome could affect voting rights for tens of thousands.
Criminal justice advocates won a major victory in August when a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled that the ban violates the Constitution’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. But the full 17-member circuit court vacated that ruling weeks later and scheduled Tuesday’s hearing.
Judge Kyle Duncan was among 5th Circuit judges who suggested during questioning that the Legislature, not judges, should prescribe punishment for a crime. “There is no judicial calculus to tell the difference between a rapist, and an armed robber and a car thief — and a timber thief, for that matter,” Duncan told attorney Jon Youngwood, who was arguing against disenfranchisement.
Judge Stephen Higginson appeared to be more sympathetic to Youngwood’s argument, noting that Mississippi is unusual in permanently disenfranchising people for lesser felonies. And he pushed back against Mississippi attorney Scott Stewart’s contention that the voting ban is not a criminal punishment, but a regulation regarding fitness to vote.
Permanently disenfranchising someone, Higginson said, “sounds punitive.”
The court’s 17 full-time active judges heard arguments, along with two senior-status, part-time judges who sat on the panel that ruled against the ban in August. They gave no indication when they would rule.
Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of 10 specific felonies, including bribery, theft and arson, lose the right to vote. Under a previous state attorney general, the list was expanded to 22 crimes, including timber larceny — felling and stealing trees from someone else’s property — and carjacking.
To have their voting rights restored, people convicted of any of the crimes must get a pardon from the governor or persuade lawmakers to pass individual bills just for them with two-thirds approval. Lawmakers in recent years have passed few of those bills, and they passed none in 2023.
“Mississippi stands as an outlier among its sister states, bucking a clear and consistent trend in our Nation against permanent disenfranchisement,” Senior Judge James Dennis wrote in the August opinion, joined by Senior Judge Carolyn Dineen King. Both judges were nominated to the court by Democratic presidents — King by Jimmy Carter and Dennis by Bill Clinton.
Also on the panel was Judge Edith Jones, still on full-time status nearly 40 years after she was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan. In a dissent to the August ruling, Jones cited a previous Supreme Court ruling regarding felons’ disenfranchisement, saying it is up to legislatures to decide such matters.
Tuesday’s hearing will include Jones and 16 other full-time members of the court. King and Dennis will also take part because they were members of the original ruling panel. The 5th Circuit is one of the most conservative circuit appeals courts, with 12 of its full-time posts filled by nominees of Republican presidents. Duncan was nominated by former President Donald Trump, Higginson by former President Barack Obama.

XIQCG2XPLT_ZDIIRCP3R7KZKEE,Chicago officer given 90 days home detention for entering Capitol on Jan. 6,Tom Jackman,"January 24, 2024 at 7:05 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/24/chicago-cop-sentenced-jan6/,"A Chicago police officer who entered the U.S. Capitol during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, in his police sweatshirt and was later convicted of four misdemeanors by a D.C. jury, was sentenced Wednesday to 90 days of home detention and three years of probation.
Karol Chwiesiuk, 32, remains on the Chicago force on unpaid leave, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Prosecutors said he is now working as a part-time security officer. His sister Agnieszka Chwiesiuk, 30, who joined Chwiesiuk on his journey to D.C. and then inside the Capitol, received an identical sentence from U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes.
Chwiesiuk took multiple selfies both inside and outside the grounds, including some on Jan. 5 standing in front of signs noting that the grounds were closed. The Chwiesiuks opted for a jury trial on their misdemeanor trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. They claimed they did not know they weren’t permitted in the Capitol, though when they entered shortly before 3 p.m., mayhem was rampant and they climbed through a broken door.
Chicago officer charged in Jan. 6 riot wore a police sweatshirt to the Capitol, U.S. alleges
“I just find it unbelievable,” Reyes told the brother and sister, “that you two didn’t know you shouldn’t be in the Capitol.”
Prosecutors asked Reyes to sentence Karol Chwiesiuk to 12 months of incarceration and to order Agnieszka Chwiesiuk to serve eight months, asking the judge to enhance the brother’s sentence because of multiple misstatements on the witness stand in his trial. Karol Chwiesiuk testified that he didn’t know what was happening at the Capitol that day, despite advance notices on his phone of protests at the Capitol, and that he saw no signs that anything was amiss that day, despite smashed windows and hand-to-hand combat between police and rioters.
A jury convicted the brother and sister in August of four counts of disorderly conduct on restricted grounds and trespassing, but prosecutors noted that the two remained defiant. Records show Agnieszka Chwiesiuk wrote on a fundraising page that she was arrested “as part of the January 6th witch hunt” and that the “prosecution is politically motivated.”
“It was still rather tame,” Karol Chwiesiuk told the judge Wednesday, “compared to the rioting I witnessed as a police officer in 2020” during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd. “My work desensitized me to rioters’ behavior.”
Reyes declined to increase the sentence because of his testimony, saying she would not penalize him for going to trial or taking the stand. She made it clear that she did not think the brother and sister deserved jail time because neither of them had criminal records, they were in the Capitol for less than 10 minutes, and they did not commit any violence or vandalism.
Chwiesiuk said that while he was in the Capitol, he approached an officer, spoke briefly to him, and then told his sister they needed to leave. “As a police officer,” he told the judge, “I honestly believe I had no choice but to enter the Capitol. My presence there could have been beneficial, right?” He said if he had witnessed an attack on police, he would have helped the officers.
“Am I remorseful? To an extent, right?” Chwiesiuk said. His sister did not speak to the judge.
When the Chicago police learned in June 2021 that Chwiesiuk was being investigated, they immediately suspended his police powers. He was arrested nine days later. “The fact that a Chicago police officer has been charged in that attack on American democracy,” then-Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said, “makes my blood boil.”
Reyes, handling only her fifth sentencing after being appointed to the bench last year by President Biden, said she did not think the Chwiesiuks drove from Chicago to the District with the intent to invade the Capitol, though Karol Chwiesiuk did text a cousin on Jan. 3 that he was traveling “to save the nation” and also to harm “some commies.”
The judge, frustrated by the lasting belief held by some that the rioters were justified, implored the Chwiesiuks to imagine if they had a brother working as an officer in the Capitol on Jan. 6 and it were overrun by supporters of Joe Biden. She asked them to consider receiving texts from their brother saying the Capitol was being overrun by rioters, and watching video of their brother being assaulted.
“You guys can give me whatever looks you want,” the judge told the Chwiesiuks as they stared at her, “but all of this happened.”
She said she wasn’t going to place them behind bars, but “I’m going to make it as painful as I can without going to prison.” In addition to the home detention and the probation, she ordered both to complete 200 hours of community service.
“Maybe in five years, 10 years from now,” Reyes said, “you’ll say, ‘It was wrong of me to participate in this.’”
Of the roughly 740 defendants who have been sentenced for their role on Jan. 6, 400 have been placed on probation that extends past the upcoming presidential election, a Washington Post database shows. About 106 defendants also have received home detention as part of their sentences.
The report: The Jan. 6 committee released its final report, marking the culmination of an 18-month investigation into the violent insurrection. Read The Post’s analysis about the committee’s new findings and conclusions.
The final hearing: The House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol held its final public meeting where members referred four criminal charges against former president Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department. Here’s what the criminal referrals mean.
The riot: On Jan. 6, 2021, a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. Five people died on that day or in the immediate aftermath, and 140 police officers were assaulted.
Inside the siege: During the rampage, rioters came perilously close to penetrating the inner sanctums of the building while lawmakers were still there, including former vice president Mike Pence. The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and videos to create a video timeline of what happened on Jan. 6. Here’s what we know about what Trump did on Jan. 6."
XMFHTS18E6_54NQH6TYG73GO3L,Opinion A top U.N. court’s ruling on Israel and Gaza is a perversion of justice,Ruth Marcus,"January 26, 2024 at 4:41 p.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/26/un-international-court-justice-israel-gaza-south-africa/,"Somewhere, Raphael Lemkin is weeping.
Lemkin was a Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust, coined the term “genocide” and campaigned for the United Nations to declare genocide a crime punishable under international law. On the 50th anniversary of the genocide convention in 2001, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan called Lemkin “an inspiring example of moral engagement.”
The same cannot be said of Annan’s institution. In a complaint to the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ main judicial body, South Africa accused Israel of acts that are “genocidal in character” in waging war in Gaza — and, grotesquely, quoted Lemkin in support of its charges. “Israel, its officials and/or agents, have acted with the intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza,” South Africa claimed.
On Friday, the ICJ issued a preliminary ruling against Israel. It could have been far worse: The order stopped short of instructing Israel to immediately cease military operations in Gaza, as South Africa had sought. But the court found, in the anodyne language of international law, that “at least some of the acts and omissions alleged … to have been committed by Israel in Gaza appear to be capable of falling within the provisions of the Convention.”
This is a gross misreading of genocide; indeed, it is a perversion of the term. It would be appalling applied against any state, but it is especially offensive wielded against Israel — a country that was forged in the ashes of the worst genocide in human history, that was one of the early signatories to the genocide convention and that is now responding to the greatest slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust.
If there is a party guilty of genocidal intent and acts in this war, it is Hamas — although, because it is not a state, the terrorist group cannot be brought before the ICJ. Hamas speaks in its founding charter of “the Jews’ usurpation” of the land and “our struggle against the Jews.” It proclaims that “the day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them.”
Hamas is committed to the destruction of Israel and would repeat the atrocities of Oct. 7 if permitted. “Israel is a country that has no place on our land,” senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamid told a Lebanese TV station after the attack. “We must teach Israel a lesson, and we will do this again and again. The Al-Aqsa Flood is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth.” Who has genocidal intent here?
None of this is to defend the entirety of Israel’s actions before or after Oct. 7. I am a proud Jew and Zionist, but I am also no supporter of the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ultra-Orthodox and settler allies. Israel’s relentless expansion of settlements in the West Bank and mistreatment of Palestinians are indefensible and counterproductive.
As to the current war, Hamas is doubly at fault, yet that does not leave Israel blameless. First, Hamas is responsible for the barbaric attack; Israel was amply justified in responding to prevent future slaughter. Second, Hamas is responsible for the terrible scope of civilian casualties, having deliberately embedded itself within the civilian population in Gaza. Keep in mind: None of this — none — would be happening were it not for Hamas.
Still, Israel is left in a terrible predicament as it seeks to hobble, if not destroy, Hamas and recover the hostages, whose seizure and captivity itself constitute a war crime. When attacks can be expected to cause civilian casualties, the law of war requires that they be proportionate to the military objective; there is a duty to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to noncombatants. Given the ferocity and scope of the attack, Israel has the right and duty to defend itself.
But it is fair to question, as the Biden administration has, whether the Israeli response has gone too far — whether the collateral damage is disproportionate, given the effective impossibility of eradicating Hamas, and, at the very least, whether Israel is doing itself a disservice in the court of public opinion.
All of this is a far cry, however, from deeming Israel’s actions genocidal. Let’s go to the text of the genocide convention, which requires both acts and intent. The acts include killing members of a “national, ethnical, racial or religious group”; causing them “serious bodily or mental harm”; and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.” Those acts must be accompanied by intent: “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
Is that Israel’s aim here? Killing civilians serves the interests of Hamas and undermines those of Israel. Israel has taken extraordinary steps to prevent civilian casualties and otherwise mitigate the suffering of innocents. To argue those have not been enough — or even that Israel’s conduct violated international humanitarian law — is not to conclude that the actions are genocidal. If Hamas magically disappeared tomorrow, if Israel found its safety somehow assured, it would have no interest, none, in causing any harm to the civilian population.
The court’s opinion conveniently ignores this. You would not know from reading it that Hamas locates its operations within the civilian population, precisely to use civilians as human shields and to maximize casualties. The order focuses instead on a few statements by Israeli officials in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7 that were inadvisable but fall far short of demonstrating genocidal intent — for example, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s statement, “We are fighting human animals.”
The sole dissenter, Justice Julia Sebutinde of Uganda, said South Africa hadn’t come close to proving its case. She noted Israel’s “restricted and targeted attacks of legitimate military targets in Gaza,” its “mitigation of civilian harm by warning them through leaflets, radio messages and telephone calls of impending attacks,” and its “facilitation of humanitarian assistance.”
The problematic Israeli statements, she said, were yanked out of context or misinterpreted, while the “official war policy of the Israeli Government, as presented to the Court, contains no indicators of a genocidal intent.” Somehow, the majority couldn’t manage to say the same.
The most searing statement of all came from Israel’s representative to the court, Aharon Barak, a former Israeli Supreme Court justice who survived the Holocaust as a boy in Lithuania and emerged to be a champion of human rights in Israel. “Genocide is more than just a word for me; it represents calculated destruction and human behavior at its very worst,” Barak wrote. “It is the gravest possible accusation and is deeply intertwined with my personal life experience.”
Barak, invoking Lemkin, convincingly demonstrated how the court’s approach served to “dilute the concept of genocide” and was at odds with the high standards for proving intent applied in other, far more compelling cases. For example, he noted, the ICJ concluded that, except for the 1995 massacre of Muslims in Srebrenica, “the widespread and serious atrocities committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina were not carried out with the specific intent to destroy, in part, the Bosnian Muslim group.”
In comparison to the “scant evidence” of genocidal intent by Israel relied on here, he noted, the ICJ, investigating Myanmar’s treatment of the Muslim Rohingya, engaged in “meticulous collection of evidence over two years, which included 400 interviews with victims and eyewitnesses, analysis of satellite imagery, photographs and videos, the cross-checking of information against credible secondary information, expert interviews and raw data” before concluding that there was “plausible” proof of intent.
What accounts for the different treatment of Israel? I can’t help but think it is the same one that necessitated the existence of a Jewish state to begin with."
XNXYZ6OFJ8_FP1WK9ZQA8EXV5P,Intense storms — fueled by El Niño — are set to bombard West Coast,_,"January 26, 2024 at 12:25 p.m. EST",20240119,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/26/west-coast-storm-california-el-nino/,"A series of powerful atmospheric rivers is poised to strike the West Coast beginning Friday and possibly lasting into early February. The dynamic weather setup has the potential to fuel flooding anywhere from western Canada to Southern California over the next week, as a supercharged jet stream races across the Pacific over unusually warm waters amid a strong El Niño. How the pattern will evolve is far from certain, however, and many parts of the West running behind on rain and snow this season will benefit from the injection of moisture.
The prolonged stormy period kicks off Friday with a landfalling atmospheric river on the California-Oregon border. A second storm following close behind is set to target the Pacific Northwest on Sunday.
But all eyes are on the strongest system in the series, which is forecast to make landfall Tuesday in British Columbia and eventually progress southward as far as Southern California, bringing heavy rain, snow and high winds to a large swath of the West.
Moisture will surge into the Pacific Northwest and western Canada on Friday as strong atmospheric rivers strike the region into early next week. The southern coast of Oregon could see 5 to 6 inches of rain in less than 24 hours through Saturday. In some spots, storms could reach top-tier levels of 4 and 5 on the atmospheric river scale, indicating mostly hazardous rainfall conditions.
More than a foot of rain could fall on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington over the next week, while warmer temperatures and high snow levels could lead to quick rises on area rivers.
“Confidence is increasing [in] periods of moderate to heavy rain over western Washington between Friday and Tuesday,” the National Weather Service office serving Seattle wrote Thursday. “Flooding concerns are increasing, especially for rivers already running high, including the Skokomish.”
An atmospheric river is forecast to deliver heavy rain and snow to California mid- to late next week, but exactly how much — and how quickly the system will move through — remains uncertain.
It’s also unclear whether this wet pattern is a blip or a “regime shift” that could open the door for a parade of storms, but weather models suggest that the first 10 days of February could be wet and snowy for the Golden State.
An extended west-to-east jet stream typical during El Niño could steer warm storms into the state, tapping into a deep moisture plume from Hawaii. Rounds of dangerous waves could also slam the coastline.
San Diego is still reeling from flooding from an atmospheric river that struck on Monday. Some 2.73 inches of rain fell in a matter of hours — an intensity considered a 100-year event — on the fourth-wettest day in the city’s history. Officials said that San Diego hadn’t seen flooding of that magnitude since the 1930s. Damaging floods swept through the city’s southeastern urban neighborhoods when a high volume of water in a short period of time overwhelmed a concrete-lined creek.
Unusually warm water off the San Diego coastline “substantially” amped up Monday’s rainfall, “supercharging the moisture and heat in an atmospheric river that was already going to produce a decent amount but instead produced an exceptional amount,” Marty Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said in a briefing Tuesday.
Monday’s extreme rain tracks with how precipitation is trending in a warming world.
“There are going to be fewer days with moderate precipitation … but the top 1 percent wettest days are going to become much wetter,” Ralph said.

Although the upcoming wet pattern could cause impactful flooding, meteorologists have cautioned that the forecast is not calling for an extreme multiweek megastorm for California — also known as the “ARkStorm” scenario — a setup that put much of the state underwater during winter 1861-62 — that has been the subject of online rumors this week. Studies have shown the risks of such an event — or worse — have increased because of climate change.
“There is not currently any indication that an extreme flood event anywhere near this magnitude is on the horizon, despite the upcoming wet to very wet pattern in [California] and the possibly elevated flood risk during that period,” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said on X on Wednesday.
Still, meteorologists are urging the public to prepare for the storms and to stay tuned to official and trusted weather sources.
“We still DO NOT see any indication that next week’s system will cause major or devastating flooding,” the Weather Service office for the Bay Area wrote in a forecast discussion Friday morning. “With this event still being 5-6 days out, stay tuned to the forecast for the latest updates.”"
XOI02JMCJW_1JOUG82H870DY5I,How to fake a fireplace,_,"January 25, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/01/25/how-to-build-fake-fireplace/,"Fireplaces are indisputably cozy. They evoke fresh snow and hot cocoa, winter weekends holed up in rustic cabins, favorite stews simmering on the stove. While installing a real, wood-burning one requires serious construction and money, if it’s just those comforting vibes that you’re after — and not necessarily the genuine flames — there are easier alternatives.
Here’s how to pull off a faux fireplace, according to homeowners who’ve done it.
The first faux option is to go electric. These inserts, which generally range in price from a couple hundred dollars to a few thousand, offer the look of flames without actually producing any, meaning there’s no wood or ventilation required. While the exact technology varies from model to model, many versions pull off the fire effect with digital LED screens and mirrors that reflect and refract light. Some include faux logs.
If you already have a fireplace opening, just one that isn’t functional, you can put an electric insert directly into it. (If you don’t have an existing opening, you can build one; more on that below.) The key, according to Frank Martinelli, a contractor with MCM General Contracting Group in New Jersey, is measuring correctly and ensuring you’ve got a power source. The inserts come in a variety of sizes, depths and shapes (including arched) to work for the space you already have.
If you don’t have a preexisting outlet in the right spot, it’s not a major problem, as long as your home is built up to code with outlets every few feet. Tom Moschella, an independent contractor in Massachusetts, explains that a professional will have to snake wiring through the wall to set up a new outlet exactly where your new fireplace will plug in. Both he and Martinelli agreed this is an easy project that won’t take more than a day or two.
Maddie Kelly, who posts her DIY endeavors on Instagram as @bluerushhome, went with an electric insert for her home, settling on a model by PuraFlame that was “as realistic as fake fire can look.” She bought it on Amazon for just under $300. “I get compliments on it all the time, and it didn’t break the bank.”
It was important to Kelly that the insert generate real heat, if not real flames. How does this work? In most models, a fan sucks up air from the room, heats it with a metal coil, then expels it back out. Martinelli advises paying attention to the overall size of your space before selecting your insert. “If it gives off too much heat, you won’t want to sit in the room.”
If you don’t care about heat or the illusion of flames, a mantel over some kind of nook or opening is all you need.
For Lyndsey Wardman, an interior designer in Durham, England, her childhood home dictated her choice. “I grew up with an electric fire, so I was never keen on them personally,” she says. “I’d prefer just a space in which you have options like a log basket, candles or even books.”
Wardman created her fireplace focal point with a plaster bump-out, a vintage slab of wood repurposed from a railroad tie as a mantel, and a basket full of picturesque logs inside the hearth. It may not generate literal warmth, but it at least warms up the design of the room.
Ashley Taraneh, who’s documenting the DIY renovation of her home on Instagram as @myuglysplitlevel, has built three fake fireplaces of varying sizes and aesthetics, with and without electric inserts.
Whether you’re going electric or totally decorative, if you aren’t working with an existing fireplace opening, you’ll need to make a new one, either by cutting a hole into your wall or building one out. For a professional contractor, Moschella estimates building a new surround “wouldn’t take longer than a weekend, and that is with allowing your joint compound to dry.”
For the extra-ambitious homeowner, a DIY job isn’t out of the question. Kelly’s electric fireplace was the first project she tackled on her own when she started updating her house a year-and-a-half ago. She advises that you’ll need to know your way around a miter saw and a drill.
But if you have any reservations at all about your skill level, “I wouldn’t recommend just cutting into your already-existing wall yourself,” she warns. “There are studs and wires, and structural issues that could arise.” Kelly used inexpensive 2-by-4s from her local hardware store and drywall to build the opening for her electric insert. She framed the surround for her insert, measuring and determining where it would eventually sit, and then got to work drywalling. After her surround was constructed and the insert was installed, she added wood trim to frame it out. “It makes it look sealed into the wall and complete,” she says.
Building your own mantel is an arguably easier DIY task than crafting the entire opening. Taraneh has done it three different times, using pine construction lumber. Each of her mantels is essentially a hollow, rectangular box made from wood planks. She cut their edges at 45-degree angles, then “fit them together to make it look like a solid block of wood.” She stained them with a finish that made the wood appear aged.
You can also buy a premade mantel from a big-box source such as Wayfair, or for something more unique, try the vintage route, like the wood from an old railroad tie that Wardman repurposed.
If you’ve gone for a fireplace without an electric insert, you’ll need to finish and fill in the empty hollow.
Wardman suggests laying brick slips, or tiles that give the look and texture of actual brick, inside the empty space and on the hearth. Martinelli cautions that “there is a whole field of quality for brick slips” and that real-looking brick will probably be more expensive.
If the traditional brick look isn’t for you, any kind of tile will work, too. Or, for a lower commitment approach, you can also just use paint, as Wardman has done in her own home. “I like to change things up, and tile would be too permanent,” she says. For contrast, she painted her faux fireplace’s surround green and the interior beige.
For the final touch, filling the opening with pillar candles of varying heights can create a romantic look that incorporates some actual fire. Stacked logs, either on their own or in a wicker basket, are another reliable option. For the interior of her fireplace, Wardman filled a wicker basket with assorted logs wrapped in string lights.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that interior designer Lyndsey Wardman lived in Durham, North Carolina. She lives in Durham, England. The article has been corrected.

XTAK59ZKOS_XNYPUHS8PEPCSKA,Pastor accused of $3M crypto scam says he may have ‘misheard God’,Leo Sands,"January 23, 2024 at 9:54 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/23/crypto-pastor-colorado-god-eli-regalado/,"An online pastor was charged with civil fraud for selling a cryptocurrency that regulators described as “practically worthless.” His explanation: God told him to do it — although it’s possible he “misheard.”
Colorado’s securities commissioner filed a legal complaint against Eligio Regalado, who goes by Eli, and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, last week. The couple raised nearly $3.2 million by targeting Denver’s Christian community with the cryptocurrency, marketed as INDXcoin, the complaint said.
Investigators accused the couple of violating Colorado’s anti-fraud, licensing and registration laws. They alleged the cryptocurrency was promoted as a “low risk, high profit investment” while it was actually “illiquid and practically useless.” Cryptocurrency is usually able to be converted into cash or other currencies through a digital platform or trading exchange.
""The Lord said: I want you to build this,” Regalado said. “We took God at his word and sold a cryptocurrency with no clear exit.”
“We allege that Mr. Regalado took advantage of the trust and faith of his own Christian community and that he peddled outlandish promises of wealth to them when he sold them essentially worthless cryptocurrencies,” Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan said in a statement.
The filing alleged that while investors lost millions of dollars, the Regalados used the funds to support their “lavish lifestyle.” The couple sold the digital asset to more than 300 investors between June 2022 and April 2023, the statement added.
In the video message, Regalado confirmed that he and his wife made $1.3 million from selling the cryptocurrency, of which they spent “a few hundred thousand dollars” on “a home remodel that the Lord told us to do.”
“Either I misheard God, and every one of you who prayed and came in — you as well. Or two, God is still not done with this project,” Regalado said.
Is crypto a house of cards?
Despite having no prior experience in trading cryptocurrencies, Regalado said he was inspired to sell INDXcoin because “God is in the business of doing new things and breaking seals. And he did tell us to do this.”
“I said: Lord, I don’t want to do this. I don’t know how to do this. I don’t have any experience in this industry. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t want to be caught up in something.”
‘Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde’ plead guilty in ‘spy novel’-like laundering case
Investors who purchased INDXcoin were subsequently unable to convert the cryptocurrency into cash because of technical failings, according to Regalado. “We launched an exchange. The exchange technology failed. Things went downhill,” the pastor said. “I know this looks terrible.”
In a post in November announcing that the cryptocurrency’s network and exchange were to remain offline “for the time being,” Regalado said the failure had taken a toll on his mental health. He suggested investors “stop being ruled by mammon (chasing money)” and “remove all negative talk from the community,” which he complained was being flooded with negative comments.
The statement from the Colorado Securities Commissioner said the Regalados “had no experience in cryptocurrency,” something that became apparent when “a third-party auditor’s report allegedly described their INDXcoin code as unsafe, unsecure and riddled with serious technical problems.”
“New coins and new exchanges are easy to create with open source code. We want to remind consumers to be very skeptical,” Chan said."
Y77NJE1C61_A8ZAZRU2K4KYYO2,"San Francisco sues California over ‘unsafe,’ ‘disruptive’ self-driving cars",Trisha Thadani,"January 23, 2024 at 4:55 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/23/san-francisco-lawsuit-robotaxi-waymo-cruise/,"SAN FRANCISCO — In the most aggressive attempt yet to reduce the number of self-driving vehicles in this city, San Francisco filed a lawsuit against a state commission that allowed Google and General Motors’ autonomous car companies to expand here this summer, despite causing a pattern of “serious problems” on the streets.
The lawsuit, which has not been previously reported and was filed in December, sends a strong message from the nation’s tech capital: autonomous vehicles are not welcome here until they are more vigorously regulated.
It’s yet another blow for the rapidly evolving self-driving car industry, which flocked to San Francisco hoping to find a prominent testing ground that would legitimize it around the United States. Instead, the two major companies — Google-owned Waymo and General Motors-Owned Cruise — have largely been cast aside by the city as an unwelcome nuisance and a public safety hazard.
The lawsuit essentially asks the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to review whether its August decision, which allowed Waymo to operate 24/7 paid taxi service around the city, was compliant with the law. This legal action does not impact Cruise, as it already lost its permits to operate in California last year after one of its cars struck a jaywalking pedestrian and dragged her for about 20 feet.
Experts say City Attorney David Chiu is attempting to make a tricky legal case, and are skeptical on how successful he will ultimately be in getting the commission to revisit its decision. But, if the city attorney gets his way, Waymo could be forced to roll back its expansion until California rethinks the way it governs autonomous vehicles. That move could inspire dozens of other states — such as Texas and Nevada — where autonomous vehicles have been deployed.
“As driverless AVS expanded in San Francisco, members of the public and city officials identified hundreds of safety incidents, including interference with first responders,” according to the lawsuit, filed Dec. 11 in a California appellate court. “Despite these serious safety incidents, and over the objections of San Francisco, the commission approved requests by Cruise and Waymo to operate.”
In a statement, Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, said the company is “disappointed” that the city has chosen to appeal the commission’s decision.
“However, we remain confident in our ability to continue safely serving San Francisco’s visitors and residents,” Ilina said. “We have continually demonstrated our deep willingness and longtime commitment to work in partnership with California state regulators, San Francisco city officials and first responders and continue to stand by that approach.”
A spokesperson for the CPUC said it will “respond to all claims through its pleadings and statements” through the courts. A spokesperson for Cruise declined to comment.
Chiu’s legal action is the culmination of months of frustration among San Francisco leaders, who have no control over autonomous vehicles because the industry is controlled by the state. City officials have spent months trying to halt the expansion by highlighting a slew of issues caused by the vehicles, and also unsuccessfully asked the CPUC for a rehearing last year. This legal action against the CPUC is now one of the only concrete actions the city could take.
Waymo and Cruise have both cited self-reported data that their robot cars have a superior track record to human drivers, and say their technology will eventually usher in a future with fewer road deaths and injuries. Still, over the past year, the cars have caused major headaches around the city — from disrupting traffic by stopping short or breaking down in the middle of the road, to once rolling over a fire hose at an emergency scene.
Then, in a particularly egregious incident in October, a Cruise car rolled over a pedestrian and dragged her about 20 feet. That accident — and Cruise’s initial misrepresentation over the events — prompted the California Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend Cruise’s driverless permits. The company has since stopped testing its autonomous cars around the country, and has faced significant turmoil, including layoffs and the resignation of its CEO.
Waymo has not caused as many high-profile incidents in San Francisco as Cruise, and the complaint said the Google sister company “appears to be operating a limited fleet” in the city. Still, according to the complaint, “the public’s safety should not be subject to voluntary actions by regulated entities, and Waymo could ramp up operations at any time.”
Waymo currently has 250 registered cars in its San Francisco fleet, though all of them are not in service at once, Ilina said.
According to the lawsuit, the city is asking the CPUC to reconsider the permits for Waymo and also “develop reporting requirements, safety benchmarks, and other needed public safety regulations” that would address “serious incidents involving first responders, street traffic interference, and disruption of public transportation.”
Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies, said while he agrees with San Francisco leaders that local governments should have more control over autonomous vehicles, he thinks the arguments in the lawsuit are “weak on the merits.” Ultimately, he said, autonomous vehicles “should be held to the same standards as human drivers.”
“We should crack down on technology that makes the roads less safe and encourage technology that makes the roads safer,” he said.
The CPUC and Waymo have until Feb. 16 to file an opposition brief. Chiu also filed another lawsuit in  California’s Supreme Court, which argues that the CPUC also failed to act appropriately by refusing to conduct a review of the environmental impacts of its decision under the California Environmental Quality Act.
“San Francisco believes that autonomous vehicles will be a beneficial part of our city’s future, but in the meantime, while allowing this technology to develop, we must act to protect the safety of our residents and visitors,” Chiu said in a statement. “Poor AV performance has caused serious problems on San Francisco streets, jeopardizing public safety and emergency response.”"
Y9V0T7RT1V_QMXHLJDU59OQZ34,Arab media outlets echo Trump in criticism of Qatar,Heba Farouk Mahfouz,"June 13, 2017 at 11:35 a.m. EDT",20240115,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/06/13/arab-media-outlets-echo-trump-in-criticism-of-qatar/,"A crisis in the Persian Gulf began last week when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries severed relations with Qatar. These governments accused the tiny country of destabilizing the region by supporting terrorist groups — an allegation Qatari officials deny.
In a news conference Friday in Washington, President Trump said Qatar historically has been a “funder of terrorism at a very high level” and called the action against the country “hard but necessary.”
Many media outlets in the region — government-owned and independent — have adopted the anti-Qatar stance of their respective governments and began echoing some of Trump's remarks. As the crisis entered its second week, here's a look at what some newspapers are saying.
Saudi Arabia's Mecca Al Mukaramah newspaper printed a photo of Trump on its front page, with a red headline: ""Qatar has a history of funding terrorism, has to stop."" Al-Jazira newspaper also quoted Trump, warning that ""Qatar must stop its terrorism or accept its downfall.""
""Qatar adopts antagonist policies towards gulf countries, undermining their sovereignty to destabilize their security,'' added the leading Saudi newspaper, Al Riyadh.
In the United Arab Emirates, Al Khaleej newspaper described the steps taken against Qatar as ""harsh"" but ""necessary to set the limits for the Qatari leadership's stubbornness and insistence on destabilizing Persian Gulf countries.""
The government's announcement that supporting Qatar on social media will be treated as a cybercrime, with a possible 15-year penalty, also dominated headlines. Bahrain issued a similar statement last week.
In Egypt, the privately owned Youm7 newspaper described Qatar as ""the state of terrorism"" and accused the banned Qatari Al Jazeera channel of being ""the spokesperson of Qaeda and ISIS."" The state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper said that ""Arab patience has come to an end regarding Qatar's utilizing of Al Jazeera to incite against Arab states to destabilize them,"" accusing the Qatari leadership of using the channel ""to serve its own ends and orchestrate diplomatic attacks against other Arab states to spread fear and chaos among their citizens.""
Meanwhile in Kuwait, which is trying to mediate the crisis and ease tensions, mainstream media expressed concern about the crisis. The Kuwaiti Al-Qabas newspaper called the blockade ""shocking.""
On the other side of the dispute, mainstream media in Qatar also used language similar to statements issued by the government there.
On its front page Monday, Al Raya seemed to ignore the crisis, focusing instead on the emir's Ramadan iftar ""in honor of the Royal Family in Qatar.'' Headlines in Al-Watan newspaper quoted the Qatari foreign minister as saying ""No compromise. No surrender,"" and that ""the crisis threatens the safety of the whole region.""
And on Al Jazeera, a Qatari analyst blamed the crisis on the ""Riyadh Summit,"" which Trump attended with a number of other presidents and heads of states of Muslim countries in the Saudi capital last month.

YI427QWP4C_0U5CELAA39U6Q7R,Students tried to host a Palestinian culture event. Then a local eatery stepped in.,Lauren Lumpkin,"January 22, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/22/dc-students-palestinian-cultural-event/,"Yasmine Foty is 15 years old. And what she wants is for her school to talk about the conflict.
It has been more than 100 days since Hamas waged its attack on Israel and killed about 1,200 people. In the months since, the world has watched as the ensuing retaliation and conflict has grown in scale and horror — 25,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israel’s military operation, and the risk of famine grows each day. More than 10,000 of the victims are children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
Like many Americans, Yasmine has been personally affected. She knows people who have lost dozens of family members.
In her big Palestinian American family, the conflict is a constant topic of discussion. But at her high school in Northwest Washington, it seems no one will touch it. Teachers seem afraid to discuss it, she said, and students’ attempts to talk about the news have been thwarted by the principal. “They make it uncomfortable whenever we try to talk about it,” said Hala Elamine, a senior and co-leader of the Arab Student Union at Jackson-Reed High School. “It’s completely ridiculous.”
This is not unique to Jackson-Reed, with students and teachers across the country saying they have been shut down, censored or punished for commenting on the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. In a place where the teens expect to learn how to discuss difficult topics and civilly disagree with one another, some say it feels like they are being encouraged to stay quiet instead.
“It’s anti-education,” Yasmine said. “We are being silenced and censored.”
Jackson-Reed has had a public struggle with navigating tensions surrounding the conflict. First, there was pushback after scheduled readings of two memoirs that recount the Holocaust — Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel “Maus” and “Night” by Elie Wiesel — were postponed. The school said it was to give teachers time to figure out how to cover their contents more thoughtfully.
Then students, hoping to provide a space to discuss what has been happening in Gaza, tried hosting a screening of “The Occupation of the American Mind,” a documentary that critiques Western media’s portrayal of the conflict but has also been accused of antisemitism. School leaders told them they didn’t follow the proper channels to get the showing approved.
At a D.C. school, proposed film event sparks outrage amid Israel-Gaza war
The students were willing to work with the principal, Yasmine said. They suggested a list of films as alternatives; the principal never responded, she said. A spokesperson for D.C. Public Schools said the district’s social studies team is accepting recommendations for content on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to vet for classrooms.
In the meantime, the conflict in Gaza was getting worse, and Yasmine wanted to show her peers there were real people behind the growing death toll. She and others asked the school to let them host a cultural event with music, dancing and food.
Again, they weren’t allowed. Jackson-Reed’s principal, Sah Brown, wrote in an email to the ASU’s faculty adviser that he supports “the idea of celebrating Palestinian culture” and approved such an observance at either Cultural Night, a long-standing annual event that showcases the school’s diversity, or during Arab Heritage Month in April. The high school has historically not held separate events for individual cultures, according to a D.C. schools spokesperson.
“We wanted to humanize Palestinians and show our generation that we’re not just terrorists, or rooted in violence,” Yasmine said. “We wanted to show the beautiful history of Palestine.”
So they found a new venue. Andy Shallal, founder and chief executive of the restaurant Busboys and Poets, offered his location in Takoma. The event was held Thursday as part of “Palestine Week” at the restaurant.
“I have to say, I’ve been really quite uncomfortable with this kind of silencing of people and voices throughout this issue,” Shallal said in an interview Friday. “For me, that’s what being an American is. It’s not quieting down people during times when they really need to have a voice.”
On the night of the event, there were small piles of snow on the ground and more was on the way. Freezing temperatures and weather alerts had already triggered event cancellations and school closures in surrounding districts.
Yasmine had homework to do. But, for now, her focus was on highlighting her culture. With help from her family and other students from the ASU, she laid out books and poetry, artwork and newspaper articles. They hung big Palestinian flags on the walls.
They weren’t sure how many people would show up.
Just the night before, Yasmine explained her frustrations to D.C.'s school board. “As a Palestinian American, I’ve never seen my culture or background acknowledged or spoken about at my school. It makes me and other Palestinian students feel as if our culture causes harm to others and should not be celebrated,” she told board members Wednesday. “The whole point of a school and an educational environment is to create a welcoming environment for all students, not just the students they think are worthy of that welcoming environment.”
Again, she would make her case. Dozens at Busboys and Poets would listen.
On Thursday, families and students came to the Takoma restaurant in droves. They filled tightly packed tables and lined the walls when the chairs filled. As the room reached capacity, the restaurant had to open a waitlist.
The night was filled with performances, many featuring Yasmine and members of her family. She sang a song called “Asfoor,” her voice high and clear, about a bird trapped in a cage. Yasmine’s older sister, Fairouz Foty, performed a tearful aria, “Senza Mamma,” about a nun who finds out her child is dead. Much of the music centered on grief and loss — but also resistance and freedom.
The final performance was by Malikat Al Dabke, or Queens of Dabke, the first all-women group in the D.C. area created to perform the traditional folk dance, according to its members. “We were very excited to perform, to be back at Jackson-Reed,” said Fairouz, 34, a graduate of the high school and performer in the dance troupe. Brown’s decision not to host the affair “made even more of a reason for us to take part in this cultural event.”
As the night came to a close, several people thanked Yasmine and Hala. The event was a success.
Still, the girls wish they could have done it at Jackson-Reed.
“We really wish it would have been at the school,” Hala said. “It’s just so insane that something just as simple as these amazing performances, that the school wouldn’t want us to have it.”"
YK2VDME5B8_R8G8B7L1367V9D6,Superintendent praises ‘conformity’ in defense of suspending Black teen,Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff,"January 23, 2024 at 3:19 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/01/23/darryl-george-hair-superintendent-newspaper-ad/,"A week after a Texas superintendent took out a newspaper ad to defend the continued suspension of Darryl George over the way he wears his hair, the Black teen’s family filed a third request for a religious exemption to allow him to return to school months after he was originally disciplined.
George’s family sued the state’s governor and attorney general in September, alleging that the state failed to enforce a new law that prohibits hair discrimination when the high school junior was suspended because the district said his hair was too long. George has been repeatedly suspended and disciplined since.
“Being an American requires conformity with the positive benefit of unity,” wrote Greg Poole, the superintendent, in a Jan. 14 full-page advertisement in the Houston Chronicle, referencing dress codes at military academies as an example he said demonstrated the importance of rigorous standards. The ad ran after the Chronicle published an editorial criticizing the district’s actions.
Poole wrote that the suspension was based on George’s hair length — not style — which he argued is not protected under the Crown Act passed last year. He added that “despite our relatively small percentage of African-American students,” the district has a progressive history, pointing to Black school board members in the 1970s and now who help set policy.
The Barbers Hill Independent School District superintendent also wrote that other Black students have received religious exemptions for the school’s dress code, which he said allows braids, locs and twists but requires that boys’ hair must not extend past their eyebrows and earlobes. George wears locs that do not go below his ears, and family representatives said they had applied twice for that exemption but were denied. The district has said George’s hair is longer than allowed when let down.
The Superintendent of Barbers Hill ISD took out a full page ad in the @HoustonChron to defend suspending an African American student from school because his hair was too long. Wow. Just wow. pic.twitter.com/C2cZYUh3dR
“The men in our family show they locks as a sign of connection with our roots and ancestors, which keeps us connected and closer to the Higher power God,” wrote Darresha George, Darryl’s mother, in an exemption form filed Tuesday viewed by The Washington Post.
The mother also filed on Tuesday a complaint calling for the Texas Education Agency to investigate the district while alleging that school officials failed to turn in previous grievances to the district. The BHISD previously told the family and its representatives it would not provide another denial memo, according to emails shared with The Post.
The request is the latest in a months-long conflict between the family, which says that they are facing discrimination because they are Black, and the district, which says that it is enforcing a hair-length requirement that extends to all students. The dispute is taking place in Mont Belvieu, Tex., a town of almost 9,000 about 30 miles east of Houston.
“That is a pretextual excuse,” said Allie Booker, the family’s attorney. “The truth is that they allow White males to wear their hair long, just not Black ones. … It’s about race and nappy coarse hair being long.”
Booker and Candice Matthews, the state chair of the Texas Coalition of Black Democrats, spoke to The Post on the family’s behalf because they said George’s mother has had a mental breakdown because of the case. Matthews added that George has considered giving up the fight and cutting his hair because of the effect the drawn-out saga has had on his family. He has so far refused, though, to cut his hair.
On Wednesday, a hearing in Chambers County District Court could set a date for a possible injunction. Neither the school district nor the Barbers Hill Education Foundation, a nonprofit that paid for the ad, immediately responded to a request for comment Tuesday.
Texas is one of at least 24 states that have passed a version of the Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act, known as the Crown Act, to address discrimination that Black people in particular have faced in the workplace or at school. Across the country, civil rights advocates have said that school hair and dress codes have the potential to discriminate along racial, cultural or religious lines and enforce outdated gender stereotypes.
State Rep. Ron Reynolds (D), who co-wrote the Texas law and has noted that many natural hairstyles need to be a certain length, said the school district is bucking the law meant to protect students like George. He called on the district to revise its dress code and end the disciplinary actions.
“They are trying to argue that there is a loophole in the law, that it doesn’t cover length, which is nonsense,” said Reynolds, who chairs the Texas Legislative Black Caucus. He added that the full-page advertisement was a “PR attempt to deflect the fact that they’re violating Texas law.”
Poole said in the newspaper ad that the district asked a court to determine whether the dress code violates the Crown Act. Reynolds told The Post that if the court rules that the district can continue suspending George, family representatives could appeal the decision. He added that legislators would rewrite the law next session, if necessary.
Three years before the Crown Act passed, the same school suspended DeAndre Arnold and Kaden Bradford for keeping their hair in dreadlocks. Both students were placed on in-school suspension and, if they didn’t cut their hair, risked being forced to move schools.
Arnold, 18 at the time, ultimately transferred districts, while Bradford, then 16, sued the district, alleging the policy violated his civil rights. In 2021, a federal court prevented the district from enforcing the policy against Bradford in an injunction. The case is pending.
“Ultimately, this is an issue of local control and deciding who should be setting the policies, goals and expectations of our school district,” Poole wrote in the ad. “The litigation is not about what is best for students.”
Reynolds said the district is sending the wrong message to students about who can be successful. He added that Poole’s claim of local control mirrors how states used to defend not following federal civil rights-related laws.
“They’re trying to make their African American students conform to European students,” he said. “Meanwhile, they’re not conforming to the law that we passed.”"
YMX3HVGT75_JUW1UETXGWTH7YN,The Democratic Party is running on democracy. Long-shot candidates cry hypocrisy.,Michael Scherer,"January 22, 2024 at 2:35 p.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/22/democrats-biden-democracy-primary/,"NASHUA, N.H. — The Democratic National Committee has worked for years to design what its rules committee co-chairman Jim Roosevelt III has called a “transparent” 2024 nominating process, with a “level playing field” that could increase “opportunities for Democratic voters.”
But as Democrats prepare to cast their first ballots Tuesday, those lofty goals are crashing into a complex and messy result, with President Biden’s rivals in the Democratic Party and others crying foul.
New Hampshire’s Republican attorney general sent a cease-and-desist letter this month accusing Roosevelt of voter suppression by publicly calling the state primary “meaningless” because it will not result in official nominating delegates under the party rules.
Biden’s two most prominent rivals, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson, are separately upset with decisions of some state Democratic parties elsewhere to initially propose to have only Biden on primary ballots — moves that could reduce the choices for Democratic voters in those states if the campaigns do not achieve ballot access by other means.
Phillips in particular has made what he calls “the hypocrisy of democracy” a centerpiece of his long-shot bid to prevent Biden from becoming the 2024 standard-bearer as he campaigns through New Hampshire. A group advertising on his behalf in the state has been running ads telling party members to “push back” against their party leaders.
“I have discovered massive, I will call it, corruption and a lack of transparency and incongruency with a party that ostensibly is practicing and protecting and preserving democracy,” Phillips said in an interview with The Washington Post Saturday. “Right now I think there is lack of transparency. There are barriers to entry.”
Political parties have significant legal power to shape their nominating processes, with states often deferring to party leaders to pick the candidates that appear on ballots or decide whether to hold a nominating process at all. Multiple Republican state parties canceled their primaries and caucuses entirely in 2020 to reduce the threat of challenge to then-President Donald Trump.
Democrats at the national party have taken a different approach this cycle, publicly embracing the ideal of competitive and open contests that will draw voters. At the same time, party leaders have worked closely with the Biden campaign to build out his reelection campaign and to structure the contest in a way that could help him win the nomination.
At Biden’s direction in 2022, the DNC effectively canceled the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and signaled that it would prevent the New Hampshire primary from awarding delegates if it went second, removing two states that had caused him trouble in 2020. South Carolina, where Biden did well before, will be the first official state primary to award delegates, followed by Nevada and Michigan.
“A core mission of the Democratic Party is to uphold and strengthen the democratic process, and that’s why we’ve made strides over the last several cycles to bring more voters to the table and amplify the voices of voters of color, who are the backbone of our party,” Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the DNC, said in a statement.
The DNC rules also left in place significant powers for state party leaders to make decisions about who they propose appear on primary ballots. Since then, the state parties in four states — Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Tennessee — have asked the state to run Biden as the only candidate in their upcoming primary. In all of the states except for Florida, there is an alternate petition process for achieving ballot access.
“Each primary season, the role of the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee is to lay out the guardrails by which a state party can run its primary contest. The role of the state party is to plan and execute that process fairly, and the role of a campaign is to get its candidate on the ballot,” Chitika said. “If a candidate believes that process has broken down, we want to hear from them, and the Rules and Bylaws Committee will assess each case on its merits.”
Florida leaders effectively canceled their state primary when they decided to only recommend Biden for the ballot in October, following a process that the Phillips campaign has since challenged at the DNC on the grounds that the meeting to make that decision was not properly disclosed beforehand.
“We followed our process that is consistent with state law. The notion that there is some kind of conspiracy is dead wrong,” said Eden Giagnorio, the Florida Democratic Party’s communications director. “What is anti-democratic is seeking to undermine the will of the state executive committee which represents Florida.”
Democratic leaders in North Carolina, which invited Williamson on the ballot in 2020, also put forward only Biden’s name after concluding in an internal process that neither Phillips nor Williamson had enough presence in the state to justify their inclusion. In Wisconsin, Democratic leaders only submitted Biden’s name for the ballot, after having a choice of 12 candidates in the 2020 primaries.
“I don’t think anybody should be surprised about the way this process is working itself out,” said one Wisconsin party official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the process as being different because Biden is running for reelection. “It has always been the case with an incumbent in office.”
In Tennessee, a new state law allowed the state executive committee to directly submit names for the ballot in November, and they submitted only Biden because they had not yet heard from any other campaign when they met to make the decision, state party chair Hendrell Remus said.
“The message that is being sent is you need a little bit less democracy to protect democracy,” said Jeff Weaver, an adviser to the Phillips campaign who previously worked for the presidential efforts of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Williamson’s campaign has also protested. “The delegates for these states will likely be given to Biden,” said Williamson adviser Mark Van Landuyt in a statement. “He didn’t have to campaign for them, he didn’t have to fight for them, he didn’t have to earn votes in these crucial swing states. The Democratic Party’s misplaced attempts at protecting Biden endangers Democrats up and down the ballot.”
The other fight playing out in New Hampshire concerns efforts by the DNC to enforce its new calendar by dissuading Democratic participation in the state’s primary. The co-chairs of the DNC rules committee, Roosevelt and Minyon Moore, sent a Jan. 5 letter to New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley chiding him for continuing a process to select delegates after the state primary, even though the DNC has said no delegates selected as a result of the vote will be seated at the convention.
“The NHDP must take steps to educate the public that January 23rd is a nonbinding presidential preference event and is meaningless,” the letter read.
The state attorney general objected to the word “meaningless,” saying in a subsequent “cease and desist order” letter to the DNC that such a description “violates New Hampshire’s voter suppression laws.” The attorney general said that even though the primary did not result in convention delegates, the election still had meaning.
Buckley said in an interview that the dust-up had backfired on the DNC by increasing Democratic voter interest in the Tuesday contest.
“Once the attorney general made that statement and sent that letter it became statewide news,” Buckley said. “I think it has done more to motivate Democrats to vote than anything anyone has done this year.”

YU2W73HQY7_APN9PLUH2VHBB9P,6 studies to be retracted by scientists at Harvard-affiliated hospital,Carolyn Y. Johnson,"January 23, 2024 at 9:51 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/01/23/dana-farber-retractions-corrections/,"Scientists at a Harvard-affiliated cancer hospital are planning to retract six studies and will correct an additional 31 as part of an ongoing investigation into image duplications and discrepancies in dozens of papers from some of its leading researchers.
A post on For Better Science, a blog focused on scientific integrity, flagged potential problems in papers co-written by top scientists and executives at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. The institute is widely regarded as a national leader in cancer treatment and research, and much of its scientific work is supported by taxpayer dollars; it received more than $160 million from the National Institutes of Health in 2023, according to a federal database.
In addition to the pending retractions and corrections, one paper with a potential error is still under examination. Sixteen others relied on data collected at science laboratories outside Dana-Farber, and researchers at those labs have been made aware of the concerns, according to Barrett Rollins, the research integrity officer at Dana-Farber.
He added that not all of the allegations raised by the blog are accurate. Three papers were found to not require any correction or retraction.
“The presence of image discrepancies in a paper is not evidence of an author’s intent to deceive. That conclusion can only be drawn after a careful, fact-based examination which is an integral part of our response,” Rollins said in a statement. “Our experience is that errors are often unintentional and do not rise to the level of misconduct.”
Rollins is a co-author on three of the papers that were flagged by the blog and has been recused from those reviews, according to Ellen Berlin, a spokeswoman for Dana-Farber.
It is unclear whether the problems that triggered the retractions and corrections are simple mistakes or the serious scientific sin of research misconduct. But the investigation highlights an essential part of the scientific process — correcting mistakes — at a time of increased scrutiny on academic institutions and publications.
“Jumping in and doing a large number of retractions and corrections is something that’s fairly aggressive,” said Nicholas Steneck, an expert on research ethics and an emeritus professor at the University of Michigan. “From my perspective as someone promoting integrity in research, that’s spot-on — and I wish more organizations would do it.”
Sholto David, an independent molecular biologist, wrote about the papers on the blog after he started examining cancer research studies between jobs. He looked for signs of image problems using his eyes and an AI-based tool called Imagetwin. David conducted his searches by following threads, finding one researcher with publications he saw as suspect and then examining others by frequent collaborators.
When he noticed potentially problematic studies from scientists at Dana-Farber, he began looking into work published by its top leaders, including President Laurie Glimcher and Chief Operating Officer William Hahn. Glimcher co-authored four of the papers in which David flagged concerns, and Hahn co-authored 17. Glimcher and Hahn did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Not all of the issues David found were new. Some had been flagged over a decade ago on PubPeer, a website where researchers comment on and critique papers after publication. The problems span the gamut from relatively minor concerns to more serious allegations of possible image manipulation. The integrity of scientific images is crucial because they are often how data is presented in papers.
The Harvard Crimson and STAT News first reported on the investigation into papers by Dana-Farber researchers. David said he flagged issues with four additional papers to Dana-Farber administrators on Monday morning.
Rollins said researchers had already been reviewing potential data errors “in a number of the cases listed in the blog.”
Verifying that there are errors and correcting them are the first and, in many ways, simplest parts of the process. Science is done by teams, and the papers in question date back as far as 1998, meaning a careful investigation will be needed to determine the source of any errors.
“Was it one person that did it? Was it the atmosphere of the lab? That’s where it takes a lot of time to come in and figure out who actually was responsible,” Steneck said.
In general, the person listed first on a scientific paper, called the lead author, did most of the work. The last person named, known as the senior author, is generally the scientist whose lab and funding supported the work. The middle authors may have varying degrees of involvement and contributions ranging from crucial to more tenuous.
But scientific and medical publishing ethics typically say that each author should be accountable for the work.
Hidde Ploegh, an immunologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and the senior author of a 2005 paper flagged on PubPeer as having an image discrepancy, said the study’s findings are valid.
“It is more than a little unfortunate that it is easy to lob these types of accusations anonymously without checking with the authors first,” Ploegh said in an email. “It creates an undeserved suggestion of malfeasance.”
Boaz Tirosh, a biochemist at Case Western Reserve University and the paper’s lead author, also said he had been unaware of the PubPeer questions but realized Monday night that one of the graphs had been erroneously duplicated. He added that the mistake did not affect the results, which have “been confirmed by multiple studies in the community.” Glimcher is a co-author on that paper.
While understanding the source of errors in each instance will probably take a lengthy investigation, Steneck said, the strident action Dana-Farber is taking to correct the scientific record is commendable.
“Elite knowledge in academic institutions [is] under attack at the present time, and the last thing you want to do is leave yourself in a vulnerable position when that comes up,” he said. “So if this is an aggressive response by Dana-Farber, I think it’s exactly what they ought to do.”"

YXI9F15R1X_UE39BSEU1T3MF8U,Egypt’s leader el-Sissi slams Ethiopia-Somaliland coastline deal and vows support for Somalia,_,"January 21, 2024 at 2:03 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/21/egypt-somalia-ethiopia-dispute-somaliland/bf63bf58-b88f-11ee-b176-fe5fd794e716_story.html,"CAIRO — Egypt’s leader said Sunday his country stands shoulder to shoulder with Somalia in its dispute with landlocked Ethiopia, which struck a deal with Somaliland to obtain access to the sea and establish a marine force base.
President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi slammed Ethiopia’s agreement with the breakaway region. He called on Ethiopia to seek benefits from seaports in Somalia and Djibouti “through transitional means,” rather than through attempts to “control another (country’s) territory.”
“We will not allow anyone to threaten Somalia or infringe upon its territory,” el-Sissi told a joint news conference in Cairo with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud. “No one should attempt to threaten Egypt’s brothers, especially if our brothers asked us to stand with them.”
Somaliland, a region strategically located by the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991 as the country collapsed into a warlord-led conflict. The region has maintained its own government despite its lack of international recognition.
Somaliland leader Muse Bihi Abdi signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed earlier this month to allow Ethiopia to lease a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) stretch of coastline to establish a marine force base.
Sheikh Mohamud, the Somali president, rejected the deal as a violation of international law, saying: “We will not stand idly by and watch our sovereignty being compromised.”
He arrived in Egypt this weekend to rally support for his government. He met with the Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Al-Azhar mosque’s Grand Imam, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb.
Egypt is at odds with Ethiopia over a controversial hydroelectric dam Ethiopia has built on the Nile river's main tributary. The two countries — along with Sudan — have been trying for over a decade to reach a negotiated agreement on the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam.
The latest round of talks last month ended without a deal and Cairo and Addis Ababa traded blame for the failure.
Negotiators have said key questions remain about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs, and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Ethiopia rejects binding arbitration at the final stage.
The dam is on the Blue Nile near the Sudan border and Egypt fears it will have a devastating effect on its water and irrigation supply downstream unless Ethiopia takes its needs into account.
The dam began producing power last year and Ethiopia said it had completed the final phase of filling the dam’s reservoir in September."
YZHMYUWIBE_2ZG82W1TS3XXH1W,Welcome to whodunit January,Lili Loofbourow,"January 22, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/01/22/best-new-tv-mystery-thriller-series/,"Warning: Mild spoilers follow for “Death and Other Details,” “Monsieur Spade,” “Criminal Record” and “The Woman in the Wall.”
Good news, mystery fans: We’re smack in the middle of what I’ve come to think of as Whodunit January, a month packed to the brim with TV sleuths. Besides the long-awaited fourth season of “True Detective,” this time with a female director and leads, there’s a deliciously wide array of crime stories and thrillers to splash around in, available in a variety of tones and styles.
If the luxe details and cozy reversals of “Only Murders in the Building” worked for you (even when the mysteries didn’t), you’ll probably enjoy Heidi Cole McAdams and Mike Weiss’ “Death and Other Details.” The stylish, 10-episode series premiered Jan. 16 on Hulu. Mandy Patinkin, always a delight, stars as Rufus Cotesworth, “the world’s greatest detective.” (You may see a pattern emerging here.) Violett Beane co-stars as Imogene Scott, a quick-witted blonde with a fantastic wardrobe. She has a bone to pick with Cotesworth, whom she first met as a child when he was hired to solve her mother’s murder. He never did. Imogene — now a spoiled and aimless adult — hangs out with the billionaire Collier family, who once employed her mother. She tags along when they rent a luxury cruise ship to close a deal with some Chinese investors for whom it turns out Cotesworth, now an alcoholic in reduced circumstances, is working private security. It is not, at least at first, a happy reunion.
How do you think we're doing? Take a short survey about the new Style.
“Death” has a few twists too many, but it’s a pleasant and surprisingly digestible watch despite some formally complicated flashbacks and an enormous cast. The sumptuous ship makes for a visually gratifying locked-room mystery, and Beane holds her own as Patinkin’s skeptical mentee and PI-in-training. Jere Burns puts in a memorable performance, as does “Only Murders” alum Linda Emond in her capacity as the formidably bureaucratic Agent Hilde Eriksen.
Also in the running for “prettiest mystery” is AMC Plus’s “Monsieur Spade.” Imagine a noir PI dropped into the world of the 2000 film “Chocolat.” That’s a rough approximation of the setup of Scott Frank and Tom Fontana’s curious sequel to “The Maltese Falcon,” which stars Clive Owen as Dashiell Hammett’s sleuth Sam Spade. Set in the picturesque French town of Bozouls, the series begins in 1955 with Spade trying — in comically broken French — to deliver a little girl named Teresa to her father at the request of her late mother, Brigid O’Shaughnessy. (Hammett fans will recognize the latter as the femme fatale from “Maltese Falcon.”)
It goes poorly. Teresa’s father is a malefactor named Philippe Saint Andre (Jonathan Zaccaï) whose whereabouts his own mother claims not to know, and when Spade seeks help from local chief of police Patrice Michaud (Denis Ménochet, extraordinarily good), Michaud advises him to leave town. Ever the contrarian, Spade instead meets and marries a rich, vivacious vineyard owner (Chiara Mastroianni), puts the girl in a convent and settles into a comfortable retirement in the French countryside.
The series picks up eight years later, with Spade’s wife dead and Teresa (Cara Bossom) a sullen teenager. Spade, now fluent in French, lives a becalmed existence as a faintly depressed widower. His days consist of nude swims in his pool, dead-end flirtations with a local club owner (Louise Bourgoin), spats with his disapproving housekeeper (Clotilde Mollet) and halfhearted attempts to quit smoking. A series of incidents yanks him out of retirement. These include the return of Teresa’s shady father, Philippe, a mass murder at Teresa’s convent and the arrival of a garrulous young artist (Matthew Beard) who wants to paint his vineyard.
Despite its brevity, “Monsieur Spade” lets its world unfurl slowly, with continental ease. There’s lots of pleasantly acrimonious banter, much of it in French. Plenty of unexpected humor, too. Owen’s take on Spade conjures a little of Bogart’s world-weary charisma without ever quite seeming to imitate him (or resorting to his trademark monotone). The series sometimes underlines how comparatively innocent (compared with present-day crime) the “hard-boiled” stuff really was. At one point Spade — who has been exchanging barbs with Teresa’s father over the phone — is halfway through a put-down when a gunshot rings out on the other end. “Philippe?” a nonplussed Owen says, packing the moment with shock and concern but also — and mainly — frustration at the undelivered insult.
There’s a serious side, too, of course; the show incorporates the bloody aftermath of World War II (as the French dealt with Nazi collaborators), the horrors of colonialism, the Algerian war and the rise of a far-right terrorist fringe determined to keep Algeria part of France.
Uneven but fun to watch, “Monsieur Spade” eventually yields a suitably baffling ending, delivered via an exceptional cameo I’d hate to ruin. The show’s main flaw is its MacGuffin, which turns out to be not an object (like the falcon) but rather a small and terrified Algerian boy (Ismaël Berqouch) whom everyone, including the Vatican, is trying to kidnap. “What if the MacGuffin was human?” could have been (and should have been) the show’s most pressing question. But while “Monsieur Spade” occasionally tries to address it, the series collapses, by the end, into a narrower, more parochial sense of its stakes.
Those wanting a little more realism might turn to “Criminal Record,” the Apple TV Plus thriller starring Peter Capaldi and Cush Jumbo that premiered Jan. 10. Unglamorous in the extreme, the series explores the grubby gears of police bureaucracy — and the racist results they generate — through a psychodrama that develops between two detectives working for the Metropolitan police. That might sound predictable. The show is not.
The action begins when an anonymous caller claims that an innocent man is serving time for a murder her abusive boyfriend claims to have committed. The call, dismissed by many as a hoax, spurs rookie Detective Sergeant June Lenker (Jumbo) to track down the allegedly innocent convict, a man named Errol Mathis (Tom Moutchi), and the detective who obtained his confession, Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Hegarty (Capaldi). Her efforts to enlist Hegarty’s aid in determining whether a mistake was made backfire. The show escalates into a bizarre but compelling chess match between the grizzled White senior detective and the mixed-race newcomer determined to reopen the case he declared solved.
The core mystery of the series turns out not to be the murder the detectives are re-litigating. Nor is it whether racism contributes to unjust outcomes (the answer is yes). The question is, rather, whether Hegarty, the senior detective — surrounded as he is by racist peers and far-right subordinates and even would-be criminals who want to keep him happy — knows that the results he’s obtaining are tainted. “Criminal Record” turns out to be a targeted investigation of the contents of Daniel Hegarty’s soul.
While the show dutifully dedicates time and energy to the parties who matter — such as the innocent incarcerated man and his family — and addresses the ways racism and colorism further isolate officers of color, the meat of the story is the strange dynamic that develops between Lensker and Hegarty, who circle each other with a mix of hostility, distrust and real professional respect. Jumbo and Capaldi are powerhouses and the crackle of their work together here, much of which they refused to rehearse in advance, elevates a relatively simple question — is Hegarty a Nazi? — into something much murkier that could, at least in theory, allow for nuance.
Should you be in the mood for a sadder but bolder experiment, Showtime’s “The Woman in the Wall” premieres Jan. 21. The six-part miniseries, which first aired on BBC One in August, is a police procedural set in 2015 that lapses into horror whenever it slips into the sleep-starved perspective of its protagonist.
Lorna (Ruth Wilson), a woman in her  40s, survived being sent (as a pregnant teenager) to one of the infamous Catholic-run Magdalene laundries, where she was put to work, abused and parted from her baby. A grouchy, unpredictable oddball with a “Joan of Arc haircut,” Lorna sleepwalks (and does worrisome things when she does). When she goes to meet someone claiming to have information about what happened to her child, Lorna blacks out and wakes up at home, unaware of how she got there, and finds a blond woman lying on her floor, dead. She resolves to stay awake, dreading what else she might do if she lets herself sleep.
Meanwhile, a bright young detective named Colman Akande (Daryl McCormack) starts the series quibbling with his mother that the long-running TV series “Columbo” cannot qualify as a whodunit since you see, at the beginning, who did it. That cozy discussion (and loud hint) is interrupted by the murder of a priest in Dublin. Akande tracks the dead priest’s car to Lorna’s Irish town, Kilkinure — which happens to be home to a hitherto unrecognized “laundry,” to a former guard now working with police (Simon Delaney), and to several other women who were victimized there. When Lorna torches the dead priest’s car, Akande focuses his investigation on her. Lorna and the detective end up circling each other as Lorna doggedly tries to figure out what the dead woman knew about her child and Akade tries to sort Lorna’s eccentricity from her criminality — and ends up unearthing a much bigger and uglier conspiracy.
The experimental aspect concerns Wilson’s courage as a performer and creator Joe Murtagh’s refreshing but genuinely challenging lack of interest in making traumatized people palatable. Lorna starts off a little hard to take, but her reaction to the dead woman on the floor is a nightmare — for the viewer. She eventually smashes a wall in her house, laboriously shoves the body into the hole, and seals it back up. It’s horrifying and detailed, a point of no return for any protagonist, and it happens extremely early in the series. One of the meta-mysteries that emerges for audiences to solve is therefore technical — and personal: How can I, the viewer, keep following a protagonist who does such a thing? I won’t say more for fear of getting deeper into spoiler territory.
On the sillier end of things — if you’re partial to cartoons, you’re in luck. Having spent most of last year revisiting and revising his role in defining the “alpha” man, Jon Hamm begins 2024 voice-acting as “the world’s most smartest detective” — a schlubby fellow named Marvin Flute — in “Grimsburg,” an animated sitcom on Fox.
For those who prefer their crime shows with a pinch of the supernatural, AMC Plus’s “Sanctuary: A Witch’s Tale” serves up a mystery in which, when a teenage rugby player dies in an apparent accident, suspicion falls on a (literal) witch.
We’re seven shows in. That’s a ton of crime. A heap of mysteries. A cornucopia of heavily psychologized, handsomely narrated death. Enough to make “Poker Face,” which premiered around this same time last year, seem like a harbinger of the whodunit resurrection to come.
Believe it or not, there are even more. But also — surely — that’s enough?"
Z16KBMVUZR_WI66PAFEJN6R316,"U.N. court orders Israel to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza, but no cease-fire",Emily Rauhala,"January 26, 2024 at 6:27 a.m. EST",20240126,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/26/israel-icj-ruling-decision-south-africa-gaza/,"THE HAGUE — The International Court of Justice on Friday ordered Israel to do more to prevent the killing of civilians in Gaza but did not call for a cease-fire, disappointing Palestinians who had hoped the court would endorse their pleas for immediate relief from the violence.
At a closely watched hearing at The Hague’s Peace Palace, the court confirmed that it has jurisdiction in the landmark case brought by South Africa last month and in a preliminary finding said the plausibility of genocide makes the need to prevent harm to civilians urgent.
In an order read out by court president Joan E. Donoghue, the panel called on Israel to prevent the possibility of genocide in its war on Hamas, allow more aid into Gaza and sanction its officials and soldiers for comments that amount to incitement. It directed Israel to submit a report within one month outlining how it is implementing those orders.
What to know about the genocide case against Israel ahead of ICJ decision
Palestinians had hoped the court would issue an order to immediately halt the fighting, as requested by South Africa, much as the court in 2022 demanded that Russia stop its military operations in Ukraine.
“We find ourselves in a perplexing situation as a court decision acknowledging the possibility of genocide falls short of demanding a complete cease-fire,” said Mohammed Mahmoud, 36, a father of five who fled Gaza City in the north for Rafah in the south. “Waiting longer in such circumstances only prolongs death and enduring pain.”
Legal scholars said there were key differences in Russia’s and Israel’s actions that made a cease-fire order in Gaza far less likely.
Israel launched its war on Hamas after the militant group killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 240 hostage in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, according to Israeli authorities. It was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.
“The court found that Russia had no foundation under international law for its claims of self-defense and that it should stop waging war,” said Hebrew University law professor Yuval Shany, a former chairman of the U.N. Human Rights committee. “In this case, you might read the court’s rulings as an implicit validation that Israel does have a legitimate claim of self-defense.”
Israel should be able to comply with the court’s directives to protect civilians from harm and increase aid without substantially changing its operations in Gaza, Shany said. Israel already insists it warns Gazans of impending attacks and facilitates aid.
“I don’t think these orders require Israel to do anything it is not claiming to be doing anyway,” he said.
But Diana Buttu, a Palestinian human rights lawyer, said the ruling means Israel must significantly reduce its attacks in Gaza or risk being referred to the U.N. Security Council.
“The fact that they have to take measures to prevent genocide, that is, in other words, a cease-fire,” she said. “There are going to be a lot of eyes on this ICJ opinion. I don’t think Israel is going to be able to just slide by like they usually do.”
Friday’s decision is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide; that finding could take years. Rather, the provisional measures aim to prevent the situation from getting worse while the case proceeds.
U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, asked Friday if President Biden was “disappointed” the court didn’t “definitively dismiss” the claim that Israel was committing genocide, said the ruling was “consistent with many of our positions and much of the approach that we’ve taken with Israel.”
He said the court affirmed Israel’s right to take action against the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 attack and obligations to minimize civilian casualties and enable humanitarian assistance.
“All of these are things that we have been pushing and urging for as well,” Kirby said.
Donoghue, formerly a longtime State Department legal adviser, said the ICJ “considers that the civilian population in the Gaza Strip remains extremely vulnerable. The Court considers that the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is at serious risk of deteriorating further before the Court renders its final judgment.”
The case brought by South Africa has spotlighted deep divisions over the Israeli campaign in Gaza and the way it’s being conducted. In a hearing this month, South Africa argued that Israel had violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by both committing and failing to prevent genocidal acts. It asked the court to order Israel to cease military operations there immediately.
Other governments have voiced support for South Africa’s case, as has the 22-member Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
South Africa didn’t get the cease-fire it requested but nonetheless declared a “decisive victory for the international rule of law and a significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people.”
“The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has determined that Israel’s actions in Gaza are plausibly genocidal and has indicated provisional measures on that basis,” it said in a statement. “For the implementation of the international rule of law, the decision is a momentous one.”
Israel has roundly rejected the allegations. It said South Africa presented a “grossly distorted” picture by ignoring the role of Hamas and “weaponizing” the international convention against genocide.
“The charge of genocide leveled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday. He said Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians and would not end its campaign against Hamas.
The Biden administration dismissed the filing as “meritless.” Britain called the claims “nonsense.”
More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, the majority of them women and children.
ICJ decisions are legally binding, but they can be difficult to enforce. Russia ignored the 2022 order to cease its war against Ukraine. Still, the provisional orders will help shape the global conversation on the conflict.
“This is definitely a ‘win’ for South Africa, although there won’t be enormous immediate change on the ground,” Juliette McIntyre, a lecturer in law at the University of South Australia who specializes in international courts and tribunals, wrote in an email. “Which means some will criticize the court for not going far enough.”
Amichai Cohen, a law professor at Israel’s Ono Academic College, noted that a cease-fire order, the outcome Israel feared most, did not materialize. “All in all, Israel’s position is certainly not better, but the worst anxieties regarding the court’s possible position were not realized,” he said.
Some rights groups welcomed the orders.
“The World Court’s landmark decision puts Israel and its allies on notice that immediate action is needed to prevent genocide and further atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza,” said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch.
South Africa presses genocide case against Israel at international court
In Ramallah, where around 150 people gathered at an auditorium Friday to watch a live stream of the proceedings, Palestinians expressed frustration that the court did not go further.
“I came here to see international justice achieved, but unfortunately the decision was unjust,” said Iyad Stesti, 41, a musician. “I was hoping and hoping for a complete cease-fire because people are suffering …
“The decision gives Israel a full month to kill Palestinian people in Gaza and commit genocide,” he said.
At the heart of South Africa’s case is the claim that Israel has shown genocidal intent in Gaza.
“Nothing will stop the suffering except an order from this court,” Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa, said this month.
In three hours of testimony on Jan. 11, South Africa’s legal team laid out the war’s devastating impact on civilians, including a soaring death toll and a spiraling humanitarian crisis.
“It is becoming ever clearer that huge swaths of Gaza — entire towns, villages, refugee camps — are being wiped from the map,” Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, an Irish lawyer on the South African team, said at the hearing. “On average, 247 Palestinians are being killed and are at risk of being killed each day, many of them literally blown to pieces. They include 48 mothers each day, two every hour. And over 117 children each day.”
They also argued that Israeli officials have used dehumanizing language in a calculated effort to normalize “genocidal rhetoric” and incite soldiers.
Israel argued against all the claims. The Israeli legal team argued Jan. 12 that the civilian toll in Gaza was an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of fighting a militant group that hides in civilian areas, including hospitals.
Israel rejects genocide allegations at international court
Israel accused the South Africans of taking remarks from leaders out of context and ignoring orders from officials to avoid unnecessary casualties. The team also sought to highlight efforts to limit civilian harm, citing, for example, its practice of calling homes and dropping leaflets to warn Palestinians of incoming airstrikes.
“It is in response to the slaughter of Oct. 7, which Hamas openly vows to repeat, and to the ongoing attacks against it from Gaza that Israel has the inherent right to take all legitimate measures to defend its citizens and secure the release of the hostages,” said Christopher Staker, a lawyer representing Israel.
Hendrix reported from Jerusalem. Sufian Taha in Ramallah, Adela Suliman and Ellen Francis in London and Karen DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.
The International Court of Justice ruled Friday that Israel must take measures to prevent the killing of more Palestinian civilians in Gaza and to prevent acts of genocide, although the court stopped short of calling for a cease-fire. The ruling is not a verdict on whether Israel has committed genocide, which could take years.
Biden plans to dispatch CIA Director William J. Burns in the coming days to help broker an ambitious hostage deal.
Frustration is turning to fury for Israel’s hostage families as calls for a two-state solution also intensify.
Oct. 7 attack: Hamas spent more than a year planning its assault on Israel. A Washington Post video analysis shows how Hamas exploited vulnerabilities created by Israel’s reliance on technology at the “Iron Wall,” the security barrier bordering the Gaza Strip, to carry out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.

Z1MYZYYQPB_O9T5RMBAII4O7YT,Opinion Vote for destruction in November,Eugene Robinson,"January 25, 2024 at 5:27 p.m. EST",20240125,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/25/republican-party-future-trump-save/,"Anyone who genuinely cares about the future of the Republican Party — and you should if you care about strengthening democracy — has only one option in November: Vote to destroy the party to save it.
I care about the GOP. No one has ever mistaken me for a conservative, but I believe our democracy functions best when there is healthy, fact-based competition between liberal and conservative viewpoints. Progressive ideas and policy positions are improved by being challenged, and the best decisions are forged from vigorous debate.
Now, however, we have the Democratic Party on one side and the Republican dumpster fire on the other. The GOP is a cult, held in thrall by an unstable bully and would-be authoritarian. Held captive by a man who sent armed insurrectionists to the Capitol in a violent attempt to overturn his defeat in a free and fair election. Held hostage by a man who punishes any perceived disloyalty with political execution.
At the 2020 Republican National Convention, the GOP didn’t even offer a party platform. Instead, it simply affirmed its “strong support for President Donald Trump” and his “America-first agenda,” whatever that might be at any given moment.
The nation would be foolish, at this point, to expect Republicans to rise up and free themselves. Look at how the congressional negotiations over border security and Ukraine aid have changed since Trump’s New Hampshire victory on Tuesday. Just last week, GOP senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), were optimistic that the package would swiftly be approved by the Senate. But on Wednesday, McConnell told a closed-door meeting of his caucus that there might no longer be a path forward for the bill — because Trump opposes any remedy for the border crisis that might make President Biden look good.
This is insanity. Democrats are offering something Republicans have wanted for years, and might never be offered again: tougher border security without a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country, including “dreamers.” But Dear Leader Trump says no and, suddenly, GOP senators are afraid to say yes.
Republicans in Congress, clearly, will not free their party. And it looks doubtful that the GOP base has any intention of breaking the chains that bind it.
Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley finished a strong second in New Hampshire, becoming the anti-Trump by default. But the next contested primary is a month away, and it is in her home state, which might not feel very welcoming. For four long weeks, she will have to survive withering personal attacks from Trump and calls from powerful Republicans to drop out of the race in the name of party unity. And then, if she makes it to Feb. 24, she will need a miracle.
The RealClearPolitics average of polls in South Carolina shows Trump with a 30-point lead. Those surveys were taken before the other GOP candidates dropped out, so Haley can be expected to close the gap. But virtually all of the state’s Republican elected officials have fallen in line behind Trump — including Sen. Tim Scott, whom Haley first appointed to the Senate in 2013 when she was governor, and who obsequiously told Trump “I just love you” during Trump’s New Hampshire victory speech.
It is also wrong to expect the justice system to come to the party’s rescue. It is possible that one or two of the criminal cases against Trump could end — in conviction or acquittal — before November. But that seems to me increasingly unlikely. And even if the former president is a felon, I find it hard to imagine his party throwing him overboard.
What can save the GOP from itself? Defeat. Crushing, unambiguous defeat.
Our political parties reform and reconstitute themselves after being soundly rebuked by the voters. After the disaster of President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation and the aimlessness of the Gerald Ford administration, Republicans regrouped and became the party of Ronald Reagan; his policies were not those I agreed with, but they were coherent and could be negotiated with. After Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis lost successive presidential elections, their party turned to Bill Clinton and the “new Democrats,” whose ideas were a break with the past — and, again, held together as an ideology.
If you want the GOP to be a serious conservative political party and not a MAGA cult, send Republicans into the wilderness. Vote for Biden. Take away Republicans’ control of the House. Give Democrats a bigger majority in the Senate. Vote Republican officials out of statehouses, city halls and school boards.
Make the metaphorical ashes from which a new GOP can rise."
ZC734WMNBK_CPVN4W0BWUQNTWW,Musk visits Auschwitz amid surge in antisemitic posts on X,Taylor Telford,"January 22, 2024 at 11:56 a.m. EST",20240122,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/22/elon-musk-auschwitz-visit/,"Tech titan Elon Musk made a private visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland on Monday, a gesture that comes weeks after he faced criticism for the proliferation of antisemitic content on his social media platform, X.
Jewish leaders had called on Musk to witness the site of one of the most horrific chapters of the Holocaust amid escalating allegations of antisemitism against Musk and the platform, which he purchased and took private in 2022.
Antisemitism was rising online. Then Elon Musk’s X supercharged it.
The Anti-Defamation League has reported that antisemitic content surged more than 900 percent on X in the weeks after the Israel-Gaza conflict erupted on Oct. 7, with Musk using his account to amplify antisemitic tropes. The White House in November criticized him for “abhorrent promotion of Antisemitic and racist hate.”
“As Musk learns from his trip, we hope he and the leadership team at X will reflect on the ways in which antisemitism has been allowed to spread on their platform,” a spokesperson for the ADL said Friday in a statement to The Washington Post.
Musk and his representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk threatened to sue the ADL over its report. But he has also embarked on media appearances in which he rebuked the Hamas militants for murdering innocent civilians. He toured a kibbutz with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late November and was shown a video documenting atrocities against Israelis on Oct. 7.
Scores of major advertisers, including Disney and Universal, fled X in November after the left-leaning nonprofit group Media Matters for America revealed that Musk’s social media platform had been placing ads for major brands such as Apple next to antisemitic content, with memes portraying Nazism as a spiritual awakening and Adolf Hitler quotes presented in an inspirational style.
During World War II, more than 1 million people, overwhelmingly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz amid the occupation by Nazi Germany.
Musk toured the death camp alongside European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin, who in a live-streamed event on X in September invited the billionaire to Auschwitz “to walk there, to feel it, to understand it.” Musk laid a wreath at the wall of death and took part in a short ceremony and service by the Birkenau memorial, the European Jewish Association (EJA) said in a statement emailed to The Post.
Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev and conservative pundit Ben Shapiro also toured the site with Musk ahead of a conference the EJA is hosting in Krakow later Monday. Musk also brought one of his young sons.
At the EJA conference in Krakow, Musk had been slated to chat with Shapiro about antisemitism, but the discussion was canceled. Shapiro has appeared publicly with Musk on the subject of antisemitism before. In a Sept. 28 discussion broadcast on X, Musk said he went to a Hebrew preschool in South Africa and described himself as “aspirationally Jewish.”"
ZK5R63RYK3_A0HL98ZTOPQ8E8M,What happens to a campaign headquarters when the campaign ends?,Philip Bump,"January 23, 2024 at 1:28 p.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/23/what-happens-campaign-headquarters-when-campaign-ends/,"Presidential campaigns are, in essence, businesses with a limited shelf life. The candidate is the product. The campaign tries to sell the product with ads and outreach and by getting media attention. Donors are investors; power is the return. And at the scale of a major-party presidential nominee, the business is national, with thousands of employees and an enormous budget spanning an extended period of time.
At the level of state primary, though, it’s different. The duration is shorter and the scale more modest. Particularly in places such as Iowa or New Hampshire, where nearly every campaign settles down at least for a while, it’s a part of the local economy, hiring people and buying ad time and — to the point of this article — renting space where the often-dull work of campaigning can take place.
The result is that presidential campaigns often get short-term leases on properties in places such as Des Moines or Manchester, N.H., spaces that are used for a bit and then rented out again to someone else.
When I was in Manchester last weekend, a though occurred to me: What are the spaces I saw in 2016 and 2020 being used for now? So I went around and took photos of the past headquarters used by candidates vying for the primary in those years. It offers an interesting lens into both the process of campaigning — and the local and national economy.

This wasn’t quite as easy as it might seem. Many of the spaces rented by campaigns are just offices within office buildings (albeit often large ones). That was the case with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s 2016 office in New Hampshire, which occupied the second floor of a building in a medical center.
The outside of the building hasn’t changed and, at a glance, it would be hard to tell what replaced Christie (in the building, not on the ballot). The answer: a medical billing office.
Sometimes, though, it’s very easy to tell. That’s the case with former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley whose (mostly empty) 2016 headquarters, located in a storefront at a strip mall, is now a vape shop.
It declined to retain the graffitilike effect on the window.
The office from which the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) dispatched volunteers in 2016 went more the route of Christie’s headquarters, being replaced by a property tax management company.
His campaign had another office, too — located with some irony on the second floor of an office building affiliated with Citizens Bank.
Over the intervening eight years, the “Bernie” sign has come down.
Former Ohio governor John Kasich’s 2016 campaign was  based in a weirdly situated Colonial-style house, next to a gas station and a major highway. It is now a landscape supply company, with the remnants of a pile of mulch sitting outside.
Just north of Kasich’s headquarters that year was that of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Like Christie’s, the headquarters featured a large room over another building but, unlike Christie’s, the entrance was up a wooden staircase in the back.
Eight years later, the staircase is noticeably more worn and the space is empty.
That means that the sign out front, which in 2016 promoted Cruz to my amusement, also has an empty spot that Cruz once occupied.
One of the most remarkable transformations since 2016 involves the headquarters of former Florida governor Jeb Bush. In 2016, he occupied a run-down space along Elm Street just south of downtown Manchester. The awning was collapsing and the graveyard just behind the building offered a too-easy metaphor.
When I went back in 2020, I noticed that the awning had been fixed up, but I didn’t take a picture. No matter; bigger changes were looming.
The Bush headquarters was torn down and a mixed-use building was constructed in its place. There’s probably a metaphor in this, too, but I’ll leave that to others.
You can see the pattern here, though. Shifts from campaigns to real estate, medical care, vaping — a decent encapsulation of changes to the national economy since 2016. And, of course, that some of the spaces are still empty.
That’s true, too, even over the past four years. Sanders’s 2020 space — across the parking lot from the Citizens Bank and next to a grocery store — is currently available for rent.
The campaign headquarters of Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) was located upstairs in a downtown Manchester office building. Since then, not much has changed.
In fact, this same building also housed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 headquarters (though I didn’t take an outside photo at the time). According to the window signage, her suite (300) was unoccupied in 2020 and is unoccupied now.
The 2020 campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was located in the lower level of an apartment building near downtown. The building is still an apartment building; it wasn’t clear when I was there Sunday what might be in her campaign’s old space.
Pete Buttigieg, now the transportation secretary, ran his 2020 presidential campaign out of an art space across the street from the arena in downtown Manchester. It’s still there.
His 2020 rival, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), had a storefront a bit farther from downtown, plastered with campaign signs. Now, it’s a tax preparation center.
(It is also just behind Donald Trump’s 2024 headquarters and across the street from Democrat Marianne Williamson’s.)
In 2020, Andrew Yang had one of the most interesting headquarters, located across the Merrimack River from downtown in a tiny building in a residential neighborhood.
It has since been converted into a coffee shop.
Joe Biden’s efforts in New Hampshire four years ago were not terribly impressive, given that he finished fifth.
His primary headquarters then was in a meeting hall for the firefighters union; that’s what it still is today.
He had a secondary office in downtown Manchester (around the corner from the Bennet-Clinton building). It, too, is the same art gallery it was then.
Now we reach the kicker to this story.
In 2016, Donald Trump came into New Hampshire having just narrowly lost Iowa. His campaign was run out of another office building in Manchester — a building that also housed the offices of Americans for Prosperity, for which his campaign manager Corey Corey Lewandowski had once worked.
A sort of overhang out front of the building bore a Trump sign.
That sign is no longer there. Instead, it has been replaced by a sign promoting Real Options, a women’s health clinic that offers counseling and advice to women seeking abortions — albeit, according to one abortion-access organization, to dissuade women from seeking abortions.

ZROYOCP7NU_E3OTBOELENYE3W3,"Thelma Z. Lavine, who brought an accessible approach to philosophy, dies",Emma Brown,"February 27, 2011 at 10:15 a.m. EST",20240123,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/professor-made-philosophy-accessible/2011/02/21/ABHF2FI_story.html,"Thelma Z. Lavine, a professor at several Washington area universities who was known for making Western philosophy broadly accessible in her writings and television appearances, died Jan. 28 at her home in the District of cardiac arrest. She was 95.
Dr. Lavine specialized in 19th century German philosophy, the sociology of knowledge, and American philosophy, particularly the writings of psychologist and educational reformer John Dewey.
Described in a Washington Post profile as “an evangelist for philosophy,” she taught at the University of Maryland during the 1950s and ’60s and then for two decades at George Washington University. She was on the George Mason University faculty from 1985 until she retired in 1998.
At all three schools, she was known for teaching popular courses that emphasized connections between philosophy, economics, history and contemporary American culture.
“One of the things that intrigues my students is that I laugh a lot,” she told The Post in 1985. “Philosophy is comic because a lot of it is gamesmanship, and the efforts on either side of an issue are never entirely conclusive.”
She was the author of “From Socrates to Sartre: The Philosophic Quest” (1984), a concise history of Western thought that used plain language to raise provocative questions, such as whether one could prove the existence of God and the meaning of existential author Jean-Paul Sartre’s statement that man is “condemned to be free.”
“From Socrates to Sartre,” which a Post review called “thoroughly accessible to the budding philosopher,” grew out of a 30-part series of Dr. Lavine’s lectures that were initially broadcast by Maryland Public Television and later were shown by public television stations across the country. The series brought thousands of letters from viewers.
“She made me see how philosophy reaches into every single minute crevice of life,” a former student, Lisa Seigel, told The Post in 1985. “She taught me how to think.”
Thelma Zeno Lavine was born in Boston on Feb. 12, 1915.
Her father, a designer of women’s clothing, chose her middle name, which came from Zeno of Citium, founder of Stoicism — that philosophy of fortitude and self-control. “It was part of his very sober view of human life,” Dr. Lavine later said. “He was not exactly an enlightened optimist.”
She received a bachelor’s degree from Radcliffe College in 1936 and received doctorates in philosophy and psychology from Harvard University.
Dr. Lavine taught at Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., and Brooklyn College before joining the University of Maryland faculty in 1955.
She was the author of scholarly articles and reviews and was a past president of the Washington Philosophy Club and the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy.
Dr. Lavine’s other memberships included the Cosmos Club in Washington and the executive board of the Washington School of Psychiatry’s Forum on Psychiatry and the Humanities.
Her husband of 40 years, Jerome J. Sachs, died in 1984. Survivors include a daughter, Margaret V. Sachs of Athens, Ga."
