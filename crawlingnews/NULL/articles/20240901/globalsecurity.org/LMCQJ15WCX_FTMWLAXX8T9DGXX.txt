Japan and Australia will hold a "two-plus-two" security meeting in Australia on Thursday, aiming to strengthen defense and security cooperation, which Chinese analysts warn would be disruptive and detrimental to the regional stability and exert significant impact to push the Asia-Pacific region into security dilemmas or traps.
Japanese media outlet Jiji Press News reported on Friday that Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Defense Minister Minoru Kihara, and Australia by Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles.
Jiji noted that Tokyo and Canberra are expected to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening collaboration, citing China's behavior in the region.
According to analysts, the promotion of Japan-Australia cooperation came as the US launched the so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy and stepped up its pressure to push forward the coordination among allies and partners in an attempt to contain China and undermine its peaceful development.
Since the Australia-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), a treaty that provides a framework for each country's forces to operate in the other's, came into force in August 2023, how to further deepen and cooperate with each other based on the agreement could be a matter for discussion during the upcoming security meeting, said Chen Hong, executive director of Asia Pacific Studies Centre at East China Normal University.
With Japan also hyping up the Taiwan question and the Diaoyu Islands issue and stirring up trouble over the South China Sea issue, it is believed that Australia may conduct some cooperative actions under the guidance of US' anti-China strategy, according to Chen.
"It cannot be ruled out that Japan and Australia may propose joint military exercises, or even rope in a third party, such as the Philippines, to join," Chen said.
Also, considering that Japan might one day in some capacity join the AUKUS, an Australia-UK-US security partnership, related discussions are expected to be covered during the Japan-Australia security meeting, as they want to form a circle of deterrence around China, Chen noted.
The expert warned that as the Asia-Pacific is the engine of the world economy, undermining peace and stability in the region is actually a threat to world peace, security and development, which is also a serious concern for the international community.
