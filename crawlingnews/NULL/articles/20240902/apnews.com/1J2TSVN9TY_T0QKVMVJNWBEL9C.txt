FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) — An Arkansas woman has pleaded guilty to felony charges after she threatened in a phone call to bomb the office of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Susan Scott, a 66-year-old Fort Smith woman, pleaded guilty Friday to threatening a catastrophe and second-degree battery of a police officer.
Scott was sentenced to the 78 days she had already served in the Sebastian County jail and a $2,500 fine. Sebastian County Circuit Judge R. Gunner DeLay also ordered Scott to have no contact with Sanders and her family or the officer who arrested Scott. The judge ordered Scott to complete an anger management class within the next 6 months.
Investigators said Scott made the threat on June 14 and continued to make threats against Sanders when officers arrested her at home. She was charged with battery because police said Scott resisted arrest, including kicking and head-butting an officer, and had been held in jail since then.
Shue said in a news release that sentencing guidelines recommended against prison time for Scott and that both Sanders and the police officer approved of the plea that didn’t require further incarceration. He said the officer wasn’t seriously injured and Scott “has no present ability to manufacture an explosive device, much less place and detonate an explosive device in the Office of the Governor.”
