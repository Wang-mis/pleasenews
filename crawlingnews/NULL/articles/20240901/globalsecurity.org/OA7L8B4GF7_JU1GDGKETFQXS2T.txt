Advisor - Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights and Child Rehabilitation Daria Herasymchuk, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine Matthias Schmale and UNICEF Representative to Ukraine Munir Mammadzade signed an agreement to continue the cooperation between the Ukrainian government and the UN's National Task Force under the Joint Preventive Plan "Children and Armed Conflicts."
"Every step within the plan, developed jointly with the United Nations, is vital for the protection of our children. We cannot stop until every child is safe," said Daria Herasymchuk.
The extension of cooperation with the UN for another year is one of the steps in implementing Bring Kids Back UA, a comprehensive action plan initiated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This plan unites the efforts of Ukraine, foreign governments, and international organizations to return home Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.
