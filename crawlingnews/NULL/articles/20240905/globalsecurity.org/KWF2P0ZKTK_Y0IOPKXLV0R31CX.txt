Question: Will you comment on reports about Ukraine's ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on the condition that the Court's jurisdiction over war crimes committed by its nationals is limited for a period of seven years? What, in Moscow's opinion, could explain this reservation?
Maria Zakharova: Everyone is all too familiar with the reputation both the Kiev regime and the ICC have. Neither is independent, and neither can be associated with law or justice. It is a case when two negatives don't make an affirmative but raise lawlessness to the square.
The reservation made by Ukraine upon the ratification of the Rome Statute clearly shows the Kiev authorities' real attitude to international humanitarian law and justice.  In effect, they want to protect their citizens from the jurisdiction of that court, which is extremely loyal to them, while keeping the ability to initiate criminal proceedings in The Hague against citizens of other countries on the charges Kiev itself falsifies. This move cannot be regarded as anything other than an undisguised intention to give their military a free hand to commit grave war crimes.
All their attempts to evade responsibility are doomed. The Ukrainian criminals who are guilty of committing grave international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be called to account and get the punishment they deserve.
