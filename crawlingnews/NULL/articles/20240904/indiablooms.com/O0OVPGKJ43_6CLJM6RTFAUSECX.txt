Two people were killed and 10 others including a minor, policemen and a reporter were injured in a fresh violence which took place on Monday.
The attack took place in Koutruk village in the Imphal West district, which borders Kuki tribes-dominated Kangpokpi district.
Several houses and vehicles were set on fire allegedly by the Kuki insurgents on Sunday night.
Security forces had covered up the entire area on Monday morning.
The area was volatile even on Monday. As per a report by NDTV, intermittent firing and explosions were heard at a distance.
Janghaolun, a spokesperson of Manipur's Kuki Inpi, said as quoted by NDTV, "The violence in Manipur will continue to escalate till the time there is no permanent political solution or Biren Singh remains the Chief Minister."
More than 200 people died and about 50,000 others displaced after the ethnic clash between the Meiteis and Kukis broke out in Manipur on May 3, 2023.
The outbreak of violence in Manipur can be traced back to the 'Tribal Solidarity March' initiated by the All Tribal Students' Union of Manipur (ATSUM).
The march was organized as a form of protest against the demand to include the Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category, which was prompted by a directive from the Manipur High Court on April 19.
The march served as a catalyst for the subsequent escalation of violence in the region.
Approximately 53 percent of the population in Manipur comprises Meiteis, residing predominantly in the Imphal Valley, while the remaining 40 percent consists of tribal communities such as Kukis, residing primarily in the hill districts surrounding the Valley.
