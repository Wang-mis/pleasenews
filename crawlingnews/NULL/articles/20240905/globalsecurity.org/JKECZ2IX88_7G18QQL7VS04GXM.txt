Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Estonia was very disappointed that Mongolia decided to welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"All parties of the Rome Statute are obligated to comply with the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and arrest war criminal Putin if he enters their territory. The fact that the Mongolian government decided to roll out the red carpet instead of arresting him strongly undermines the ICC and the international legal system. Mongolia had the historic chance to contribute to the end of Russia's war in Ukraine and they decided to pass on it. Russian war criminals must be punished."
