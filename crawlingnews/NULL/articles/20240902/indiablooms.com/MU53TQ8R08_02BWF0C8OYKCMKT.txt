The hearing was cancelled as Chief Justice DY Chandrachud will not be holding the court on Thursday.
As per Thursday's listing, the matter will be heard by a bench comprising the Chief Justice along with Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra.
The announcement was seen as a major blow to the junior doctors and protesters, who had been waiting with bated breath and expecting justice for the victim of the brutal rape and murder that took place at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9.

It came on a day when Kolkata was observing another night vigil with people gathering at various points of the city to keep unwavering pressure on the authorities and judiciary for fair investigation and justice in the case.
In a rare show of citizens' solidarity, Kolkata observed its second-night vigil by turning off lights and coming out on streets with candles in their hands in demand of justice for the 31-year-old junior doctor who was brutally raped and murdered at RG Kar Hospital on Aug 9.
