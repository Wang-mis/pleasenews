The day marked the inception of the Tibetan democratic system in exile.
On this day, the Tibetan parliament-in-exile was established in 1960 following the arrival of the Dalai Lama and 80,000 Tibetans in exile in Dharamshala, reported ANI.
While speaking to ANI, a resident of Dharamshala expressed his pleasure on the occasion and said the day is very special for Tibetan people.
“In 1960, Dalai Lama declared the democracy system, started some members of parliament from the different regions of Tibet and then set up the democracy parliament system. A huge number of people from the three regions and also five sectarians of Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet. Since that, we have got a democracy system, as gradually we have the increased members of parliament from different regions,” he added.
