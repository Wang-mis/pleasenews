In two separate attacks, at least 3 Israeli settlers have been injured in the occupied West Bank.
Media reports said on Friday the incidents happened in two different Israeli settlements.
The first incident took place close to a gas station near Al-Quds where a vehicle exploded, injuring two settlers.
The Israeli military says the man behind the attack was shot and killed.
Separately, in an attempted car ramming attack a settler was injured near Al-Khalil.
The regime troops said the person responsible was shot and killed.
The operations come against the backdrop of Israel's large-scale incursion into the occupied West Bank.
The regime has killed over 670 Palestinians in the West Bank since it started genocide in the Gaza Strip last October.
Israeli assaults on refugee camps and towns in the West Bank are a near-daily occurrence and have intensified since October 7.
Since then, Israel has killed at least 40,600 people and wounded another 93,778 in the besieged Gaza Strip
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, al-Haq and Al Mezan Center for Human Rights have warned of escalating violence in the West Bank and the use of tactics by Israeli forces that the world has witnessed in its war on Gaza.
In a landmark opinion on July 19, the International Court of Justice declared Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian land unlawful and demanded the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East al-Quds.
Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East al-Quds, areas Palestinians want for a future independent state, in a 1967 war.
