Moreh is a town bordering Myanmar and it has been alleged by the state government that miscreants from the neighbouring country are fomenting trouble in the northeastern state.
""The allegation of the Committee on Tribal Unity (COTU) and the Kuki Inpi Manipur regarding collaborations with valley-based insurgent groups and Meitei militants disguised as security force personnel in Moreh is not true. The allegations are baseless and misleading,"" the police said in a statement.
Two police commandos were killed on January 17 in militant attacks in Moreh, while several others were injured.
Kuki organisations alleged that surrendered valley-based insurgents were allowed to ""mix freely"" with the state police.
Manipur has been rocked by ethnic strife since May last year and more than 180 people were killed.
The violence erupted on May 3 after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community’s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.
Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts."

""Our 'Mohabbat ki dukaan' (shop of love) is open for everyone. 'Judega Bharat, Jeetega Hindustan',"" Gandhi said in a post on X while sharing a video of the incident.
Later addressing a public meeting here, the Congress MP narrated the incident and said the Congress is neither scared of Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.
The Congress has claimed that its leaders, including Gandhi and Jairam Ramesh, were targeted by BJP supporters during the Assam leg of the Manipur-to-Maharashtra Nyay Yatra.
The BJP, however, claimed that Gandhi was rattled after ""Jai Shri Ram"" and ""Modi, Modi"" slogans were raised in his presence.
""If this is how rattled he is, how will he face the people of this country in days ahead, after the anti-Hindu Congress rejected the invite to be part of the 'Pran Pratishtha' (January 22 Ram temple consecration ceremony ) in Ayodhya?"" BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said on X tagging the video.
BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said some people chanted ""'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Modi, Modi"" during the yatra ""so Rahul Gandhi arrogantly charges at them"".
""Security personnel stopped him. 'Mohabbat ki dukaan' or 'Ahankaar ki Dukaan' (shop of arrogance) Shameful and atrocious behaviour by entitled dynast! He even made kissing actions to the crowd!!"" he said on X.
At the public meeting, Gandhi said, ""Some 2-3 kms before, around 20-25 BJP workers carrying sticks came in front of our bus, and when I came out from the bus, they ran away...they think that the Congress is scared of BJP and RSS workers."" 	""What kind of dream are they seeing. They can tear as many posters and placards as they want, we don't care, and are not bothered. We are not scared of anybody, we are neither scared of Narendra Modi nor the chief minister here,"" he said.
During his earlier Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi had made similar gestures to a crowd which chanted ""Modi, Modi"" slogans when the march was in Rajasthan.
The Congress has alleged that the ""attacks"" on its yatra have the backing of Chief Minister Sarma.
In his speech at Nagaon public meeting, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge targeted Sarma, saying, ""This is something like 'Meri billi mujh se meow'.""  	""The cat which once belonged to the Congress is now doing 'meow' to us,"" Kharge said. Sarma had quit the Congress to join the BJP in 2015.	 	AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said his vehicle was attacked by some BJP protesters but he kept his composure and moved on.
""My vehicle was attacked a few minutes ago at Jumugurihat, Sunitpur, by an unruly BJP crowd who also tore off the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra stickers from the windshield. They threw water and shouted anti-BJNY (Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra) slogans,"" he said.
""But we kept our composure, waved to the hooligans and sped away. This is undoubtedly the Assam CM's doing. We are not intimidated and will soldier on,"" Ramesh said.
AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said, ""Complete lawlessness at display in Assam. All along the yatra route, the CM has stationed his goons to attack the yatra and disrupt our peaceful march for justice.""   	""He's completely mistaken to think this will deter us. If anything, this has given us more strength to ensure his and Narendra Modi's defeat, "" he said.
The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will pass through 100 Lok Sabha constituencies in 15 states, traversing 6,713 km, mostly in buses but also on foot, and culminate in Mumbai on March 20 or 21. It began from Thoubal in Manipur on January 14.

The Batadrawa Than is located at the birthplace of Assamese icon Srimanta Sankardeva, a social-religious reformer of the 15th-16th century.
In a letter to Batadrawa's Congress MLA Shibamoni Bora on Sunday afternoon, the managing committee's president Jogendra Nath Dev Mahanta said that on the occasion of the Ram temple's consecration, several organisations have planned devotional programmes at the premises of the Than.
""Several thousands of people are expected to visit the place and as such we cannot allow Gandhi to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
""We had received a letter from Bora regarding the Congress MP's visit and we extend a warm welcome to him but we cannot allow him to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the committee, he added.
Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Gandhi should avoid visiting Batadrawa on January 22 as there can be no competition between Lord Ram and the medieval-age Vaishnav saint.
""We will request Rahul Gandhi not to visit Batadrawa on Monday during the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple as it will reflect Assam in the wrong light,"" he said at a press conference.
He can go after the consecration ceremony without creating ""unnecessary competition which will be sad for Assam"", Sarma said.
The chief minister said that he is pained to know that when PM Narendra Modi will participate in the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya, Gandhi will be at the Batadrawa sattra.
""This is a wrong projection. There is no competition between Ram and Sankardeva and when the nation's focus is on Ayodhya, it should not be unnecessarily diverted to Assam. We will be grateful if he avoids going to the Sattra during the Pran Pratistha of the Ram temple,"" he said.
The visit can be rescheduled to early morning or in the evening, he said.
Reacting to Sarma's statement, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said that Gandhi would visit the Than as planned, maintaining that no politics should be done over it.

The level of death, destruction and displacement from the war already is without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet Israeli officials say the fighting is likely to continue for several more months.
The slow progress and the plight of the hostages held in Gaza has divided ordinary Israelis and their leaders even as the offensive threatens to ignite a wider war involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
The United States, which has provided essential diplomatic and military support for the offensive, has had limited success in persuading Israel to adopt military tactics that put civilians at less risk and to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has rejected U.S. and international calls for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
GAZA DEATH TOLL CLIMBS AMID BLISTERING OFFENSIVE
The war began with Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on October 7, during which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel responded with a blistering three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that laid waste to entire neighbourhoods. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.
Israel continues to carry out airstrikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.
Since the war started, a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry reported on Sunday.
The death toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza's hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were wounded in the past day, he said.
The overall toll is thought to be even higher because many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says around two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors.
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of UN agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighbourhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
The war has displaced some 85 per cent of Gaza's residents from their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into UN-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave.
UN officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
ISRAELIS INCREASINGLY DIVIDED
Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves “complete victory” over Hamas and returns all the remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only managed to rescue one hostage since the war began, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel's War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the remaining hostages was through a cease-fire. In an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amounted to “illusions”.
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group also is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel's government has ruled that out for now, but it faces rising pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for another exchange, and from Israelis frustrated by the security failures that preceded the October 7 attack and by Netanyahu's handling of the war.
Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners are meanwhile pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces."

AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh made this statement during a media conference in Lakhimpur on Saturday, addressing reporters' persistent enquiries about the whereabouts of Rahul and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on January 22.
Ramesh said: “Around 7am on January 22, Rahulji will be at Bordowa Than in Nagaon district...It is the birthplace of Sri Sri Sankardeva who was a mahan dharma guru, social reformer and cultural icon of our country.”
Though the saint-reformer and playwright was born in the 15th century, “his life is still an inspiration to crores of people”. “His pieces of advice are even more relevant in today’s age. Rahulji will offer his shradhhanjali to him there (Bordowa Than) on the morning of January 22,” he said.
Rahul will then address a public rally with party president Mallikarjun Kharge at Kaliabor, also in Nagaon district.
Ramesh also spoke on the hurdles the Yatra is facing on its Assam leg, with Assam PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah condemning the alleged attack on Youth Congress vehicles and tearing down of the Yatra posters and banners on Friday night in Lakhimpur.
“We will not be cowed down by these attacks. The BJP government is rattled with the support the Yatra has received from the people of Assam. The Yatra is unstoppable,” he told The Telegraph.
The Congress has gone all out against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the BJP for allegedly creating hurdles for the Yatra. Ramesh said he was requesting BJP president J.P. Nadda to say only two things to Sarma. “We do not need any new evidence of his (Sarma) loyalty to the RSS-BJP. Give permission to take out Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from the same route through which J.P. Naddaji's rally took place.”
Nadda had undertaken a road show in Guwahati last week, but the administration is not allowing the Congress to undertake even short padyatras.
In a post, Kharge also condemned the “shameful attack on the #BharatJodoNyayYatra vehicles and tearing of the Congress party's banners and posters by BJP goons in Lakhimpur”.
The Assam chief minister is expected to respond to the Congress's charges in a news meet on Sunday."

6U3IPCF0US_5G9WPV1T0VLQJ30,Bonbibi: The beloved forest goddess of Hindus and Muslims of the Sunderbans,"Chandrima S. Bhattacharya Published 21.01.24, 05:37 AM","Chandrima S. Bhattacharya Published 21.01.24, 05:37 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/culture/bonbibi-the-beloved-goddess-of-hindus-and-muslims-of-sunderbans/cid/1995185,"Residents of Kalitala-Samshernagar in Hingalganj block in the Sunderbans are very happy with a recent gift from the chief minister: a brand new temple of Bonbibi, the forest goddess.
The temple is all marble and tiles, with the light shining off its polished surfaces, and it is expected that the chief minister will inaugurate it soon. The people of Hingalganj are waiting eagerly for the occasion.
But one wonders what Bonbibi would have made of her new home. The oldest of the temples of Bonbibi, who is worshipped as the protector of all creatures from the dangers of the forest, especially from the tiger, were built decades ago — at the very least — and are a far cry from the marble-and-tile structure that is the Hingalganj temple.
In the interiors of the Sunderbans, Bonbibi temples can look like survivors from another time.
Of late, Bonbibi’s popularity has travelled far beyond the Sunderbans, even into Coke Studio as a song — one reason, perhaps, behind the idea that she deserves a “modern” home even in the Sunderbans.
In the forest area of Kultali is located an old Bonbibi temple that is visited frequently by local residents and outsiders. Kultali is one of the places in the Sunderbans where tigers are being sighted in increasing numbers now. Every year, on the last Tuesday of the Bengali month of Baisakh, a Bonbibi mela is organised. The occasion draws thousands of people, including Hindus and Muslims, as Bonbibi is revered by both communities.
According to her story, which lives on in many versions and is also sung by her devotees as Bonbibir gaan, she defeats Dakshin Ray, the tiger god of the Sunderbans, and at once takes over the Sunderbans and saves the people from Dakshin Ray, who, too, continues to be worshipped.
Getting to the temple is not easy. One has to go by boat, down a hauntingly beautiful, serene green-blue stream that flows into River Matla, which reigns wide and sweeping against the horizon. To get to the boat is not easy either; the slope of the mudbanks is treacherous. An untrained urban body can disappear swiftly into its depths if not supported by able hands. My friend and I are being taken to the temple by Kamal Bera, a fisherman who lives in a village in Mai-pith area of Kultali.
Pugmarks of the tiger leading to the temple.                                                             Chandrima S. Bhattacharya
Bera has absolute faith in Bonbibi. He starts out every day, or night, as it may be, into the perilous waters and forests by taking Bonbibi’s name. To her, he owes his survival, he says. We are in his small diesel-driven fishing boat. With him is his helper. On both sides of the blue-green water are mangrove forests. On the way, we pick up Rabin Guchchhait, who does the puja at the Bonbibi temple.
Like Guchchhait, often Bonbibi’s priests are not Brahmins. “Eta amader gorib jele-bauleder pujo… This is the puja of us, the poor jele-baule community,” says Guchchhait. “We do not know any mantras.”
We get down at a spot that marks the beginning of Bonbibi’s “thaan” (from sthaan, or place). My heart skips a few beats as I look down. Pugmarks are all around us. Clear large ones and smaller smudged ones mark the length of the narrow path that leads from the mudbank to the temple, our destination.
“That mark is old, from a few days earlier, but this one is from this morning,” says Bera. “Eta Bonbibir thaan. This is where the tigers will come,” he says. “All you have to do is have faith in Bonbibi,” he says.
This is the sanctum sanctorum. Tigers roam here, Bera seems to say, but they are rendered powerless by the goddess. Bera’s father, a fisherman like him, was killed by a tiger. Guchchhait says he once rescued someone from the tiger’s jaws. They have lost count how many times they have seen a tiger. The number of tigers is growing significantly now, they say. But no tiger ever attacks at the thaan, they insist. Their grandfathers, who had migrated to the Sunderbans from Midnapore, had built the temple, they say.
The temple is a revelation. It is a large, beautiful, spare, mud structure supported by bamboo poles. Its only concession to modern age is the tin roof. The inside is bare, except for eight, rather grand, idols in a row. In the middle, on the right side, is Bonbibi. One of the best-dressed goddesses, she is wearing a sari here, though sometimes she can also be seen wearing a ghagra and salwar. But her headdress is like that of a Muslim princess. She has an enchanting, heart-shaped face, a bright yellow complexion and looks on benignly at what stretches ahead of her: the river and the forest. To her left is Shah Jangali, her brother. Next to him are Boro Gaji Khan Saheb, a king, says Guchchhait, and Peer Saheb, his minister. Peer Saheb is also known as Chhawal Peer, one who blesses people with children.
Guchchhait performs the worship of these four, who are of Muslim origin, during the festival. The puja is performed simply, without any mantra, just by offering Bonbibi and her companions some food and flowers. To Bonbibi’s right are four “Hindu” goddesses, says Guchchhait: Narayani Debi, Dakshin Ray’s mother, riding a tiger here, Ma Bishalakshi, very similar to Kali, Ma Manasa, the goddess of snakes, and Ma Ganga, the river goddess, with Makar, her vahana. Their puja, during the same festival, is performed by a Hindu Brahmin priest.
This very pantheon should be enough as an ans-wer to the peddlers of communal politics, who are now also trying to appropriate Dakshin Ray as “Hindu” and alienating “Bonbibi” as Muslim, as temples take centre stage. “Devotees turn up in thousands to attend the festival, both Hindus and Muslims,” says Guchchhait.
Bonbibi’s story is also an interesting reference to a period in Bengal’s history. According to Munsi Baynaddi’s kechchha-kabya (narrative poems in praise of a deity’s accomplishments), Bonbibi Jahuranama, Bonbibi and her brother Shah Jangali had come over from Mecca to rule over Badaban, or the Sunderbans, points out Gopendrakrishna Basu in his book Banglar Loukik Debata. In a parallel account, Bonbibi defeats Dakshin Ray to rescue Dukhe, a poor youth who was tricked by his relatives into being sacrificed for Dakshin Ray. Some Bonbibi idols have her carrying Dukhe, like a child, on her lap.
In the last few years, Bonbibi’s popularity has grown spectacularly, outside the Sunderbans and into popular culture. The goddess got global recognition since Amitav Ghosh wrote The Hungry Tide, his novel set in the Sunderbans. Since then, she has appeared in a Bengali film and also in Coke Studio, where she is rather unre- cognisable as a pretty young, slim woman with a tall headdress moving to fusion beats.
All this has not changed Bera’s life. He has to go fishing every day, sometimes in the dead of night, though he has stopped catching crabs, which takes one to the interiors of the forest. Many deaths occur from tiger attacks when men go to collect crabs or honey. Bera also farms and manages a fishery, and yet finds it hard to make both ends meet. “I hardly sleep,” he says. Neither does his wife, who works by his side all day long and also manages the household, though she does not go fishing.
Having faith is the only way to survive. “You will meet the tiger,” says Bera. “And you can never trust him. Only if you can look into the tiger’s eye, you can win. But how many can do that? So you have to have faith in Bonbibi,” he says. At this point, Guchchhait expresses his heart’s desire. “We also want to construct a concrete temple here,” he says.
Thankfully the forest department has stopped this effort so far. But in this age of temples, we do not know for how long."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has rejected U.S. and international calls for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
GAZA DEATH TOLL CLIMBS AMID BLISTERING OFFENSIVE
The war began with Hamas' surprise attack in southern Israel on October 7, during which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel responded with a blistering three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that laid waste to entire neighbourhoods. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.
Israel continues to carry out airstrikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.
Since the war started, a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry reported on Sunday.
The death toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza's hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were wounded in the past day, he said.
The overall toll is thought to be even higher because many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says around two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors.
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of UN agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighbourhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
The war has displaced some 85 per cent of Gaza's residents from their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into UN-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave.
UN officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
ISRAELIS INCREASINGLY DIVIDED
Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves “complete victory” over Hamas and returns all the remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only managed to rescue one hostage since the war began, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel's War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the remaining hostages was through a cease-fire. In an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amounted to “illusions”.
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group also is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel's government has ruled that out for now, but it faces rising pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for another exchange, and from Israelis frustrated by the security failures that preceded the October 7 attack and by Netanyahu's handling of the war.
Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners are meanwhile pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces."

Vincent New Delhi Published 21.01.24, 06:23 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/in-delhi-high-court-a-delicious-dispute-between-moti-mahal-and-daryaganj-proprietors/cid/1995199,"A delicious dispute has made it to the case menu of Delhi High Court.
The owners of an iconic chain of restaurants have sued a rival chain, started by a descendant of their late partner, for claiming to have crafted two dishes synonymous with post-Partition Delhi: butter chicken and dal makhani.
Moti Mahal’s proprietors told the court that they “are the owners of the famous trademark ‘Moti Mahal’ and related formative marks, used in relation to restaurants operating nationally and internationally since 1920”, and that “the defendants are misleading the public into believing that their ‘Daryaganj’ restaurants are connected with the plaintiffs’ predecessor’s first ‘Moti Mahal’ restaurant in Daryaganj”.
The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Sandeep Sethi, told the court of Justice Sanjeev Narula on Tuesday that the proof of the alleged misrepresentation by the defendant was the “use of a picture of the plaintiffs’ predecessor, the (late) Kundan Lal Gujral, on their Facebook page, misrepresenting it as that of the defendants’ predecessor, (late) Kundan Lal Jaggi,” as well as the “…manipulation of the photograph of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Peshawar on their website, substantiating this claim with a comparison to the ‘original’ photograph shown at plaintiffs’ own website”.
The defendants’ lawyer, Amit Sibal, offered to take down the Peshawar photo from their website as a gesture of goodwill. He clarified that the incorrectly labelled photo of Gujral “is not from the defendants’ Facebook page and evidently belongs to ‘A to Z Kitchen’, an entity unrelated to the defendants”.
He further said that the “restaurant was established jointly by predecessors of both parties, thus invalidating any claims of exclusive rights over the image that the plaintiffs might claim” and that “the defendants’ website has been cropped to exclude the term ‘Moti Mahal’, rendering the plaintiffs’ grievance unfounded”.
Amit happens to be the son of Kapil Sibal, former MP for Chandni Chowk, the parliamentary constituency within which the neighbourhood of Daryaganj lies. It was in the Daryaganj area that Delhi’s first Moti Mahal opened in 1947.
The matter has been listed for May 29, giving the patrons and owners of both restaurants plenty of time to ruminate.
Social media was quick to slam both their butter chickens as overpriced shadows of their original recipes and now replicated at every restaurant that describes itself as Punjabi.
Gujral passed away in 1997, and Jaggi in 2018. The following year, Jaggi’s grandson Raghav and his associate Amit Bagga started Daryaganj, the restaurant chain.
Moti Mahal claims that Gujral invented not just butter chicken and dal makhani but also tandoori chicken and the chicken pakora.
Perhaps another lawsuit is due from someone against tandoori momos — an enduring favourite in the capital that tramples upon everything that food puritans hold dear about tandoori chicken or momos.
The website of Daryaganj stakes Jaggi’s claim to inventing butter chicken and dal makhani — the bones of contention in the case. It credits an unnamed Bengali patron with a suggestion that led to the recipe for butter chicken.
“One fine night in 1947, Kundan Lal Jaggi was about to shut shop when a group of hungry refugees arrived at the doorstep of his restaurant, eager to have their first meal of the day,” the website says.
“The kitchen was nearly empty at that late hour, barring a few portions of their famous tandoori chicken. A Bengali gentleman also dining at the restaurant suggested Kundan Lal Jaggi make a gravy and add tandoori chicken into it so that everyone could have a hearty meal.”
It adds: “Kundan Lal Jaggi was struck with an idea. After finding whatever he could in the kitchen, he created a gravy with tomatoes, fresh butter, and some spices. He then added pieces of cooked tandoori chicken to it, which is why the recipe is a dual recipe of tandoori chicken cooked first and then added to the makhani ‘butter’ gravy.”
An entirely different butter chicken popular in Old Delhi comes in a gravy of butter and curd — usually attributed to Aslam on Matia Mahal Road. Perhaps to pre-empt any future lawsuit, Aslam tells anyone who listens that the whole world has copied his recipes.
His namesake, Ahmed Aslam Ali of Glasgow, is credited with the chicken tikka masala, which former British foreign secretary Robin Cook called the “true British national dish” in 2001."

Security has been tightened with hundreds of cops armed with guns and radios safeguarding the town ahead of the Pran Pratishtha. Sources in the central security establishment said over 2,000 cops (both in uniform and plainclothes) from Uttar Pradesh and central intelligence agencies had been provided wireless radios to communicate with each other and keep an eye on any “suspicious” movements.
“Besides, there are cops at several checkpoints, bomb-sniffing dogs, security cameras, drone surveillance, artificial intelligence solutions and undercover sleuths posted at various pointsin and around the town to ensure fool-proof security on Monday,” an Intelligence Bureau official told The Telegraph.
A six-layer security system, he said, has been put in place and commandos have been strategically deployed in and around the temple complex. CRPF commandos have been deployed near the temple cordon housing the sanctum sanctorum.
“An additional layer with sublayers will be in place for the Prime Minister. UP police will form the sixth and outermost layer, followed by paramilitary forces. The fourth ring will have plainclothes security people while the third will have trained commandos from the state police. Intelligence wing sleuths and frisking teams will form the second ring and the last layer will be secured by NSG commandos,” the official said.
A control room has been set up to coordinate various aspects of security. “Anti-drone systems are also there to prevent aerial threats, while 400 firefighters will remain on standby,” the official added."

Rakesh Bangalore Published 21.01.24, 05:30 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/congress-or-rss-government-congress-mlc-b-k-hariprasad-fumes-at-cop-call-on-ayodhya-caution/cid/1995186,"Congress lawmaker B.K. Hariprasad has put his party’s government in Karnataka in a quandary by questioning the rationale of sending police officers to question him over his recent warning that a “Godhra-like” incident could happen in the state ahead of the Ram temple consecration, asking: ""Is this a Congress government or an RSS-led government?""
Hariprasad said he was surprised when a police officer visited him on Friday and sought information on his comment where he expressed fears about a communal incident tantamount to the Godhra train arson that killed several kar sevaks who were returning from Ayodhya in 2002.
“Is this a Congress government or an RSS-led government? I am unable to figure out which government is this,” the outspoken member of the Legislative Council (MLC) told reporters.
“I thought there was a Congress government in Karnataka. But now, I need to rethink,” he said, in a stinging remark against the party’s government.
“If this is the situation a man like me who has worked for the Congress for so many years has to face, one can only imagine the plight of an ordinary party worker,” Hariprasad said.
A former Rajya Sabha member, Hariprasad had recently urged the Karnataka government to take adequate steps to avert any possible “Godhra-like” incident in the state that could trigger a major communal strife. The train burning eventually led to the Gujarat riots that left thousands dead.
“The Karnataka government should be extremely alert because during a similar occasion in Gujarat, kar sevaks were set on fire in Godhra while returning from Ayodhya,” Hariprasad had said.
“A Godhra-like attempt could be made here. So no chance should be given for such an untoward incident in Karnataka. All arrangements should be made for those who want to go to Ayodhya as we don’t want to see another Godhra in Karnataka,” he had warned.
Hariprasad on Friday repeated his earlier statement and once again urged the government to deploy adequate security measures for pilgrims from the state heading to Ayodhya for Monday’s consecration.
Karnataka home minister G. Parameshwar downplayed the police probe and said it was a routine inquiry made on account of Hariprasad’s recent statement. “It is a routine inquiry,” he said.
A former AICC general secretary and a prominent face of the backward classes, Hariprasad was miffed at being ignored for a cabinet berth last year.
The AICC had served him a showcause notice in September 2023 for his scathing attack on chief minister Siddaramiah, albeit without taking his name. “You cannot call yourself a socialist by wearing a dhoti, Hublot watch and (yet have) khaki shorts (a symbol of the RSS) inside,”  Hariprasad had said.
A Congress functionary on Saturday expressed angst at a senior leader like Hariprasad making remarks against the government. “He should realise that every word matters ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,” said the leader, who declined to be named. But he wasn’t sure if the party was considering disciplinary action against Hariprasad, and said it was best to let the issue die down."

Iranian state television said four advisers from the Revolutionary Guard had been killed in the strike in Damascus, without identifying them, adding that Israel was behind the strike. Nour News, which is believed to be close to the country’s intelligence apparatus, identified two of the dead as General Sadegh Omidzadeh, the intelligence deputy of the guard’s expeditionary Quds Force in Syria, and his deputy, who goes by the nom de guerre Hajj Gholam.
An opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said at least six people — five Iranians and a Syrian — were killed in the missile attack that struck while officials from Iran-backed groups were holding a meeting.
The Observatory’s chief, Rami Abdurrahman, said three of the Iranians were commanders, adding that four other people are still missing under the rubble.
Syrian state TV reported that the “Israeli aggression” targeted a residential building in the tightly guarded western Damascus neighbourhood of Mazzeh, home to several diplomatic missions. Saturday’s strike was close to the embassies of Venezuela and South Africa.
An official with knowledge of the situation said that the building was used by Revolutionary Guard officials, adding that the “Israeli missiles” destroyed the whole building and that 10 people were either killed or wounded in the attack. The official is from an Iran-backed group, but asked that his name and affiliation not be used because he was not authorised to speak publicly about security affairs.
The Israeli military did not comment on the strike.
Security forces deployed around the destroyed four-storey building as ambulances and fire engines were seen in the area. A search for people trapped under the rubble was underway. Windows were also shattered in nearby buildings.
A grocer near the scene of the strike said he heard five consecutive explosions at about 9.15am, adding that he later witnessed the bodies of a man and a woman being taken away as well as three wounded people.
“The shop shook. I stayed inside for few seconds then went out and saw the smoke billowing from behind the mosque,” the man, who asked that his name not be used for security reasons, told The Associated Press.
“What happened was terrifying. I collapsed,” said Khaled Mawed, who lives nearby."

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also said violence persists and social harmony has been destroyed in the state, and alleged that the PM maintains his silence and refuses to meet political leaders and parties from the state.
In a post on X, Ramesh said, ""The Prime Minister tweets on Manipur Statehood Day but has not found time nor thought it necessary to visit the state which has gone through so much pain and agony since May 3rd, 2023.""
""The distress of the people of the state continues. Violence persists. Social harmony has been destroyed. But the PM maintains his silence and refuses to meet political leaders and parties from the state,"" the Congress general secretary in-charge communications said.
""The good wishes he has expressed through social media are yet another demonstration of his hypocrisy,"" Ramesh said.
The Congress leader's attack came after Modi, in a post in X, said, ""On Manipur's Statehood Day, my best wishes to the people of the state. Manipur has made a strong contribution to India's progress.""
""We take pride in the culture and traditions of the state. I pray for the continued development of Manipur,"" he said.
The violence, which claimed over 180 lives, erupted on May 3 last year after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.
Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts.

A3TQ9G9HNR_2IG97M4O163LY7M,Split apparent in Darjeeling BJP over MP Raju Bista's candidature for Lok Sabha polls,"Vivek Chhetri, Avijit Sinha Siliguri, Darjeeling Published 21.01.24, 06:36 AM","Vivek Chhetri, Avijit Sinha Siliguri, Darjeeling Published 21.01.24, 06:36 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/split-apparent-in-darjeeling-bjp-over-mp-raju-bistas-candidature-for-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1995196,"A tussle seems to have broken out in the BJP over the candidature for the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat, with district leaders speaking in multiple voices.
While sitting MP Raju Bista has the backing of a sizeable segment of the party, B.P. Sharma, the party MLA from Kurseong, has staked his claim as a “bhumiputra” (son of the soil).
He has threatened to contest as an Independent if the party fields an “outsider”. Bista is a Gorkha but hails from Manipur.
Adding to the mix, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former foreign secretary who is from the region, has been reaching out to people in the hills and the plains.
“His overtures are significant. He is moving across Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts, meeting and helping people in different ways. Though he has not given any hints, his activities have led to speculation within and outside the party,” an observer said.
A senior BJP functionary in Siliguri said: “The central leadership will decide the candidate for the Darjeeling seat, which our party has won three times straight since 2009.”
He added: “But unlike other districts of north Bengal, there is utter confusion here because of the activities of party leaders. Also, Shringla’s activities have generated curiosity since he is regularly meeting people in different forums.”
Kalyan Dewan, president of the Darjeeling (hills) district committee of the BJP, has lauded Bista’s performance, indicating the district committee is behind him.
“The way things are moving forward under the leadership of our MP is an indication of good teamwork. There is a big opportunity (of him winning if fielded), too,” Dewan said.
Shankar Ghosh and Anandamoy Barman — party MLAs from Siliguri and Matigara-Naxalbari — too are Bista supporters.
“The MP has done a lot for the region. He has brought central funds for the construction of four-lane highways, expansion of Bagdogra airport, and development of New Jalpaiguri station,” Ghosh said.
“Also, he facilitated the allocation of funds for drinking water projects in the hills and the plains.”
Asked about Shringla’s recent visits to various places in and around Siliguri, Ghosh gave a terse answer.
“I have no inkling about his activities. Nor is our party involved in the works he has taken up,” he said, alluding to the promises Shringla has made to people.
Sharma, the Kurseong MLA, has said he is not satisfied with Bista’s performance as MP.
“We thought we had brought a Gorkha’s son but we now realise we had just brought a party cadre. He is not working for the community but for the interests of the party as he wants a party ticket,” he said.
Sharma added: “If the BJP comes with the same election promises and sends someone from Delhi and does not field anybody from here (a local candidate) this time, I am ready to contest against the candidate.”
He attacked Shringla, too, but without naming him. “During Durga Puja, we found some posters written in Bengali in Siliguri and in Nepali in Darjeeling,” Sharma said, alluding to Shringla’s posters.
“Just having a property (in the hills) is not enough. Even Mithun Chakraborty and Govinda have properties in the hills…. We need people who are from among us and are committed to our issues,” he said.
Shringla traces his roots to Darjeeling, with both his parents hailing from the hills. He has ancestral properties in Darjeeling but has spent most of his time away from the hills since his school days.
The former diplomat, who has floated the Darjeeling Welfare Society, said he intends to work for the people of the region.
In a lecture at North Bengal University on Friday, he elaborated on the geostrategic importance of Siliguri and argued that Siliguri, Darjeeling and Sikkim can become a new “golden trio” for tourism.
On Saturday, he visited a private hospital and then travelled to Panighata on Siliguri’s outskirts. He met local people and assured them of help so that the Panighata tea estate, closed for months, could be reopened."

""Our 'Mohabbat ki dukaan' (shop of love) is open for everyone. 'Judega Bharat, Jeetega Hindustan',"" Gandhi said in a post on X while sharing a video of the incident.
Later addressing a public meeting here, the Congress MP narrated the incident and said the Congress is neither scared of Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.
The Congress has claimed that its leaders, including Gandhi and Jairam Ramesh, were targeted by BJP supporters during the Assam leg of the Manipur-to-Maharashtra Nyay Yatra.
The BJP, however, claimed that Gandhi was rattled after ""Jai Shri Ram"" and ""Modi, Modi"" slogans were raised in his presence.
""If this is how rattled he is, how will he face the people of this country in days ahead, after the anti-Hindu Congress rejected the invite to be part of the 'Pran Pratishtha' (January 22 Ram temple consecration ceremony ) in Ayodhya?"" BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said on X tagging the video.
BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawala said some people chanted ""'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Modi, Modi"" during the yatra ""so Rahul Gandhi arrogantly charges at them"".
""Security personnel stopped him. 'Mohabbat ki dukaan' or 'Ahankaar ki Dukaan' (shop of arrogance) Shameful and atrocious behaviour by entitled dynast! He even made kissing actions to the crowd!!"" he said on X.
At the public meeting, Gandhi said, ""Some 2-3 kms before, around 20-25 BJP workers carrying sticks came in front of our bus, and when I came out from the bus, they ran away...they think that the Congress is scared of BJP and RSS workers."" 	""What kind of dream are they seeing. They can tear as many posters and placards as they want, we don't care, and are not bothered. We are not scared of anybody, we are neither scared of Narendra Modi nor the chief minister here,"" he said.
During his earlier Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi had made similar gestures to a crowd which chanted ""Modi, Modi"" slogans when the march was in Rajasthan.
The Congress has alleged that the ""attacks"" on its yatra have the backing of Chief Minister Sarma.
In his speech at Nagaon public meeting, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge targeted Sarma, saying, ""This is something like 'Meri billi mujh se meow'.""  	""The cat which once belonged to the Congress is now doing 'meow' to us,"" Kharge said. Sarma had quit the Congress to join the BJP in 2015.	 	AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said his vehicle was attacked by some BJP protesters but he kept his composure and moved on.
""My vehicle was attacked a few minutes ago at Jumugurihat, Sunitpur, by an unruly BJP crowd who also tore off the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra stickers from the windshield. They threw water and shouted anti-BJNY (Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra) slogans,"" he said.
""But we kept our composure, waved to the hooligans and sped away. This is undoubtedly the Assam CM's doing. We are not intimidated and will soldier on,"" Ramesh said.
AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said, ""Complete lawlessness at display in Assam. All along the yatra route, the CM has stationed his goons to attack the yatra and disrupt our peaceful march for justice.""   	""He's completely mistaken to think this will deter us. If anything, this has given us more strength to ensure his and Narendra Modi's defeat, "" he said.
The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will pass through 100 Lok Sabha constituencies in 15 states, traversing 6,713 km, mostly in buses but also on foot, and culminate in Mumbai on March 20 or 21. It began from Thoubal in Manipur on January 14.

BP2HMBKMZC_V4KED17CAE3GCN3,"India to fence Myanmar border, free movement agreement to be discontinued: Amit Shah","Imran Ahmed Siddiqui New Delhi Published 21.01.24, 05:53 AM","Imran Ahmed Siddiqui New Delhi Published 21.01.24, 05:53 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/india-to-fence-myanmar-border-free-movement-agreement-to-be-discontinued-amit-shah/cid/1995198,"Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said India would fence its border with Myanmar and discontinue the free movement agreement, adding that the border would be ""protected like the Bangladesh frontier"".
""The India-Myanmar border will be protected like the Bangladesh frontier. The Centre will stop the free movement with Myanmar,"" Shah said while addressing the passing-out parade of the first batch of five newly constituted Assam Police commando battalions in Tezpur, Assam.
The free movement regime (FMR) allows people living on either side of the India-Myanmar border to venture 16km into each other’s territory without a visa and stay for up to two weeks, because many of them share cross-border familial and ethnic ties.
Sources in the security establishment say that over 500 Myanmarese soldiers crossed into India in the last three months to escape ethnic cleansing.
Sources said the Myanmarese soldiers took refuge in Mizoram after their camps were captured by militants from the Arakan Army (AA) — an armed ethnic group in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine.
There are also allegations that illegal immigrants from Myanmar are behind the ethnic violence that has engulfed Manipur since May 3, leaving at least 200 people dead and over 67,000 displaced. Meitei organisations have alleged that firearms are being supplied to militants in Manipur from Myanmar.
Recently, Mizoram chief minister Lalduhoma opposed any move to set up barbed wire fencing along the India-Myanmar border. He said it would be “unacceptable” as people from both sides of the India-Myanmar border wish to come under one administration.
The northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram share a 1,643km border with Myanmar along a mountainous terrain. The border, demarcated by the British in 1826, is manned by the Assam Rifles. Dense forests in most parts make the border porous.
Last September, Manipur chief minister Biren Singh had urged the Union home ministry to cancel the free movement regime along the India-Myanmar border and complete its fencing.
Manipur shares a 398km border with Myanmar, of which only around 6 km is fenced, sources said. The FMR was introduced in 1970.
Earlier this month, Lalduhoma met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi and discussed issues related to the international border with Myanmar.
He also met external affairs minister S. Jaishankar and said any move to set up barbed wire fencing along the India-Myanmar border would be “unacceptable”.
Lalduhoma later said that refugees seeking shelter in Mizoram weren’t treated unequally and expressed his wish for a Greater Mizoram as part of an Akhand Bharat.
The Mizoram chief minister has so far spoken in favour of the unification of the “Zo territory”, which refers to certain contiguous regions of northeastern India, Myanmar, the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, and other areas.
Lalduhoma has argued that the British separated the Mizos by carving Burma out of what was then Indian territory and that the Mizo people have always dreamt of “becoming one nation under one administration”.
Sources in the Union home ministry, however, said talks had begun to start the tendering process for an advanced smart fencing system for the entire India-Myanmar border.
“The fencing along the entire Myanmar border is likely to take four to five years. Once the fencing is completed, those entering will have to get a visa,” a ministry official said."

Sitharaman, in a post on X alleged: ""TN govt has banned watching live telecast of #AyodhaRamMandir programmes of 22 Jan 24. In TN there are over 200 temples for Shri Ram. In HR&CE managed temples no puja/bhajan/prasadam/annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are stopping privately held temples also from organising events. They are threatening organisers that they will rip off pandals. Strongly condemn this anti-Hindu, hateful action."" The Union Minister tagged the Tamil newspaper's report in this regard.
Reacting to the allegation, Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister, P K Sekar Babu said there is no such ban. In temples in Tamil Nadu, the HR & CE Department has not imposed any kind of ban for conduct of puja for Lord Ram. Also, there is no bar to distribute 'Annadhanam' and 'Prasadam.' 	""A rumour is being disseminated to divert people's attention from the DMK's youth wing conference, underway now at Salem,"" he said in a social media post.
Further, Sekar Babu dubbed the reportage as completely false and had ulterior motives. He said it was regrettable that Sitharaman, who holds a high office, was circulating such fake news.

Going by the data of Huntr, the UAE-based marketplace connecting migrant workers with enterprises, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu are the highest contributors to the migration of construction workers from India to the GCC countries.
Workers with proficiency in construction skills such as masonry, carpentry, plumbing, electrical works, and welding and having prior experience in construction projects, are highly valued by the industries in the GCC countries, the report stated.
Further, the report revealed that certifications from the National Skill Development Corporation India (NSDC) and good physical fitness are essential as well for workers who work in the GCC region.
Workers with basic communication skills in English and adaptability to different working conditions and cultures are also valued by the construction sector, the report added.
The report is an analysis based on data on Huntr platform.
Meanwhile, according to data by Huntr, these workers from India, who work in the construction industry in the Middle East, are from 20-40 years age group and mostly men.
The report also found that most of these blue-collar workers in the construction domain are from diverse educational backgrounds.
Individuals engaged in construction jobs can have minimal formal education, which increases the accessibility of such employment opportunities to a broad spectrum of people, it noted.
However, workers with technical or vocational training in specific construction trades are valued more, which showcases the importance of specialised skills in this field as well, added the report.
""In the dynamic landscape of global labour migration, apart from India workers from countries such as Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone are contributing significantly to the construction sector in the Middle East region,"" . Huntr CEO Samuel Joy said.
Despite the stable salary scenario in recent years, the current surge in demand hints at potential increments, reflecting the evolving dynamics of the market, he said.
""The Middle East's appetite for construction workers extends to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and Oman, creating a broader canvas of opportunities for skilled labour from around the world,""  Joy added.

Singh, whose friendship with Kumar dates back to the 1974 students’ movement in Bihar led by Jayaprakash Narayan, replaces Mangani Lal Mandal who in March last year became only the second leader to have been made the JDU’s vice-president after former poll strategist Prashant Kishor who was given the top post in 2017.
Mandal has been made a national general secretary.
The party’s most visible face in the media, K.C. Tyagi, has been designated as “political advisor and spokesperson”. The other spokesperson in the list is Rajib Ranjan, a former MLA from the Nitish’s home district of Nalanda, who returned to JDU last year after quitting the BJP."

The Congress leader claimed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be defeated in all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi.
""This rally would be the invocation to remove the Bharatiya Janata Party from all seven seats in Delhi,"" he said.
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress, both partners of the opposition INDIA bloc, have been holding seat-sharing talks for the states, including Delhi.

Ramaswamy earlier this week announced that he was leaving the Republican presidential race and endorsing Trump.
In an interview with Fox News on Friday about a possible job in a second Trump administration, the 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur said: ""There are a lot of ways to drive change in this country, inside and outside government.” 	 “For the last few years, I’ve been doing it through the market,” The Hill quoted Ramaswamy as saying.
Ramaswamy, who campaigned as the most Trump-friendly, ""America first"" alternative in the Republican field, just one day after ending his presidential campaign gave a passionate speech and asked voters to vote for Trump.
""We are in the middle of a war in this country,"" Ramaswamy said, portraying a country divided between ""those of us who love the United States of America and a fringe minority who hates this country and what we stand for."" 	 ""And right now we need a commander in chief who will lead us to victory,"" he said.
Trump, who had accused him of ""deceitful campaign tricks"" and not being ""MAGA"", soon returned the favour by praising Ramaswamy.
Make America Great Again or MAGA is an American political slogan and movement popularised by Trump during his successful 2016 presidential campaign and is used to refer to his political base.
""I've been a friend of his even though we were competing against each other,"" Trump said. ""But I was a friend of his and we got along and ... I kept saying, 'Why is he running? He keeps calling me a great president.' But he's a fantastic guy, a very smart guy. He's got some tremendous ideas.""

The much-awaited Ram temple consecration will be held in Ayodhya on Monday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the rituals, following which the shrine will be opened for the public a day later.
The TMC, which has accused the BJP of trying to politicise a religious event by attempting to put up a ""gimmick show"" ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, has announced to hold a mega all-faith harmony rally in the metropolis led by West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee.
The party will also hold similar rallies in every block of the state.
The Bengal BJP, which has unsuccessfully demanded that the day be declared a holiday in the state, along with several other Hindu outfits, has planned several events and programmes across the state to celebrate the day, including setting up LED screens in various areas where the Ram temple inauguration will be telecast live.
The Opposition BJP has accused the TMC of trying to create distraction and divert attention from the historic Pran Pratistha ceremony of Lord Ram through the ""all-faith rally"". The party also accused the state government of impeding programmes to celebrate the scheduled inauguration of the temple.
""The BJP is trying to vitiate the atmosphere of the country. Everybody loves Lord Ram. But the BJP mixes politics with religion, we are against this trend. And the all-faith rally by our party supremo is just a precursor to Republic Day celebrations,"" TMC MP Sougata Roy said.
Echoing him, TMC minister Shashi Panja said the all-faith rally should not be viewed as a counter to any programme, as projected by the BJP.
""The all-faith rally is not aimed at countering any other programme. Allegations that the state government is trying to stop programmes by the BJP are baseless and untrue,"" she said.
The BJP, however, felt that the TMC's rally was aimed at appeasing a particular community in the state.
""The TMC's rally is aimed at appeasing a particular community, especially the minorities of the state. Otherwise, what was the need for organising a rally on the same day? The TMC wants to create a law and order situation in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,"" leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari said.
West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said, ""Those trying to stop celebrations regarding Ram temple inauguration will be given a befitting reply in the next elections. The TMC is taking out the rally to counter the event in Ayodhya."" 	Majumdar slammed the TMC government for not announcing a holiday on January 22, despite requests by the saffron camp.
Central government establishments, public sector banks, insurance companies, financial institutions and regional rural banks (RRBs) across the country will remain closed for half a day on January 22. Several states, including neighbouring Assam and Odisha, have also declared a half-day holiday to mark the consecration ceremony.
Political analyst Maidul Islam thinks that both the TMC and the BJP will be using the Ram temple inauguration celebrations event and all-faith rally to gauge their strength among the masses.
""January 22 will be a warm-up match for both the TMC and the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. With TMC trying to reach out to the minorities and the Left-liberals, the BJP will try to consolidate the Hindu votes in the state,"" Islam, a professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, said.
In the 2019 elections, TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and BJP secured 18 seats in the state.

AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh made this statement during a media conference in Lakhimpur on Saturday, addressing reporters' persistent enquiries about the whereabouts of Rahul and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on January 22.
Ramesh said: “Around 7am on January 22, Rahulji will be at Bordowa Than in Nagaon district...It is the birthplace of Sri Sri Sankardeva who was a mahan dharma guru, social reformer and cultural icon of our country.”
Though the saint-reformer and playwright was born in the 15th century, “his life is still an inspiration to crores of people”. “His pieces of advice are even more relevant in today’s age. Rahulji will offer his shradhhanjali to him there (Bordowa Than) on the morning of January 22,” he said.
Rahul will then address a public rally with party president Mallikarjun Kharge at Kaliabor, also in Nagaon district.
Ramesh also spoke on the hurdles the Yatra is facing on its Assam leg, with Assam PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah condemning the alleged attack on Youth Congress vehicles and tearing down of the Yatra posters and banners on Friday night in Lakhimpur.
“We will not be cowed down by these attacks. The BJP government is rattled with the support the Yatra has received from the people of Assam. The Yatra is unstoppable,” he told The Telegraph.
The Congress has gone all out against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the BJP for allegedly creating hurdles for the Yatra. Ramesh said he was requesting BJP president J.P. Nadda to say only two things to Sarma. “We do not need any new evidence of his (Sarma) loyalty to the RSS-BJP. Give permission to take out Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from the same route through which J.P. Naddaji's rally took place.”
Nadda had undertaken a road show in Guwahati last week, but the administration is not allowing the Congress to undertake even short padyatras.
In a post, Kharge also condemned the “shameful attack on the #BharatJodoNyayYatra vehicles and tearing of the Congress party's banners and posters by BJP goons in Lakhimpur”.
The Assam chief minister is expected to respond to the Congress's charges in a news meet on Sunday."

“It is a matter of pride for me to join the post. We will continue to work for the development of Dhupguri subdivision,” said Chakraborty on Saturday.

Iranian state television said four advisers from the Revolutionary Guard had been killed in the strike in Damascus, without identifying them, adding that Israel was behind the strike. Nour News, which is believed to be close to the country’s intelligence apparatus, identified two of the dead as General Sadegh Omidzadeh, the intelligence deputy of the guard’s expeditionary Quds Force in Syria, and his deputy, who goes by the nom de guerre Hajj Gholam.
An opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said at least six people — five Iranians and a Syrian — were killed in the missile attack that struck while officials from Iran-backed groups were holding a meeting.
The Observatory’s chief, Rami Abdurrahman, said three of the Iranians were commanders, adding that four other people are still missing under the rubble.
Syrian state TV reported that the “Israeli aggression” targeted a residential building in the tightly guarded western Damascus neighbourhood of Mazzeh, home to several diplomatic missions. Saturday’s strike was close to the embassies of Venezuela and South Africa.
An official with knowledge of the situation said that the building was used by Revolutionary Guard officials, adding that the “Israeli missiles” destroyed the whole building and that 10 people were either killed or wounded in the attack. The official is from an Iran-backed group, but asked that his name and affiliation not be used because he was not authorised to speak publicly about security affairs.
The Israeli military did not comment on the strike.
Security forces deployed around the destroyed four-storey building as ambulances and fire engines were seen in the area. A search for people trapped under the rubble was underway. Windows were also shattered in nearby buildings.
A grocer near the scene of the strike said he heard five consecutive explosions at about 9.15am, adding that he later witnessed the bodies of a man and a woman being taken away as well as three wounded people.
“The shop shook. I stayed inside for few seconds then went out and saw the smoke billowing from behind the mosque,” the man, who asked that his name not be used for security reasons, told The Associated Press.
“What happened was terrifying. I collapsed,” said Khaled Mawed, who lives nearby."

Palestinian fighters battled tanks trying to push back into the eastern suburbs of the Jabalia area in northern Gaza, where Israel had started pulling out troops and shifting to smaller-scale operations, residents and militants said.
The Israeli military said aircraft struck militant squads trying to plant explosives near troops and fire missiles at tanks in northern Gaza and said it was striking targets throughout Gaza.
In the southern area of Khan Younis, where Israel says it has expanded its operations against Hamas, witnesses said tanks shelled areas around Nasser Hospital overnight, describing the bombardment as the most intense in many days.
Nasser is now Gaza's largest functioning hospital. Israel says Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, including Nasser, which Hamas and medical staff deny though Israel has presented some footage and photos backing its claims.
The Israeli military said that in Khan Younis, it raided a military compound, neutralized ready-to-use rocket launchers and found explosives stashed underground while an aircraft struck two gunmen there.
The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes have killed 165 people and wounded 280 others in the past 24 hours, one of the biggest death tolls in a single day in 2024.
It did not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its daily toll. But most of the 24,927 Palestinians killed since the October 7 war began are civilians, health officials say.
Fighting has not been confined to Gaza. An Israeli strike on Syria's capital Damascus on Saturday killed four members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, including the head of the force's information unit in Syria, a security source in the regional pro-Syria alliance told Reuters.
In southern Lebanon, an Israeli strike on Saturday killed two members of Hamas travelling in a car, three security sources in Lebanon told Reuters. There was no immediate comment from Hamas or the Israeli military.
Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in Gaza after its fighters burst into Israel on October 7, rampaged through Israeli towns and bases, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and dragging 253 hostages back to the enclave.
Israel says its forces have so far killed around 9,000 militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to press on with the war until Hamas is defeated and the remaining hostages released."

They have been under the supervision of the Assam Rifles since then, the official said.
These 276 soldiers were brought to Aizawl over Saturday and Sunday for their transport to Myanmar from the Lengpui airport, she said.
The group is headed by a colonel, and has 36 officers and 240 lower-rank personnel, officials said.
Since November, 635 Myanmar soldiers have fled their country and entered Mizoram after their camps were overrun and captured by ethnic armed organisations and pro-democratic forces, officials said.
Of them, 359 soldiers have already been sent back to their country, they said.
While 104 Myanmar army personnel were sent to the border town of Moreh in Manipur from different places in Mizoram by Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters in November, 255 soldiers were moved via the Lengpui airport by Myanmar air force planes on January 2 and January 9, they said.
Mizoram shares a 510-km-long border with Myanmar.

Going by the data of Huntr, the UAE-based marketplace connecting migrant workers with enterprises, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu are the highest contributors to the migration of construction workers from India to the GCC countries.
Workers with proficiency in construction skills such as masonry, carpentry, plumbing, electrical works, and welding and having prior experience in construction projects, are highly valued by the industries in the GCC countries, the report stated.
Further, the report revealed that certifications from the National Skill Development Corporation India (NSDC) and good physical fitness are essential as well for workers who work in the GCC region.
Workers with basic communication skills in English and adaptability to different working conditions and cultures are also valued by the construction sector, the report added.
The report is an analysis based on data on Huntr platform.
Meanwhile, according to data by Huntr, these workers from India, who work in the construction industry in the Middle East, are from 20-40 years age group and mostly men.
The report also found that most of these blue-collar workers in the construction domain are from diverse educational backgrounds.
Individuals engaged in construction jobs can have minimal formal education, which increases the accessibility of such employment opportunities to a broad spectrum of people, it noted.
However, workers with technical or vocational training in specific construction trades are valued more, which showcases the importance of specialised skills in this field as well, added the report.
""In the dynamic landscape of global labour migration, apart from India workers from countries such as Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone are contributing significantly to the construction sector in the Middle East region,"" . Huntr CEO Samuel Joy said.
Despite the stable salary scenario in recent years, the current surge in demand hints at potential increments, reflecting the evolving dynamics of the market, he said.
""The Middle East's appetite for construction workers extends to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and Oman, creating a broader canvas of opportunities for skilled labour from around the world,""  Joy added.

Chakraborty, who is posted in Jalpaiguri, was given the additional charge of Dhupguri, a day after the state came up with a notification announcing the creation of the new sub-division.
“It is a matter of pride for me to join the post. We will continue to work for the development of Dhupguri subdivision,” said Chakraborty on Saturday.
Chakraborty on Saturday morning reached the BDO office campus and walked into an office of the backward classes’ welfare department.
As the news spread, members of Dhupguri Nagarik Mancha, a citizens’ forum that has been striving with the demand of the new subdivision, celebrated the day with abir and sweets.
They also hired a musical band group and took out a procession which reached the BDO office. The participants distributed sweets among bystanders too.
At the BDO office, they greeted Chakraborty and welcomed him.
Later, Mahua Gope, the Jalpaiguri district Trinamul president, also reached the office.
She also greeted the new SDO and thanked the state government.
“The chief minister has kept her promise. The creation of a new sub-division will largely help the people of Dhupguri and Banarhat blocks. It will also help in expediting development work. People here can get more services from the administration now,” said Gope.
After assuming office, the SDO held a meeting with the BDO, the inspector-in-charge of Dhupguri police station and the block medical officer of health.
“I will be in the office regularly. Necessary steps would be taken to create new infrastructure as more government offices will open at the newly created subdivision in due course,” Chakraborty said.
The state government came up with a notification on the jurisdiction of the administrative set-up of the new Dhupguri subdivision on Friday, following which the Trinamul top brass underscored how it met its promises to people.
Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, the party’s MP and national general secretary, asserted “Kotha diye kotha rakhar naam ee holo Trinamul (Trinamul is a party that keeps its word)."" Abhishek had promised the subdivision."

Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh also said violence persists and social harmony has been destroyed in the state, and alleged that the PM maintains his silence and refuses to meet political leaders and parties from the state.
In a post on X, Ramesh said, ""The Prime Minister tweets on Manipur Statehood Day but has not found time nor thought it necessary to visit the state which has gone through so much pain and agony since May 3rd, 2023.""
""The distress of the people of the state continues. Violence persists. Social harmony has been destroyed. But the PM maintains his silence and refuses to meet political leaders and parties from the state,"" the Congress general secretary in-charge communications said.
""The good wishes he has expressed through social media are yet another demonstration of his hypocrisy,"" Ramesh said.
The Congress leader's attack came after Modi, in a post in X, said, ""On Manipur's Statehood Day, my best wishes to the people of the state. Manipur has made a strong contribution to India's progress.""
""We take pride in the culture and traditions of the state. I pray for the continued development of Manipur,"" he said.
The violence, which claimed over 180 lives, erupted on May 3 last year after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status.
Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of Manipur's population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley, while tribals, which include Nagas and Kukis, constitute 40 per cent and reside mainly in the hill districts.

Rakesh Bangalore Published 21.01.24, 05:30 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/congress-or-rss-government-congress-mlc-b-k-hariprasad-fumes-at-cop-call-on-ayodhya-caution/cid/1995186,"Congress lawmaker B.K. Hariprasad has put his party’s government in Karnataka in a quandary by questioning the rationale of sending police officers to question him over his recent warning that a “Godhra-like” incident could happen in the state ahead of the Ram temple consecration, asking: ""Is this a Congress government or an RSS-led government?""
Hariprasad said he was surprised when a police officer visited him on Friday and sought information on his comment where he expressed fears about a communal incident tantamount to the Godhra train arson that killed several kar sevaks who were returning from Ayodhya in 2002.
“Is this a Congress government or an RSS-led government? I am unable to figure out which government is this,” the outspoken member of the Legislative Council (MLC) told reporters.
“I thought there was a Congress government in Karnataka. But now, I need to rethink,” he said, in a stinging remark against the party’s government.
“If this is the situation a man like me who has worked for the Congress for so many years has to face, one can only imagine the plight of an ordinary party worker,” Hariprasad said.
A former Rajya Sabha member, Hariprasad had recently urged the Karnataka government to take adequate steps to avert any possible “Godhra-like” incident in the state that could trigger a major communal strife. The train burning eventually led to the Gujarat riots that left thousands dead.
“The Karnataka government should be extremely alert because during a similar occasion in Gujarat, kar sevaks were set on fire in Godhra while returning from Ayodhya,” Hariprasad had said.
“A Godhra-like attempt could be made here. So no chance should be given for such an untoward incident in Karnataka. All arrangements should be made for those who want to go to Ayodhya as we don’t want to see another Godhra in Karnataka,” he had warned.
Hariprasad on Friday repeated his earlier statement and once again urged the government to deploy adequate security measures for pilgrims from the state heading to Ayodhya for Monday’s consecration.
Karnataka home minister G. Parameshwar downplayed the police probe and said it was a routine inquiry made on account of Hariprasad’s recent statement. “It is a routine inquiry,” he said.
A former AICC general secretary and a prominent face of the backward classes, Hariprasad was miffed at being ignored for a cabinet berth last year.
The AICC had served him a showcause notice in September 2023 for his scathing attack on chief minister Siddaramiah, albeit without taking his name. “You cannot call yourself a socialist by wearing a dhoti, Hublot watch and (yet have) khaki shorts (a symbol of the RSS) inside,”  Hariprasad had said.
A Congress functionary on Saturday expressed angst at a senior leader like Hariprasad making remarks against the government. “He should realise that every word matters ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,” said the leader, who declined to be named. But he wasn’t sure if the party was considering disciplinary action against Hariprasad, and said it was best to let the issue die down."
JWON5IM5HP_4A835SLYKV9MOW6,Split apparent in Darjeeling BJP over MP Raju Bista's candidature for Lok Sabha polls,"Vivek Chhetri, Avijit Sinha Siliguri, Darjeeling Published 21.01.24, 06:36 AM","Vivek Chhetri, Avijit Sinha Siliguri, Darjeeling Published 21.01.24, 06:36 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/west-bengal/split-apparent-in-darjeeling-bjp-over-mp-raju-bistas-candidature-for-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1995196,"A tussle seems to have broken out in the BJP over the candidature for the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat, with district leaders speaking in multiple voices.
While sitting MP Raju Bista has the backing of a sizeable segment of the party, B.P. Sharma, the party MLA from Kurseong, has staked his claim as a “bhumiputra” (son of the soil).
He has threatened to contest as an Independent if the party fields an “outsider”. Bista is a Gorkha but hails from Manipur.
Adding to the mix, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, a former foreign secretary who is from the region, has been reaching out to people in the hills and the plains.
“His overtures are significant. He is moving across Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts, meeting and helping people in different ways. Though he has not given any hints, his activities have led to speculation within and outside the party,” an observer said.
A senior BJP functionary in Siliguri said: “The central leadership will decide the candidate for the Darjeeling seat, which our party has won three times straight since 2009.”
He added: “But unlike other districts of north Bengal, there is utter confusion here because of the activities of party leaders. Also, Shringla’s activities have generated curiosity since he is regularly meeting people in different forums.”
Kalyan Dewan, president of the Darjeeling (hills) district committee of the BJP, has lauded Bista’s performance, indicating the district committee is behind him.
“The way things are moving forward under the leadership of our MP is an indication of good teamwork. There is a big opportunity (of him winning if fielded), too,” Dewan said.
Shankar Ghosh and Anandamoy Barman — party MLAs from Siliguri and Matigara-Naxalbari — too are Bista supporters.
“The MP has done a lot for the region. He has brought central funds for the construction of four-lane highways, expansion of Bagdogra airport, and development of New Jalpaiguri station,” Ghosh said.
“Also, he facilitated the allocation of funds for drinking water projects in the hills and the plains.”
Asked about Shringla’s recent visits to various places in and around Siliguri, Ghosh gave a terse answer.
“I have no inkling about his activities. Nor is our party involved in the works he has taken up,” he said, alluding to the promises Shringla has made to people.
Sharma, the Kurseong MLA, has said he is not satisfied with Bista’s performance as MP.
“We thought we had brought a Gorkha’s son but we now realise we had just brought a party cadre. He is not working for the community but for the interests of the party as he wants a party ticket,” he said.
Sharma added: “If the BJP comes with the same election promises and sends someone from Delhi and does not field anybody from here (a local candidate) this time, I am ready to contest against the candidate.”
He attacked Shringla, too, but without naming him. “During Durga Puja, we found some posters written in Bengali in Siliguri and in Nepali in Darjeeling,” Sharma said, alluding to Shringla’s posters.
“Just having a property (in the hills) is not enough. Even Mithun Chakraborty and Govinda have properties in the hills…. We need people who are from among us and are committed to our issues,” he said.
Shringla traces his roots to Darjeeling, with both his parents hailing from the hills. He has ancestral properties in Darjeeling but has spent most of his time away from the hills since his school days.
The former diplomat, who has floated the Darjeeling Welfare Society, said he intends to work for the people of the region.
In a lecture at North Bengal University on Friday, he elaborated on the geostrategic importance of Siliguri and argued that Siliguri, Darjeeling and Sikkim can become a new “golden trio” for tourism.
On Saturday, he visited a private hospital and then travelled to Panighata on Siliguri’s outskirts. He met local people and assured them of help so that the Panighata tea estate, closed for months, could be reopened."

A final decision on the extradition of Nikhil Gupta, 52, will be in the hands of Justice Minister Pavel Blazek once the ruling is delivered to all parties in the case, a ministry spokesperson said.
Gupta has been accused by US federal prosecutors of working with an Indian government official on the plot to kill a New York City resident, who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India.
Czech authorities had arrested Gupta in June last year when he travelled from India to Prague.
Czech news website www.seznamzpravy.cz, which first reported on the appeals decision, said Gupta had argued his identity was mistaken and that he was not the man the US was looking for. He described the case as political, it said.
“The time frame for the minister’s decision cannot be assumed at this point,” the justice ministry spokesman said, adding that Gupta could be expected to take all steps possible to try to prevent extradition.
The minister has three months to turn to the Supreme Court in case he has doubts about the lower court’s decisions, the spokesperson said.
Prague High Court rejected Gupta’s appeal against a December decision by a lower court that ruled that extradition is allowed.
A spokesperson for the Prague High Court declined immediate comment.
The Czech Republic has in the past agreed to US extradition requests.
A lawyer for Gupta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Czech news website quoted the lawyer as saying he would ask the minister not to extradite Gupta and would also take the case to the Constitutional Court.

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi and the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh announced on Saturday that they would work only in the afternoons on Monday.
The AIIMS and PGIMER will start work at 2.30pm while the RML will open at 1.30pm, although all emergency and critical clinical services will remain functional throughout, according to circulars the institutions circulated to their staff.
The circular from AIIMS has cited the central government directive ordering central institutions to remain closed for half a day — until 2.30pm — on Monday, saying “the Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha at Ayodhya will be celebrated across India”.
“This is going to have an impact on patients who have morning appointments,” said a senior doctor at AIIMS who requested anonymity.
“It is going to be difficult to compress all patients due to come in on Monday into the afternoon window that will open at 2.30pm.”
An AIIMS annual report says the hospital had received more than 1.03 million OPD patients during 2021-22, which doctors say implies an average of over 3,000 OPD patients a day.
The PGIMER note said all hospital OPDs, operational theatres, and non-emergency services would be closeduntil 2.30pm. “Only emergency services will remain functional as usual,” the note said."

""The India-Myanmar border will be protected like the Bangladesh frontier. The Centre will stop the free movement with Myanmar,"" Shah said while addressing the passing-out parade of the first batch of five newly constituted Assam Police commando battalions in Tezpur, Assam.
The free movement regime (FMR) allows people living on either side of the India-Myanmar border to venture 16km into each other’s territory without a visa and stay for up to two weeks, because many of them share cross-border familial and ethnic ties.
Sources in the security establishment say that over 500 Myanmarese soldiers crossed into India in the last three months to escape ethnic cleansing.
Sources said the Myanmarese soldiers took refuge in Mizoram after their camps were captured by militants from the Arakan Army (AA) — an armed ethnic group in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine.
There are also allegations that illegal immigrants from Myanmar are behind the ethnic violence that has engulfed Manipur since May 3, leaving at least 200 people dead and over 67,000 displaced. Meitei organisations have alleged that firearms are being supplied to militants in Manipur from Myanmar.
Recently, Mizoram chief minister Lalduhoma opposed any move to set up barbed wire fencing along the India-Myanmar border. He said it would be “unacceptable” as people from both sides of the India-Myanmar border wish to come under one administration.
The northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram share a 1,643km border with Myanmar along a mountainous terrain. The border, demarcated by the British in 1826, is manned by the Assam Rifles. Dense forests in most parts make the border porous.
Last September, Manipur chief minister Biren Singh had urged the Union home ministry to cancel the free movement regime along the India-Myanmar border and complete its fencing.
Manipur shares a 398km border with Myanmar, of which only around 6 km is fenced, sources said. The FMR was introduced in 1970.
Earlier this month, Lalduhoma met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi and discussed issues related to the international border with Myanmar.
He also met external affairs minister S. Jaishankar and said any move to set up barbed wire fencing along the India-Myanmar border would be “unacceptable”.
Lalduhoma later said that refugees seeking shelter in Mizoram weren’t treated unequally and expressed his wish for a Greater Mizoram as part of an Akhand Bharat.
The Mizoram chief minister has so far spoken in favour of the unification of the “Zo territory”, which refers to certain contiguous regions of northeastern India, Myanmar, the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, and other areas.
Lalduhoma has argued that the British separated the Mizos by carving Burma out of what was then Indian territory and that the Mizo people have always dreamt of “becoming one nation under one administration”.
Sources in the Union home ministry, however, said talks had begun to start the tendering process for an advanced smart fencing system for the entire India-Myanmar border.
“The fencing along the entire Myanmar border is likely to take four to five years. Once the fencing is completed, those entering will have to get a visa,” a ministry official said."

The car rally, organised by six volunteer Hindus from the Bay Area, was taken from Sunnyvale to Warm Spring BART station, Golden Gate, followed by a spectacular Tesla car light show on Saturday evening.
Led by a giant Ram Rath, the rally covered almost 100 miles and was escorted by two police cars for security reasons.
“The event, held in celebration of the Ram temple, drew an overwhelming response, surpassing all expectations,"" Rohit Sharma, one of the six organisers, told PTI over the phone.
“Despite unexpected rain, prompting a change in the ending station to Warm Spring BART station, over 2,000 enthusiastic Ram bhakts, waving saffron flags, singing Ram Bhajans, beating drums, transformed the area into a mini-Ayodhya,"" said Deepti Mahajan, the lead organiser.
“It was a first-of-its-kind rally held by Hindus in America and participants were emotionally charged and overjoyed. Mainstream Americans were surprised with the amount of devotion amongst participants when they were told about the event being held thousands of miles away in Ayodhya for the inauguration of Ram temple after 500 years,"" Deepak Bajaj, one of the organisers, said.
The Tesla light show, a special feature with 170 registered cars coordinated by Vamsi Rajanala, exceeded expectations with over 300 cars dazzling the crowd.
“The rally, complemented by a Tesla light show, rhythmic dhol beats, and a delectable food feast elevated the event to unprecedented heights,"" Bajaj said.
Param Desai, also one of the organisers, said the grand celebration not only marked a significant cultural event, but also showcased the spirit of togetherness and the deep-rooted cultural ties within the community.

LAD3H5Y8TB_58MNITSADQ6ALTA,Israel’s progress is limited in eradicating Hamas and also liberating Israeli hostages still in Gaza,"Ronen Bergman, Patrick Kingsley Jerusalem Published 21.01.24, 09:34 AM","Ronen Bergman, Patrick Kingsley Jerusalem Published 21.01.24, 09:34 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/israels-progress-is-limited-in-eradicating-hamas-and-also-liberating-israeli-hostages-still-in-gaza/cid/1995222,"After more than 100 days of war, Israel’s limited progress in dismantling Hamas has raised doubts within the military’s high command about the near-term feasibility of achieving the country’s principal wartime objectives: eradicating Hamas and also liberating the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.
Israel has established control over a smaller part of Gaza at this point in the war than it originally envisaged in battle plans from the start of the invasion, which were reviewed by The New York Times. That slower-than-expected pace has led some commanders to privately express their frustrations over the civilian government’s strategy for Gaza, and led them to conclude that the freedom of more than 100 Israeli hostages still in Gaza can be secured only through diplomatic rather than military means.
The dual objectives of freeing the hostages and destroying Hamas are now mutually incompatible, according to interviews with four senior military leaders, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about their personal opinions.
There is also a clash between how long Israel would need to fully eradicate Hamas — a time-consuming slog fought in the group’s warren of underground tunnels — and the pressure, applied by Israel’s allies, to wrap up the war quickly amid a spiralling civilian death toll.
The generals further said that a drawn-out battle intended to fully dismantle Hamas would most likely cost the lives of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza since October 7, when Hamas militants invaded Israel, killed roughly 1,200 people and took some 240 captives, according to Israeli estimates.
Hamas freed more than 100 hostages in November, but has said it will not release the others unless Israel agrees to completely cease hostilities. Most of the remaining hostages are thought to be held by Hamas cells that are hiding within the subterranean fortress of tunnels that extends for hundreds of miles beneath the surface of Gaza.
On Thursday, Gadi Eisenkot, a former army chief who is serving in the war cabinet, exposed a rift inside the government when he said in a television interview that it was an “illusion” to believe that the hostages could be rescued alive through military operations.
“The situation in Gaza is such that the war aims have yet to be achieved,” said Eisenkot, adding: “For me, there’s no dilemma. The mission is to rescue civilians, ahead of killing an enemy.”
That strategic bind has amplified the military’s frustration at the indecisiveness of Israel’s civilian leadership, according to the four commanders.
The commanders said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s equivocation about a postwar plan for Gaza was at least in part to blame for the military’s predicament on the battlefield.
Netanyahu has yet to clarify how Gaza will be governed after the war — and the commanders said that without a long-term vision for the territory, the army could not make short-term tactical decisions about how to capture the parts of Gaza that remain beyond Israeli control. Capturing the southernmost part of Gaza, which lines the Egyptian border, would require greater coordination with Egypt. But Egypt is unwilling to engage without guarantees from Israel over the postwar plan, three of the commanders said.
Asked for comment, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that “The PM is leading the war on Hamas with unprecedented achievements in a very decisive manner.” In a speech on Thursday, Netanyahu promised both to achieve “total victory over Hamas,” and also rescue the hostages.
The Israeli military declined to respond to the commanders’ comments.
The generals fear that a lengthy campaign — without a postwar plan — would erode any remaining support from Israel’s allies, limiting their willingness to supply additional ammunition.
Foreign leaders have grown alarmed by the death toll caused by Israel’s campaign: More than 24,000 Gazans have been killed in the war, according to health authorities in the enclave, prompting accusations — strongly denied by Israel — of genocide. Gazan officials have not said how many of those killed were combatants, but Israeli military officials say the toll includes more than 8,000 fighters.
Families of hostages have become more vocal about the need to free their relatives through diplomacy not force. Some hostages taken into Gaza have since been declared dead — and it is not yet clear whether they were accidentally killed by Israeli forces or by Hamas.
Of the more than 100 hostages liberated since the invasion began, only one was freed in a rescue operation. The others were all swapped for Palestinian prisoners and detainees during a brief truce in November.
By focusing its efforts on destroying the tunnels, the military risks mistakes that could cost the lives of more Israeli citizens. Three Israeli hostages were already killed by their own soldiers in December, despite waving a white flag and shouting in Hebrew.
“Basically, it’s a stalemate,” said Andreas Krieg, a war expert at King’s College London. “It’s not an environment where you can free hostages,” he added."
LHRYRENIM1_CC3WJV215T7WO2A,EC order of December 2023 puts a question mark on Rajeev Kumar’s future as acting DGP,"Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 21.01.24, 09:15 PM","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 21.01.24, 09:15 PM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/election-commission-order-of-december-2023-puts-a-question-mark-on-rajeev-kumars-future-as-acting-dgp/cid/1995331,"Did the Mamata Banerjee government appoint Rajeev Kumar as the acting director-general of police knowing fully well that he might have to be removed from office by January 31 within a month of his appointment?
A month-old letter from the Election Commission of India, sent to chief secretaries of all states, suggests that the Mamata Banerjee government of Bengal went ahead with the ad hoc appointment of Kumar last month with the express knowledge that he would have to be removed before January 31, 2024 as directed by Nirvachan Sadan in the letter dated December 21, 2023.
The EC letter is regarding transfer and posting of officers ahead of the 2024 general elections and  polls pertaining to state assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim.
The sub-section five of section 6 (categories of officers not covered under transfer policy) states, “the commission further desires that no officer/official against whom a criminal case related to official functioning is pending in any court of law, be associated with/deployed on election related duty.”
The deadline for completing the process and submission of compliance reports by the state chief secretary and DGP--- in the case of Bengal, Kumar’s own office will have to comply--- has been set as January 31, 2024.
The question remains why the Mamata Banerjee government rushed to appoint Kumar in the first place when it knows that he is facing a criminal case in the Saradha chit fund scam being investigated by the CBI no less.
“The appointment was a personal achievement for him. Even if he has to go now the blame will be on the EC's door. Whether he will be reinstated after the elections will most likely depend on the outcome (of the Lok Sabha polls),"" said a senior government officer.
The rule-book says that before the appointment of DGP the state has to send a list with details of all officers of director-general rank to the UPSC, which selects three names and sends them to the state. The state is then free to choose any one officer from the list of three.
Apart from the CBI probe against Kumar in the Saradha scam there is no other reason why he will not get to be the DGP.
Only two others are senior to Kumar -- Vivek Sahai and Zulfiquar Hasan, both 1988 batch officers. Sahai is currently director-general of police (Home Guards) while Hasan is on central deputation to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.
“Before the DGP is appointed the vigilance department and the ministry of personnel have to verify if a case is pending against the incumbent. We suspect the state government and the Centre have hushed up the matter (Saradha scam probe). Otherwise how could a person against whom CBI had issued a lookout notice be given charge of DGP?” asked Mohammad Salim, CPM state secretary. “We will lodge a complaint to the central poll panel as soon as the elections are announced and the model code of conduct comes into effect,"" he said.
CPM Rajya Sabha MP and lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who had fought the case for the Saradha chit fund victims, said, “The case against him (Kumar) is a criminal one and he will have to go.”
Kumar, a 1989-batch IPS officer, was once accused of snooping by Mamata herself during her days as Bengal’s main Opposition leader. Subsequently, he went on to become her closest confidante in the last 10 years.
Kumar has the dubious record of being removed in two previous elections—2016 Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections--- and in case the state government complies with the Election Commission’s instructions, he will earn a hat-trick.
On April 12, 2016, ahead of voting in the Calcutta constituencies for the Bengal Assembly elections, EC had ordered his removal, following complaints of partisan behavior by all  three major Opposition parties, the Left, the Congress and the BJP. He was reinstated soon after Mamata was sworn-in chief minister for a second term.
Three years later, the Bengal government had him transferred as additional director-general in the state CID, from the Calcutta Police which he was heading at that time, acting on a directive from the central poll panel.
However, following massive violence between Trinamul and the BJP supporters after a road show by then BJP national president Amit Shah, in which a bust of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was vandalized, the poll panel showed Kumar the red-card.
After the Lok Sabha results, Kumar, along with 10 other officers who had been removed by EC, were reinstated.
Kumar has been on the CBI’s radar since February 2019 when the central probe agency had accused him of ""destroying evidence"" and working in ""connivance with the accused"" in the Saradha scam case.
In 2013, Mamata had handpicked Kumar, then commissioner of Bidhannagar police, to head a special investigation team to probe the multi-crore Ponzi scheme scam. But the CBI took over the probe on the directive of the Supreme Court in May 2014.
The chief minister herself led a three-day sit-in demonstration at Calcutta’s Metro Channel after a CBI team went to question Kumar in February 2019, while he was still the city police chief. The CBI team that went to interrogate Kumar on that February Sunday evening was detained by  Kolkata Police. Kumar was later interrogated in the Meghalaya capital of Shillong on February 9, 2019.
State Trinamul spokesperson Kunal Ghosh did not respond when The Telegraph Online reached out to him for a comment."

Ramaswamy earlier this week announced that he was leaving the Republican presidential race and endorsing Trump.
In an interview with Fox News on Friday about a possible job in a second Trump administration, the 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur said: ""There are a lot of ways to drive change in this country, inside and outside government.” 	 “For the last few years, I’ve been doing it through the market,” The Hill quoted Ramaswamy as saying.
Ramaswamy, who campaigned as the most Trump-friendly, ""America first"" alternative in the Republican field, just one day after ending his presidential campaign gave a passionate speech and asked voters to vote for Trump.
""We are in the middle of a war in this country,"" Ramaswamy said, portraying a country divided between ""those of us who love the United States of America and a fringe minority who hates this country and what we stand for."" 	 ""And right now we need a commander in chief who will lead us to victory,"" he said.
Trump, who had accused him of ""deceitful campaign tricks"" and not being ""MAGA"", soon returned the favour by praising Ramaswamy.
Make America Great Again or MAGA is an American political slogan and movement popularised by Trump during his successful 2016 presidential campaign and is used to refer to his political base.
""I've been a friend of his even though we were competing against each other,"" Trump said. ""But I was a friend of his and we got along and ... I kept saying, 'Why is he running? He keeps calling me a great president.' But he's a fantastic guy, a very smart guy. He's got some tremendous ideas."" 	 ""He's going to be working with us for a long time,"" Trump said Tuesday after some in the crowd chanted ""VP, VP, VP."" 	 The race for the Republican presidential nomination makes its next stop in New Hampshire, where Haley is 11.4 points behind Trump, according to a poll average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill.

Singh, whose friendship with Kumar dates back to the 1974 students’ movement in Bihar led by Jayaprakash Narayan, replaces Mangani Lal Mandal who in March last year became only the second leader to have been made the JDU’s vice-president after former poll strategist Prashant Kishor who was given the top post in 2017.
Mandal has been made a national general secretary.
The party’s most visible face in the media, K.C. Tyagi, has been designated as “political advisor and spokesperson”. The other spokesperson in the list is Rajib Ranjan, a former MLA from the Nitish’s home district of Nalanda, who returned to JDU last year after quitting the BJP."

Security has been tightened with hundreds of cops armed with guns and radios safeguarding the town ahead of the Pran Pratishtha. Sources in the central security establishment said over 2,000 cops (both in uniform and plainclothes) from Uttar Pradesh and central intelligence agencies had been provided wireless radios to communicate with each other and keep an eye on any “suspicious” movements.
“Besides, there are cops at several checkpoints, bomb-sniffing dogs, security cameras, drone surveillance, artificial intelligence solutions and undercover sleuths posted at various pointsin and around the town to ensure fool-proof security on Monday,” an Intelligence Bureau official told The Telegraph.
A six-layer security system, he said, has been put in place and commandos have been strategically deployed in and around the temple complex. CRPF commandos have been deployed near the temple cordon housing the sanctum sanctorum.
“An additional layer with sublayers will be in place for the Prime Minister. UP police will form the sixth and outermost layer, followed by paramilitary forces. The fourth ring will have plainclothes security people while the third will have trained commandos from the state police. Intelligence wing sleuths and frisking teams will form the second ring and the last layer will be secured by NSG commandos,” the official said.
A control room has been set up to coordinate various aspects of security. “Anti-drone systems are also there to prevent aerial threats, while 400 firefighters will remain on standby,” the official added."

With this repatriation, which will continue for two days -- Monday and Tuesday, more than 600 Myanmarese soldiers who fled to Mizoram will be sent back to their country, he said.
The 276 personnel will be airlifted by Myanmar air force planes from the Lengpui airport near Aizawl to Sittwe in the neighbouring country's Rakhine state, the Assam Rifles official told PTI.
They entered Bandukbanga village, located at the India-Myanmar-Bangladesh trijunction, in southernmost Mizoram's Lawngtlai district with arms and ammunition on 17 January and approached the Assam Rifles, she said.
They were taken to the nearby Assam Rifles camp at Parva, and later the majority of them were shifted to Lunglei, she added.
They have been under the supervision of the Assam Rifles since then, the official said.
These 276 soldiers were brought to Aizawl over Saturday and Sunday for their transport to Myanmar from the Lengpui airport, she said.
The group is headed by a colonel, and has 36 officers and 240 lower-rank personnel, officials said.
Since November, 635 Myanmar soldiers have fled their country and entered Mizoram after their camps were overrun and captured by ethnic armed organisations and pro-democratic forces, officials said.
Of them, 359 soldiers have already been sent back to their country, they said.
While 104 Myanmar army personnel were sent to the border town of Moreh in Manipur from different places in Mizoram by Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters in November, 255 soldiers were moved via the Lengpui airport by Myanmar air force planes on January 2 and January 9, they said.

They found a holding area, five narrow rooms behind metal bars, toilets, mattresses, and even drawings by a child hostage who was freed during a November truce, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said.
No hostages were there when it was discovered.
The military released photos from the underground labyrinth and said it brought in journalists to document the tunnel before it was destroyed.
The tunnel entrance, Hagari said, was in the house of a Hamas member in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where Israel has been focusing its fight in recent weeks against the Palestinian Islamist group.
""The soldiers entered the tunnel where they encountered terrorists, engaging in a battle that ended with the elimination of the terrorists,"" Hagari said.
The tunnel was rigged with blast doors and explosives, he said.
""According to the testimonies we have, about 20 hostages were held in this tunnel at different times under harsh conditions without daylight, in dense air with little oxygen, and terrible humidity that makes breathing difficult,"" he said.
Some of the hostages kept there were freed during the week-long Qatari-mediated truce. Others are among the more than 130 captured during Hamas' Oct. 7 rampage through southern Israel that are still in Gaza."

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi and the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh announced on Saturday that they would work only in the afternoons on Monday.
The AIIMS and PGIMER will start work at 2.30pm while the RML will open at 1.30pm, although all emergency and critical clinical services will remain functional throughout, according to circulars the institutions circulated to their staff.
The circular from AIIMS has cited the central government directive ordering central institutions to remain closed for half a day — until 2.30pm — on Monday, saying “the Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha at Ayodhya will be celebrated across India”.
“This is going to have an impact on patients who have morning appointments,” said a senior doctor at AIIMS who requested anonymity.
“It is going to be difficult to compress all patients due to come in on Monday into the afternoon window that will open at 2.30pm.”
An AIIMS annual report says the hospital had received more than 1.03 million OPD patients during 2021-22, which doctors say implies an average of over 3,000 OPD patients a day.
The PGIMER note said all hospital OPDs, operational theatres, and non-emergency services would be closeduntil 2.30pm. “Only emergency services will remain functional as usual,” the note said."

“Inclusiveness is the essence of Bengal that has prevailed for centuries, while development and welfare of the people is the key focus of the ruling establishment here.

Mamata’s interfaith rally would start from Hazra Crossing and end at Park Circus Maidan. She will visit Kalighat temple and offer puja before starting the rally. She will also visit shrines of different religious faiths.
Trinamul leaders expected that the rally headed by Mamata would be massive with at least 50,000 people from different communities. Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Tribal and Dalit organisations will take part in the interfaith rallies across Bengal on Monday, a Trinamul leader said on Saturday."

Vincent New Delhi Published 21.01.24, 06:23 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/in-delhi-high-court-a-delicious-dispute-between-moti-mahal-and-daryaganj-proprietors/cid/1995199,"A delicious dispute has made it to the case menu of Delhi High Court.
The owners of an iconic chain of restaurants have sued a rival chain, started by a descendant of their late partner, for claiming to have crafted two dishes synonymous with post-Partition Delhi: butter chicken and dal makhani.
Moti Mahal’s proprietors told the court that they “are the owners of the famous trademark ‘Moti Mahal’ and related formative marks, used in relation to restaurants operating nationally and internationally since 1920”, and that “the defendants are misleading the public into believing that their ‘Daryaganj’ restaurants are connected with the plaintiffs’ predecessor’s first ‘Moti Mahal’ restaurant in Daryaganj”.
The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Sandeep Sethi, told the court of Justice Sanjeev Narula on Tuesday that the proof of the alleged misrepresentation by the defendant was the “use of a picture of the plaintiffs’ predecessor, the (late) Kundan Lal Gujral, on their Facebook page, misrepresenting it as that of the defendants’ predecessor, (late) Kundan Lal Jaggi,” as well as the “…manipulation of the photograph of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Peshawar on their website, substantiating this claim with a comparison to the ‘original’ photograph shown at plaintiffs’ own website”.
The defendants’ lawyer, Amit Sibal, offered to take down the Peshawar photo from their website as a gesture of goodwill. He clarified that the incorrectly labelled photo of Gujral “is not from the defendants’ Facebook page and evidently belongs to ‘A to Z Kitchen’, an entity unrelated to the defendants”.
He further said that the “restaurant was established jointly by predecessors of both parties, thus invalidating any claims of exclusive rights over the image that the plaintiffs might claim” and that “the defendants’ website has been cropped to exclude the term ‘Moti Mahal’, rendering the plaintiffs’ grievance unfounded”.
Amit happens to be the son of Kapil Sibal, former MP for Chandni Chowk, the parliamentary constituency within which the neighbourhood of Daryaganj lies. It was in the Daryaganj area that Delhi’s first Moti Mahal opened in 1947.
The matter has been listed for May 29, giving the patrons and owners of both restaurants plenty of time to ruminate.
Social media was quick to slam both their butter chickens as overpriced shadows of their original recipes and now replicated at every restaurant that describes itself as Punjabi.
Gujral passed away in 1997, and Jaggi in 2018. The following year, Jaggi’s grandson Raghav and his associate Amit Bagga started Daryaganj, the restaurant chain.
Moti Mahal claims that Gujral invented not just butter chicken and dal makhani but also tandoori chicken and the chicken pakora.
Perhaps another lawsuit is due from someone against tandoori momos — an enduring favourite in the capital that tramples upon everything that food puritans hold dear about tandoori chicken or momos.
The website of Daryaganj stakes Jaggi’s claim to inventing butter chicken and dal makhani — the bones of contention in the case. It credits an unnamed Bengali patron with a suggestion that led to the recipe for butter chicken.
“One fine night in 1947, Kundan Lal Jaggi was about to shut shop when a group of hungry refugees arrived at the doorstep of his restaurant, eager to have their first meal of the day,” the website says.
“The kitchen was nearly empty at that late hour, barring a few portions of their famous tandoori chicken. A Bengali gentleman also dining at the restaurant suggested Kundan Lal Jaggi make a gravy and add tandoori chicken into it so that everyone could have a hearty meal.”
It adds: “Kundan Lal Jaggi was struck with an idea. After finding whatever he could in the kitchen, he created a gravy with tomatoes, fresh butter, and some spices. He then added pieces of cooked tandoori chicken to it, which is why the recipe is a dual recipe of tandoori chicken cooked first and then added to the makhani ‘butter’ gravy.”
An entirely different butter chicken popular in Old Delhi comes in a gravy of butter and curd — usually attributed to Aslam on Matia Mahal Road. Perhaps to pre-empt any future lawsuit, Aslam tells anyone who listens that the whole world has copied his recipes.
His namesake, Ahmed Aslam Ali of Glasgow, is credited with the chicken tikka masala, which former British foreign secretary Robin Cook called the “true British national dish” in 2001."

They found a holding area, five narrow rooms behind metal bars, toilets, mattresses, and even drawings by a child hostage who was freed during a November truce, military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said.
No hostages were there when it was discovered.
The military released photos from the underground labyrinth and said it brought in journalists to document the tunnel before it was destroyed.
The tunnel entrance, Hagari said, was in the house of a Hamas member in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where Israel has been focusing its fight in recent weeks against the Palestinian Islamist group.
""The soldiers entered the tunnel where they encountered terrorists, engaging in a battle that ended with the elimination of the terrorists,"" Hagari said.
The tunnel was rigged with blast doors and explosives, he said.
""According to the testimonies we have, about 20 hostages were held in this tunnel at different times under harsh conditions without daylight, in dense air with little oxygen, and terrible humidity that makes breathing difficult,"" he said.
Some of the hostages kept there were freed during the week-long Qatari-mediated truce. Others are among the more than 130 captured during Hamas' Oct. 7 rampage through southern Israel that are still in Gaza."

In an article posted on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's (RSS) website, Bhagwat referred to the ""continuous struggle of the Hindu society"" for the construction of the temple in Ayodhya and said the ""conflict and bitterness"" over the dispute should now come to an end.
After years of legal struggle, the Supreme Court pronounced a ""balanced"" verdict on November 9, 2019, after examining ""the truth and facts"" and also hearing the arguments of all the parties in the case, he said.
Bhagwat said from a ""Dharmic"" point of view, Lord Ram is the ""most worshipped deity"" of the majority society in the country and is still accepted as an ideal of conduct by the entire society.
""Hence, now the conflict that has arisen as for and against over the dispute should be ended. The bitterness that has arisen in the meantime should also end. The enlightened people of the society must see that the dispute ends completely,"" he said.
""Ayodhya means a city where there is no war, a place free from conflict. On this occasion, in the entire country, reconstruction of Ayodhya is the need of the hour and also the duty of all of us,"" Bhagwat said.
The RSS chief said the occasion of construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya marks the ""reawakening of national pride"".
This also signifies the ""acceptance of the vision of life behind the character of Shri Ram by the modern Bharatiya society"", he added.
The 'pran pratishtha' (consecration) ceremony will be held at the Ram temple on January 22 and will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Bhagawat and more than 7,000 people, including seers.
""This world is (in a) destructive frenzy due to egoism, selfishness and discrimination and is bringing infinite calamities upon itself. The entry of Shri Ram Lalla in Ram Janmabhoomi and his Pran Pratishtha is the beginning of the campaign for reconstruction of Bharatvarsh which is for the well-being of all, accepting all without enmity and showing the path of harmony, unity, progress and peace,"" Bhagwat said.
""We are the active followers and implementers of that campaign. In the devotional celebration of January 22, along with the reconstruction of the temple, all of us have resolved for the reconstruction of Bharat and through it paving the way for reconstruction of the entire world,"" he said.
""Keeping this guiding light in mind, moving forward is the need of the hour,"" he added.
The RSS chief said the history of Bharat is the history of ""continuous struggle against the invaders for around the last one and a half thousand years"".
He said the aim of early invasions was to plunder and sometimes, like Alexander's invasion, it was for colonisation.
""But the attacks from the West in the name of Islam only brought complete destruction and alienation of the society. To demoralise the nation, society, it was necessary to destroy their religious places. Hence, foreign invaders also destroyed temples in India. They did this multiple times,"" he said.
Their aim was to ""demoralise the Bharatiya society"" so that they could rule over Bharat ""unhindered with the weakened society"", Bhagwat said.
""The demolition of Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya was also done with the same intention and for the same purpose. This policy of the invaders was not limited to just Ayodhya or any one temple, but was a war strategy for the entire world,"" he added.
The RSS chief said the faith, commitment and morale of the society in Bharat never diminished.
""The society did not bow down, their struggle of resistance continued. Therefore, repeated attempts were made to take control of the birthplace (of Lord Ram) and build a temple there (in Ayodhya). There were many wars, struggles and sacrifices for him. And the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi ingrained in the minds of Hindus,"" he added.
Turning the pages of history, Bhagwat said that in 1857, when war plans started being made against the British rule, Hindus and Muslims ""together expressed their readiness"" to fight against them and then there was a mutual exchange of ideas between them.
And at that time, a situation evolved where there would be a reconciliation on the issue of banning cow slaughter and liberation of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi. ""Bahadur Shah Zafar also guaranteed a ban on cow slaughter,"" he said.
""As a result, the entire society fought together. Bharatiya people showed bravery in that war but unfortunately this war of Independence failed. Then, Bharat did not get independence, British rule remained uninterrupted, but the struggle for Ram temple did not stop,"" he added.

“Inclusiveness is the essence of Bengal that has prevailed for centuries, while development and welfare of the people is the key focus of the ruling establishment here. It is not to counter anyone but a continuous effort to keep Bengal safe from the BJP’s divisive politics,” said a senior Trinamul leader.
The main attraction of the day would be the interfaith rally led by Mamata in Calcutta. The chief minister will visit shrines before leading the interfaith rally. Her party colleagues have been tasked with the same exercise in each block in Bengal.
Mamata’s interfaith rally would start from Hazra Crossing and end at Park Circus Maidan. She will visit Kalighat temple and offer puja before starting the rally. She will also visit shrines of different religious faiths.
Trinamul leaders expected that the rally headed by Mamata would be massive with at least 50,000 people from different communities. Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Tribal and Dalit organisations will take part in the interfaith rallies across Bengal on Monday, a Trinamul leader said on Saturday."
SESAKRSM87_U6PP4S7VWDGPX4Q,A seditious pamphlet and the birth of an iconic brand,"Trinanjan Chakraborty Published 21.01.24, 02:17 PM","Trinanjan Chakraborty Published 21.01.24, 02:17 PM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/my-kolkata/lifestyle/a-seditious-pamphlet-and-the-birth-of-an-iconic-brand/cid/1995275,"Calcutta in the 1920s — a hotbed of the freedom struggle. A procession of students marches down the posh locality of Elgin Road, shouting incendiary slogans. They also distribute pamphlets, calling for the citizenry to rise up in revolt and overthrow the British regime. The explosive content of the pamphlets catches the eye of Lalbazar Police HQ. A hunt is on for the author of the piece.
This was by a young man by the name of Noni Gopal Bose. Ironically, Noni Gopal wasn’t particularly involved in the freedom struggle. A meritorious student, he was more interested in preparation for his university exams. But fate dealt him a cruel hand right then. Noni Gopal was arrested and charged with sedition. His future lay in tatters.
A few days later, Noni Gopal was being transferred in a prison van also carrying some prisoners imprisoned for armed violence against the British. The van was attacked in transit to free these prisoners and Noni Gopal also fled with them. However, the cops now launched a manhunt for him all over the city and his family, realising a recapture would probably bring a worse fate, managed to smuggle Noni Gopal to Madras.
From Madras, Noni Gopal boarded a ship to USA. He did not have a passport and had barely $5 on him. He arrived in Philadelphia where he was lucky to make the acquaintance of local Ghadar Party representatives, who arranged a temporary shelter for him and also found work for him as a salesman.
It was in Philadelphia that Noni Gopal met an American woman named Charlotte, of French and German ancestry, with a deep interest in the Vedas and Hindu philosophy. The two fell in love and soon got married. On November 2, 1929, the couple was blessed with a boy whom they named Amar Gopal. From a very young age, Amar showed a sharp interest in mechanical devices. It started off with repairing electric toy trains and such other stuff of his friends which allowed him to earn some pocket money.
When, in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor bombing, the US joined the WWII in full earnest, a 13-year-old Amar Bose, with the help of a few friends, was running a business of repairing radio sets and electronic toys from the basement of the Bose family. During the war years, Amar’s radio repairing business was the biggest in scale in the area where the family stayed. A bright student, Amar had thought up an ingenious plan to augment his business. As a salesman, his father visited many stores in the city. In all such stores, a sign was put up for his radio repair service. All faulty radio sets deposited were picked up by Noni Gopal and brought home where Amar repaired them. The store earned 10% of the billed amount for every set such serviced!
A young Amar Bose                                                              boseapac.com
After graduating from high school, Amar Bose joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from where he graduated as a bachelor in electrical engineering, in the early 1950s. He followed it up with a master’s and doctoral degree — all from MIT, before joining the institute as faculty in 1956.
The same year, Amar Bose bought a set of high-priced speaker system, but was left utterly disappointed to find that despite impressive technical specs, the speakers completely failed to reproduce the live performance effect. This was the genesis of his groundbreaking research work that would culminate in the invention of a stereo loudspeaker system that would authentically reproduce the sound of a live concert in a home setting.
In 1964, Amar Gopal Bose set up the Bose Corporation, which, over the years, came to be synchronous with the business of sound. Bose’s obsession with improving the quality of sound led to the introduction of a number of groundbreaking products like the 901 speaker system, the 601 series I, II and III floor-standers, the Acoustimass cubes with module HT systems and the legendary Bose 301 bookshelf models. He never made the company public; arguing that only way Bose Corp would be able to invest in high-end futuristic R&D was by remaining private.
Early days at the Bose lab                                                              boseapac.com
In an interview to Science magazine in 2004, Bose has said, “I would have been fired a 100 times in a company run by MBAs. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn't been done before.”
Although the head of a major corporation, Bose remained a faculty at MIT till 2001. In 2011, he donated majority of the non-voting shares of Bose Corp to MIT on the condition that the shares would not be sold. It was Bose’s tribute to his alma mater to ensure that R&D work at the institute had a major funding source.
Amar Gopal Bose passed away on July 12, 2013. The company he founded, today employs more than 7,000 people and in FY2021 had revenues to the tune of US$ 3.2 billion.
And to think that it all begun with a seditious pamphlet in distant Calcutta."

Sitharaman, in a post on X alleged: ""TN govt has banned watching live telecast of #AyodhaRamMandir programmes of 22 Jan 24. In TN there are over 200 temples for Shri Ram. In HR&CE managed temples no puja/bhajan/prasadam/annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are stopping privately held temples also from organising events. They are threatening organisers that they will rip off pandals. Strongly condemn this anti-Hindu, hateful action."" The Union Minister tagged the Tamil newspaper's report in this regard.
Reacting to the allegation, Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister, P K Sekar Babu said there is no such ban. In temples in Tamil Nadu, the HR & CE Department has not imposed any kind of ban for conduct of puja for Lord Ram. Also, there is no bar to distribute 'Annadhanam' and 'Prasadam.' 	""A rumour is being disseminated to divert people's attention from the DMK's youth wing conference, underway now at Salem,"" he said in a social media post.
Further, Sekar Babu dubbed the reportage as completely false and had ulterior motives. He said it was regrettable that Sitharaman, who holds a high office, was circulating such fake news.

SOB35TS255_OMGC2CZCA2KGXN8,Israeli women fight on Gaza front line for first time since establishment of Israel in 1948,"Isabel Kershner Gaza Strip Published 21.01.24, 09:43 AM","Isabel Kershner Gaza Strip Published 21.01.24, 09:43 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/israeli-women-fight-on-gaza-front-line-for-first-time-since-establishment-of-israel-in-1948/cid/1995224,"When Captain Amit Busi gets a chance to sleep, she does so with her boots on — and in a shared tent in an improvised Israeli military post in the northern Gaza Strip.
There she commands a company of 83 soldiers, nearly half of them men. It is one of several mixed-gender units fighting in Gaza, where female combat soldiers and officers are serving on the front line for the first time since the war surrounding the establishment of Israel in 1948.
Busi is responsible not just for the lives of her subordinates — search-and-rescue engineers whose specialised training and tools help infantry troops enter damaged and booby-trapped buildings at risk of collapse — but also for the wounded soldiers they help evacuate from the battlefield. She and her soldiers also help scour the area for fighters, weapons and rocket launchers and are responsible for guarding the camp.
It can be easy to forget Busi is only 23, given the respect she has clearly earned from her subordinates — among them Jews, Druze and Bedouin Muslim men.
“The borders have been blurred,” Busi said of the decadeslong limits on the roles of female combat troops in Israel. The military, she said, “needs us, so we are here.”
Since Israeli ground forces entered Gaza in late October, women have been there fighting. Their inclusion has helped bolster the image of the army domestically after the intelligence and military failures of October 7, and amid global scrutiny of the campaign’s high civilian death toll. More than 24,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to Gaza health officials.
The integration of women into the military’s combat units has been the subject of a lengthy debate in Israel, home to one of the world’s few armies that conscript women at 18 for mandatory service. For years the question of women serving at the front pitted ultraconservative rabbis and religiously observant soldiers against feminists, secularists and critics of the country’s traditionally macho culture.
Now, that debate is effectively over.
There is no point continuing such arguments, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the military’s chief of staff, said after female soldiers raced to confront Hamas attackers on October 7, because their “action and fighting” speaks louder than words.
Like other fundamentals of Israeli life, many of the preconceptions about women in combat were upended on October 7, when hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen surged across the border from Gaza into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli officials, and abducting 240 captives to Gaza.
In the months since, the needs of the military have propelled societal change at breakneck speed. Same-sex partners of slain soldiers are now legally recognised widows and widowers, and at least one transgender soldier has fought on the front in Gaza.
Despite years of derision from conservative quarters of Israeli society, female combat soldiers have become symbols of progress and equality, appearing on magazine covers and featured in television news profiles.
A recent survey by the Israel Democracy Institute found that among the secular public, about 70 per cent of women and 67 per cent of men indicated support for increasing the number of women in combat roles.
In recent years, women have made up about 18 per cent of the military’s combat force.
“Everyone is using the phrase ‘The debate is over,’” said Idit Shafran Gittleman, director of the Military and Society programme at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. “Everyone saw what happened on October 7,” she said, adding that “women contribute to security, they don’t decrease security.”
Israeli women were thrust into combat almost immediately on October 7. Two all-female tank crews, once the butt of sexist jokes, hurtled through the desert that morning to help repel waves of armed infiltrators from Gaza.
The female commander of Caracal, a mixed-gender infantry battalion, led a 12-hour battle along the Gaza border with two companies equipped with Lau missiles and machine guns. Together with the tanks, they helped block Hamas’ advance, saving several communities from attack.
“We stopped them, they didn’t pass us,” said the commander, Lieutenant Colonel Or Ben Yehuda, 34, a career officer and a mother of three, speaking at the battalion’s desert base near the Egyptian border, where her unit is usually deployed."
T9EF2REREV_2U4RZFVVHQZON4W,Israel’s progress is limited in eradicating Hamas and also liberating Israeli hostages still in Gaza,"Ronen Bergman, Patrick Kingsley Jerusalem Published 21.01.24, 09:34 AM","Ronen Bergman, Patrick Kingsley Jerusalem Published 21.01.24, 09:34 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/israels-progress-is-limited-in-eradicating-hamas-and-also-liberating-israeli-hostages-still-in-gaza/cid/1995222,"After more than 100 days of war, Israel’s limited progress in dismantling Hamas has raised doubts within the military’s high command about the near-term feasibility of achieving the country’s principal wartime objectives: eradicating Hamas and also liberating the Israeli hostages still in Gaza.
Israel has established control over a smaller part of Gaza at this point in the war than it originally envisaged in battle plans from the start of the invasion, which were reviewed by The New York Times. That slower-than-expected pace has led some commanders to privately express their frustrations over the civilian government’s strategy for Gaza, and led them to conclude that the freedom of more than 100 Israeli hostages still in Gaza can be secured only through diplomatic rather than military means.
The dual objectives of freeing the hostages and destroying Hamas are now mutually incompatible, according to interviews with four senior military leaders, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about their personal opinions.
There is also a clash between how long Israel would need to fully eradicate Hamas — a time-consuming slog fought in the group’s warren of underground tunnels — and the pressure, applied by Israel’s allies, to wrap up the war quickly amid a spiralling civilian death toll.
The generals further said that a drawn-out battle intended to fully dismantle Hamas would most likely cost the lives of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza since October 7, when Hamas militants invaded Israel, killed roughly 1,200 people and took some 240 captives, according to Israeli estimates.
Hamas freed more than 100 hostages in November, but has said it will not release the others unless Israel agrees to completely cease hostilities. Most of the remaining hostages are thought to be held by Hamas cells that are hiding within the subterranean fortress of tunnels that extends for hundreds of miles beneath the surface of Gaza.
On Thursday, Gadi Eisenkot, a former army chief who is serving in the war cabinet, exposed a rift inside the government when he said in a television interview that it was an “illusion” to believe that the hostages could be rescued alive through military operations.
“The situation in Gaza is such that the war aims have yet to be achieved,” said Eisenkot, adding: “For me, there’s no dilemma. The mission is to rescue civilians, ahead of killing an enemy.”
That strategic bind has amplified the military’s frustration at the indecisiveness of Israel’s civilian leadership, according to the four commanders.
The commanders said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s equivocation about a postwar plan for Gaza was at least in part to blame for the military’s predicament on the battlefield.
Netanyahu has yet to clarify how Gaza will be governed after the war — and the commanders said that without a long-term vision for the territory, the army could not make short-term tactical decisions about how to capture the parts of Gaza that remain beyond Israeli control. Capturing the southernmost part of Gaza, which lines the Egyptian border, would require greater coordination with Egypt. But Egypt is unwilling to engage without guarantees from Israel over the postwar plan, three of the commanders said.
Asked for comment, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that “The PM is leading the war on Hamas with unprecedented achievements in a very decisive manner.” In a speech on Thursday, Netanyahu promised both to achieve “total victory over Hamas,” and also rescue the hostages.
The Israeli military declined to respond to the commanders’ comments.
The generals fear that a lengthy campaign — without a postwar plan — would erode any remaining support from Israel’s allies, limiting their willingness to supply additional ammunition.
Foreign leaders have grown alarmed by the death toll caused by Israel’s campaign: More than 24,000 Gazans have been killed in the war, according to health authorities in the enclave, prompting accusations — strongly denied by Israel — of genocide. Gazan officials have not said how many of those killed were combatants, but Israeli military officials say the toll includes more than 8,000 fighters.
Families of hostages have become more vocal about the need to free their relatives through diplomacy not force. Some hostages taken into Gaza have since been declared dead — and it is not yet clear whether they were accidentally killed by Israeli forces or by Hamas.
Of the more than 100 hostages liberated since the invasion began, only one was freed in a rescue operation. The others were all swapped for Palestinian prisoners and detainees during a brief truce in November.
By focusing its efforts on destroying the tunnels, the military risks mistakes that could cost the lives of more Israeli citizens. Three Israeli hostages were already killed by their own soldiers in December, despite waving a white flag and shouting in Hebrew.
“Basically, it’s a stalemate,” said Andreas Krieg, a war expert at King’s College London. “It’s not an environment where you can free hostages,” he added."

A creeper from the ground floor goes up to the overhanging wrought iron balcony. And that is where, one evening last November, some dhuti-panjabi-clad men stood confabulating. They were not residents, only actors in a play that was being staged in the nooks and crannies of this quaint house.
Barrister Babur Bari, or the house of Mr Barrister, in Beleghata has a history. It was known for the Durga Puja and Jagadhatri Puja it hosted in the late 19th century. Subhas Chandra Bose is said to have visited the house many times as did Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, who was the family physician. Sharing these nuggets of history is the current owner of the house, who wishes to remain anonymous. She lives in the house and rents out part of it for weddings and such other occasions, which help her maintain the colonial-era property. And that is how she let Samuho, a queer-feminist theatre group and DAG (Delhi Art Gallery) use the premises for a “performance installation” inspired by Sripantha’s Keyabat Meye.
INSIDE OUTSIDE: Queer-feminist theatre group Samuho’s production of Keyabat Meye.                                                             Samuho
Sripantha is the pseudonym of the late Nikhil Sarkar, who was a social historian and writer. Keyabat Meye is the name of a Bengali farce by him. It takes its name from a 19th-century Battala erotica.
Sripantha writes: “Keya-bat meye means bravo girl. Gutsy girl. She is the heroine of modern times...” The preface runs thus: “This book is about women during colonial times. A large part of it is about 19th-century Bengali bhadramahilas. It also sheds light on the relations bet-ween men and women and the social issues prevalent during the colonial period.”
The production of Keya-bat Meye is a collection of portraits of 19th-century women. So you’d find in it Phulmoni and Rasasundari. Ten-year-old Phulmoni died after her husband Harimohon, 35, consummated their marriage. This is the same Phulmoni whose case was a catalyst to the passage of the Age of Consent Act, 1891, which raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse for all girls from 10 to 12 years. Rasasundari, married off at 12, taught herself to read and write while toiling away in the kitchen and raising eight children.
The play also has portrayals of women such as Jnanadanandini from the Tagore household and Nati Binodini, rising star of the stage.
“A friend approached me on behalf of DAG. They commissioned Samuho to do Keyabat Meye,” said Titas, dramaturge, curator, researcher and artistic director of the production. Titas, who prefers the descriptor of “a female-bodied queer theatre professional”, is an alumnus of the London International School of Performing Arts.
“Our other productions at Samuho have been in open spaces... They are driven by their clear queer-feminist point of view, content, people and how they create space. But Keyabat Meye deals with a specific period, so the house was very much part of that period,” said Titas.
The play negotiates the andarmahal and the bahirmahal, the inside and the outside worlds, and captures the reactions of people inha- biting the two spaces and their reactions to the social reforms of those times. “We needed a colonial house because it would have to have that architecture... The outside is all about what the men are saying, what Ramesh Chandra Mitra said, what Bal Gangadhar Tilak was saying, what Raja Rammohan Roy and Vidya-sagar were saying while the andarmahal constitutes the experiences and narratives of the overlooked women,” she added.
That day, before one could realise that the play was on, a jostle and shove had begun to get inside the narrow entrance that leads to the thakurdalan or courtyard of the house. Rasabati Napitani, who is the barber, plays the sutradhar. It is the mid-1850s, and Vidyasagar has just managed to get the Widow Remarriage Act passed. In other news, Lord Bethune has floated the proposal for the first school for girls in Calcutta.
Of the 23 girls who first joined Bethune school, only nine remained. These nine girls took a giant step. They lived through the change. To date, I know of several girls who are dropping out of their PhD programmes not being able to manage home, children and studies,” said Titas, who keeps making the connection between “those times” and these times. “When Manashi Sarkar and I were writing the soliloquy of Rasasundari and how she taught herself to read and write, we cried. Had I known how Rasasundari had learnt to write, I would probably have studied more seriously,” she added.
Keyabat Meye narrates the stories of progressive women too. It makes a reference to a travelogue by Krishnabhamini Das. At one corner of Barrister Babu’s terrace, Krishnabhamini too enacts her story, her experiences, her excitement while travelling in foreign lands and how she wished that just as British women were fighting for their rights to be represented in Parliament, women in Bengal too would come out of their homes and kitchens and fight for their rights. Nati Binodini tells her story in one of the large rooms with huge mirrors and a four-poster bed.

Kharge said the party's first Bharat Jodo Yatra in 2022-23 had passed through several BJP-ruled states but ""no stone was hurled"" at it.
Addressing a rally in Nagaon district as part of the yatra, Kharge said, ""No stone was hurled during the first yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. No one tried to threaten us even though we crossed many BJP-ruled states."" 	""Even in Nagpur, which has the RSS headquarters, lakhs of people joined us and there was no incident,"" he said.
""Why is it happening in Assam? It is happening here because (prime minister Narendra) Modi ji's 'chela' (disciple), who blindly listens to his 'sahab' (boss),"" he said.
Referring to the attack on state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah earlier in the day, Kharge said, ""The yatra is going on so successfully here that BJP people are scared and they attacked our state party chief. But he (Borah) is not afraid, nor any Congress worker."" 	He maintained that the Congress works to unite people, while the BJP tries to divide people.

UMQH5A6V2Z_UXK5L5G4HTO6PV4,EC order of December 2023 puts a question mark on Rajeev Kumar’s future as acting DGP,"Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 21.01.24, 09:15 PM","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 21.01.24, 09:15 PM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/west-bengal/election-commission-order-of-december-2023-puts-a-question-mark-on-rajeev-kumars-future-as-acting-dgp/cid/1995331,"Did the Mamata Banerjee government appoint Rajeev Kumar as the acting director-general of police knowing fully well that he might have to be removed from office by January 31 within a month of his appointment?
A month-old letter from the Election Commission of India, sent to chief secretaries of all states, suggests that the Mamata Banerjee government of Bengal went ahead with the ad hoc appointment of Kumar last month with the express knowledge that he would have to be removed before January 31, 2024 as directed by Nirvachan Sadan in the letter dated December 21, 2023.
The EC letter is regarding transfer and posting of officers ahead of the 2024 general elections and  polls pertaining to state assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim.
The sub-section five of section 6 (categories of officers not covered under transfer policy) states, “the commission further desires that no officer/official against whom a criminal case related to official functioning is pending in any court of law, be associated with/deployed on election related duty.”
The deadline for completing the process and submission of compliance reports by the state chief secretary and DGP--- in the case of Bengal, Kumar’s own office will have to comply--- has been set as January 31, 2024.
The question remains why the Mamata Banerjee government rushed to appoint Kumar in the first place when it knows that he is facing a criminal case in the Saradha chit fund scam being investigated by the CBI no less.
“The appointment was a personal achievement for him. Even if he has to go now the blame will be on the EC's door. Whether he will be reinstated after the elections will most likely depend on the outcome (of the Lok Sabha polls),"" said a senior government officer.
The rule-book says that before the appointment of DGP the state has to send a list with details of all officers of director-general rank to the UPSC, which selects three names and sends them to the state. The state is then free to choose any one officer from the list of three.
Apart from the CBI probe against Kumar in the Saradha scam there is no other reason why he will not get to be the DGP.
Only two others are senior to Kumar -- Vivek Sahai and Zulfiquar Hasan, both 1988 batch officers. Sahai is currently director-general of police (Home Guards) while Hasan is on central deputation to the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.
“Before the DGP is appointed the vigilance department and the ministry of personnel have to verify if a case is pending against the incumbent. We suspect the state government and the Centre have hushed up the matter (Saradha scam probe). Otherwise how could a person against whom CBI had issued a lookout notice be given charge of DGP?” asked Mohammad Salim, CPM state secretary. “We will lodge a complaint to the central poll panel as soon as the elections are announced and the model code of conduct comes into effect,"" he said.
CPM Rajya Sabha MP and lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who had fought the case for the Saradha chit fund victims, said, “The case against him (Kumar) is a criminal one and he will have to go.”
Kumar, a 1989-batch IPS officer, was once accused of snooping by Mamata herself during her days as Bengal’s main Opposition leader. Subsequently, he went on to become her closest confidante in the last 10 years.
Kumar has the dubious record of being removed in two previous elections—2016 Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections--- and in case the state government complies with the Election Commission’s instructions, he will earn a hat-trick.
On April 12, 2016, ahead of voting in the Calcutta constituencies for the Bengal Assembly elections, EC had ordered his removal, following complaints of partisan behavior by all  three major Opposition parties, the Left, the Congress and the BJP. He was reinstated soon after Mamata was sworn-in chief minister for a second term.
Three years later, the Bengal government had him transferred as additional director-general in the state CID, from the Calcutta Police which he was heading at that time, acting on a directive from the central poll panel.
However, following massive violence between Trinamul and the BJP supporters after a road show by then BJP national president Amit Shah, in which a bust of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was vandalized, the poll panel showed Kumar the red-card.
After the Lok Sabha results, Kumar, along with 10 other officers who had been removed by EC, were reinstated.
Kumar has been on the CBI’s radar since February 2019 when the central probe agency had accused him of ""destroying evidence"" and working in ""connivance with the accused"" in the Saradha scam case.
In 2013, Mamata had handpicked Kumar, then commissioner of Bidhannagar police, to head a special investigation team to probe the multi-crore Ponzi scheme scam. But the CBI took over the probe on the directive of the Supreme Court in May 2014.
The chief minister herself led a three-day sit-in demonstration at Calcutta’s Metro Channel after a CBI team went to question Kumar in February 2019, while he was still the city police chief. The CBI team that went to interrogate Kumar on that February Sunday evening was detained by  Kolkata Police. Kumar was later interrogated in the Meghalaya capital of Shillong on February 9, 2019.
State Trinamul spokesperson Kunal Ghosh did not respond when The Telegraph Online reached out to him for a comment."

The Batadrawa Than is located at the birthplace of Assamese icon Srimanta Sankardeva, a social-religious reformer of the 15th-16th century.
In a letter to Batadrawa's Congress MLA Shibamoni Bora on Sunday afternoon, the managing committee's president Jogendra Nath Dev Mahanta said that on the occasion of the Ram temple's consecration, several organisations have planned devotional programmes at the premises of the Than.
""Several thousands of people are expected to visit the place and as such we cannot allow Gandhi to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
""We had received a letter from Bora regarding the Congress MP's visit and we extend a warm welcome to him but we cannot allow him to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the committee, he added.
Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Gandhi should avoid visiting Batadrawa on January 22 as there can be no competition between Lord Ram and the medieval-age Vaishnav saint.
""We will request Rahul Gandhi not to visit Batadrawa on Monday during the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple as it will reflect Assam in the wrong light,"" he said at a press conference.
He can go after the consecration ceremony without creating ""unnecessary competition which will be sad for Assam"", Sarma said.
The chief minister said that he is pained to know that when PM Narendra Modi will participate in the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya, Gandhi will be at the Batadrawa sattra.
""This is a wrong projection. There is no competition between Ram and Sankardeva and when the nation's focus is on Ayodhya, it should not be unnecessarily diverted to Assam. We will be grateful if he avoids going to the Sattra during the Pran Pratistha of the Ram temple,"" he said.
The visit can be rescheduled to early morning or in the evening, he said.
Reacting to Sarma's statement, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said that Gandhi would visit the Than as planned, maintaining that no politics should be done over it.

A bench of Justices Girish Kulkarni and Neela Gokhale, which held a special hearing on Sunday for the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by four law students from Maharashtra and Gujarat, noted the petition was ""politically motivated, frivolous and vexatious"".
The HC advised the students to ""utilise their time in doing better things"".
The bench said normally the court while dismissing such a petition would impose an exemplary cost on the petitioner, but it was refraining from doing so as the petitioners here are young students and hence a word of caution would suffice.
The Maharashtra government argued that to declare a holiday falls within the executive policy decision of the government and should not fall for judicial scrutiny.
The students in their plea claimed the decision to declare a public holiday keeping an eye over the upcoming parliamentary elections was a ""gross abuse of power for political purposes"".
The petition, filed by Shivangi Agarwal, Satyajeet Salve, Vedant Agarwal and Khushi Bangia, sought that the HC quash the government order declaring a holiday on January 22.
""The petition has political overtones and it appears to be a petition that is politically motivated and a publicity interest litigation. A glare for publicity seems to be apparent from the tenor of the petition and the arguments made in the open court,"" the bench said.
The court said the petitioners have also questioned the wisdom of the Supreme Court in an order passed in another matter and this has shaken ""our judicial conscience"".
""We have no doubt that this PIL has been filed for extraneous reasons. It appears to be absolutely frivolous and vexatious and does not deserve the attention of court,"" the bench said.
There was no doubt that such petitions were a ""blatant abuse of law"" and cannot be kept pending, it added.
The court also questioned the political remarks made in the plea and asked at whose instance or motivation the statements were included in the petition.
""As pointed out by the respondent (Maharashtra government), there are some statements about political agenda in the plea that are political in nature...some are very reckless statements. On whose motivation or at whose instance have those statements been included in the plea?"" the bench asked.
The HC also questioned the petitioners as to how the media came to know of the petition even before it was placed before the court.
The petition said the consecration of a temple is an essential religious practice associated with the Hindu religion and therefore cannot be in any manner a concern of the government.
Any step taken by the government including declaration of public holiday for celebrating the consecration of a Hindu temple is nothing but an act of identifying with a particular religion, the plea claimed.
""An act of the government in celebrating and openly participating in the consecration of a Hindu temple thereby associating with a particular religion is nothing but a direct attack on the principles of secularism,"" the PIL further claimed.
Such a public holiday could be declared perhaps to commemorate a patriotic personality or historic figure but not to celebrate the consecration of a temple to appease a particular section of the society or religious community, it said.
The plea said there are several temples across India and if the government starts celebrating consecrations of various Gods and Goddesses in old or newly constructed temples, it would be necessary to declare a public holiday on each of such days.
""There are only 365 days in the year and they may not be enough to celebrate such consecrations,"" it said.
Public holidays would lead to loss of education if the educational institutions are closed, financial loss if banking institutions are closed, and loss of governance and public works if government and public offices are closed, it added.
Advocate General Birendra Saraf, appearing for the Maharashtra government, on Sunday argued that to declare a holiday falls within the executive policy decision of the government and should not fall for judicial scrutiny.
""The petition proceeds on a wrong footing that the decision was arbitrary. Most of the public holidays are for religious events. This allows citizens to carry out their religious practices. And such holidays are not declared for only one community. It is done for all religious communities,"" Saraf said.

The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) has identified seven types of such frauds that includes tricking through missed calls, video calls, in the name of job offers and investment plans, impersonation, hijacking and screen share.
As part of the 'hijacking' scam, the eight page advisory-cum-alert said, the scammers take unauthorised access to the victim's WhatsApp (WA) account and request money from their contacts.
""Some people also witnessed WhatsApp video calls from unknown numbers. These were basically sextortion-based nude video calls which were then used to threaten the user.""  	""The hackers blackmail the user and ask for money in return,"" the BPRD said in the communication accessed by PTI.
The BPRD is a think tank on policing subjects under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
WhatsApp, on its part, has launched a number of public message campaigns in the recent past to advertise to the public about the safety features brought in by the platform, owned by technology major Meta.
The BPRD said through missed calls made from numbers starting with country codes mostly belonging to Vietnam, Kenya, Ethiopia and Malaysia, the hackers use 'code scripted bots' to find active users and then target them for various cyber threats.
As part of the impersonation scam, the scammers contacts the victim pretending to be the CEO or senior officer of their organisation and target top management executives like CFO (chief financial officer), COO (chief operating officer), CTO (chief technical officer) and high-ranking police and government officers, it said.
The fraudsters get personal information of the personnel they are pretending to be by surfing their social media handles and create similar profiles and seek immediate payments to some links citing their occupancy at some important meeting or a problem in their old number in order to convince the victim to transfer the funds, the BPRD said.
It also published, in the alert, pictures of some WA accounts where such attempts were made.
The communication expressed a particular concern about a recently released feature of 'screen share' by WhatsApp.
""In the past, numerous frauds were witnessed where scammers get victims' screen access fraudulently to commit illicit activities,"" the BPRD said.
It added that scammers impersonate as officials from banks, financial institutions, government bodies etc., and once they convince the victim to share their screen, a malicious app or software is installed ""surreptitiously"" and the victims sensitive information like bank details, passwords and banking services are compromised.
As part of the do's and don'ts, the communication asked users to activate 'two factor authentication or 2FA' on their WA account while it suggested not replying and answering suspicious or unknown WA calls and reporting and blocking the numbers that approach the user.
""The officials associated with messaging app WhatsApp have already been informed for this data breaching act. As numerous government bodies and ministry officials are already working on it, official communications are sent to the concerned authorities for the same.""  	""As a precautionary measure, unknown communications on WhatsApp without verifying their authenticity should be avoided. Still, any appropriate solution to such problems is not yet recognised,"" it said.

The much-awaited Ram temple consecration will be held in Ayodhya on Monday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the rituals, following which the shrine will be opened for the public a day later.
The TMC, which has accused the BJP of trying to politicise a religious event by attempting to put up a ""gimmick show"" ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, has announced to hold a mega all-faith harmony rally in the metropolis led by West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee.
The party will also hold similar rallies in every block of the state.
The Bengal BJP, which has unsuccessfully demanded that the day be declared a holiday in the state, along with several other Hindu outfits, has planned several events and programmes across the state to celebrate the day, including setting up LED screens in various areas where the Ram temple inauguration will be telecast live.
The Opposition BJP has accused the TMC of trying to create distraction and divert attention from the historic Pran Pratistha ceremony of Lord Ram through the ""all-faith rally"". The party also accused the state government of impeding programmes to celebrate the scheduled inauguration of the temple.
""The BJP is trying to vitiate the atmosphere of the country. Everybody loves Lord Ram. But the BJP mixes politics with religion, we are against this trend. And the all-faith rally by our party supremo is just a precursor to Republic Day celebrations,"" TMC MP Sougata Roy said.
Echoing him, TMC minister Shashi Panja said the all-faith rally should not be viewed as a counter to any programme, as projected by the BJP.
""The all-faith rally is not aimed at countering any other programme. Allegations that the state government is trying to stop programmes by the BJP are baseless and untrue,"" she said.
The BJP, however, felt that the TMC's rally was aimed at appeasing a particular community in the state.
""The TMC's rally is aimed at appeasing a particular community, especially the minorities of the state. Otherwise, what was the need for organising a rally on the same day? The TMC wants to create a law and order situation in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,"" leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari said.
West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said, ""Those trying to stop celebrations regarding Ram temple inauguration will be given a befitting reply in the next elections. The TMC is taking out the rally to counter the event in Ayodhya."" 	Majumdar slammed the TMC government for not announcing a holiday on January 22, despite requests by the saffron camp.
Central government establishments, public sector banks, insurance companies, financial institutions and regional rural banks (RRBs) across the country will remain closed for half a day on January 22. Several states, including neighbouring Assam and Odisha, have also declared a half-day holiday to mark the consecration ceremony.
Political analyst Maidul Islam thinks that both the TMC and the BJP will be using the Ram temple inauguration celebrations event and all-faith rally to gauge their strength among the masses.
""January 22 will be a warm-up match for both the TMC and the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. With TMC trying to reach out to the minorities and the Left-liberals, the BJP will try to consolidate the Hindu votes in the state,"" Islam, a professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, said.
In the 2019 elections, TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and BJP secured 18 seats in the state.

A creeper from the ground floor goes up to the overhanging wrought iron balcony. And that is where, one evening last November, some dhuti-panjabi-clad men stood confabulating. They were not residents, only actors in a play that was being staged in the nooks and crannies of this quaint house.
Barrister Babur Bari, or the house of Mr Barrister, in Beleghata has a history. It was known for the Durga Puja and Jagadhatri Puja it hosted in the late 19th century. Subhas Chandra Bose is said to have visited the house many times as did Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, who was the family physician. Sharing these nuggets of history is the current owner of the house, who wishes to remain anonymous. She lives in the house and rents out part of it for weddings and such other occasions, which help her maintain the colonial-era property. And that is how she let Samuho, a queer-feminist theatre group and DAG (Delhi Art Gallery) use the premises for a “performance installation” inspired by Sripantha’s Keyabat Meye.
INSIDE OUTSIDE: Queer-feminist theatre group Samuho’s production of Keyabat Meye.                                                             Samuho
Sripantha is the pseudonym of the late Nikhil Sarkar, who was a social historian and writer. Keyabat Meye is the name of a Bengali farce by him. It takes its name from a 19th-century Battala erotica.
Sripantha writes: “Keya-bat meye means bravo girl. Gutsy girl. She is the heroine of modern times...” The preface runs thus: “This book is about women during colonial times. A large part of it is about 19th-century Bengali bhadramahilas. It also sheds light on the relations bet-ween men and women and the social issues prevalent during the colonial period.”
The production of Keya-bat Meye is a collection of portraits of 19th-century women. So you’d find in it Phulmoni and Rasasundari. Ten-year-old Phulmoni died after her husband Harimohon, 35, consummated their marriage. This is the same Phulmoni whose case was a catalyst to the passage of the Age of Consent Act, 1891, which raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse for all girls from 10 to 12 years. Rasasundari, married off at 12, taught herself to read and write while toiling away in the kitchen and raising eight children.
The play also has portrayals of women such as Jnanadanandini from the Tagore household and Nati Binodini, rising star of the stage.
“A friend approached me on behalf of DAG. They commissioned Samuho to do Keyabat Meye,” said Titas, dramaturge, curator, researcher and artistic director of the production. Titas, who prefers the descriptor of “a female-bodied queer theatre professional”, is an alumnus of the London International School of Performing Arts.
“Our other productions at Samuho have been in open spaces... They are driven by their clear queer-feminist point of view, content, people and how they create space. But Keyabat Meye deals with a specific period, so the house was very much part of that period,” said Titas.
The play negotiates the andarmahal and the bahirmahal, the inside and the outside worlds, and captures the reactions of people inha- biting the two spaces and their reactions to the social reforms of those times. “We needed a colonial house because it would have to have that architecture... The outside is all about what the men are saying, what Ramesh Chandra Mitra said, what Bal Gangadhar Tilak was saying, what Raja Rammohan Roy and Vidya-sagar were saying while the andarmahal constitutes the experiences and narratives of the overlooked women,” she added.
That day, before one could realise that the play was on, a jostle and shove had begun to get inside the narrow entrance that leads to the thakurdalan or courtyard of the house. Rasabati Napitani, who is the barber, plays the sutradhar. It is the mid-1850s, and Vidyasagar has just managed to get the Widow Remarriage Act passed. In other news, Lord Bethune has floated the proposal for the first school for girls in Calcutta.
Of the 23 girls who first joined Bethune school, only nine remained. These nine girls took a giant step. They lived through the change. To date, I know of several girls who are dropping out of their PhD programmes not being able to manage home, children and studies,” said Titas, who keeps making the connection between “those times” and these times. “When Manashi Sarkar and I were writing the soliloquy of Rasasundari and how she taught herself to read and write, we cried. Had I known how Rasasundari had learnt to write, I would probably have studied more seriously,” she added.
Keyabat Meye narrates the stories of progressive women too. It makes a reference to a travelogue by Krishnabhamini Das. At one corner of Barrister Babu’s terrace, Krishnabhamini too enacts her story, her experiences, her excitement while travelling in foreign lands and how she wished that just as British women were fighting for their rights to be represented in Parliament, women in Bengal too would come out of their homes and kitchens and fight for their rights. Nati Binodini tells her story in one of the large rooms with huge mirrors and a four-poster bed.
A love story is told through letters, between Indira Devi and Pramatha Chaudhuri. Indira Devi, who was the daughter of Jnanadanandini. Why not a queer love story? Titas replied, “Queer prem did exist in those times but it was in-visible for their safety.”"

The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) has identified seven types of such frauds that includes tricking through missed calls, video calls, in the name of job offers and investment plans, impersonation, hijacking and screen share.
As part of the 'hijacking' scam, the eight page advisory-cum-alert said, the scammers take unauthorised access to the victim's WhatsApp (WA) account and request money from their contacts.
""Some people also witnessed WhatsApp video calls from unknown numbers. These were basically sextortion-based nude video calls which were then used to threaten the user.""  	""The hackers blackmail the user and ask for money in return,"" the BPRD said in the communication accessed by PTI.
The BPRD is a think tank on policing subjects under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
WhatsApp, on its part, has launched a number of public message campaigns in the recent past to advertise to the public about the safety features brought in by the platform, owned by technology major Meta.
The BPRD said through missed calls made from numbers starting with country codes mostly belonging to Vietnam, Kenya, Ethiopia and Malaysia, the hackers use 'code scripted bots' to find active users and then target them for various cyber threats.
As part of the impersonation scam, the scammers contacts the victim pretending to be the CEO or senior officer of their organisation and target top management executives like CFO (chief financial officer), COO (chief operating officer), CTO (chief technical officer) and high-ranking police and government officers, it said.
The fraudsters get personal information of the personnel they are pretending to be by surfing their social media handles and create similar profiles and seek immediate payments to some links citing their occupancy at some important meeting or a problem in their old number in order to convince the victim to transfer the funds, the BPRD said.
It also published, in the alert, pictures of some WA accounts where such attempts were made.
The communication expressed a particular concern about a recently released feature of 'screen share' by WhatsApp.
""In the past, numerous frauds were witnessed where scammers get victims' screen access fraudulently to commit illicit activities,"" the BPRD said.
It added that scammers impersonate as officials from banks, financial institutions, government bodies etc., and once they convince the victim to share their screen, a malicious app or software is installed ""surreptitiously"" and the victims sensitive information like bank details, passwords and banking services are compromised.
As part of the do's and don'ts, the communication asked users to activate 'two factor authentication or 2FA' on their WA account while it suggested not replying and answering suspicious or unknown WA calls and reporting and blocking the numbers that approach the user.
""The officials associated with messaging app WhatsApp have already been informed for this data breaching act. As numerous government bodies and ministry officials are already working on it, official communications are sent to the concerned authorities for the same.""  	""As a precautionary measure, unknown communications on WhatsApp without verifying their authenticity should be avoided. Still, any appropriate solution to such problems is not yet recognised,"" it said.

YF6NUBWRPJ_6QLOGUCEWYTW8PX,Bonbibi: The beloved forest goddess of Hindus and Muslims of the Sunderbans,"Chandrima S. Bhattacharya Published 21.01.24, 05:37 AM","Chandrima S. Bhattacharya Published 21.01.24, 05:37 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/bonbibi-the-beloved-goddess-of-hindus-and-muslims-of-sunderbans/cid/1995185,"Residents of Kalitala-Samshernagar in Hingalganj block in the Sunderbans are very happy with a recent gift from the chief minister: a brand new temple of Bonbibi, the forest goddess.
The temple is all marble and tiles, with the light shining off its polished surfaces, and it is expected that the chief minister will inaugurate it soon. The people of Hingalganj are waiting eagerly for the occasion.
But one wonders what Bonbibi would have made of her new home. The oldest of the temples of Bonbibi, who is worshipped as the protector of all creatures from the dangers of the forest, especially from the tiger, were built decades ago — at the very least — and are a far cry from the marble-and-tile structure that is the Hingalganj temple.
In the interiors of the Sunderbans, Bonbibi temples can look like survivors from another time.
Of late, Bonbibi’s popularity has travelled far beyond the Sunderbans, even into Coke Studio as a song — one reason, perhaps, behind the idea that she deserves a “modern” home even in the Sunderbans.
In the forest area of Kultali is located an old Bonbibi temple that is visited frequently by local residents and outsiders. Kultali is one of the places in the Sunderbans where tigers are being sighted in increasing numbers now. Every year, on the last Tuesday of the Bengali month of Baisakh, a Bonbibi mela is organised. The occasion draws thousands of people, including Hindus and Muslims, as Bonbibi is revered by both communities.
According to her story, which lives on in many versions and is also sung by her devotees as Bonbibir gaan, she defeats Dakshin Ray, the tiger god of the Sunderbans, and at once takes over the Sunderbans and saves the people from Dakshin Ray, who, too, continues to be worshipped.
Getting to the temple is not easy. One has to go by boat, down a hauntingly beautiful, serene green-blue stream that flows into River Matla, which reigns wide and sweeping against the horizon. To get to the boat is not easy either; the slope of the mudbanks is treacherous. An untrained urban body can disappear swiftly into its depths if not supported by able hands. My friend and I are being taken to the temple by Kamal Bera, a fisherman who lives in a village in Mai-pith area of Kultali.
Pugmarks of the tiger leading to the temple.                                                             Chandrima S. Bhattacharya
Bera has absolute faith in Bonbibi. He starts out every day, or night, as it may be, into the perilous waters and forests by taking Bonbibi’s name. To her, he owes his survival, he says. We are in his small diesel-driven fishing boat. With him is his helper. On both sides of the blue-green water are mangrove forests. On the way, we pick up Rabin Guchchhait, who does the puja at the Bonbibi temple.
Like Guchchhait, often Bonbibi’s priests are not Brahmins. “Eta amader gorib jele-bauleder pujo… This is the puja of us, the poor jele-baule community,” says Guchchhait. “We do not know any mantras.”
We get down at a spot that marks the beginning of Bonbibi’s “thaan” (from sthaan, or place). My heart skips a few beats as I look down. Pugmarks are all around us. Clear large ones and smaller smudged ones mark the length of the narrow path that leads from the mudbank to the temple, our destination.
“That mark is old, from a few days earlier, but this one is from this morning,” says Bera. “Eta Bonbibir thaan. This is where the tigers will come,” he says. “All you have to do is have faith in Bonbibi,” he says.
This is the sanctum sanctorum. Tigers roam here, Bera seems to say, but they are rendered powerless by the goddess. Bera’s father, a fisherman like him, was killed by a tiger. Guchchhait says he once rescued someone from the tiger’s jaws. They have lost count how many times they have seen a tiger. The number of tigers is growing significantly now, they say. But no tiger ever attacks at the thaan, they insist. Their grandfathers, who had migrated to the Sunderbans from Midnapore, had built the temple, they say.
The temple is a revelation. It is a large, beautiful, spare, mud structure supported by bamboo poles. Its only concession to modern age is the tin roof. The inside is bare, except for eight, rather grand, idols in a row. In the middle, on the right side, is Bonbibi. One of the best-dressed goddesses, she is wearing a sari here, though sometimes she can also be seen wearing a ghagra and salwar. But her headdress is like that of a Muslim princess. She has an enchanting, heart-shaped face, a bright yellow complexion and looks on benignly at what stretches ahead of her: the river and the forest. To her left is Shah Jangali, her brother. Next to him are Boro Gaji Khan Saheb, a king, says Guchchhait, and Peer Saheb, his minister. Peer Saheb is also known as Chhawal Peer, one who blesses people with children.
Guchchhait performs the worship of these four, who are of Muslim origin, during the festival. The puja is performed simply, without any mantra, just by offering Bonbibi and her companions some food and flowers. To Bonbibi’s right are four “Hindu” goddesses, says Guchchhait: Narayani Debi, Dakshin Ray’s mother, riding a tiger here, Ma Bishalakshi, very similar to Kali, Ma Manasa, the goddess of snakes, and Ma Ganga, the river goddess, with Makar, her vahana. Their puja, during the same festival, is performed by a Hindu Brahmin priest.
This very pantheon should be enough as an ans-wer to the peddlers of communal politics, who are now also trying to appropriate Dakshin Ray as “Hindu” and alienating “Bonbibi” as Muslim, as temples take centre stage. “Devotees turn up in thousands to attend the festival, both Hindus and Muslims,” says Guchchhait.
Bonbibi’s story is also an interesting reference to a period in Bengal’s history. According to Munsi Baynaddi’s kechchha-kabya (narrative poems in praise of a deity’s accomplishments), Bonbibi Jahuranama, Bonbibi and her brother Shah Jangali had come over from Mecca to rule over Badaban, or the Sunderbans, points out Gopendrakrishna Basu in his book Banglar Loukik Debata. In a parallel account, Bonbibi defeats Dakshin Ray to rescue Dukhe, a poor youth who was tricked by his relatives into being sacrificed for Dakshin Ray. Some Bonbibi idols have her carrying Dukhe, like a child, on her lap.
In the last few years, Bonbibi’s popularity has grown spectacularly, outside the Sunderbans and into popular culture. The goddess got global recognition since Amitav Ghosh wrote The Hungry Tide, his novel set in the Sunderbans. Since then, she has appeared in a Bengali film and also in Coke Studio, where she is rather unre- cognisable as a pretty young, slim woman with a tall headdress moving to fusion beats.
All this has not changed Bera’s life. He has to go fishing every day, sometimes in the dead of night, though he has stopped catching crabs, which takes one to the interiors of the forest. Many deaths occur from tiger attacks when men go to collect crabs or honey. Bera also farms and manages a fishery, and yet finds it hard to make both ends meet. “I hardly sleep,” he says. Neither does his wife, who works by his side all day long and also manages the household, though she does not go fishing.
Having faith is the only way to survive. “You will meet the tiger,” says Bera. “And you can never trust him. Only if you can look into the tiger’s eye, you can win. But how many can do that? So you have to have faith in Bonbibi,” he says. At this point, Guchchhait expresses his heart’s desire. “We also want to construct a concrete temple here,” he says.
Thankfully the forest department has stopped this effort so far. But in this age of temples, we do not know for how long."

Palestinian fighters battled tanks trying to push back into the eastern suburbs of the Jabalia area in northern Gaza, where Israel had started pulling out troops and shifting to smaller-scale operations, residents and militants said.
The Israeli military said aircraft struck militant squads trying to plant explosives near troops and fire missiles at tanks in northern Gaza and said it was striking targets throughout Gaza.
In the southern area of Khan Younis, where Israel says it has expanded its operations against Hamas, witnesses said tanks shelled areas around Nasser Hospital overnight, describing the bombardment as the most intense in many days.
Nasser is now Gaza's largest functioning hospital. Israel says Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, including Nasser, which Hamas and medical staff deny though Israel has presented some footage and photos backing its claims.
The Israeli military said that in Khan Younis, it raided a military compound, neutralized ready-to-use rocket launchers and found explosives stashed underground while an aircraft struck two gunmen there.
The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes have killed 165 people and wounded 280 others in the past 24 hours, one of the biggest death tolls in a single day in 2024.
It did not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants in its daily toll. But most of the 24,927 Palestinians killed since the October 7 war began are civilians, health officials say.
Fighting has not been confined to Gaza. An Israeli strike on Syria's capital Damascus on Saturday killed four members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, including the head of the force's information unit in Syria, a security source in the regional pro-Syria alliance told Reuters.
In southern Lebanon, an Israeli strike on Saturday killed two members of Hamas travelling in a car, three security sources in Lebanon told Reuters. There was no immediate comment from Hamas or the Israeli military.
Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas in Gaza after its fighters burst into Israel on October 7, rampaged through Israeli towns and bases, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and dragging 253 hostages back to the enclave.
Israel says its forces have so far killed around 9,000 militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday vowed to press on with the war until Hamas is defeated and the remaining hostages released."
Z96WP5P4OH_RTWII6DHXIWKCGP,Israeli women fight on Gaza front line for first time since establishment of Israel in 1948,"Isabel Kershner Gaza Strip Published 21.01.24, 09:43 AM","Isabel Kershner Gaza Strip Published 21.01.24, 09:43 AM",20240121,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/israeli-women-fight-on-gaza-front-line-for-first-time-since-establishment-of-israel-in-1948/cid/1995224,"When Captain Amit Busi gets a chance to sleep, she does so with her boots on — and in a shared tent in an improvised Israeli military post in the northern Gaza Strip.
There she commands a company of 83 soldiers, nearly half of them men. It is one of several mixed-gender units fighting in Gaza, where female combat soldiers and officers are serving on the front line for the first time since the war surrounding the establishment of Israel in 1948.
Busi is responsible not just for the lives of her subordinates — search-and-rescue engineers whose specialised training and tools help infantry troops enter damaged and booby-trapped buildings at risk of collapse — but also for the wounded soldiers they help evacuate from the battlefield. She and her soldiers also help scour the area for fighters, weapons and rocket launchers and are responsible for guarding the camp.
It can be easy to forget Busi is only 23, given the respect she has clearly earned from her subordinates — among them Jews, Druze and Bedouin Muslim men.
“The borders have been blurred,” Busi said of the decadeslong limits on the roles of female combat troops in Israel. The military, she said, “needs us, so we are here.”
Since Israeli ground forces entered Gaza in late October, women have been there fighting. Their inclusion has helped bolster the image of the army domestically after the intelligence and military failures of October 7, and amid global scrutiny of the campaign’s high civilian death toll. More than 24,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to Gaza health officials.
The integration of women into the military’s combat units has been the subject of a lengthy debate in Israel, home to one of the world’s few armies that conscript women at 18 for mandatory service. For years the question of women serving at the front pitted ultraconservative rabbis and religiously observant soldiers against feminists, secularists and critics of the country’s traditionally macho culture.
Now, that debate is effectively over.
There is no point continuing such arguments, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, the military’s chief of staff, said after female soldiers raced to confront Hamas attackers on October 7, because their “action and fighting” speaks louder than words.
Like other fundamentals of Israeli life, many of the preconceptions about women in combat were upended on October 7, when hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen surged across the border from Gaza into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli officials, and abducting 240 captives to Gaza.
In the months since, the needs of the military have propelled societal change at breakneck speed. Same-sex partners of slain soldiers are now legally recognised widows and widowers, and at least one transgender soldier has fought on the front in Gaza.
Despite years of derision from conservative quarters of Israeli society, female combat soldiers have become symbols of progress and equality, appearing on magazine covers and featured in television news profiles.
A recent survey by the Israel Democracy Institute found that among the secular public, about 70 per cent of women and 67 per cent of men indicated support for increasing the number of women in combat roles.
In recent years, women have made up about 18 per cent of the military’s combat force.
“Everyone is using the phrase ‘The debate is over,’” said Idit Shafran Gittleman, director of the Military and Society programme at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. “Everyone saw what happened on October 7,” she said, adding that “women contribute to security, they don’t decrease security.”
Israeli women were thrust into combat almost immediately on October 7. Two all-female tank crews, once the butt of sexist jokes, hurtled through the desert that morning to help repel waves of armed infiltrators from Gaza.
The female commander of Caracal, a mixed-gender infantry battalion, led a 12-hour battle along the Gaza border with two companies equipped with Lau missiles and machine guns. Together with the tanks, they helped block Hamas’ advance, saving several communities from attack.
“We stopped them, they didn’t pass us,” said the commander, Lieutenant Colonel Or Ben Yehuda, 34, a career officer and a mother of three, speaking at the battalion’s desert base near the Egyptian border, where her unit is usually deployed."
