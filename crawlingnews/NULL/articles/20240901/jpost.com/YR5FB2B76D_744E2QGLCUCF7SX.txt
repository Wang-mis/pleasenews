American families of hostages held in Gaza have urged US President Joe Biden to consider a deal with Hamas that does not include Israel, NBC News reported on Thursday morning.Additionally, The Telegraph reported on Friday evening that a unilateral deal between Hamas and the US was already being considered, with US State Secretary Antony Blinken suggesting that most of the details of such a deal had already been agreed upon.During a meeting on Sunday, the relatives of the remaining American hostages called for the White House administration to look for options concerning their loved one's return, which does not include Israel.  Talks about a possible unilateral deal show growing doubts among family members and some officials about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreeing to a ceasefire with Hamas for the release of hostages, NBC News noted in their report.This is not the first time the subject of an agreement between the US and the terrorist organization Hamas. In June, NBC reported that the Biden administration began discussions on the matter, though the initiative did not succeed, with key administration figures strongly opposing the idea.

Additionally, US State Secretary Antony Blinken stated that approximately 90% of a ceasefire deal has been agreed on, according to The Telegraph, which further noted in its report that tensions between the White House and Netanyahu concerning the deal are rising.“In the coming days, we will share with Israel, and they [Qatar and Egypt] will share with Hamas, our thoughts – the three [mediators] – on exactly how to resolve the remaining outstanding questions, and then it will be time for the parties to decide yes or no, and then we’ll see,” said Blinken.Moreover, the US is currently pushing hard for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would also free the remaining hostages and possibly stop Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis from further attacking Israel, The Telegraph cited Israeli officials. The report further noted that Biden's top priority before leaving office was stopping the Israel-Hamas war.   Stay updated with the latest news!

However, this effort did not yield any results.Despite seemingly attempting to deal with the terrorist organization and the family's call for a unilateral deal that excludes Israel, one administration official claimed the idea of dealing with Hamas without Israel is unrealistic as the terrorist organization wants something the US cannot offer, NBC noted in their report.“Hamas wants two things that only Israel can deliver: a ceasefire and nearly 1,000 Palestinian prisoners currently in Israeli jails. Every other proposal has gone nowhere because that is what Hamas demands for the hostages,” NBC cited the official. Additionally, last week, US President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu for not doing enough to secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas despite the deaths of six hostages in Gaza.However, Netanyahu insists on maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor - which Hamas demands an Israeli withdrawal from - arguing about "the centrality of the Philadelphi Corridor [in] arming of Hamas,” as it was a key smuggling route between Gaza and Egypt, through which Hamas might also smuggle hostages.This stance has drawn criticism from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and others, who claim that the corridor was not originally a core demand. Moreover, Egypt strongly opposes Israeli control of the corridor and has accused Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire talks, The Telegraph noted in its report.The Biden administration is seeking to return the four remaining American hostages believed to be alive: Edan Alexander, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Omer Neutra, and Keith Seigal, as well as the bodies still held by Hamas of Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein Haggai, all of which were confirmed dead.

Additionally, last week, US President Joe Biden criticized Netanyahu for not doing enough to secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas despite the deaths of six hostages in Gaza.However, Netanyahu insists on maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor - which Hamas demands an Israeli withdrawal from - arguing about "the centrality of the Philadelphi Corridor [in] arming of Hamas,” as it was a key smuggling route between Gaza and Egypt, through which Hamas might also smuggle hostages.This stance has drawn criticism from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and others, who claim that the corridor was not originally a core demand. Moreover, Egypt strongly opposes Israeli control of the corridor and has accused Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire talks, The Telegraph noted in its report.The Biden administration is seeking to return the four remaining American hostages believed to be alive: Edan Alexander, Sagui Dekel-Chen, Omer Neutra, and Keith Seigal, as well as the bodies still held by Hamas of Itay Chen, Gadi Haggai, and Judith Weinstein Haggai, all of which were confirmed dead.
