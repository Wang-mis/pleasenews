Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has reiterated his administration's unconditional support for the Palestinian resistance in its fight against the occupying Israeli regime.
Pezeshkian made the remarks in a message delivered during the 9th International Conference of "Mujahideen in Exile" which was held in the Iranian city of Damghan in the northern province of Semnan on Tuesday, with guests from different Muslim countries and national and provincial officials in attendance.
"Over the course of nearly half a century, the legacy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has consistently championed justice and advocated human rights globally, has been to fully support the oppressed Palestinian nation's resistance against the Zionist usurper regime, as well as the struggle of all the oppressed nations in the world," he said.
The president said from the beginning of his tenure, he has declared his steadfast support for the Palestinian people and the oppressed around the world.
He also said the 14th Iranian government will continue its unwavering support for the Palestinian resistance just as the previous governments.
"I believe that we should always consider ourselves committed to seeking justice and support freedom-seekers and also the oppressed in any circumstance, because justice-seeking on the part of the elite and awakened consciences can lay a good ground for realizing a bright future," he said.
Pezeshkian further praised the late Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian as "a distinguished diplomat and a true embodiment of resistance diplomacy" as well as "a strong and intelligent negotiator."
Amir-Abdollahian passed away in the helicopter crash of May 19, along with late President Ebrahim Raisi and several other officials.
