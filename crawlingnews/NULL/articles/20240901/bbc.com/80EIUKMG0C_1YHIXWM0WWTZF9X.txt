Detectives investigating Nicola Sturgeon over the SNP's finances have asked prosecutors for directions on the next steps in their inquiry.
The update is understood to be about the former first minister and ex-SNP treasurer Colin Beattie, who have remained under investigation after being arrested and released without charge last year.
Former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, Ms Sturgeon's husband, was charged with embezzling party funds in April.
Police have sent prosecutors details of what they have uncovered in an "advice and guidance report" on Operation Branchform and are seeking formal advice on what they should do next.
A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "On 9 August, we presented the findings of the investigation so far to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and we await their direction on what further action should be taken."
The Crown Office said the police report is under consideration.
A month after Mr Murrell was charged, Branchform detectives sent a standard prosecution report to the Crown Office concerning incidents said to have taken place between 2016 and 2023.
Senior Crown Office lawyers are considering whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Murrell and whether it would be in the public interest to do so.
Ms Sturgeon has denied that her decision to resign as first minister and SNP leader in March last year was influenced by the police investigation.
She said she would fully co-operate with the inquiry and has done nothing wrong.
