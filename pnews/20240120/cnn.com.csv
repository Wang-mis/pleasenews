0X6R5WI92U_GN1APLKPT5SGM4Q,Pakistan condemns deadly Iranian missile strike on its territory as tensions spike across region,"By Jonny Hallam, Asim Khan and Helen Regan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:15 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/middleeast/iran-missile-attack-pakistan-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian airstrike inside its borders that killed two children, calling it an “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warning of retaliation.
Iran said it used “precision missile and drone strikes,” to destroy two strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, in the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan’s southwest Balochistan province, according to Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency.
Tuesday’s attack comes after Iran launched missiles in northern Iraq and Syria Monday, in the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East where Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza risks spiraling into a wider regional conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said the attack on its territory killed “two innocent children” and warned Iran of “serious consequences.”
It described the airstrike as an “unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran … inside Pakistani territory.”
“It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the ministry said.
Pakistan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador from Iran and suspended all Iraninan high-level visits.
“Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” Mumtaz Baloch, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a televised address.
She said the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan should not return from a current visit to Iran and warned “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act.”
China urged Iran and Pakistan to exercise restraint in handling their ongoing conflict after the deadly strike. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on both countries to “avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.”
A spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the strike was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan,” but stressed India has “zero tolerance towards terrorism.”
Iran launches missile strikes in northern Iraq and Syria, claims to destroy Israeli spy base
The Jaish al-Adl militant group late Tuesday said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had used six attack drones and a number of rockets to destroy two houses where the children and wives of its fighters lived.
Authorities in Balochistan province told CNN two girls had died and at least four people were injured. The girls, aged eight and 12, were killed in houses that were damaged in the attack in the village of Koh-e-Sabz in Kulag, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Panjgur district, on Tuesday evening, according to the district’s deputy commissioner Mumtaz Khetran.
Khetran also said a mosque near the homes was targeted and hit in the strikes.
Koh-e-Sabz — about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Pakistan’s border with Iran — is known to be the home of Jaish al-Adl’s former second-in-command Mullah Hashim, who was killed in clashes with Iranian forces in Sarawan, an Iranian region adjacent to Panjgur, in 2018.
Last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice, is a separatist militant group that operates on both sides of the border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its stated goal is the independence of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan province, which neighbors Pakistan.
On Wednesday, it claimed responsibility for an attack on an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) vehicle in Sistan and Baluchistan that Iranian state media says killed one of its colonels.
Jaish al-Adl said on its official website that it had targeted an IRGC pick-up truck on the outskirts of Iranshahr.
Colonel Hossein Ali Javadanfar was killed in the attack, according to the IRGC’s Sepah news.
CNN cannot independently verify Jaish al-Adl’s claim.
Iran said Wednesday it “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that “none of the nationals of the friendly country of Pakistan were targeted” in the strike.
“We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. But we don’t allow our national security to be compromised and to be played with and we have no reservation when it comes to our national interests,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The strikes in Pakistan came a day after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards launched ballistic missiles, targeting what it claimed was a spy base for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Erbil, northern Iraq, and at “anti-Iran terror groups” in Syria.
Iran said the strikes in Iraq were in response to what it said were Israeli attacks that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders, and claimed targets in Syria were involved in the recent dual bombings in the city of Kerman during a memorial for the slain Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani that left scores dead and wounded.
It defended the strikes as a “precise and targeted” operation to deter security threats, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement on Tuesday.
Iran’s attacks will further raise fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could widen into a full-scale war in the Middle East with grave humanitarian, political and economic consequences.
The attacks in Iraq and Syria were condemned by the United States as “reckless” and imprecise, while the United Nations said, “security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.”
Iraq said it submitted a complaint to the UN Security Council and the UN on Tuesday. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said there are no Mossad-affiliated centers operating in Erbil in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
But, speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria at Davos, Iran’s Foreign Minister repeated the country’s claim that the strike on Iraq was a response “against elements and agents of Mossad,” and said Iran has “very good relations” with both Iraq and Pakistan.
“We have talked and agreed for several times on the necessity of fighting terrorism,” he said, adding that the action taken by Iran “targeted Israel that remains a common enemy of both of us,” and that the country would respond to any attack “vigorously.”
He stressed that if Israel’s war in Gaza ends, then other conflicts across the Middle East would too. “If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks has killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, and wrought widespread devastation, as civilians live with the threat of imminent death – either by an airstrike, starvation or disease.
The conflict has escalated hostilities across the region, with Iran’s allies and proxies – the so-called axis of resistance – launching attacks on Israeli forces and its allies.
On Tuesday, the US military launched new strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen, targeting anti-ship ballistic missiles controlled by the Iran-backed rebel group, a defense official told CNN.
A few hours later, the Houthis launched a missile into international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea, hitting the M/V Zografia, a Maltese flagged bulk carrier, the official said.
The strikes are at least the third round of attacks the US military has launched against the Houthis’ infrastructure since last Thursday, when American and British conducted a joint operation that targeted command and control nodes and weapons depots used by the Houthis to launch missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have also repeatedly come under rocket and drone attacks from Tehran’s proxies. Last week, the US carried out a strike in Baghdad that killed a leader from an Iran-backed proxy group that Washington blamed for attacks against US personnel in the region.
And fighting has intensified between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah, across the Lebanon border. On Sunday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed to press on with confrontations with Israeli forces on the Lebanon border until the end of the Israeli offensive in Gaza.

0ZIHR5ORGZ_44HSC1FLW0EF61J,Taiwan voters dismiss China warnings and hand ruling party a historic third consecutive presidential win,"By Eric Cheung, Wayne Chang, Nectar Gan and Jerome Taylor, CNN","6 minute read Updated 4:43 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240113,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/13/asia/taiwan-presidential-election-results-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party pulled off a historic third consecutive presidential victory on Saturday as voters shrugged off warnings by China that their re-election would increase the risk of conflict.
Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s current vice president, declared victory on Saturday evening while his two opposition rivals both conceded defeat.
“This is a night that belongs to Taiwan. We managed to keep Taiwan on the map of the world,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” he added.
China responded soon after the vote by saying “Taiwan is part of China.”
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was elected Vice President.
The counting of votes has concluded, with Lai – the candidate of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) – receiving just over 40% of the total votes, according to Taiwan’s Central Election Commission (CEC).
Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party candidate Hou Yu-ih garnered 33.49% of the votes, with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) candidate Ko Wen-je received 26.45%. More than 14 million people took part, meaning that voter turnout came in at just over 71%.
The boisterous election campaign, an illustration of Taiwan’s vibrant democratic credentials, was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose.
The result shows voters backing the DPP’s view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China’s threats and deepen relations with fellow democratic countries, even if that means economic punishment or military intimidation by Beijing.
It is also a further snub to eight years of increasingly strongarm tactics towards Taiwan under Xi who has vowed that the island’s eventual “reunification” with the mainland is “a historical inevitability”.
Following Taiwan’s election result, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said no matter “whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change.”
The spokesperson continued: “The one-China principle is the solid anchor for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that the international community will continue to adhere to the one-China principle and understand and support the Chinese people’s just cause of opposing ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities and striving to achieve national reunification.”
A spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office earlier insisted the election result “does not represent the mainstream view on the island.”
Other world powers have congratulated Lai, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying the vote demonstrated “the strength of [Taiwan’s] robust democratic system and electoral process.”
Like outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, who cannot stand again because of term limits, Lai is openly loathed by China’s Communist Party leaders and his victory is unlikely to lead to any improvement in ties between Beijing and Taipei.
China cut off most communications with Taipei after Tsai took office and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-ruled island, turning the Taiwan Strait into one of the world’s major geopolitical flash points.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it. While successive Chinese Communist leaders have vowed to eventually achieve “reunification,” Xi has repeatedly said the Taiwan issue “should not be passed down generation after generation,” linking the mission to his mid-century goal of “national rejuvenation.”
The DPP emphasizes that Taiwan is not subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party, and that its future Taiwan must only be decided by its 23.5 million people.
In the run up to Saturday’s vote, Beijing warned Taiwan’s voters to “make the right choice” and “recognize the extreme danger of Lai Ching-te’s triggering of cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
His running mate Hsiao has been sanctioned twice by China for being a “stubborn secessionist.”
Speaking to the media ahead of his victory speech on Saturday night, Lai called his win a “victory for the community of democracies.”
“We are telling the international community that between democracy and authoritarianism, we still stand on the side of democracy,” he said.
“I will act in accordance with our democratic and free constitutional order in a manner that is balanced and maintains the cross-strait status quo,” he added. “At the same time, we are also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China”.
“In the future, we hope that China will recognize the new situation, and understand that only peace benefits both sides of the strait,” he added.
Lai’s victory comes as the US is trying to stabilize fraught relations with China and prevent competition from veering into conflict. During Tsai’s administration, Taiwan bolstered ties with the United States, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
US officials have said that Washington will uphold its longstanding policy toward Taiwan no matter who takes on the top job. The Biden administration will dispatch an unofficial delegation – including former senior officials – to Taipei following the election in keeping with past practice, according to senior officials.
The delegation visit “will be a signal, a very symbolic way of supporting Taiwan,” said T.Y. Wang, a professor at Illinois State University.
Saturday’s result is another major blow for Taiwan’s Kuomintang, which back warmer relations with Beijing and have not held the presidency since 2016.
Beijing made little secret of its desire to see the KMT return to power. During campaigning the KMT accused Lai and the DPP of needlessly stoking tensions with China.
Lev Nachman, a political science professor at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said that while Lai has to make some economic adjustments given deep public grievances over low wages and unaffordable housing, on issues like foreign policy and cross-strait relations he is expected to largely follow Tsai’s approach.
“So much of (Lai’s) campaign has been trying to reassure not just a domestic audience, but international audience that he is Tsai Ing-wen 2.0,” he said.
That will not be welcome in Beijing.
Days before the election, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said by following Tsai’s path, Lai is pursuing a path of provocation and confrontation and will bring Taiwan “closer and closer to war and recession.”
Analysts say China could escalate economic and military pressure on Taiwan to show its displeasure in the coming days and weeks, or save a more forceful response for May, when Lai takes office.
“There’s multiple times that China could cause a fuss over a DPP victory, either now or later this year,” Nachman said.
And Beijing has a wide range of coercive measures in its toolbox too.
In the lead-up to the vote, China ended preferential tariffs for some Taiwanese imports under a free trade agreement. It could broaden the scope of goods targeted, or even suspend the agreement altogether.
China can also further ramp up its military pressure on Taiwan, sending more fighter jets and warships close to the island’s skies and waters, a tactic it has deployed with increased frequency in recent years.
But Taiwan’s security officials said ahead of the vote that they didn’t expect large-scale military actions from China right after the election, citing unsuitable winter weather conditions, troubles in the Chinese economy, and efforts by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties following a bilateral summit in November.
And while an escalation of military tension could increase the risks of accidents and miscalculations, it doesn’t necessarily portend an imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait, analysts noted.
“Just because the DPP is in power doesn’t mean China’s going to war,” said Nachman.
“The last eight years have obviously been uncomfortable with the DPP in power, but it hasn’t led to war, they’ve been able to find an uncomfortable middle ground. And the hope is that even with a Lai presidency that we can continue to have this sort of uncomfortable silence without having to go to war.”"
14ZRV2ZC90_EOLF5A63STEG9DC,US and UK carry out strikes against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen,"By Oren Liebermann, Haley Britzky, Natasha Bertrand, Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt, MJ Lee and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","11 minute read Updated 3:36 PM EST, Fri January 12, 2024",20240112,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/11/politics/us-strikes-houthis-yemen/,"The US and UK militaries launched strikes against Houthi targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Thursday, marking a significant response after the Biden administration and its allies warned that the Iran-backed militant group would bear the consequences of its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US President Joe Biden said he ordered the strikes “in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.”
READ: President Joe Biden’s statement on strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen
“Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces — together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways,” the president said in a statement released by the White House.
Biden added that he will “not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday the strikes were an act of “self-defense,” adding that the aim was to “de-escalate tensions and to restore stability to the region.”
US Air Forces Central Commander Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich initially said US and coalition forces struck over 60 targets with more than 100 precision-guided munitions at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations. The Houthi assets included command and control nodes, munitions, depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems, he added.
On Friday afternoon, Director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims II said another 12 locations were also hit on Thursday after a “near immediate” decision following the initial strikes.
The strikes, which have been condemned by several leaders across the Middle East, killed five and wounded six others, according to the rebels’ military spokesperson, Yahya Sare’e, who said the airstrikes would not deter further Houthi attacks on shipping.
The US and UK strikes are a sign of the growing international alarm over the threat to one of the world’s most critical waterways. For weeks, the US had sought to avoid direct strikes on Yemen because of the risk of escalation in a region already simmering with tension as the Israel-Hamas war continues, but the ongoing Houthi attacks on international shipping compelled the coalition to act.
Though the US has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, this marks the first known strike against the Houthis in Yemen.
The strikes were from fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles. More than a dozen Houthi targets were fired on by missiles fired from air, surface, and sub platforms and were chosen for their ability to degrade the Houthis’ continued attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, a US official told CNN.
What kind of weapons are the US and UK using to strike Yemen’s Houthis?
The USS Florida, a guided missile submarine that crossed into the Red Sea on November 23, was part of the attack on Yemen, according to a second US official.
The USS Philippine Sea guided missile cruiser and two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Mason, also took place, the official added on Friday.
The US also deployed 22 fixed wing aircraft — including F18s — from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, the official said.
Four British Typhoon jets departed RAF Akrotiri, a major UK airbase in Cyprus, on Thursday evening local time, according to a British government official.
Two Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers also comprised the mission, UK junior armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC on Friday, adding that at least 14 targets were successfully hit.
“They flew south, joined up with their US colleagues, and prosecuted two targets in Houth-controlled Yemen, both of which had been used for the launching of drone and missile attacks,” Heappey added. There are no more UK convoys “immediately planned,” he said.
On Thursday, Rear-Admiral Emmanuel Slaars, joint commander of French forces in the Red Sea region, told journalists in Paris that French naval forces were patroling the waters where the Houthis operated.
Slaars said the French navy forces remain “under national command” and were “not subordinated” to the US. However, they are cooperating and sharing intelligence with the US.
A senior US military official told reporters on Thursday evening that he could not provide an exact percentage of Houthi assets that were destroyed in the strikes but that it was “significant.” He added that precision guided munitions were used to destroy the targets “and also to minimize collateral damage.”
“We were absolutely not targeting civilian population centers. We were going after very specific capabilities, in very specific locations, with precision munitions,” the official said.
The Houthis — an Iran-backed Shia political and military organization that has been fighting a civil war in Yemen against a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia — have been launching drones and missiles at commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea for weeks, many of which have been intercepted and shot down by US Navy ships in the area.
The Houthis have said their bombardments are showing solidarity with the Palestinian people, after Israel launched an unrelenting military campaign on Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks.
The Houthis have said they will only relent when Israel allows the entry of food and medicine into Gaza; its strikes could be intended to inflict economic pain on Israel’s allies in the hope they will pressure it to cease its military offensive.
Within Yemen, a yearslong conflict between Houthi forces and the Saudi-backed coalition has plunged the population into a devastating humanitarian crisis marked by famine, economic turmoil and extreme poverty.
Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014, and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government, triggering a civil war. The conflict spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis.
The conflict has killed up to 377,000 people, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported in 2021. More than half of those died from indirect causes associated with the conflict, such as lack of food, water and healthcare.
Pro-Houthi demonstrators gathered in Sanaa on Friday, protesting against the US and UK airstrikes. Some chanted, “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.”
The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping on Tuesday marked the final straw that culminated in Biden giving the green light for the US to move forward with Thursday’s strikes, though preparations have been ongoing for some time, a senior US official told CNN.
The strikes come as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin remains hospitalized following complications from a surgery for prostate cancer. A senior Defense official said Austin ordered and monitored the strikes in in real-time from the hospital “with a full suite of secure communications.”
Pentagon watchdog launches review following Austin hospitalization
Over the course of the past several weeks, Biden has weighed potential strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen against the prospect of an escalating crisis in the Middle East. His underlying hesitancy in ordering direct action has been the potential of getting drawn in more directly to an expanding conflict — a scenario US officials believe could ultimately be Iran’s objective.
But the White House had made clear the repeated Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea were intolerable. The attacks have forced some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the waterway, instead adding thousands of miles to international shipping routes by sailing around the continent of Africa.
Hours before the strike on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran “has a role to play” in getting the Houthis to stop their “reckless, dangerous, and illegal activity.” If they did not, he said, “there will be consequences.”
The Houthi’s deputy foreign minister, Hussein al-Ezzi, claimed that Yemen was targeted in a “massive aggressive assault.”
In a speech Thursday, Houthi leader Abdul Malek Al-Houthi said that any US attack on Yemen ” will not go unanswered,” cryptically warning that the response will be “much more” than attacking US ships in the sea.
Houthi rebels’ military spokesperson Sare’e on Friday said they would continue their aggression against commercial ships in the Red Sea.
In a statement Friday on social media, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the group’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said the airstrikes “are barbaric, terrorist, and are a deliberate and unjustified aggression that reflects a brutal psychology.”
A senior US administration official signaled that there could be more action to come against the Houthis.
The Houthis fired at least one anti-ship ballistic missile towards a commercial vessel, Sims said on Friday.
The ballistic missile, fired Friday, “did not hit any ships of any kind,” Sims said, adding that he expected they were working through things on the ground and “trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them.” A US official said the missile was fired towards the M/T Khalissa in the Gulf of Aden.
“I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation. Quite honestly I would hope they wouldn’t. And what I mean by that is, there are a number of actors here who have the ability and have influence with the Houthis who recognize that continued conflict is not … advantageous to them,” Sims said. “Iran would be one of them.”
“The hope would be that any real thought of retaliation is based on a clear understanding that we simply are not going to be messed with here,” he added.
New explosions were heard in Yemen’s western port city of Hodeidah on Friday, a resident told CNN.
The airport in Hodeidah had been hit in the initial round of strikes early Friday morning. The resident provided CNN a video that showed smoke rising from the direction of the airport.
CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense about the explosions, and whether there are new strikes in Yemen.
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned while traveling in the region that “if it doesn’t stop, there will have to be consequences. And unfortunately, it hasn’t stopped.”
Blinken also said he doesn’t believe the war in Gaza is escalating into a regional conflict, even as he warned of “a lot of danger points.” While in the region, Blinken visited Bahrain, home to the US Naval Forces Central Command and the Navy’s Fifth Fleet.
An important aspect of Blinken’s trip to the Middle East was to tell regional leaders that if US takes military action against the Houthis, it should be seen as defensive, not escalatory, according to a senior State Department official.
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council passed a US- and Japan-led resolution condemning “in the strongest terms the at least two dozen Houthi attacks on merchant and commercial vessels since November 19, 2023” and demanding “that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks.” Eleven countries voted in favor of the resolution. Four abstained, including China and Russia. A Western diplomat told CNN that the US accommodated some of China’s requests on the language of the resolution.
US strikes in Yemen are not unprecedented; according to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US has conducted nearly 400 airstrikes in Yemen since 2002.
In Yemen, officials say they are concerned at what a strike against the Houthis would portend for the region. Declassified US intelligence shows that Iran has been deeply involved in coordinating the Houthi attacks on commercial and merchant ships, including providing information about shipping vessels passing through the waterway.
Among the US’ concerns about taking direct action inside Yemen is also the risk of upsetting a carefully brokered truce in the war in Yemen between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, which a US official previously told CNN the Biden administration considers one of its most significant foreign policy achievements.
Some American officials feared a direct attack on the Houthis in Yemen would be precisely what the group craved: drawing the US into direct engagement with the Iranian proxy group and potentially committing its forces to a more prolonged conflict.
Still, Biden’s attempts at deterrence had done little to prevent the Houthis from continuing their attacks on commercial and merchant ships transiting the Red Sea.
A significant turning point came around New Year’s, when US Navy helicopters shot and sank three Houthi boats in self-defense, killing those aboard. It was the first direct engagement between the US and Houthis since the start of the conflict, and prompted Biden to convene his national security team for a secure briefing call while he was on vacation in the US Virgin Islands.
That joint statement was issued on January 3, saying that the Houthis “will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.”
While not describing the statement as a red line, Biden and his team recognized the language would essentially bind them to a more forceful response should the Houthi attacks continue, which many officials privately believed they would.
Just on Tuesday, the US Navy to shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by the Houthis; culminating on Thursday the fiercest response from the Biden administration since the salvos began.
There have been at least 27 Houthi attacks since November 19. As the US and its allies have been navigating the Houthis’ ongoing attacks, there have also been at least 131 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, leading to several strikes on facilities linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other proxy forces.
But many of the commercial vessels have had no connection to Israel. Vice Adm. Bradley Cooper, the commander of US Navy Central Command, said last week that the US assesses 55 nations have “direct connections” to the ships that have come under fire.

17K8IEPLS1_8F66NP9A6FKJ13I,Taiwan loses diplomatic ally to China days after presidential election,"By Nectar Gan, Eric Cheung and Wayne Chang, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:13 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/nauru-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-china-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan has lost another diplomatic ally to China just days after its presidential election in what Taipei said was both sudden and designed by Beijing to suppress the island’s “democratic achievements.”
The Pacific Island nation of Nauru on Monday announced it had severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China, a decision confirmed by Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry.
The move is the latest blow to Taiwan’s efforts to retain its dwindling number of diplomatic allies, and comes just two days after Taiwan’s voters defied China’s threats to elect a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and a staunch defender of Taiwan’s distinct identity and sovereignty, won the presidential election on Saturday, handing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a historic third straight term.
Beijing had repeatedly warned Taiwan’s voters that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up diplomatic pressure on Taipei in recent years, including by poaching its allies.
During the DPP’s eight years in power, Taiwan has lost 10 diplomatic allies to China.
Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?
On Monday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned China in “the strongest possible terms” for Nauru’s diplomatic switch, which it said came at “a key moment” following the presidential election.
“China’s move is to suppress Taiwan’s democratic achievements,” Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang told reporters.
Tien added that the severance of ties was a “very sudden move” by the Nauru government, which had congratulated Lai’s presidential victory over the weekend.
Tien said Taiwan will immediately suspend all official interactions with Nauru “to defend national dignity,” including closing its embassy and asking the Pacific Island nation to close its embassy in Taiwan.
Tien also claimed that Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry had received information that Chinese officials had courted politicians in Nauru with offers of economic assistance.
He refused to put a figure on the alleged inducement, but said it was “beyond what we are able to assist our diplomatic allies with.”
In a regular news briefing Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not divulge whether Beijing had pledged financial aid to Nauru, but welcomed its move.
“It is Nauru’s right decision made on its own volition as an independent sovereign nation to announce its recognition of the one-China principle, its severance of ties with Taiwan and resumption of diplomatic relations with China after Taiwan’s election,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. “This also shows that the one-China principle is a general trend and the common aspiration of the people.”
This is the second time Nauru has severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Pacific Island country first cut ties in 2002, followed by a resumption in 2005.
The Nauru government said its resumption of diplomatic relations with China was “in the best interests” of the country and its people.
“This means that the Republic of Nauru will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory, and will sever ‘diplomatic relations’ with Taiwan as of this day and no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan,” it said in a statement.
Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China
Nauru’s switch of allegiance leaves Taiwan with only 12 diplomatic allies, mostly small nations in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America, and the Vatican.
Nauru’s announcement came as an unofficial US delegation reaffirmed “rock solid” US support for Taiwan during a visit to the island to meet its current and incoming presidents.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
But since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
Many other Western nations, including several in Europe, have also retained informal relations with Taipei in the guise of trade offices.
Analysts say these unofficial relationships with powerful Western nations are in many ways more consequential than the official diplomatic ties it maintains with a handful of smaller countries.
However, formal diplomatic relations allow those countries to advocate on behalf of Taiwan in international bodies that the island is locked out of, such as the United Nations.

1C4RMZH9MP_KH93DCN9AWYAEYF,South Africa accuses Israel of genocide and urges top UN court to halt Gaza war,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 10:12 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240111,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/,"South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and calling for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was handed a 2.5-year sentence on Tuesday which was commuted to a fine of 27,300 Turkish Liras ($910 USD) after he accepted the charge of “reckless killing” for fatally striking Yunus Emre Gocer, a married father of two, in late November, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber.
The case initially sparked controversy in Turkey after Mohamud left the country following the deadly incident, prompting criticism of perceived inaction by police and prosecutors. An arrest warrant for Mohamud was dropped when he returned to Turkey in order to give a statement in court on Friday, according to TRT.
Mohamud was not required to be in court on Tuesday when the verdict in the case was read. He was originally handed a 3-year prison sentence, which was decreased to 2.5 years for “good conduct,” according to TRT. According to Turkish penal code, the court can opt to convert a sentence of that length to a fine, which it did, sparing Mohamud any prison time. His driver’s license will also be cancelled for six months, according to TRT.
Iyaz Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN that his clients had agreed to drop their formal complaint against Mohamud. He would not say what, if any, deal with Mohamud prompted that decision, or whether the family would be financially compensated.
Mohamud’s case is one of two incidents involving the sons of prominent foreign officials that have raised questions about fairness in the justice system. In December, there was a second collision allegedly involving the son of a former Yemeni defense minister, who police say hit two pedestrians. One of the victims was seriously injured.
The two cases have no direct connection to one another, beyond the coincidental timing, and the harsh public spotlight cast on both – especially after early missteps and discrepancies by police and prosecutors in the first.
According to Turkish police, 40-year-old Mohamud, the son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was behind the wheel of a black BMW with diplomatic plates in southwest Istanbul when it struck Gocer, a delivery driver on a scooter, on November 30.
According to a statement from the prosecutor, Gocer died on December 6 and “therefore the nature of the crime changed” from the charge of “reckless injury” to “reckless killing.” Two days later, an arrest warrant was issued.

Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN in December that Mohamud had left the country on December 2, before the warrant was issued.
Cimen had previously told CNN that the initial police report suggested the victim had made an illegal lane change, but only after public scrutiny, and after the victim died and the charge became more serious, did a subsequent report cast doubt on the initial police assessment of what happened. That second report, written by independent experts, says that the “primarily negligent party” was Mohamud.
A third report, meant to resolve discrepancies between the initial police report and the subsequent expert report, produced a more mixed result. Published December 18 by the Traffic Specialization Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute, it affirmed that Mohamud was “primarily at fault,” but also found that Gocer was also “secondarily at fault.” The report says that Gocer was in front of Mohamud in the second-to-right lane, while Mohamud was behind in the right lane.
Gocer slowed to change lanes to the right, and that’s when he was hit. It blames Mohamud for failing to hit the brakes and slow down, but it also blames Gocer for failing to adequately check his mirrors to see Mohamud behind him and slowing to a stop on a road with a speed limit of 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
The perceived initial failings quickly led to public outrage, with motorcycle drivers and couriers staging a protest in December calling for justice for Gocer.
Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said in December that he was glad the prosecutor’s office had issued the arrest warrant. The mayor had written on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the prosecutor’s office would need to explain discrepancies between the initial police report and the latest statement “which allowed the suspect to flee abroad.”
CNN reached out to the Somali consulate for comment in December but did not receive a response. In an interview with the Associated Press published December 14, the Somali president denied that his son had fled the country, saying that he left because he had business elsewhere and there was no arrest warrant for him. President Mohamud told the AP he was sorry for Gocer’s family for his loss, and said that he has advised his son to go back to Turkey for court proceedings. “The decision is his — but I am giving that advice,” he said.
At the time, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters in Ankara he had personally spoken with the Somali justice minister.
“In the coming days, the defendant will come to Turkey and participate in the trial process,” he said, according to Anadolu. “”We will never allow any of our citizens to lose their rights and legal interests in favor of a foreigner. We will follow the incident to the end. We will work for justice to prevail.”

In the second, separate incident in early December in central Istanbul, Musaeed Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, the son of Yemen’s former Defense Minister Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, was behind the wheel of a vehicle that hit two people as they were crossing the street, according to the statement Hussein gave to prosecutors.One of them was a 71-year-old named Pakize Ozer, who was seriously injured, according to CNN Turk. “The complainant suddenly appeared in front of me. Since the sun was coming from the opposite direction, I didn’t see exactly where she was coming from,” he said in his statement to prosecutors. In that report he said that Ozer was not in a pedestrian crosswalk and he denied that he was at fault.
Hussein’s father was in the passenger seat at the time. CNN Turk reported in December that Ozer was in hospital in life-threatening condition, but Hussein’s lawyer, Kerim Bahadır Seker, now says that she has since left hospital. He says his client is currently under house arrest and a travel ban prevents him from leaving the country.
Last month, he told CNN Turk that his client was not speeding or under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision.
Grainy videos purportedly showing security camera footage of each crash have been widely broadcast on Turkish media, which has heavily covered both incidents."
2403PTJM0V_A3VE1V3E10NCWL8,"China’s economy grew by about 5.2% in 2023, Premier Li says","By Laura He, CNN","3 minute read Updated 8:41 AM EST, Tue January 16, 2024",20240116,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/16/business/china-economy-li-qiang-davos-intl-hnk/,"China’s economy grew by about 5.2% in 2023, slightly better than the official target Beijing had set, Premier Li Qiang said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
“In the past year of 2023, China’s economy has generally rebounded and improved,” the country’s second highest official told the meeting of global business and political leaders.
The Chinese government had earlier said that it was targeting a growth rate of around 5% for 2023, and is set to announce its annual GDP figures for last year on Wednesday.
While this expansion would mark a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s economic worst performances in over three decades.
Barring the pandemic years through 2022, when China’s growth was disrupted by strict lockdowns and other restrictions, 5.2% is the country’s slowest pace of annual growth since 1990, when the economy expanded by 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
The country has been beset by a series of economic problems, including a real estate crisis, record youth unemployment, deflation, and a rapidly ageing population. International economists have widely projected China’s growth to slow to around 4.5% this year.
Those problems have sent investors rushing for the exits. China’s stock markets were the biggest losers in 2023. The country’s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell more than 11%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 14%. Meanwhile, the MSCI World index closed the year 22% higher, its biggest annual jump since 2019.
“Even if there are twists and turns in China’s economic operation, its overall long-term positive trend will not change,” said Li. The premier is the most senior Chinese leader to attend the Davos forum in person since President Xi Jinping in 2017.
Li also tried to reassure international investors, who have become increasingly wary of China’s tough business environment and slowing growth.
“Investing in the Chinese market is not a risk but an opportunity,” he said.
The country has about 400 million people in the middle-income group, and that number is expected to double to 800 million in the next 10 years, Li said.
“The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he added.
Ongoing urbanization will create huge demand in sectors such as housing, education, medical and elderly care, he said, adding that there are still nearly 300 million rural Chinese who will eventually migrate to cities.
There is also a lot of room for investments in upgrading urban transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, he noted.
Li also pledged to create “first-class” operating environment for international businesses in China.
“No matter how the world’s situation changes, China will adhere to its fundamental national policy of opening up, and its door will only get wider and wider,” he said.
His remarks come as Beijing intensifies its efforts to revive the economy and woo foreign investment back into the country. Foreign companies have grown wary of Beijing’s rising scrutiny and are pulling out. In the third quarter, a measure of foreign direct investment (FDI) into China turned negative for the first time since 1998.
On Monday, Li met with Swiss President Viola Amherd and said the two countries would deepen economic ties and start talks to upgrade their free-trade agreement, according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry.
In November, Xi visited the United States for the first time in more than six years, where he met with President Joe Biden to amend ties between the two countries. In a meeting with top American business executives, Xi pledged to make it easier for foreigners to invest and operate in his country.

2PFJXEGSJY_ULGM9WWX9O33QTU,Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China,"By Nectar Gan and Eric Cheung, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:01 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/us-unofficial-delegation-visit-taiwan-intl-hnk/,"Former senior US officials reaffirmed “rock solid” American support for Taiwan in a visit Monday after the self-ruled island defied threats from China by electing a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy, on Saturday won a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), shrugging off warnings from Beijing that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
In keeping with past US practice, the Biden administration dispatched an unofficial delegation to Taiwan following the election to meet the island’s current and incoming presidents. But the US reaction to the election has already sparked an angry response from China.
In a meeting with Taiwan’s incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, former US national security adviser Stephen Hadley congratulated Taiwan on the elections on behalf of the American people, praising the self-ruled island’s democracy as a “shining example for the world.”
Hadley reaffirmed that “the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan.”
“We look forward to continuity in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States under the new administration and for common efforts to preserve cross-strait peace and stability,” he said.
Nauru cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China
Former deputy secretary of state James Steinberg said the delegation traveled to Taiwan to “underscore the US bipartisan support for our long-standing friendship for Taiwan.”
During Tsai’s eight years in office, Taiwan has bolstered its ties with its democratic partners, especially the US, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
The delegation also met with Lai and Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim, a well-known figure in Washington after serving as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States.
In the meeting, Lai called the US “Taiwan’s most important partner,” and expressed gratitude for its long-standing support to the island.
Lai vowed to build on Tsai’s efforts to defend peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. “And we hope that the United States will continue to support Taiwan to deepen our cooperation in this area,” he said.
“I believe that our relationship will continue to flourish as we work together, and it will become an important force in defending peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added.
The visit came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday congratulated Lai on his win and Taiwan’s people “for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust democratic system and electoral process.”
In a statement, Blinken said the US looks forward to working with Lai and Taiwan’s leaders of all parties to “advance our shared interests and values, and to further our longstanding unofficial relationship.”
That statement prompted an angry response from Beijing, which views Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if necessary.
On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the statement “seriously violates the one-China principle” and US promises to only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
“It also sends a gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the US side,” the ministry said in a statement.
The Chinese embassies in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada also lashed out at their host countries for congratulating Lai on his victory.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa called Taiwan “an extremely crucial partner and an important friend” in her congratulatory message. The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it “resolutely opposed” her statement, which it blasted as “a serious interference in China’s internal affairs.”
Taiwan was a Japanese colony for half a century until 1945.
Under Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, and severed official communication with Taipei’s government since 2016. Lai’s election is unlikely to lead to a thawing of cross-strait ties any time soon.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. But it has long remained deliberately vague on whether it will come to Taiwan’s defense in case of a Chinese attack.
Asked by reporters to comment on Taiwan’s election results Saturday, US President Joe Biden said: “We do not support independence.”"

“My dream was to someday to return to Europe,” Meyer, 66, tells CNN. “Once remote work became standard and I sold my real estate in the US. I knew that relocation to Europe was a ‘now or never’ proposition.”
Her personal and professional travels had taken her to many countries in Europe throughout the years, but never Portugal.
While the sunny Mediterranean climate and Portugal’s laid-back vibe were part of the allure, Meyer was ready for a new chapter in her life.
Safety, quality of life, affordable medical care, and a relatively simple path to permanent residency and citizenship, were high on her list of priorities for her future country of residence, and Lisbon ticked all of her boxes.
Signs of the pandemic were still very evident when Meyer arrived in the Portuguese capital with five suitcases in tow in August 2021.
“Few hotels and restaurants open, a fraction of the number of usual tourists, mask-wearing the norm, I felt like I had Lisbon to myself,” she says.
Meyer rented an apartment for three months in Lisbon at first. But after exploring the area, she fell in love with the charms of nearby Cascais, a former fishing village that has been luring many expats recently.
This US couple sold their house and moved to Italy for good
She was struck by Cascais’ unplugged and somewhat sleepy feel, which was something she wasn’t accustomed to, and the fact that locals didn’t seem to use mobile phones at the market or cafes.
“Here, time stands still, and people relish time together,” she says. “Things take longer. In place of any sense of urgency you find a happier, more laid-back lifestyle.
“But one that can be very frustrating to Americans addicted to frenetic beats and trapped in the rat race.”
She says she was taken aback by the genuineness of the Portuguese people, their pride and joy in learning that an expat had chosen their country as a new home, and their willingness to help when she was struggling to communicate.
“Portuguese is a very difficult language to learn, but they are always willing to help with pronunciations and usage,” she says. “It is very much a welcoming culture.”
Later that year, Meyer bought a 95-square-meter, two-bedroom, split-level apartment with a roof terrace in a quiet neighborhood, close to cafés and cultural attractions.
Situated on a hill above the center of town, it offers striking views stretching from Cascais Bay and the ocean to the famous mountains and palaces of Sintra.
The purchase price was 595,000 euros (around $651,000). Even though Portugal saw an overall property price increase of 13.8% in 2021, with prices continuing to rise in the years since then, Meyer estimates that an apartment in a similar spot in California would have cost her at least triple.
Fortunately, Meyer was able to benefit from Portugal’s “golden visa” system, a five-year residence by investment program aimed at non-EU nationals, which is no longer available for real estate purchases.
To qualify, applicants were required to make a real estate purchase of a minimum of 500,000 euros ($547,000.)
The golden visa grants her visa-free travel through Europe’s Schengen Area. She also has the option to apply for Portuguese citizenship after holding a golden visa for five years, according to a recently amended law aimed at speeding up procedures.
They sold everything to become a digital nomad family. Here’s what happened next
But for Meyer, one of the cons to moving to a destination with such a slower-paced lifestyle has been getting through red tape, and she faced a wait of around two years to obtain her residency due to the Portugal’s previous long approval process.
“Word of mouth from others who have been through it reigns supreme,” she says. “And my advice would be to find a good attorney.”
Meyer says that Cascais’ strong sense of community played a part in her decision to build her new life there.
“People are very social and family-oriented,” she says. “On weekends I meet friends at the popular mercado, where, in addition to a farmers’ market, butchers, cheese and fishmongers, crafts, stands with clothing and household goods for sale, you can socialize and just watch the world go by.”
Savoring a creamy pastel de nata (egg or custard tarts) or a tosta mista (a grilled sandwich) at one of the local pastelaria shops is also a popular pastime here.
According to Meyer, the quality and speed of service in restaurants and hotels is slower than in the US, and deliveries and home repairs are also likely to take longer.
“On the upside, a restaurant server would never, ever present a bill without a customer asking for it,” she adds.
“That would be considered rude, even with a line of customers waiting for a table. And you won’t see people eating or drinking on the go, as you would in the US.”
Meyer has noticed that the absence of a tipping culture in Portugal is something that Americans find difficult to grasp.
“A small tip is always appreciated for good service and overall experience,” she adds. “But not mandatory. Americans over-tipping can even be considered rather vulgar in some circles.”
She’s picked up some local habits, like forsaking a clothes dryer, considered “the Portuguese way.”
However, Meyer hasn’t been able to give up air-conditioning – a 2022 study by real estate platform Idealista found that only one in four properties on the market in Portugal had air conditioning – and has a unit installed at her home.
Adapting to the local climate has also meant learning to deal with the high coastal humidity and the propensity for mold in winter.
“Due to different building standards than those we are accustomed to in the US, dampness and mold is common,” says Meyer.
“I’ve learned to live with various dehumidifying devices and the frequent airing out of my apartment during winter months. Just part of the new routine.”
Meyer’s also had to adapt to the intricately-designed cobblestones on the sidewalks of Portugal – calcada portuguesa – which can be “beautiful to the eye but treacherous to the body.”
“I slipped and fell on these slick stones several times when I first arrived, and quickly learned that this is simply a rite of passage,” she says, adding that she now wears sneakers to tackle them. “In Portugal, it’s function over style in the shoe department.”
She’s also had to get used to the Portuguese queuing systems. The phrase, “take a number,” has all-new meaning in Portugal, says Meyer.
“To get served at post offices, hospitals and pharmacies requires you go to a machine for a senha, a piece of paper containing a code indicating your place in line,” she explains.
“You may proceed to a desk only once your number is illuminated on a screen and called.”
However, Meyers feels that the affordable cost of living in Portugal outweighs any challenges, even though prices have risen in the years since she’s been there.
“When I arrived an Uber ride within the greater Cascais area started at 1.50 euros (around $1.64),” she says. “Today that is closer to 3.50 euros or 4 euros (about $4.38.)
“Recently, I had friends tell me that a round trip Uber ride they took in NYC – from Lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side – was $100, including tip, of course. Sticker shock is common for anyone living in Portugal and returning to the US.”
Back in late 2021, Meyer says that lunch for two (a fish, steak or stew main, vegetable and potatoes, two glasses of wine, bread and bottled water) would cost her 16 euros (around $17.50.) More recently, the price was 22 euros (around $24,) which she still considers to be a relative bargain.
Although Meyer has adapted well, she says she’s still trying to fully absorb the Cascais vibe and feel like a local.
“When living outside of the US, I consider myself first and foremost a foreigner,” she says.
“I know that I must adapt to a new and different culture, not vice versa. Embracing that mindset is fundamental to living abroad.”
Meyer gets homesick from time to time, but says she has no plans to return to the US, and wouldn’t swap her new life for anything.
“I miss my friends and family in the US, but living in a safe, peaceful, affordable and eye-opening environment is an indisputable trade-off,” she says.
“Portugal is a pretty wonderful travel destination – and I’ve had more US visitors these past two years than I probably would have had time to see if I were still living in the US.”"
6IA7G22N98_2RSYHECX5NK7EI9,"Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?","By Nectar Gan, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:58 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240114,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/14/asia/profile-lai-ching-te-taiwan-new-president-intl-hnk/,"Lai Ching-te, a former doctor from a poor mining family, was propelled into politics by a military crisis in the Taiwan Strait 27 years ago.
Now, the soft-spoken political veteran is tasked with preventing another one from happening as the newly elected leader of the self-ruled island that China’s Communist Party has vowed to one day absorb.
On Saturday, Lai, 64, the current vice president from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won a widely watched election to become Taiwan’s next president.
His victory handed the DPP a historic third consecutive term, delivering a snub to years of growing threats from Taiwan’s much-larger authoritarian neighbor, China.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
Lai, who has long faced Beijing’s wrath for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty, said as president he has “an important responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” pledging to pursue dialogue with China under the principles of dignity and parity.
“At the same time, we’re also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China,” he told reporters ahead of his victory speech.
Under leader Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan, which it views as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary.
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait are at their highest since 1996, when China fired missiles into waters off Taiwan’s coast to intimidate voters ahead of the island’s first free presidential election – after the nascent democracy emerged from decades of its own authoritarian rule.
For Lai, then a fresh-faced doctor at a university hospital in the southern city of Tainan, that missile crisis became his “defining moment.”
“I decided I had a duty to participate in Taiwan’s democracy and help protect this fledgling experiment from those who wished it harm,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal last year.
Lai hung up his white coat to run for office – first becoming a legislator, then a popular two-term mayor of Tainan, before serving as the premier and – since 2020 – the vice president of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen.
The doctor-turned politician has now broken the “eight-year curse” of Taiwan politics – a popular term nodding to the fact that, until Lai’s victory, no political party had ever stayed in power for more than two terms since Taiwan became a democracy.
Lai called his foray into politics an “unexpected journey.”
Growing up in poverty in a mining village near the northern coast of Taiwan, Lai had dreamed of becoming a doctor since childhood. He had five siblings, and his mother raised them alone by doing odd jobs. His father, a coal miner, died in a work accident when Lai was a small child.
Lai was too young to remember his father. “But one day I suddenly realized, the biggest asset my father left me was that my family was poor,” he said at an event in March last year.
“Growing up in such a family, we will be more mature, have more willpower, and have more courage to overcome difficulties.”
After completing a bachelor’s degree in physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei, Lai went to Tainan for medical school.
He was a few years into a promising career as a physician in Tainan when a local DPP official approached him. He asked the popular doctor to help a DPP politician campaign for local elections.
It was 1994, less than a decade after the DPP first emerged from Taiwan’s democracy movement against the authoritarian rule of the Kuomintang (KMT).
Before lifting martial law in 1987 and transitioning slowly toward free elections, the KMT ruled Taiwan with an iron fist for nearly four decades after fleeing to the island from mainland China after losing the civil war to the Communist forces there.
Tens of thousands of political opponents were killed or jailed during what came to be known as the “White Terror” and the DPP was formed by many veterans of those who had campaigned for democracy.
While Lai was in college in Taipei, he and his roommates had closely followed news of the KMT’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. “I was full of doubts and concerns for the future of this country,” he said in video released by his presidential election campaign.
Lai agreed to help the DPP with the local election, but the candidate lost in the end.
A year later, some democracy activists invited Lai to join the DPP to run for the legislature.
He initially rejected the idea. “I was born and raised in a rural, impoverished place, and I had always wanted to be a doctor. Now, I’ve finally made it this far to become a chief physician,” he said in the campaign video.
But his political friends refused to give up. Months later, crisis flared in the Taiwan Strait as China held live-fire exercises and fired missiles toward Taiwan, giving Lai a final push across the line.
“Instead of criticizing the ruling government at the time from my clinic, wouldn’t it be better to come out and follow the vanguards of the democratic movement and actually do something for Taiwan?” he said in the video.
“I also thought that in this life, if I could find a project that makes me feel passionate to embark on, it would be a life worth living.”
In the lead-up to the election, China made no secret of its desire to prevent a Lai victory.
Chinese officials repeatedly framed the vote as a choice between “peace and war” – echoing a talking point of the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih, Beijing’s preferred candidate – while railing against Lai for triggering “cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
Hailing from a more radical wing of the DPP, Lai was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence – a red line for Beijing.
His views tempered as he rose through the ranks. But China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a “practical worker for Taiwan independence.”
Lai now says he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country” so there is “no plan or need” to declare independence.
That deliberately nuanced stance mimics his outgoing predecessor Tsai, Taiwan’s first female president, who was unable to stand again because of term limits.
Beijing cut off official communications with Taipei after Tsai took office in 2016 and ramped up its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally, something that looks set to continue when Lai is inaugurated and fully takes over in May.
In many ways Beijing’s rhetoric towards Lai is even more hostile than how it viewed Tsai.
China’s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, “troublemaker” and “war maker,” while rejecting his repeated offers for talks.
One such offer was made to China’s top leader, Xi.
In May last year, at a quick-fire Q&A session with students at his alma mater, National Taiwan University, Lai named Xi as the head of state he would most like to have dinner with.
If he had a chance to dine with Xi, Lai said, he would advise the Chinese leader to “chill out a little.”
“No need to be so stressed,” he said.
Asked about Lai’s invitation, Beijing said his comments were “weird” and accused Lai of “trying to put on the cloak of goodwill” given that his “Taiwan independence nature” had not changed.
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who was elected vice president Saturday, was also openly loathed by Beijing. Hsiao, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was sanctioned twice by China for being a “diehard secessionist.”
Lai earned more than 40 percent of the popular vote, while the KMT scooped up 33 percent and a newer opposition party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), racked up 26 percent.
The DPP lost its majority in the legislature, taking 51 of the 113 seats, meaning Lai may find himself more constrained than Tsai and needing to rely on political alliances to pass legislation.
Hours after Lai declared victory, China dismissed the outcome of Taiwan’s elections, saying the DPP “does not represent mainstream public opinion” on the island.
“Taiwan is China’s Taiwan,” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement on Saturday night.
“This election cannot change the shared hope from compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to get closer and closer, it moreover cannot stop the inevitable destiny that our motherland will be united.”
But that assertion could not be further from Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion.
Under Xi’s strongarm tactics, Taiwan’s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10 percent now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3 percent identify primarily as Chinese.
The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing.
“We have been bullied for years on end. I just can’t stand kneeling down to their demands and their meddling with our elections. We want to keep our free style of living and our democracy,” Yang Wei-ting, a 27-year-old civil servant, said amid cheers and celebrations at Lai’s rally.
“I think the most important part for us is to work with like-minded partners around the globe, and tell China that we’re not alone and we’re not scared. We’re standing in the face of an authoritarian regime, but we’re backed by many like-minded countries.”

According to FlightAware, the plane was in the air for 14 minutes. The incident apparently started about three minutes into the flight. The crew reported an engine fire, according to air traffic recordings.
“Mayday, mayday, giant 095 heavy, engine fire. Request vectors back to the airport,” the crew said, according to audio posted on LiveATC.net.
An FAA incident report says the flight’s No. 2 engine failed. That is the inboard engine on the left wing of a Boeing 747.
A “post flight inspection revealed a softball size hole above #2 engine,” the report says.
The ordeal sent sparks flying through the night sky over Miami.

Melanie Adaros was walking near her home in Miami’s Kendall neighborhood around 10:40 p.m. when she looked up and saw fire and sparks coming from a plane’s engine.
“It was very frightening,” she told CNN. “I couldn’t tell if the plane was going down.”
It’s unclear whether the sparks were caused by an issue with the plane or something external.
Atlas Air said the crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to Miami International Airport. The plane landed around 11 p.m. Thursday.
Atlas Air will conduct an inspection to determine the cause of the issue, and the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate.
“NTSB has opened an investigation and is collecting information to evaluate and determine scope of the investigation,” the agency said in a statement to CNN. “No further information to release at this time.”
The aircraft is a Boeing 747-8 built in 2015, according to FAA data. In a statement to CNN, Boeing said it is “supporting our customer and will support the NTSB investigation into this incident.”

8KN4L5WGN9_K97Q645HXL4W19A,China says it’s easier than ever for Americans to visit the country,"By Lilit Marcus and Veronica Lin, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:50 PM EST, Tue January 9, 2024",20240110,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/american-tourist-visas-china-intl-hnk/,"For years, Americans interested in visiting China had to endure a thorough visa process, which required pre-booking hotels and flights and handing their passports over to an embassy or consulate for an undetermined period.
But as of January 1, 2024, some of those restrictions have dropped or loosened, making it easier than ever for US citizens to obtain a Chinese tourist visa.
Americans have the seventh most powerful passport in the world, meaning there are a whopping 187 countries and territories that US citizens can visit either without a visa or by getting one immediately on arrival – a list that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, but not mainland China.
Elsewhere in the region, US passport holders can visit Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore on vacation visa-free for 30-90 days.
As a result, China has been further down the bucket list for many American travelers, who considered the country “too hard” to visit.
China tries to lure foreign tourists with expanded visa-free scheme after weak post-pandemic bounce back
Now, Americans who want to get a Chinese tourist visa (L-visa) no longer have to submit proof of a round-trip flight booking, a hotel reservation, an organized itinerary or a letter of invitation.
The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the newly relaxed guidelines on December 29, 2023, citing the desire “to further facilitate people-to-people exchanges.”
State-run media outlet Xinhua also reported that the Civil Aviation Administration of China plans to increase nonstop flights between the two countries.
Sam Fleischmann, a Pittsburgh-based education consultant planning to visit China in April, said he’s more inclined to do so now that certain restrictions have been lifted.
“If I’m in a city to do consultancy for two weeks, but I have other opportunities to go to a different city, it’s nice to have the flexibility that I don’t need my return ticket,” says Fleischmann. “I think spontaneous travel is one of the most beautiful things about traveling.”
For his next trip to Hong Kong, he’s considering staying in Shanghai for a few days thanks to the six-day visa-free transit policy, where citizens of 53 countries can enter and stay in designated cities and provinces in China without a visa if they meet certain criteria.
It’s not just Americans who stand to benefit from China opening up.
In November, China announced a trial program to allow visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia to enter visa-free for 15 days.
Soon after, China and Thailand announced intentions of a reciprocal visa-free program, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry said would “serve the fundamental interests of both peoples.”
Visas weren’t the only challenge for Western tourists going to China that the country has addressed.
Last year, the country’s main digital payment systems, WeChat Pay and Alipay, opened up to users with non-Chinese credit cards and bank accounts, thus eliminating a major pain point for foreign visitors.

Since last July, visitors have also been able to link their Visa and Mastercard accounts to China’s most popular mobile payment platforms – allowing them to book taxis, ride the subway and pay for goods and services at millions of outlets across the near-cashless country, though a fee may be added for larger transactions.
However, one thing that hasn’t eased is the US State Department’s guidance on going to China. It lists China as a level three or “orange” country, which means “reconsider travel.”
The guidance reads: “Reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.”
China enforced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns during the pandemic, which battered the economy. The consequences of these policies can be seen in the slowdown and dismal economic results last year.
“The impact of Covid lockdowns communicated to the rest of the world in the sense that China was closed and closing off, and so by changing these rules, it sends the message that it’s opening back up,” says Hong Kong University tourism professor Benjamin Iaquinto.
“The economy in China is not doing so well. And this is probably going to help contribute to boosting it back up again, there are also concerns with its international reputation,” he added.
However, according to Iaquinto, geopolitical tensions – including “volatile” US-China relations – mean that these changes might not be permanent.
“If there’s some type of blowup between the two countries, not necessarily in terms of war, but some type of political argument,” he said, “that might result in China responding by reversing those changes.”

The event, which raised €1.31m in total, was attended by US Climate Envoy John Kerry along with many other climate action visionaries. Art pieces and unique jewelry were also auctioned off.
“Amidst the ongoing fight against pollution, I also witness the progress that has been achieved. We have come a long way. Today, so many people are here to be part of the solution,” Schwarzenegger said at the dinner. “I extend my gratitude to everyone who has joined my fight against pollution.”
Schwarzenegger is facing criminal tax proceedings for failing to declare the Audemars Piguet watch to customs officers in Munich after he got off a flight from Los Angeles, a Munich Customs press officer told CNN Wednesday.
“He did not declare a product. A product that was imported from non-EU countries in order to remain in the EU. And this process applies to everyone,” press officer Thomas Meister said.
Meister said the former California governor and “Terminator” star was released and traveled on after being held for over two hours.
The actor agreed to pre-pay potential taxes on the watch but the officers failed to get a credit card machine to work for an hour until they gave up and brought him to a bank and asked him to withdraw cash from an ATM to pay, a source close to the actor told CNN.
The ATM they brought him to had a limit that was too low, and the bank was closed.
When he returned, a new officer brought a new credit card machine that worked, the source added.

Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was handed a 2.5-year sentence on Tuesday which was commuted to a fine of 27,300 Turkish Liras ($910 USD) after he accepted the charge of “reckless killing” for fatally striking Yunus Emre Gocer, a married father of two, in late November, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber.
The case initially sparked controversy in Turkey after Mohamud left the country following the deadly incident, prompting criticism of perceived inaction by police and prosecutors. An arrest warrant for Mohamud was dropped when he returned to Turkey in order to give a statement in court on Friday, according to TRT.
Mohamud was not required to be in court on Tuesday when the verdict in the case was read. He was originally handed a 3-year prison sentence, which was decreased to 2.5 years for “good conduct,” according to TRT. According to Turkish penal code, the court can opt to convert a sentence of that length to a fine, which it did, sparing Mohamud any prison time. His driver’s license will also be cancelled for six months, according to TRT.
Iyaz Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN that his clients had agreed to drop their formal complaint against Mohamud. He would not say what, if any, deal with Mohamud prompted that decision, or whether the family would be financially compensated.
Mohamud’s case is one of two incidents involving the sons of prominent foreign officials that have raised questions about fairness in the justice system. In December, there was a second collision allegedly involving the son of a former Yemeni defense minister, who police say hit two pedestrians. One of the victims was seriously injured.
The two cases have no direct connection to one another, beyond the coincidental timing, and the harsh public spotlight cast on both – especially after early missteps and discrepancies by police and prosecutors in the first.
According to Turkish police, 40-year-old Mohamud, the son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was behind the wheel of a black BMW with diplomatic plates in southwest Istanbul when it struck Gocer, a delivery driver on a scooter, on November 30.
According to a statement from the prosecutor, Gocer died on December 6 and “therefore the nature of the crime changed” from the charge of “reckless injury” to “reckless killing.” Two days later, an arrest warrant was issued.

Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN in December that Mohamud had left the country on December 2, before the warrant was issued.
Cimen had previously told CNN that the initial police report suggested the victim had made an illegal lane change, but only after public scrutiny, and after the victim died and the charge became more serious, did a subsequent report cast doubt on the initial police assessment of what happened. That second report, written by independent experts, says that the “primarily negligent party” was Mohamud.
A third report, meant to resolve discrepancies between the initial police report and the subsequent expert report, produced a more mixed result. Published December 18 by the Traffic Specialization Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute, it affirmed that Mohamud was “primarily at fault,” but also found that Gocer was also “secondarily at fault.” The report says that Gocer was in front of Mohamud in the second-to-right lane, while Mohamud was behind in the right lane.
Gocer slowed to change lanes to the right, and that’s when he was hit. It blames Mohamud for failing to hit the brakes and slow down, but it also blames Gocer for failing to adequately check his mirrors to see Mohamud behind him and slowing to a stop on a road with a speed limit of 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
The perceived initial failings quickly led to public outrage, with motorcycle drivers and couriers staging a protest in December calling for justice for Gocer.
Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said in December that he was glad the prosecutor’s office had issued the arrest warrant. The mayor had written on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the prosecutor’s office would need to explain discrepancies between the initial police report and the latest statement “which allowed the suspect to flee abroad.”
CNN reached out to the Somali consulate for comment in December but did not receive a response. In an interview with the Associated Press published December 14, the Somali president denied that his son had fled the country, saying that he left because he had business elsewhere and there was no arrest warrant for him. President Mohamud told the AP he was sorry for Gocer’s family for his loss, and said that he has advised his son to go back to Turkey for court proceedings. “The decision is his — but I am giving that advice,” he said.
At the time, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters in Ankara he had personally spoken with the Somali justice minister.
“In the coming days, the defendant will come to Turkey and participate in the trial process,” he said, according to Anadolu. “”We will never allow any of our citizens to lose their rights and legal interests in favor of a foreigner. We will follow the incident to the end. We will work for justice to prevail.”

In the second, separate incident in early December in central Istanbul, Musaeed Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, the son of Yemen’s former Defense Minister Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, was behind the wheel of a vehicle that hit two people as they were crossing the street, according to the statement Hussein gave to prosecutors.One of them was a 71-year-old named Pakize Ozer, who was seriously injured, according to CNN Turk. “The complainant suddenly appeared in front of me. Since the sun was coming from the opposite direction, I didn’t see exactly where she was coming from,” he said in his statement to prosecutors. In that report he said that Ozer was not in a pedestrian crosswalk and he denied that he was at fault.
Hussein’s father was in the passenger seat at the time. CNN Turk reported in December that Ozer was in hospital in life-threatening condition, but Hussein’s lawyer, Kerim Bahadır Seker, now says that she has since left hospital. He says his client is currently under house arrest and a travel ban prevents him from leaving the country.
Last month, he told CNN Turk that his client was not speeding or under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision.
Grainy videos purportedly showing security camera footage of each crash have been widely broadcast on Turkish media, which has heavily covered both incidents."

According to FlightAware, the plane was in the air for 14 minutes. The incident apparently started about three minutes into the flight. The crew reported an engine fire, according to air traffic recordings.
“Mayday, mayday, giant 095 heavy, engine fire. Request vectors back to the airport,” the crew said, according to audio posted on LiveATC.net.
An FAA incident report says the flight’s No. 2 engine failed. That is the inboard engine on the left wing of a Boeing 747.
A “post flight inspection revealed a softball size hole above #2 engine,” the report says.
The ordeal sent sparks flying through the night sky over Miami.

Melanie Adaros was walking near her home in Miami’s Kendall neighborhood around 10:40 p.m. when she looked up and saw fire and sparks coming from a plane’s engine.
“It was very frightening,” she told CNN. “I couldn’t tell if the plane was going down.”
It’s unclear whether the sparks were caused by an issue with the plane or something external.
Atlas Air said the crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to Miami International Airport. The plane landed around 11 p.m. Thursday.
Atlas Air will conduct an inspection to determine the cause of the issue, and the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate.
“NTSB has opened an investigation and is collecting information to evaluate and determine scope of the investigation,” the agency said in a statement to CNN. “No further information to release at this time.”

CPNVYOB5Q4_7NZ75MXVB9GE3Z2,Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China,"By Nectar Gan and Eric Cheung, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:01 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/us-unofficial-delegation-visit-taiwan-intl-hnk/,"Former senior US officials reaffirmed “rock solid” American support for Taiwan in a visit Monday after the self-ruled island defied threats from China by electing a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy, on Saturday won a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), shrugging off warnings from Beijing that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
In keeping with past US practice, the Biden administration dispatched an unofficial delegation to Taiwan following the election to meet the island’s current and incoming presidents. But the US reaction to the election has already sparked an angry response from China.
In a meeting with Taiwan’s incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, former US national security adviser Stephen Hadley congratulated Taiwan on the elections on behalf of the American people, praising the self-ruled island’s democracy as a “shining example for the world.”
Hadley reaffirmed that “the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan.”
“We look forward to continuity in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States under the new administration and for common efforts to preserve cross-strait peace and stability,” he said.

Former deputy secretary of state James Steinberg said the delegation traveled to Taiwan to “underscore the US bipartisan support for our long-standing friendship for Taiwan.”
During Tsai’s eight years in office, Taiwan has bolstered its ties with its democratic partners, especially the US, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
The delegation also met with Lai and Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim, a well-known figure in Washington after serving as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States.
In the meeting, Lai called the US “Taiwan’s most important partner,” and expressed gratitude for its long-standing support to the island.
Lai vowed to build on Tsai’s efforts to defend peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. “And we hope that the United States will continue to support Taiwan to deepen our cooperation in this area,” he said.
“I believe that our relationship will continue to flourish as we work together, and it will become an important force in defending peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added.
The visit came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday congratulated Lai on his win and Taiwan’s people “for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust democratic system and electoral process.”
In a statement, Blinken said the US looks forward to working with Lai and Taiwan’s leaders of all parties to “advance our shared interests and values, and to further our longstanding unofficial relationship.”
That statement prompted an angry response from Beijing, which views Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if necessary.
On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the statement “seriously violates the one-China principle” and US promises to only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
“It also sends a gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the US side,” the ministry said in a statement.
The Chinese embassies in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada also lashed out at their host countries for congratulating Lai on his victory.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa called Taiwan “an extremely crucial partner and an important friend” in her congratulatory message. The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it “resolutely opposed” her statement, which it blasted as “a serious interference in China’s internal affairs.”
Taiwan was a Japanese colony for half a century until 1945.
Under Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, and severed official communication with Taipei’s government since 2016. Lai’s election is unlikely to lead to a thawing of cross-strait ties any time soon.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. But it has long remained deliberately vague on whether it will come to Taiwan’s defense in case of a Chinese attack.
Asked by reporters to comment on Taiwan’s election results Saturday, US President Joe Biden said: “We do not support independence.”"

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, handed down the fine to Google, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL), in 2017 for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.
Juliane Kokott, Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European Union, said judges should confirm the fine.
“Google … was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favor its own comparison shopping service by favoring the display of its results,” she said.
Judges, who follow the majority of such non-binding recommendations, will rule in the coming months.

Google said it would review the opinion and wait for the court ruling.
Irrespective of its appeal, the company continues “to invest in our remedy, which has been working successfully for several years, and will continue to work constructively with the European Commission,” a spokesperson said.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is scheduled to meet Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and other Big Tech leaders in the United States later on Thursday to discuss competition and digital issues.

FY9FVZQY0B_EZR5OKEQL42U4TF,Why are Iran and Pakistan striking each other’s territory – and what does it have to do with the Middle East?,"By Sophia Saifi, Adam Pourahmadi, Azaz Syed and Jessie Yeung, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:34 PM EST, Thu January 18, 2024",20240118,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/18/world/iran-pakistan-attacks-tensions-explainer-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan and Iran have both conducted strikes on each other’s territories in an unprecedented escalation of hostilities between the neighbors, at a time when tensions have risen sharply across the Middle East and beyond.
The two countries share a volatile border, stretching about 900 kilometers (560 miles), with Pakistan’s Balochistan province on one side and Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province on the other.
Both nations have long fought militants in the restive Baloch region along the border. But while the two countries share a common separatist enemy, it is highly unusual for either side to attack militants on each other’s soil.
The latest strikes come as Iran’s allies and proxies in the Middle East – the so-called axis of resistance – launch attacks on Israeli forces and its allies against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Here’s what you need to know.
The opening salvo in this fast-moving sequence of events began Tuesday when Iran conducted strikes on Pakistan’s Balochistan province – killing two children and wounding several others, according to Pakistani authorities.
Iran claimed it had “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that no Pakistani nationals were targeted.
But the attack sparked anger in Pakistan, which called the strike “an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran.”
Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency said it had been targeting strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, or Army of Justice.
The separatist militant group operates on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its ultimate goal is independence for Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is majority Sunni – the dominant branch of Islam – while Iran and its “axis of resistance” is largely Shia.
Pakistan struck back two days later with what it called a “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” on several alleged separatist hideouts in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Announcing the strikes on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said a number of militants were killed. At least 10 people — all Pakistani nationals — were killed, Tasnim reported, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan, who said authorities were investigating how those people had “settled in the village.”
Pakistan said it had for years complained that separatist fighters had “safe havens and sanctuaries” in Iran – and was forced to take matters into its own hands with Thursday’s strikes.
Pakistan and Iran’s struggle against separatists operating on either side of each other’s borders is not new.
Deadly clashes along the turbulent border have happened regularly over the years. Just last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in Sistan and Baluchestan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
What is highly unusual, however, is each side’s willingness to hit targets across those borders, without informing each other first. And all this is happening against the backdrop of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has sent repercussions coursing through the region.
The larger regional conflict may have emboldened Iran to be more proactive in pursuing targets beyond its borders, experts say – especially as the United States walks a tightrope between de-escalating hostilities and flexing its own military might to deter further moves by Iran.

The day before the strikes in Pakistan, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Iraq and Syria, claiming to be targeting a spy base for Israeli forces and “anti-Iran terror groups.”
Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah across the Lebanon border; and the US is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea in the name of revenge for Israel’s assault on Gaza.
“If you don’t censure Iran and its proxies … then there’s no cost for them to continue to pursue those activities,” said Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He added that Iran’s dominant position in the Middle East, in contrast to conflict-ridden nations like Yemen and Syria, means it stands to gain from regional instability and “filling power vacuums.” And Iran’s activities now serve to further several of its main goals, which include empowering Palestinians and counteracting American influence in the Middle East, he said.
Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the various hostilities reflect Iran “striving to cement its role as a leader in the region.”
“It’s seeking regional hegemony,” he told CNN. “And when the United States and Israel are there, and Israel’s waging this campaign against Hamas, then Iran feels the need to strike back and assert itself.”
The Baloch people, also spelled Baluch, live where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran meet. They have long exhibited a fiercely independent streak and always resented being ruled by both Islamabad and Tehran, with insurgencies bubbling across the porous border region for decades.
The area they live in is also rich in natural resources, but Baloch separatists complain that their people, some of the region’s poorest, have seen little wealth trickle down to their communities.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has witnessed a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, fueled by a decades-long insurgency by separatists who demand independence from the country, angered by what they say is the state’s monopoly and exploitation of the region’s mineral resources.
Iran has also faced a long history of insurgencies from its Kurdish, Arab and Baloch minorities.
Jaish al-Adl is just one of many separatist groups operating within Iran. It was originally part of a larger Sunni militant group called Jundallah, which fractured after its leader was executed by Iran in 2010, according to the US government’s National Counterterrorism Center. Jaish al-Adl emerged instead and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department.
The group often targets Iranian security personnel, government officials, and Shia civilians, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.
In 2015, the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed eight Iranian border guards, with militants reportedly crossing into Iran from Pakistan. And in 2019, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a bus carrying members of the Iranian military, killing at least 23 in Sistan-Baluchestan.
On Wednesday, a day after Iran’s strikes on Pakistan, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian military vehicle in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Iran’s strikes on Tuesday sparked a diplomatic spat, with Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and suspending all high-level visits from its neighbor.
And after Pakistan’s strikes, Iran on Thursday demanded “an immediate explanation” from its neighbor, Tasnim reported – and the Iranian military conducted a large-scale exercise off the country’s southwest coast, involving the air force, naval forces and ground forces.
Nearby nations have weighed in, with Turkey’s foreign minister holding calls with his counterparts in both Iran and Pakistan. Afterward, he said neither country wanted to escalate tensions further.
India said it has “zero tolerance towards terrorism,” and that the attack was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan.” China urged both nations to exercise restraint, and the European Union said it was “gravely concerned by the spiral of violence in the Middle East and beyond.”
US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller also urged restraint on Thursday – but added he didn’t think the flare-up was “in any way, shape or form connected to Gaza.”
“But whenever you see things, see strikes in the region, given the tensions in the region, there is the risk for increase in conflict, which is something that we’re trying to avoid,” he said.
It is not clear whether either Iran or Pakistan would want to descend into full-blown hostilities over separatist groups that they both regard as an enemy.
Both sides issued statements after their respective strikes that hinted at a desire not to see things escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry called Iran a “brotherly country” and emphasized the need to “find joint solutions.”
That echoed the Iranian foreign minister, who called Pakistan a “friendly country” earlier this week and said their strikes were proportionate and only aimed at militants."
GEO3DUH0CZ_NA4STEQ83X7AEE7,South Africa accuses Israel of genocide and urges top UN court to halt Gaza war,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 10:12 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240111,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/,"South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and calling for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

H099GBH0II_FSPMF2F1I1WPI6T,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:57 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/us/texas-border-patrol-us-mexico/,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
2 children and a woman drowned in the Rio Grande, authorities say, days after Texas blocked the feds amid migrant crisis
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
What we know about the drownings of 3 Mexican migrants near Eagle Pass, Texas
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”
The Texas Military Department, meanwhile, said by the time Border Patrol agents requested access to the site Friday night, “the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site.”
“At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the US during this period,” the Texas Military Department said. “Also, at no point was TMD made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park, nor was TMD made aware of any bodies being discovered on the US side of the border regarding this situation.”
The federal-state border standoff in Texas has prompted members of a kind of group known for using demonizing rhetoric and intersecting with extremists to issue a call on social media for people to travel to Eagle Pass in protest.
The group is urging “patriots” from across the country to go to Eagle Pass “to demand that elected officials honor their oath of office to defend the border against a ‘foreign invasion,’” according to a member’s online video that employs the term far-right groups use for the border crisis.
A property owner will let the group set up tents, campers and RVs, he says.
These “patriots,” however, are misinformed about border security and immigration policy, said Texas state Rep. Eddie Morales Jr., a Democrat who represents 11 counties in West Texas, including the city of Eagle Pass. Instead, they should camp outside Congress and demand lawmakers act on immigration, he said.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives right now, if they were truly interested in solving this issue, they would fast track a border immigration and a border security bill by tomorrow,” Morales said.
Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber is monitoring the potential arrival this weekend of people from around the country and is concerned for the safety and security of the area due to the heated rhetoric on immigration, he told CNN.
Groups like this one that use “patriot” as part of their names have emerged since 2020 in an effort to get Donald Trump to form a third major political party, the Anti-Defamation League told CNN in a statement. While such groups are not inherently extremist, they engage in demonizing rhetoric, far-right policy causes and at times intersect with extremist groups and movements, it said.
A state away, Louisiana’s new Republican governor has directed state agencies to report any arrests of or funds spent on undocumented immigrants, he mandated in an executive order signed Friday.
﻿“The cost of illegal immigration in this state is falling on the shoulders of hard-working Louisianans,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement Tuesday. “This Executive Order will analyze data to determine the financial burden our citizens are being forced to carry because of those who do not follow the law.”
“Louisiana will always welcome those who legally immigrate, but taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill for individuals who break the law and skip the line.”
The heads of every executive branch in the state must provide within 120 days a report to the governor’s office detailing any use “of public funds directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of illegal aliens,” the order says.
The governor directs the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police to provide monthly reports on the number of people “charged or convicted of a criminal offense” and to note whether they are documented or undocumented, according to the order.
Law enforcement is also directed in the order to “regularly publish” to the public data regarding “arrests and convictions of illegal aliens,” their nationality, their offense, whether charged or convicted and report any “known or suspected gang affiliation” for arrested undocumented immigrants and where they were arrested.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

HYWMZUN1N4_L8K6ZDJAMQ2EA69,Why this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal,"By Silvia Marchetti, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:54 AM EST, Tue January 16, 2024",20240116,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/american-woman-ditched-us-portugal/,"Moving to a foreign country can be a scary decision. Particularly if it’s a country you’ve never even visited.
In 2021, Katie Meyer, a global hospitality communications professional from California, chose to do just that.
Meyer, who had previously lived and worked in London before returning to the US, relocated to Portugal during the Covid-19 pandemic, settling in the idyllic seaside resort of Cascais, close to Lisbon.
“My dream was to someday to return to Europe,” Meyer, 66, tells CNN. “Once remote work became standard and I sold my real estate in the US. I knew that relocation to Europe was a ‘now or never’ proposition.”
Her personal and professional travels had taken her to many countries in Europe throughout the years, but never Portugal.
While the sunny Mediterranean climate and Portugal’s laid-back vibe were part of the allure, Meyer was ready for a new chapter in her life.
Safety, quality of life, affordable medical care, and a relatively simple path to permanent residency and citizenship, were high on her list of priorities for her future country of residence, and Lisbon ticked all of her boxes.
Signs of the pandemic were still very evident when Meyer arrived in the Portuguese capital with five suitcases in tow in August 2021.
“Few hotels and restaurants open, a fraction of the number of usual tourists, mask-wearing the norm, I felt like I had Lisbon to myself,” she says.
Meyer rented an apartment for three months in Lisbon at first. But after exploring the area, she fell in love with the charms of nearby Cascais, a former fishing village that has been luring many expats recently.
This US couple sold their house and moved to Italy for good
She was struck by Cascais’ unplugged and somewhat sleepy feel, which was something she wasn’t accustomed to, and the fact that locals didn’t seem to use mobile phones at the market or cafes.
“Here, time stands still, and people relish time together,” she says. “Things take longer. In place of any sense of urgency you find a happier, more laid-back lifestyle.
“But one that can be very frustrating to Americans addicted to frenetic beats and trapped in the rat race.”
She says she was taken aback by the genuineness of the Portuguese people, their pride and joy in learning that an expat had chosen their country as a new home, and their willingness to help when she was struggling to communicate.
“Portuguese is a very difficult language to learn, but they are always willing to help with pronunciations and usage,” she says. “It is very much a welcoming culture.”
Later that year, Meyer bought a 95-square-meter, two-bedroom, split-level apartment with a roof terrace in a quiet neighborhood, close to cafés and cultural attractions.
Situated on a hill above the center of town, it offers striking views stretching from Cascais Bay and the ocean to the famous mountains and palaces of Sintra.
The purchase price was 595,000 euros (around $651,000). Even though Portugal saw an overall property price increase of 13.8% in 2021, with prices continuing to rise in the years since then, Meyer estimates that an apartment in a similar spot in California would have cost her at least triple.
Fortunately, Meyer was able to benefit from Portugal’s “golden visa” system, a five-year residence by investment program aimed at non-EU nationals, which is no longer available for real estate purchases.
To qualify, applicants were required to make a real estate purchase of a minimum of 500,000 euros ($547,000.)
The golden visa grants her visa-free travel through Europe’s Schengen Area. She also has the option to apply for Portuguese citizenship after holding a golden visa for five years, according to a recently amended law aimed at speeding up procedures.
They sold everything to become a digital nomad family. Here’s what happened next
But for Meyer, one of the cons to moving to a destination with such a slower-paced lifestyle has been getting through red tape, and she faced a wait of around two years to obtain her residency due to the Portugal’s previous long approval process.
“Word of mouth from others who have been through it reigns supreme,” she says. “And my advice would be to find a good attorney.”
Meyer says that Cascais’ strong sense of community played a part in her decision to build her new life there.
“People are very social and family-oriented,” she says. “On weekends I meet friends at the popular mercado, where, in addition to a farmers’ market, butchers, cheese and fishmongers, crafts, stands with clothing and household goods for sale, you can socialize and just watch the world go by.”
Savoring a creamy pastel de nata (egg or custard tarts) or a tosta mista (a grilled sandwich) at one of the local pastelaria shops is also a popular pastime here.
According to Meyer, the quality and speed of service in restaurants and hotels is slower than in the US, and deliveries and home repairs are also likely to take longer.
“On the upside, a restaurant server would never, ever present a bill without a customer asking for it,” she adds.
“That would be considered rude, even with a line of customers waiting for a table. And you won’t see people eating or drinking on the go, as you would in the US.”
Meyer has noticed that the absence of a tipping culture in Portugal is something that Americans find difficult to grasp.
“A small tip is always appreciated for good service and overall experience,” she adds. “But not mandatory. Americans over-tipping can even be considered rather vulgar in some circles.”
She’s picked up some local habits, like forsaking a clothes dryer, considered “the Portuguese way.”
However, Meyer hasn’t been able to give up air-conditioning – a 2022 study by real estate platform Idealista found that only one in four properties on the market in Portugal had air conditioning – and has a unit installed at her home.
Adapting to the local climate has also meant learning to deal with the high coastal humidity and the propensity for mold in winter.
“Due to different building standards than those we are accustomed to in the US, dampness and mold is common,” says Meyer.
“I’ve learned to live with various dehumidifying devices and the frequent airing out of my apartment during winter months. Just part of the new routine.”
Meyer’s also had to adapt to the intricately-designed cobblestones on the sidewalks of Portugal – calcada portuguesa – which can be “beautiful to the eye but treacherous to the body.”
“I slipped and fell on these slick stones several times when I first arrived, and quickly learned that this is simply a rite of passage,” she says, adding that she now wears sneakers to tackle them. “In Portugal, it’s function over style in the shoe department.”
She’s also had to get used to the Portuguese queuing systems. The phrase, “take a number,” has all-new meaning in Portugal, says Meyer.
“To get served at post offices, hospitals and pharmacies requires you go to a machine for a senha, a piece of paper containing a code indicating your place in line,” she explains.
“You may proceed to a desk only once your number is illuminated on a screen and called.”
However, Meyers feels that the affordable cost of living in Portugal outweighs any challenges, even though prices have risen in the years since she’s been there.
“When I arrived an Uber ride within the greater Cascais area started at 1.50 euros (around $1.64),” she says. “Today that is closer to 3.50 euros or 4 euros (about $4.38.)
“Recently, I had friends tell me that a round trip Uber ride they took in NYC – from Lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side – was $100, including tip, of course. Sticker shock is common for anyone living in Portugal and returning to the US.”
Back in late 2021, Meyer says that lunch for two (a fish, steak or stew main, vegetable and potatoes, two glasses of wine, bread and bottled water) would cost her 16 euros (around $17.50.) More recently, the price was 22 euros (around $24,) which she still considers to be a relative bargain.
Although Meyer has adapted well, she says she’s still trying to fully absorb the Cascais vibe and feel like a local.
“When living outside of the US, I consider myself first and foremost a foreigner,” she says.
“I know that I must adapt to a new and different culture, not vice versa. Embracing that mindset is fundamental to living abroad.”
Meyer gets homesick from time to time, but says she has no plans to return to the US, and wouldn’t swap her new life for anything.
“I miss my friends and family in the US, but living in a safe, peaceful, affordable and eye-opening environment is an indisputable trade-off,” she says.
“Portugal is a pretty wonderful travel destination – and I’ve had more US visitors these past two years than I probably would have had time to see if I were still living in the US.”"

IDGDS5UGJ2_1E2SFTW1Y1JDF87,Taiwan loses diplomatic ally to China days after presidential election,"By Nectar Gan, Eric Cheung and Wayne Chang, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:13 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/nauru-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-china-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan has lost another diplomatic ally to China just days after its presidential election in what Taipei said was both sudden and designed by Beijing to suppress the island’s “democratic achievements.”
The Pacific Island nation of Nauru on Monday announced it had severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China, a decision confirmed by Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry.
The move is the latest blow to Taiwan’s efforts to retain its dwindling number of diplomatic allies, and comes just two days after Taiwan’s voters defied China’s threats to elect a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and a staunch defender of Taiwan’s distinct identity and sovereignty, won the presidential election on Saturday, handing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a historic third straight term.
Beijing had repeatedly warned Taiwan’s voters that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up diplomatic pressure on Taipei in recent years, including by poaching its allies.
During the DPP’s eight years in power, Taiwan has lost 10 diplomatic allies to China.
Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?
On Monday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned China in “the strongest possible terms” for Nauru’s diplomatic switch, which it said came at “a key moment” following the presidential election.
“China’s move is to suppress Taiwan’s democratic achievements,” Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang told reporters.
Tien added that the severance of ties was a “very sudden move” by the Nauru government, which had congratulated Lai’s presidential victory over the weekend.
Tien said Taiwan will immediately suspend all official interactions with Nauru “to defend national dignity,” including closing its embassy and asking the Pacific Island nation to close its embassy in Taiwan.
Tien also claimed that Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry had received information that Chinese officials had courted politicians in Nauru with offers of economic assistance.
He refused to put a figure on the alleged inducement, but said it was “beyond what we are able to assist our diplomatic allies with.”
In a regular news briefing Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not divulge whether Beijing had pledged financial aid to Nauru, but welcomed its move.
“It is Nauru’s right decision made on its own volition as an independent sovereign nation to announce its recognition of the one-China principle, its severance of ties with Taiwan and resumption of diplomatic relations with China after Taiwan’s election,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. “This also shows that the one-China principle is a general trend and the common aspiration of the people.”
This is the second time Nauru has severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Pacific Island country first cut ties in 2002, followed by a resumption in 2005.
The Nauru government said its resumption of diplomatic relations with China was “in the best interests” of the country and its people.
“This means that the Republic of Nauru will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory, and will sever ‘diplomatic relations’ with Taiwan as of this day and no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan,” it said in a statement.
Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China
Nauru’s switch of allegiance leaves Taiwan with only 12 diplomatic allies, mostly small nations in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America, and the Vatican.
Nauru’s announcement came as an unofficial US delegation reaffirmed “rock solid” US support for Taiwan during a visit to the island to meet its current and incoming presidents.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
But since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
Many other Western nations, including several in Europe, have also retained informal relations with Taipei in the guise of trade offices.
Analysts say these unofficial relationships with powerful Western nations are in many ways more consequential than the official diplomatic ties it maintains with a handful of smaller countries.
However, formal diplomatic relations allow those countries to advocate on behalf of Taiwan in international bodies that the island is locked out of, such as the United Nations.

The event, which raised €1.31m in total, was attended by US Climate Envoy John Kerry along with many other climate action visionaries. Art pieces and unique jewelry were also auctioned off.
“Amidst the ongoing fight against pollution, I also witness the progress that has been achieved. We have come a long way. Today, so many people are here to be part of the solution,” Schwarzenegger said at the dinner. “I extend my gratitude to everyone who has joined my fight against pollution.”
Schwarzenegger is facing criminal tax proceedings for failing to declare the Audemars Piguet watch to customs officers in Munich after he got off a flight from Los Angeles, a Munich Customs press officer told CNN Wednesday.
“He did not declare a product. A product that was imported from non-EU countries in order to remain in the EU. And this process applies to everyone,” press officer Thomas Meister said.
Meister said the former California governor and “Terminator” star was released and traveled on after being held for over two hours.
The actor agreed to pre-pay potential taxes on the watch but the officers failed to get a credit card machine to work for an hour until they gave up and brought him to a bank and asked him to withdraw cash from an ATM to pay, a source close to the actor told CNN.
The ATM they brought him to had a limit that was too low, and the bank was closed.
When he returned, a new officer brought a new credit card machine that worked, the source added.

J7JMFCAOC4_JT9OB5U4EWR96UJ,Taiwan loses diplomatic ally to China days after presidential election,"By Nectar Gan, Eric Cheung and Wayne Chang, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:13 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/nauru-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-china-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan has lost another diplomatic ally to China just days after its presidential election in what Taipei said was both sudden and designed by Beijing to suppress the island’s “democratic achievements.”
The Pacific Island nation of Nauru on Monday announced it had severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China, a decision confirmed by Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry.
The move is the latest blow to Taiwan’s efforts to retain its dwindling number of diplomatic allies, and comes just two days after Taiwan’s voters defied China’s threats to elect a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and a staunch defender of Taiwan’s distinct identity and sovereignty, won the presidential election on Saturday, handing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a historic third straight term.
Beijing had repeatedly warned Taiwan’s voters that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up diplomatic pressure on Taipei in recent years, including by poaching its allies.
During the DPP’s eight years in power, Taiwan has lost 10 diplomatic allies to China.
Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?
On Monday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned China in “the strongest possible terms” for Nauru’s diplomatic switch, which it said came at “a key moment” following the presidential election.
“China’s move is to suppress Taiwan’s democratic achievements,” Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang told reporters.
Tien added that the severance of ties was a “very sudden move” by the Nauru government, which had congratulated Lai’s presidential victory over the weekend.
Tien said Taiwan will immediately suspend all official interactions with Nauru “to defend national dignity,” including closing its embassy and asking the Pacific Island nation to close its embassy in Taiwan.
Tien also claimed that Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry had received information that Chinese officials had courted politicians in Nauru with offers of economic assistance.
He refused to put a figure on the alleged inducement, but said it was “beyond what we are able to assist our diplomatic allies with.”
In a regular news briefing Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not divulge whether Beijing had pledged financial aid to Nauru, but welcomed its move.
“It is Nauru’s right decision made on its own volition as an independent sovereign nation to announce its recognition of the one-China principle, its severance of ties with Taiwan and resumption of diplomatic relations with China after Taiwan’s election,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. “This also shows that the one-China principle is a general trend and the common aspiration of the people.”
This is the second time Nauru has severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Pacific Island country first cut ties in 2002, followed by a resumption in 2005.
The Nauru government said its resumption of diplomatic relations with China was “in the best interests” of the country and its people.
“This means that the Republic of Nauru will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory, and will sever ‘diplomatic relations’ with Taiwan as of this day and no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan,” it said in a statement.
Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China
Nauru’s switch of allegiance leaves Taiwan with only 12 diplomatic allies, mostly small nations in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America, and the Vatican.
Nauru’s announcement came as an unofficial US delegation reaffirmed “rock solid” US support for Taiwan during a visit to the island to meet its current and incoming presidents.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
But since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
Many other Western nations, including several in Europe, have also retained informal relations with Taipei in the guise of trade offices.
Analysts say these unofficial relationships with powerful Western nations are in many ways more consequential than the official diplomatic ties it maintains with a handful of smaller countries.
However, formal diplomatic relations allow those countries to advocate on behalf of Taiwan in international bodies that the island is locked out of, such as the United Nations.

K8EBKZ83AO_MO01V1CS6BX42FL,"Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?","By Nectar Gan, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:58 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240114,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/14/asia/profile-lai-ching-te-taiwan-new-president-intl-hnk/,"Lai Ching-te, a former doctor from a poor mining family, was propelled into politics by a military crisis in the Taiwan Strait 27 years ago.
Now, the soft-spoken political veteran is tasked with preventing another one from happening as the newly elected leader of the self-ruled island that China’s Communist Party has vowed to one day absorb.
On Saturday, Lai, 64, the current vice president from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won a widely watched election to become Taiwan’s next president.
His victory handed the DPP a historic third consecutive term, delivering a snub to years of growing threats from Taiwan’s much-larger authoritarian neighbor, China.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
Lai, who has long faced Beijing’s wrath for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty, said as president he has “an important responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” pledging to pursue dialogue with China under the principles of dignity and parity.
“At the same time, we’re also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China,” he told reporters ahead of his victory speech.
Under leader Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan, which it views as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary.
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait are at their highest since 1996, when China fired missiles into waters off Taiwan’s coast to intimidate voters ahead of the island’s first free presidential election – after the nascent democracy emerged from decades of its own authoritarian rule.
For Lai, then a fresh-faced doctor at a university hospital in the southern city of Tainan, that missile crisis became his “defining moment.”
“I decided I had a duty to participate in Taiwan’s democracy and help protect this fledgling experiment from those who wished it harm,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal last year.
Lai hung up his white coat to run for office – first becoming a legislator, then a popular two-term mayor of Tainan, before serving as the premier and – since 2020 – the vice president of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen.
The doctor-turned politician has now broken the “eight-year curse” of Taiwan politics – a popular term nodding to the fact that, until Lai’s victory, no political party had ever stayed in power for more than two terms since Taiwan became a democracy.
Lai called his foray into politics an “unexpected journey.”
Growing up in poverty in a mining village near the northern coast of Taiwan, Lai had dreamed of becoming a doctor since childhood. He had five siblings, and his mother raised them alone by doing odd jobs. His father, a coal miner, died in a work accident when Lai was a small child.
Lai was too young to remember his father. “But one day I suddenly realized, the biggest asset my father left me was that my family was poor,” he said at an event in March last year.
“Growing up in such a family, we will be more mature, have more willpower, and have more courage to overcome difficulties.”
After completing a bachelor’s degree in physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei, Lai went to Tainan for medical school.
He was a few years into a promising career as a physician in Tainan when a local DPP official approached him. He asked the popular doctor to help a DPP politician campaign for local elections.
It was 1994, less than a decade after the DPP first emerged from Taiwan’s democracy movement against the authoritarian rule of the Kuomintang (KMT).
Before lifting martial law in 1987 and transitioning slowly toward free elections, the KMT ruled Taiwan with an iron fist for nearly four decades after fleeing to the island from mainland China after losing the civil war to the Communist forces there.
Tens of thousands of political opponents were killed or jailed during what came to be known as the “White Terror” and the DPP was formed by many veterans of those who had campaigned for democracy.
While Lai was in college in Taipei, he and his roommates had closely followed news of the KMT’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. “I was full of doubts and concerns for the future of this country,” he said in video released by his presidential election campaign.
Lai agreed to help the DPP with the local election, but the candidate lost in the end.
A year later, some democracy activists invited Lai to join the DPP to run for the legislature.
He initially rejected the idea. “I was born and raised in a rural, impoverished place, and I had always wanted to be a doctor. Now, I’ve finally made it this far to become a chief physician,” he said in the campaign video.
But his political friends refused to give up. Months later, crisis flared in the Taiwan Strait as China held live-fire exercises and fired missiles toward Taiwan, giving Lai a final push across the line.
“Instead of criticizing the ruling government at the time from my clinic, wouldn’t it be better to come out and follow the vanguards of the democratic movement and actually do something for Taiwan?” he said in the video.
“I also thought that in this life, if I could find a project that makes me feel passionate to embark on, it would be a life worth living.”
In the lead-up to the election, China made no secret of its desire to prevent a Lai victory.
Chinese officials repeatedly framed the vote as a choice between “peace and war” – echoing a talking point of the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih, Beijing’s preferred candidate – while railing against Lai for triggering “cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
Hailing from a more radical wing of the DPP, Lai was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence – a red line for Beijing.
His views tempered as he rose through the ranks. But China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a “practical worker for Taiwan independence.”
Lai now says he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country” so there is “no plan or need” to declare independence.
That deliberately nuanced stance mimics his outgoing predecessor Tsai, Taiwan’s first female president, who was unable to stand again because of term limits.
Beijing cut off official communications with Taipei after Tsai took office in 2016 and ramped up its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally, something that looks set to continue when Lai is inaugurated and fully takes over in May.
In many ways Beijing’s rhetoric towards Lai is even more hostile than how it viewed Tsai.
China’s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, “troublemaker” and “war maker,” while rejecting his repeated offers for talks.
One such offer was made to China’s top leader, Xi.
In May last year, at a quick-fire Q&A session with students at his alma mater, National Taiwan University, Lai named Xi as the head of state he would most like to have dinner with.
If he had a chance to dine with Xi, Lai said, he would advise the Chinese leader to “chill out a little.”
“No need to be so stressed,” he said.
Asked about Lai’s invitation, Beijing said his comments were “weird” and accused Lai of “trying to put on the cloak of goodwill” given that his “Taiwan independence nature” had not changed.
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who was elected vice president Saturday, was also openly loathed by Beijing. Hsiao, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was sanctioned twice by China for being a “diehard secessionist.”
Lai earned more than 40 percent of the popular vote, while the KMT scooped up 33 percent and a newer opposition party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), racked up 26 percent.
The DPP lost its majority in the legislature, taking 51 of the 113 seats, meaning Lai may find himself more constrained than Tsai and needing to rely on political alliances to pass legislation.
Hours after Lai declared victory, China dismissed the outcome of Taiwan’s elections, saying the DPP “does not represent mainstream public opinion” on the island.
“Taiwan is China’s Taiwan,” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement on Saturday night.
“This election cannot change the shared hope from compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to get closer and closer, it moreover cannot stop the inevitable destiny that our motherland will be united.”
But that assertion could not be further from Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion.
Under Xi’s strongarm tactics, Taiwan’s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10 percent now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3 percent identify primarily as Chinese.
The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing.
“We have been bullied for years on end. I just can’t stand kneeling down to their demands and their meddling with our elections. We want to keep our free style of living and our democracy,” Yang Wei-ting, a 27-year-old civil servant, said amid cheers and celebrations at Lai’s rally.
“I think the most important part for us is to work with like-minded partners around the globe, and tell China that we’re not alone and we’re not scared. We’re standing in the face of an authoritarian regime, but we’re backed by many like-minded countries.”

LV2QJBQB5T_71SJ47HE2NYBVDC,Why are Iran and Pakistan striking each other’s territory – and what does it have to do with the Middle East?,"By Sophia Saifi, Adam Pourahmadi, Azaz Syed and Jessie Yeung, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:34 PM EST, Thu January 18, 2024",20240118,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/18/world/iran-pakistan-attacks-tensions-explainer-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan and Iran have both conducted strikes on each other’s territories in an unprecedented escalation of hostilities between the neighbors, at a time when tensions have risen sharply across the Middle East and beyond.
The two countries share a volatile border, stretching about 900 kilometers (560 miles), with Pakistan’s Balochistan province on one side and Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province on the other.
Both nations have long fought militants in the restive Baloch region along the border. But while the two countries share a common separatist enemy, it is highly unusual for either side to attack militants on each other’s soil.
The latest strikes come as Iran’s allies and proxies in the Middle East – the so-called axis of resistance – launch attacks on Israeli forces and its allies against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Here’s what you need to know.
The opening salvo in this fast-moving sequence of events began Tuesday when Iran conducted strikes on Pakistan’s Balochistan province – killing two children and wounding several others, according to Pakistani authorities.
Iran claimed it had “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that no Pakistani nationals were targeted.
But the attack sparked anger in Pakistan, which called the strike “an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran.”
Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency said it had been targeting strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, or Army of Justice.
The separatist militant group operates on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its ultimate goal is independence for Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is majority Sunni – the dominant branch of Islam – while Iran and its “axis of resistance” is largely Shia.
Pakistan struck back two days later with what it called a “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” on several alleged separatist hideouts in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Announcing the strikes on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said a number of militants were killed. At least 10 people — all Pakistani nationals — were killed, Tasnim reported, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan, who said authorities were investigating how those people had “settled in the village.”
Pakistan said it had for years complained that separatist fighters had “safe havens and sanctuaries” in Iran – and was forced to take matters into its own hands with Thursday’s strikes.
Pakistan and Iran’s struggle against separatists operating on either side of each other’s borders is not new.
Deadly clashes along the turbulent border have happened regularly over the years. Just last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in Sistan and Baluchestan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
What is highly unusual, however, is each side’s willingness to hit targets across those borders, without informing each other first. And all this is happening against the backdrop of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has sent repercussions coursing through the region.
The larger regional conflict may have emboldened Iran to be more proactive in pursuing targets beyond its borders, experts say – especially as the United States walks a tightrope between de-escalating hostilities and flexing its own military might to deter further moves by Iran.

The day before the strikes in Pakistan, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Iraq and Syria, claiming to be targeting a spy base for Israeli forces and “anti-Iran terror groups.”
Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah across the Lebanon border; and the US is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea in the name of revenge for Israel’s assault on Gaza.
“If you don’t censure Iran and its proxies … then there’s no cost for them to continue to pursue those activities,” said Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He added that Iran’s dominant position in the Middle East, in contrast to conflict-ridden nations like Yemen and Syria, means it stands to gain from regional instability and “filling power vacuums.” And Iran’s activities now serve to further several of its main goals, which include empowering Palestinians and counteracting American influence in the Middle East, he said.
Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the various hostilities reflect Iran “striving to cement its role as a leader in the region.”
“It’s seeking regional hegemony,” he told CNN. “And when the United States and Israel are there, and Israel’s waging this campaign against Hamas, then Iran feels the need to strike back and assert itself.”
The Baloch people, also spelled Baluch, live where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran meet. They have long exhibited a fiercely independent streak and always resented being ruled by both Islamabad and Tehran, with insurgencies bubbling across the porous border region for decades.
The area they live in is also rich in natural resources, but Baloch separatists complain that their people, some of the region’s poorest, have seen little wealth trickle down to their communities.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has witnessed a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, fueled by a decades-long insurgency by separatists who demand independence from the country, angered by what they say is the state’s monopoly and exploitation of the region’s mineral resources.
Iran has also faced a long history of insurgencies from its Kurdish, Arab and Baloch minorities.
Jaish al-Adl is just one of many separatist groups operating within Iran. It was originally part of a larger Sunni militant group called Jundallah, which fractured after its leader was executed by Iran in 2010, according to the US government’s National Counterterrorism Center. Jaish al-Adl emerged instead and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department.
The group often targets Iranian security personnel, government officials, and Shia civilians, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.
In 2015, the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed eight Iranian border guards, with militants reportedly crossing into Iran from Pakistan. And in 2019, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a bus carrying members of the Iranian military, killing at least 23 in Sistan-Baluchestan.
On Wednesday, a day after Iran’s strikes on Pakistan, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian military vehicle in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Iran’s strikes on Tuesday sparked a diplomatic spat, with Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and suspending all high-level visits from its neighbor.
And after Pakistan’s strikes, Iran on Thursday demanded “an immediate explanation” from its neighbor, Tasnim reported – and the Iranian military conducted a large-scale exercise off the country’s southwest coast, involving the air force, naval forces and ground forces.
Nearby nations have weighed in, with Turkey’s foreign minister holding calls with his counterparts in both Iran and Pakistan. Afterward, he said neither country wanted to escalate tensions further.
India said it has “zero tolerance towards terrorism,” and that the attack was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan.” China urged both nations to exercise restraint, and the European Union said it was “gravely concerned by the spiral of violence in the Middle East and beyond.”
US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller also urged restraint on Thursday – but added he didn’t think the flare-up was “in any way, shape or form connected to Gaza.”
“But whenever you see things, see strikes in the region, given the tensions in the region, there is the risk for increase in conflict, which is something that we’re trying to avoid,” he said.
It is not clear whether either Iran or Pakistan would want to descend into full-blown hostilities over separatist groups that they both regard as an enemy.
Both sides issued statements after their respective strikes that hinted at a desire not to see things escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry called Iran a “brotherly country” and emphasized the need to “find joint solutions.”
That echoed the Iranian foreign minister, who called Pakistan a “friendly country” earlier this week and said their strikes were proportionate and only aimed at militants."
M8KU4231RL_FDOWXYNIASBJZ32,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:57 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/17/us/texas-border-patrol-us-mexico/,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
2 children and a woman drowned in the Rio Grande, authorities say, days after Texas blocked the feds amid migrant crisis
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
What we know about the drownings of 3 Mexican migrants near Eagle Pass, Texas
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”
The Texas Military Department, meanwhile, said by the time Border Patrol agents requested access to the site Friday night, “the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site.”
“At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the US during this period,” the Texas Military Department said. “Also, at no point was TMD made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park, nor was TMD made aware of any bodies being discovered on the US side of the border regarding this situation.”
The federal-state border standoff in Texas has prompted members of a kind of group known for using demonizing rhetoric and intersecting with extremists to issue a call on social media for people to travel to Eagle Pass in protest.
The group is urging “patriots” from across the country to go to Eagle Pass “to demand that elected officials honor their oath of office to defend the border against a ‘foreign invasion,’” according to a member’s online video that employs the term far-right groups use for the border crisis.
A property owner will let the group set up tents, campers and RVs, he says.
These “patriots,” however, are misinformed about border security and immigration policy, said Texas state Rep. Eddie Morales Jr., a Democrat who represents 11 counties in West Texas, including the city of Eagle Pass. Instead, they should camp outside Congress and demand lawmakers act on immigration, he said.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives right now, if they were truly interested in solving this issue, they would fast track a border immigration and a border security bill by tomorrow,” Morales said.
Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber is monitoring the potential arrival this weekend of people from around the country and is concerned for the safety and security of the area due to the heated rhetoric on immigration, he told CNN.
Groups like this one that use “patriot” as part of their names have emerged since 2020 in an effort to get Donald Trump to form a third major political party, the Anti-Defamation League told CNN in a statement. While such groups are not inherently extremist, they engage in demonizing rhetoric, far-right policy causes and at times intersect with extremist groups and movements, it said.
A state away, Louisiana’s new Republican governor has directed state agencies to report any arrests of or funds spent on undocumented immigrants, he mandated in an executive order signed Friday.
﻿“The cost of illegal immigration in this state is falling on the shoulders of hard-working Louisianans,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement Tuesday. “This Executive Order will analyze data to determine the financial burden our citizens are being forced to carry because of those who do not follow the law.”
“Louisiana will always welcome those who legally immigrate, but taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill for individuals who break the law and skip the line.”
The heads of every executive branch in the state must provide within 120 days a report to the governor’s office detailing any use “of public funds directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of illegal aliens,” the order says.
The governor directs the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police to provide monthly reports on the number of people “charged or convicted of a criminal offense” and to note whether they are documented or undocumented, according to the order.
Law enforcement is also directed in the order to “regularly publish” to the public data regarding “arrests and convictions of illegal aliens,” their nationality, their offense, whether charged or convicted and report any “known or suspected gang affiliation” for arrested undocumented immigrants and where they were arrested.

O3JC8KL52K_SOC05765BZA61LK,China says it’s easier than ever for Americans to visit the country,"By Lilit Marcus and Veronica Lin, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:50 PM EST, Tue January 9, 2024",20240110,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/american-tourist-visas-china-intl-hnk/,"For years, Americans interested in visiting China had to endure a thorough visa process, which required pre-booking hotels and flights and handing their passports over to an embassy or consulate for an undetermined period.
But as of January 1, 2024, some of those restrictions have dropped or loosened, making it easier than ever for US citizens to obtain a Chinese tourist visa.
Americans have the seventh most powerful passport in the world, meaning there are a whopping 187 countries and territories that US citizens can visit either without a visa or by getting one immediately on arrival – a list that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, but not mainland China.
Elsewhere in the region, US passport holders can visit Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore on vacation visa-free for 30-90 days.
As a result, China has been further down the bucket list for many American travelers, who considered the country “too hard” to visit.
China tries to lure foreign tourists with expanded visa-free scheme after weak post-pandemic bounce back
Now, Americans who want to get a Chinese tourist visa (L-visa) no longer have to submit proof of a round-trip flight booking, a hotel reservation, an organized itinerary or a letter of invitation.
The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the newly relaxed guidelines on December 29, 2023, citing the desire “to further facilitate people-to-people exchanges.”
State-run media outlet Xinhua also reported that the Civil Aviation Administration of China plans to increase nonstop flights between the two countries.
Sam Fleischmann, a Pittsburgh-based education consultant planning to visit China in April, said he’s more inclined to do so now that certain restrictions have been lifted.
“If I’m in a city to do consultancy for two weeks, but I have other opportunities to go to a different city, it’s nice to have the flexibility that I don’t need my return ticket,” says Fleischmann. “I think spontaneous travel is one of the most beautiful things about traveling.”
For his next trip to Hong Kong, he’s considering staying in Shanghai for a few days thanks to the six-day visa-free transit policy, where citizens of 53 countries can enter and stay in designated cities and provinces in China without a visa if they meet certain criteria.
It’s not just Americans who stand to benefit from China opening up.
In November, China announced a trial program to allow visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia to enter visa-free for 15 days.
Soon after, China and Thailand announced intentions of a reciprocal visa-free program, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry said would “serve the fundamental interests of both peoples.”
Visas weren’t the only challenge for Western tourists going to China that the country has addressed.
Last year, the country’s main digital payment systems, WeChat Pay and Alipay, opened up to users with non-Chinese credit cards and bank accounts, thus eliminating a major pain point for foreign visitors.

Since last July, visitors have also been able to link their Visa and Mastercard accounts to China’s most popular mobile payment platforms – allowing them to book taxis, ride the subway and pay for goods and services at millions of outlets across the near-cashless country, though a fee may be added for larger transactions.
However, one thing that hasn’t eased is the US State Department’s guidance on going to China. It lists China as a level three or “orange” country, which means “reconsider travel.”
The guidance reads: “Reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.”
China enforced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns during the pandemic, which battered the economy. The consequences of these policies can be seen in the slowdown and dismal economic results last year.
“The impact of Covid lockdowns communicated to the rest of the world in the sense that China was closed and closing off, and so by changing these rules, it sends the message that it’s opening back up,” says Hong Kong University tourism professor Benjamin Iaquinto.
“The economy in China is not doing so well. And this is probably going to help contribute to boosting it back up again, there are also concerns with its international reputation,” he added.
However, according to Iaquinto, geopolitical tensions – including “volatile” US-China relations – mean that these changes might not be permanent.
“If there’s some type of blowup between the two countries, not necessarily in terms of war, but some type of political argument,” he said, “that might result in China responding by reversing those changes.”

O79SVUTX41_PKG9KHR19QIKDVM,South Africa accuses Israel of genocide and urges top UN court to halt Gaza war,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 10:12 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240111,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/,"South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and calling for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

PLVFNACGD1_WGTFS82WGT3ZQ6J,READ: President Joe Biden’s statement on strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen,By CNN Staff,"2 minute read Published 11:31 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240112,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/11/politics/read-biden-statement-airstrikes-houthis-yemen/,"President Joe Biden said airstrikes launched by the US and UK against Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen were “in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.”
The president ordered the strikes just days after what the US military called a “complex attack” by the Iranian-backed militants on Red Sea shipping.
Read Biden’s full statement on the coalition airstrikes in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen below:
Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces—together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways. These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea—including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history. These attacks have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardized trade, and threatened freedom of navigation. More than 50 nations have been affected in 27 attacks on international commercial shipping. Crews from more than 20 countries have been threatened or taken hostage in acts of piracy.  More than 2,000 ships have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea—which can cause weeks of delays in product shipping times. And on January 9, Houthis launched their largest attack to date—directly targeting American ships. The response of the international community to these reckless attacks has been united and resolute. Last month, the United States launched Operation Prosperity Guardian—a coalition of more than 20 nations committed to defending international shipping and deterring Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.  We also joined more than 40 nations in condemning Houthi threats. Last week, together with 13 allies and partners, we issued an unequivocal warning that Houthi rebels would bear the consequences if their attacks did not cease. And yesterday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding the Houthis end attacks on merchant and commercial vessels. Today’s defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels’ escalating attacks against commercial vessels. These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes. I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary."

The event, which raised €1.31m in total, was attended by US Climate Envoy John Kerry along with many other climate action visionaries. Art pieces and unique jewelry were also auctioned off.
“Amidst the ongoing fight against pollution, I also witness the progress that has been achieved. We have come a long way. Today, so many people are here to be part of the solution,” Schwarzenegger said at the dinner. “I extend my gratitude to everyone who has joined my fight against pollution.”
Schwarzenegger is facing criminal tax proceedings for failing to declare the Audemars Piguet watch to customs officers in Munich after he got off a flight from Los Angeles, a Munich Customs press officer told CNN Wednesday.
“He did not declare a product. A product that was imported from non-EU countries in order to remain in the EU. And this process applies to everyone,” press officer Thomas Meister said.
Meister said the former California governor and “Terminator” star was released and traveled on after being held for over two hours.
The actor agreed to pre-pay potential taxes on the watch but the officers failed to get a credit card machine to work for an hour until they gave up and brought him to a bank and asked him to withdraw cash from an ATM to pay, a source close to the actor told CNN.
The ATM they brought him to had a limit that was too low, and the bank was closed.
When he returned, a new officer brought a new credit card machine that worked, the source added.

“In the past year of 2023, China’s economy has generally rebounded and improved,” the country’s second highest official told the meeting of global business and political leaders.
The Chinese government had earlier said that it was targeting a growth rate of around 5% for 2023, and is set to announce its annual GDP figures for last year on Wednesday.
While this expansion would mark a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s economic worst performances in over three decades.
Barring the pandemic years through 2022, when China’s growth was disrupted by strict lockdowns and other restrictions, 5.2% is the country’s slowest pace of annual growth since 1990, when the economy expanded by 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
The country has been beset by a series of economic problems, including a real estate crisis, record youth unemployment, deflation, and a rapidly ageing population. International economists have widely projected China’s growth to slow to around 4.5% this year.
Those problems have sent investors rushing for the exits. China’s stock markets were the biggest losers in 2023. The country’s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell more than 11%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 14%. Meanwhile, the MSCI World index closed the year 22% higher, its biggest annual jump since 2019.
“Even if there are twists and turns in China’s economic operation, its overall long-term positive trend will not change,” said Li. The premier is the most senior Chinese leader to attend the Davos forum in person since President Xi Jinping in 2017.
Li also tried to reassure international investors, who have become increasingly wary of China’s tough business environment and slowing growth.
“Investing in the Chinese market is not a risk but an opportunity,” he said.
The country has about 400 million people in the middle-income group, and that number is expected to double to 800 million in the next 10 years, Li said.
“The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he added.
Ongoing urbanization will create huge demand in sectors such as housing, education, medical and elderly care, he said, adding that there are still nearly 300 million rural Chinese who will eventually migrate to cities.
There is also a lot of room for investments in upgrading urban transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, he noted.
Li also pledged to create “first-class” operating environment for international businesses in China.
“No matter how the world’s situation changes, China will adhere to its fundamental national policy of opening up, and its door will only get wider and wider,” he said.
His remarks come as Beijing intensifies its efforts to revive the economy and woo foreign investment back into the country. Foreign companies have grown wary of Beijing’s rising scrutiny and are pulling out. In the third quarter, a measure of foreign direct investment (FDI) into China turned negative for the first time since 1998.
On Monday, Li met with Swiss President Viola Amherd and said the two countries would deepen economic ties and start talks to upgrade their free-trade agreement, according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry.
In November, Xi visited the United States for the first time in more than six years, where he met with President Joe Biden to amend ties between the two countries. In a meeting with top American business executives, Xi pledged to make it easier for foreigners to invest and operate in his country.

S31X7N3TH2_KN2HHF9X9KPFX0K,Why are Iran and Pakistan striking each other’s territory – and what does it have to do with the Middle East?,"By Sophia Saifi, Adam Pourahmadi, Azaz Syed and Jessie Yeung, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:34 PM EST, Thu January 18, 2024",20240118,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/18/world/iran-pakistan-attacks-tensions-explainer-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan and Iran have both conducted strikes on each other’s territories in an unprecedented escalation of hostilities between the neighbors, at a time when tensions have risen sharply across the Middle East and beyond.
The two countries share a volatile border, stretching about 900 kilometers (560 miles), with Pakistan’s Balochistan province on one side and Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province on the other.
Both nations have long fought militants in the restive Baloch region along the border. But while the two countries share a common separatist enemy, it is highly unusual for either side to attack militants on each other’s soil.
The latest strikes come as Iran’s allies and proxies in the Middle East – the so-called axis of resistance – launch attacks on Israeli forces and its allies against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Here’s what you need to know.
The opening salvo in this fast-moving sequence of events began Tuesday when Iran conducted strikes on Pakistan’s Balochistan province – killing two children and wounding several others, according to Pakistani authorities.
Iran claimed it had “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that no Pakistani nationals were targeted.
But the attack sparked anger in Pakistan, which called the strike “an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran.”
Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency said it had been targeting strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, or Army of Justice.
The separatist militant group operates on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its ultimate goal is independence for Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is majority Sunni – the dominant branch of Islam – while Iran and its “axis of resistance” is largely Shia.
Pakistan struck back two days later with what it called a “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” on several alleged separatist hideouts in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Announcing the strikes on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said a number of militants were killed. At least 10 people — all Pakistani nationals — were killed, Tasnim reported, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan, who said authorities were investigating how those people had “settled in the village.”
Pakistan said it had for years complained that separatist fighters had “safe havens and sanctuaries” in Iran – and was forced to take matters into its own hands with Thursday’s strikes.
Pakistan and Iran’s struggle against separatists operating on either side of each other’s borders is not new.
Deadly clashes along the turbulent border have happened regularly over the years. Just last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in Sistan and Baluchestan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
What is highly unusual, however, is each side’s willingness to hit targets across those borders, without informing each other first. And all this is happening against the backdrop of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has sent repercussions coursing through the region.
The larger regional conflict may have emboldened Iran to be more proactive in pursuing targets beyond its borders, experts say – especially as the United States walks a tightrope between de-escalating hostilities and flexing its own military might to deter further moves by Iran.

The day before the strikes in Pakistan, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Iraq and Syria, claiming to be targeting a spy base for Israeli forces and “anti-Iran terror groups.”
Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah across the Lebanon border; and the US is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea in the name of revenge for Israel’s assault on Gaza.
“If you don’t censure Iran and its proxies … then there’s no cost for them to continue to pursue those activities,” said Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He added that Iran’s dominant position in the Middle East, in contrast to conflict-ridden nations like Yemen and Syria, means it stands to gain from regional instability and “filling power vacuums.” And Iran’s activities now serve to further several of its main goals, which include empowering Palestinians and counteracting American influence in the Middle East, he said.
Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the various hostilities reflect Iran “striving to cement its role as a leader in the region.”
“It’s seeking regional hegemony,” he told CNN. “And when the United States and Israel are there, and Israel’s waging this campaign against Hamas, then Iran feels the need to strike back and assert itself.”
The Baloch people, also spelled Baluch, live where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran meet. They have long exhibited a fiercely independent streak and always resented being ruled by both Islamabad and Tehran, with insurgencies bubbling across the porous border region for decades.
The area they live in is also rich in natural resources, but Baloch separatists complain that their people, some of the region’s poorest, have seen little wealth trickle down to their communities.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has witnessed a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, fueled by a decades-long insurgency by separatists who demand independence from the country, angered by what they say is the state’s monopoly and exploitation of the region’s mineral resources.
Iran has also faced a long history of insurgencies from its Kurdish, Arab and Baloch minorities.
Jaish al-Adl is just one of many separatist groups operating within Iran. It was originally part of a larger Sunni militant group called Jundallah, which fractured after its leader was executed by Iran in 2010, according to the US government’s National Counterterrorism Center. Jaish al-Adl emerged instead and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department.
The group often targets Iranian security personnel, government officials, and Shia civilians, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.
In 2015, the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed eight Iranian border guards, with militants reportedly crossing into Iran from Pakistan. And in 2019, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a bus carrying members of the Iranian military, killing at least 23 in Sistan-Baluchestan.
On Wednesday, a day after Iran’s strikes on Pakistan, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian military vehicle in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Iran’s strikes on Tuesday sparked a diplomatic spat, with Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and suspending all high-level visits from its neighbor.
And after Pakistan’s strikes, Iran on Thursday demanded “an immediate explanation” from its neighbor, Tasnim reported – and the Iranian military conducted a large-scale exercise off the country’s southwest coast, involving the air force, naval forces and ground forces.
Nearby nations have weighed in, with Turkey’s foreign minister holding calls with his counterparts in both Iran and Pakistan. Afterward, he said neither country wanted to escalate tensions further.
India said it has “zero tolerance towards terrorism,” and that the attack was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan.” China urged both nations to exercise restraint, and the European Union said it was “gravely concerned by the spiral of violence in the Middle East and beyond.”
US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller also urged restraint on Thursday – but added he didn’t think the flare-up was “in any way, shape or form connected to Gaza.”
“But whenever you see things, see strikes in the region, given the tensions in the region, there is the risk for increase in conflict, which is something that we’re trying to avoid,” he said.
It is not clear whether either Iran or Pakistan would want to descend into full-blown hostilities over separatist groups that they both regard as an enemy.
Both sides issued statements after their respective strikes that hinted at a desire not to see things escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry called Iran a “brotherly country” and emphasized the need to “find joint solutions.”
That echoed the Iranian foreign minister, who called Pakistan a “friendly country” earlier this week and said their strikes were proportionate and only aimed at militants."
T6QED8EOWK_NA2N98KPGPRW4L6,Taiwan voters dismiss China warnings and hand ruling party a historic third consecutive presidential win,"By Eric Cheung, Wayne Chang, Nectar Gan and Jerome Taylor, CNN","6 minute read Updated 4:43 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240113,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/13/asia/taiwan-presidential-election-results-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party pulled off a historic third consecutive presidential victory on Saturday as voters shrugged off warnings by China that their re-election would increase the risk of conflict.
Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s current vice president, declared victory on Saturday evening while his two opposition rivals both conceded defeat.
“This is a night that belongs to Taiwan. We managed to keep Taiwan on the map of the world,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” he added.
China responded soon after the vote by saying “Taiwan is part of China.”
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was elected Vice President.
The counting of votes has concluded, with Lai – the candidate of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) – receiving just over 40% of the total votes, according to Taiwan’s Central Election Commission (CEC).
Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party candidate Hou Yu-ih garnered 33.49% of the votes, with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) candidate Ko Wen-je received 26.45%. More than 14 million people took part, meaning that voter turnout came in at just over 71%.
The boisterous election campaign, an illustration of Taiwan’s vibrant democratic credentials, was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose.
The result shows voters backing the DPP’s view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China’s threats and deepen relations with fellow democratic countries, even if that means economic punishment or military intimidation by Beijing.
It is also a further snub to eight years of increasingly strongarm tactics towards Taiwan under Xi who has vowed that the island’s eventual “reunification” with the mainland is “a historical inevitability”.
Following Taiwan’s election result, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said no matter “whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change.”
The spokesperson continued: “The one-China principle is the solid anchor for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that the international community will continue to adhere to the one-China principle and understand and support the Chinese people’s just cause of opposing ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities and striving to achieve national reunification.”
A spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office earlier insisted the election result “does not represent the mainstream view on the island.”
Other world powers have congratulated Lai, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying the vote demonstrated “the strength of [Taiwan’s] robust democratic system and electoral process.”
Like outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, who cannot stand again because of term limits, Lai is openly loathed by China’s Communist Party leaders and his victory is unlikely to lead to any improvement in ties between Beijing and Taipei.
China cut off most communications with Taipei after Tsai took office and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-ruled island, turning the Taiwan Strait into one of the world’s major geopolitical flash points.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it. While successive Chinese Communist leaders have vowed to eventually achieve “reunification,” Xi has repeatedly said the Taiwan issue “should not be passed down generation after generation,” linking the mission to his mid-century goal of “national rejuvenation.”
The DPP emphasizes that Taiwan is not subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party, and that its future Taiwan must only be decided by its 23.5 million people.
In the run up to Saturday’s vote, Beijing warned Taiwan’s voters to “make the right choice” and “recognize the extreme danger of Lai Ching-te’s triggering of cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
His running mate Hsiao has been sanctioned twice by China for being a “stubborn secessionist.”
Speaking to the media ahead of his victory speech on Saturday night, Lai called his win a “victory for the community of democracies.”
“We are telling the international community that between democracy and authoritarianism, we still stand on the side of democracy,” he said.
“I will act in accordance with our democratic and free constitutional order in a manner that is balanced and maintains the cross-strait status quo,” he added. “At the same time, we are also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China”.
“In the future, we hope that China will recognize the new situation, and understand that only peace benefits both sides of the strait,” he added.
Lai’s victory comes as the US is trying to stabilize fraught relations with China and prevent competition from veering into conflict. During Tsai’s administration, Taiwan bolstered ties with the United States, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
US officials have said that Washington will uphold its longstanding policy toward Taiwan no matter who takes on the top job. The Biden administration will dispatch an unofficial delegation – including former senior officials – to Taipei following the election in keeping with past practice, according to senior officials.
The delegation visit “will be a signal, a very symbolic way of supporting Taiwan,” said T.Y. Wang, a professor at Illinois State University.
Saturday’s result is another major blow for Taiwan’s Kuomintang, which back warmer relations with Beijing and have not held the presidency since 2016.
Beijing made little secret of its desire to see the KMT return to power. During campaigning the KMT accused Lai and the DPP of needlessly stoking tensions with China.
Lev Nachman, a political science professor at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said that while Lai has to make some economic adjustments given deep public grievances over low wages and unaffordable housing, on issues like foreign policy and cross-strait relations he is expected to largely follow Tsai’s approach.
“So much of (Lai’s) campaign has been trying to reassure not just a domestic audience, but international audience that he is Tsai Ing-wen 2.0,” he said.
That will not be welcome in Beijing.
Days before the election, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said by following Tsai’s path, Lai is pursuing a path of provocation and confrontation and will bring Taiwan “closer and closer to war and recession.”
Analysts say China could escalate economic and military pressure on Taiwan to show its displeasure in the coming days and weeks, or save a more forceful response for May, when Lai takes office.
“There’s multiple times that China could cause a fuss over a DPP victory, either now or later this year,” Nachman said.
And Beijing has a wide range of coercive measures in its toolbox too.
In the lead-up to the vote, China ended preferential tariffs for some Taiwanese imports under a free trade agreement. It could broaden the scope of goods targeted, or even suspend the agreement altogether.
China can also further ramp up its military pressure on Taiwan, sending more fighter jets and warships close to the island’s skies and waters, a tactic it has deployed with increased frequency in recent years.
But Taiwan’s security officials said ahead of the vote that they didn’t expect large-scale military actions from China right after the election, citing unsuitable winter weather conditions, troubles in the Chinese economy, and efforts by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties following a bilateral summit in November.
And while an escalation of military tension could increase the risks of accidents and miscalculations, it doesn’t necessarily portend an imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait, analysts noted.
“Just because the DPP is in power doesn’t mean China’s going to war,” said Nachman.
“The last eight years have obviously been uncomfortable with the DPP in power, but it hasn’t led to war, they’ve been able to find an uncomfortable middle ground. And the hope is that even with a Lai presidency that we can continue to have this sort of uncomfortable silence without having to go to war.”"
THEKYAKZ2P_LDPJ0IRLL93LWCH,Pakistan condemns deadly Iranian missile strike on its territory as tensions spike across region,"By Jonny Hallam, Asim Khan and Helen Regan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:15 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/17/middleeast/iran-missile-attack-pakistan-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian airstrike inside its borders that killed two children, calling it an “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warning of retaliation.
Iran said it used “precision missile and drone strikes,” to destroy two strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, in the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan’s southwest Balochistan province, according to Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency.
Tuesday’s attack comes after Iran launched missiles in northern Iraq and Syria Monday, in the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East where Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza risks spiraling into a wider regional conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said the attack on its territory killed “two innocent children” and warned Iran of “serious consequences.”
It described the airstrike as an “unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran … inside Pakistani territory.”
“It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the ministry said.
Pakistan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador from Iran and suspended all Iraninan high-level visits.
“Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” Mumtaz Baloch, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a televised address.
She said the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan should not return from a current visit to Iran and warned “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act.”
China urged Iran and Pakistan to exercise restraint in handling their ongoing conflict after the deadly strike. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on both countries to “avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.”
A spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the strike was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan,” but stressed India has “zero tolerance towards terrorism.”
Iran launches missile strikes in northern Iraq and Syria, claims to destroy Israeli spy base
The Jaish al-Adl militant group late Tuesday said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had used six attack drones and a number of rockets to destroy two houses where the children and wives of its fighters lived.
Authorities in Balochistan province told CNN two girls had died and at least four people were injured. The girls, aged eight and 12, were killed in houses that were damaged in the attack in the village of Koh-e-Sabz in Kulag, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Panjgur district, on Tuesday evening, according to the district’s deputy commissioner Mumtaz Khetran.
Khetran also said a mosque near the homes was targeted and hit in the strikes.
Koh-e-Sabz — about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Pakistan’s border with Iran — is known to be the home of Jaish al-Adl’s former second-in-command Mullah Hashim, who was killed in clashes with Iranian forces in Sarawan, an Iranian region adjacent to Panjgur, in 2018.
Last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice, is a separatist militant group that operates on both sides of the border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its stated goal is the independence of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan province, which neighbors Pakistan.
On Wednesday, it claimed responsibility for an attack on an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) vehicle in Sistan and Baluchistan that Iranian state media says killed one of its colonels.
Jaish al-Adl said on its official website that it had targeted an IRGC pick-up truck on the outskirts of Iranshahr.
Colonel Hossein Ali Javadanfar was killed in the attack, according to the IRGC’s Sepah news.
CNN cannot independently verify Jaish al-Adl’s claim.
Iran said Wednesday it “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that “none of the nationals of the friendly country of Pakistan were targeted” in the strike.
“We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. But we don’t allow our national security to be compromised and to be played with and we have no reservation when it comes to our national interests,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The strikes in Pakistan came a day after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards launched ballistic missiles, targeting what it claimed was a spy base for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Erbil, northern Iraq, and at “anti-Iran terror groups” in Syria.
Iran said the strikes in Iraq were in response to what it said were Israeli attacks that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders, and claimed targets in Syria were involved in the recent dual bombings in the city of Kerman during a memorial for the slain Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani that left scores dead and wounded.
It defended the strikes as a “precise and targeted” operation to deter security threats, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement on Tuesday.
Iran’s attacks will further raise fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could widen into a full-scale war in the Middle East with grave humanitarian, political and economic consequences.
The attacks in Iraq and Syria were condemned by the United States as “reckless” and imprecise, while the United Nations said, “security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.”
Iraq said it submitted a complaint to the UN Security Council and the UN on Tuesday. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said there are no Mossad-affiliated centers operating in Erbil in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
But, speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria at Davos, Iran’s Foreign Minister repeated the country’s claim that the strike on Iraq was a response “against elements and agents of Mossad,” and said Iran has “very good relations” with both Iraq and Pakistan.
“We have talked and agreed for several times on the necessity of fighting terrorism,” he said, adding that the action taken by Iran “targeted Israel that remains a common enemy of both of us,” and that the country would respond to any attack “vigorously.”
He stressed that if Israel’s war in Gaza ends, then other conflicts across the Middle East would too. “If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks has killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, and wrought widespread devastation, as civilians live with the threat of imminent death – either by an airstrike, starvation or disease.
The conflict has escalated hostilities across the region, with Iran’s allies and proxies – the so-called axis of resistance – launching attacks on Israeli forces and its allies.
On Tuesday, the US military launched new strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen, targeting anti-ship ballistic missiles controlled by the Iran-backed rebel group, a defense official told CNN.
A few hours later, the Houthis launched a missile into international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea, hitting the M/V Zografia, a Maltese flagged bulk carrier, the official said.
The strikes are at least the third round of attacks the US military has launched against the Houthis’ infrastructure since last Thursday, when American and British conducted a joint operation that targeted command and control nodes and weapons depots used by the Houthis to launch missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have also repeatedly come under rocket and drone attacks from Tehran’s proxies. Last week, the US carried out a strike in Baghdad that killed a leader from an Iran-backed proxy group that Washington blamed for attacks against US personnel in the region.
And fighting has intensified between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah, across the Lebanon border. On Sunday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed to press on with confrontations with Israeli forces on the Lebanon border until the end of the Israeli offensive in Gaza.
