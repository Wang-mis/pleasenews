The death toll from a landslide in southwestern China has now risen to 25 on Tuesday as more than 1,000 first responders are combing through the rubble in a mountainous village as part of a desperate search for survivors.
One of the rescuers working the disaster scene in Liangshui says there are unstable soil conditions, Reuters is reporting, citing local media. First responders in the village in China’s Yunnan province are already dealing with freezing temperatures and falling snow.
""It is difficult to carry out large-scale mechanical operations, and it is very difficult to rescue on site,"" the rescuer said, according to Reuters.
Chinese state television says following the landslide that struck early Monday, 25 people have been confirmed dead, 19 are still missing and three have been rescued, Reuters also reported.

Authorities resumed search and rescue operations Tuesday after suspending the work temporarily due to another landslide alert.
More than 1,000 rescuers are participating in the operation, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management. Two of the survivors that were rescued Monday are recovering at a local hospital.
State news agency Xinhua, citing a preliminary investigation by local experts, said the landslide was triggered by the collapse of a steep clifftop area, with the collapsed mass measuring around 330 feet wide, 200 feet in height, and about an average of 20 feet in thickness. It did not elaborate on what caused the initial collapse.

Greg Steube. R-Fla., joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the state of the 2024 GOP primary race and why he believes it is time for Republicans to band together supporting Trump.
Former President Trump said anyone who contributes to his opponent's campaign will be barred from the ""Make America Great Again"" MAGA community - but former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley quickly used the comment to her campaign's advantage.
In a TruthSocial post Wednesday, Trump hit Haley with insults ranging from ""Birdbrain"" to saying ""she was average at best"" when serving in his administration.
""Nikki ""Birdbrain"" Haley is very bad for the Republican Party and, indeed, our Country. Her False Statements, Derogatory Comments, and Humiliating Public Loss, is demeaning to True American Patriots,"" Trump wrote in a lengthy post.
The former president then went on to write that anyone who contributes to Haley's campaign ""will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp.""

Rather than stay silent, Haley reposted Trump's message on X with a link to donate to her campaign.

(via Miami-Dade Police)
The Florida grandmother charged in a murder-for-hire plot to kill her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel, waived a potential conflict of interest her own lawyer has in the case at a hearing Monday.
Attorney Daniel Rashbaum is also representing Donna Adelson's son, Charlie Adelson, a dentist who is serving a life sentence for his role in plotting Markel's 2014 murder.
She waived the potential conflict and her right to obtain outside counsel. But she could still lose her lawyer if he is called as a witness in the case.

Miami police arrested the 73-year-old Adelson at an airport in November, where she allegedly had a one-way ticket to Vietnam. A prison phone recording of a call between her and her son showed she discussed fleeing to Vietnam, China and Korea to avoid extradition.
Bodycam video of the arrest released earlier Monday showed her resisting officers' attempt take the cellphone out of her hand before they slapped her in handcuffs in front of her husband, who has not been charged in the murder conspiracy.

Florida prosecutors have charged Adelson with first-degree murder and solicitation of murder in Markel's death.

The Adelsons also allegedly opposed Markel's desire to raise the children in a kosher household.

Markel died when gunmen ambushed him in his Tallahassee driveway on July 18, 2014. That morning, he dropped his children off at day care and went to the gym. As he returned home, he was on the phone with a charter school representative discussing his children's enrollment when a hitman shot him in the head.

063MI0ID1C_L48SEOW915M885E,Wisconsin Republicans hastily approve new legislative maps,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 6:28am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-republicans-hastily-approve-new-legislative-maps,"Catholic Memorial High School President Donna Bembenek and Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty’s Rick Esenberg discuss the state’s latest lawsuit claiming that the school choice law is unconstitutional.
Wisconsin Republicans made a last-ditch effort Tuesday to avoid having the liberal-controlled state Supreme Court put in place new legislative district boundaries for the November election.
The Republican-controlled Senate passed new Senate and Assembly maps just over an hour after unveiling them, not giving the public or Democrats a chance to review them ahead of their release. Democrats said they didn't have time to analyze the proposal before the vote.
And Assembly Republicans were discussing passing maps as proposed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers without any changes. That could stop the Wisconsin Supreme Court from ordering maps that were even worse for Republicans.
WISCONSIN REPUBLICANS WOULD MAINTAIN MAJORITY IN PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE MAPS, BUT WITH REDUCED DOMINANCE
Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu said that the new maps approved by the Senate were the same as what Evers proposed, but with changes to reduce the number of Republican incumbents who would have to face one another in November.
Republican Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos talks to the media on Feb. 15, 2022. (Andy Manis)
The governor's map was ""clearly a partisan attack on us,"" LeMahieu said.
""We just wanted to make things somewhat fair,"" he said.
In yet another twist, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he supports passing the maps as proposed by Evers with no changes. He said Republicans can win under the lines drawn by Evers.
""We would basically be giving Gov. Evers a huge win,"" Vos said shortly after Evers concluded his State of the State speech. ""Adopting his maps, stopping the lawsuit seems like something to me we could agree on, but I’m waiting on Gov. Evers to get back to us.""
Evers’ spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
The Assembly could vote on the maps Wednesday.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court last month tossed the current Republican-drawn district boundaries as unconstitutional and ordered new maps. Evers, Republicans, Democrats and others submitted maps that two consultants hired by the court are now reviewing. Their recommendation is due Feb. 1, and the court is expected to release new maps shortly after.
But the court said it would defer to the Legislature if it could pass maps that Evers would sign into law.
Evers and Democrats appeared unlikely to back the new Republican maps passed by the Senate which made changes to what he proposed.
""This is about one thing: Republicans desperately trying to retain power,"" Evers' spokesperson Britt Cudaback posted before the maps were released. ""Full stop.""
Cudaback said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that any maps that differ from the maps as Evers submitted them to the Supreme Court ""aren’t the governor’s maps. Period.""
If Evers vetoes the new Republican maps, it ""will just show his true intent of trying to disenfranchise Republican voters around the state,"" LeMahieu said.
Democrats said the maps, detailed in a 169-page amendment, were an attempt by Republicans to protect their majorities that sit at 22-11 in the Senate and 64-35 in the Assembly.
""This is not a serious proposal that we have before us,"" Democratic Sen. Mark Spreitzer said. ""These maps make changes that protect Republican incumbents.""
The Senate passed the bill 17-14, with four Republicans joining 10 Democrats against. No Democrats voted for it.
All maps under consideration by the Wisconsin Supreme Court are expected to shrink Republican majorities.
WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT TOSSES GOP-DRAWN LEGISLATIVE MAPS, ORDERS NEW VOTING BOUNDARIES
Under the Evers map, Republicans would have a seven-seat majority in the Assembly, down from 29 seats now, and just a one-seat edge in the Senate, based on an analysis by Marquette University Law School research fellow John D. Johnson. His analysis used a statistical model to predict the results of the 2022 state legislative election had they taken place in the newly proposed districts.
LeMahieu said the changes Republicans were proposing to Evers' maps would not affect the partisan breakdown of each district.
This isn't the first time Republicans have tried to take control of redistricting. In September, three months before the court ordered new maps, the Assembly passed a sweeping plan that takes the power of drawing maps out of the hands of lawmakers and gives it to nonpartisan staff.
But Evers rejected the plan, calling it ""bogus,"" even though it largely resembled a nonpartisan redistricting plan he’s pushed for years.
It was that bill that Senate Republicans amended before passing it Tuesday. It was passed just hours before Evers delivered his State of the State address."
07II3RR2KI_DJXY2IJ88KZ875L,Doctor's ex-employer sought to subpoena firefighter boyfriend before she died in his house: court docs,By Michael Ruiz Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 4:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doctors-ex-employer-sought-subpoena-firefighter-boyfriend-before-she-died-his-house-court-docs,"Ricky Johnson, 38, Clayton McGeeney, 36 and David Harrington, 37, were found dead outside their friend Jordan Willis' home two days after a watch party for the Kansas City Chiefs game on Jan. 7. (Fox 4 KC)
The former employer of a doctor found dead in the home of a Missouri firefighter whose previous fiancee killed herself in his house had sought to subpoena him in a federal lawsuit, court filings reveal.
A memorandum filed in a lawsuit and counterclaim between Dr. Sarah Sweeney and the Best Foot Forward podiatry clinic also claimed that she had described her boyfriend as ""abusive."" It was filed in September, just months before police opened an investigation into her ""sudden death.""
Sweeney, a 39-year-old podiatrist originally from West Virginia, was suing the St. Louis clinic that she'd worked for after moving to Missouri and before she founded her own practice, alleging harassment and discrimination and that her employer allegedly failed to compensate her for her work.
Her unexpected death on Jan. 13, which remains under investigation, has drawn renewed attention to the 2020 suicide of Grace Holland, 35. Both women died in the homes of a local fire captain, Robert Daus.
2 MISSOURI WOMEN FOUND DEAD IN SAME FIREFIGHTER'S HOME YEARS APART

Attorneys for her former employer were trying to subpoena Daus in the case, arguing that communications between the two could be ""directly relevant"" if they pertained to her physical or mental health.
""During Sweeney’s employment with BFF, she was in a relationship with a person upon whom BFF and Harry have been attempting to serve with a subpoena, Rob Daubs (sic), who was according to Sweeney abusive and was suspected of murdering a previous girlfriend,"" Mark Murphy, an attorney representing the defendants, wrote.
Daus has actually not been named a suspect in Holland's death, which was not considered a murder.
It was ruled a suicide by the county medical examiner and two separate police investigations, but her family is suing him alleging wrongful death, and has accused him of abusing her as well.
Read the filing:
Murphy was seeking text messages between Sweeney and a former colleague that might relate to her physical and mental health, especially in conversations that mentioned Daus.
He had also filed for a subpoena seeking ""all electronically stored communications between [Daus] and plaintiff Sarah Sweeney.""
Sweeney claimed in the lawsuit that the clinic denied her health benefits and caused her to incur medical debt and business loans when she left to found her own practice. As recently as Dec. 21, she told the court her personal assets consisted of just $212 and was in palliative care due to the lack of health insurance.

""I moved to St. Louis, Missouri from Texas in order to work for defendants. Due to the financial exigencies caused by that employment – by not being paid consistently or fully and by not having health insurance – I have alternately been homeless and moved several times since I arrived,"" she told the court. ""I am currently living with my boyfriend. Most of my belongings are in boxes.""
Both the clinic and its owner filed a counterclaim, accusing her of breaching her employment agreement, violating a no-compete clause and libel, among other things.
MISSOURI FIREFIGHTER'S FIANCEE AUTOPSY REVEALS ‘SUSPICIOUS’ SCENARIO, EXPERTS SAY
Daus' attorney has not responded to numerous requests for comment.
Dr. Sweeney's family told Fox News Digital earlier this week that she stopped communicating with her mother and stepfather after they sent her news stories about Holland's death.
Holland's family has claimed that the firefighter, a captain in the Maryland Heights Fire District, controlled her finances and that they suspected domestic violence in the months before her death.

Creve Coeur's chief of police, Jeffrey Hartman, stood by his department's investigation into Holland's death Wednesday and said county police had reviewed the case and come to the same conclusion – suicide.
He has also cautioned against speculation in Sweeney's case as her autopsy and toxicology results are not yet available.

Some educators are urging the largest teachers union in the U.S. to rescind its support for President Biden until a ""permanent cease-fire"" occurs in Gaza.
According to The Nation, teachers are organizing to urge the National Education Association, an organization of over 3 million members, to rescind its support for Biden’s re-election after first announcing it last April.
Rahaf Othman, a 45-year-old Palestinian American and social studies teacher, told The Nation that she was ""distraught"" to find out about the Israel-Palestinian conflict that started with the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7.
She explained further that the matter is personal because ""our union has been very focused on racial and social justice, and supporting him when he is not only funding but also sending weapons killing my people sends me the message that we don’t matter, and that we are collateral damage and that’s OK.""

Othman, a member of the Illinois Education Association (IEA) Local 218, said she joined the effort to sway the NEA to drop its endorsement for Biden until he ""secures a permanent cease-fire,"" The Nation reported.
Even a member of the NEA board of directors is joining the engagement.
The outlet further reported that teachers are calling for the U.S. to end ""sending military funding, equipment, and intelligence to Israel"" and commit ""to a fair due process for asylum-seekers and refugees.""
The Nation described the effort as a ""small-but-growing campaign in the US labor movement.""
""For the first month, people were asking me what we should do, but I couldn’t think, couldn’t focus,"" Othman told the Nation.
""Educators rallied together and created this group, Educators for Palestine. I am grateful they brought me along for the ride.""

(Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital)
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLS RISK CLOSURE DUE TO 'MASSIVE' ENROLLMENT LOSS: NEW REPORT
The teachers go further by planning to withhold voluntary donations from the union’s political action committee ""until NEA takes this step."" Members are not planning to withhold union dues, however.
As the effort is in its early stages of development, the outlook of potential support is not yet realized, though The Nation reported that the supporters are noticing ""momentum.""
The outlet added the group of members pushed 19 local, state, and regional bodies of the NEA to pass resolutions calling for a cease-fire in Gaza and claim credit for NEA President Rebecca Pringle’s tweet in support of a cease-fire.
While members work on building the movement's support, NEA members are planning to protest alongside the American Federation of Teachers at an NEA board meeting in February.

The effort comes after Pringle announced that the NEA is recommending Biden and Vice President Harris ""continue their leadership in prioritizing America’s students, educators, and public schools as the Democratic nominees for re-election.""

TORONTO (AP) — The lawyer for a Canadian man accused of selling lethal substances on the internet to people at risk of self harm said he will be pleading not guilty to upgraded murder charges.
Kenneth Law was charged in December with 14 counts of second-degree murder, and his lawyer, Matthew Gourlay, confirmed Friday those have now all been upgraded to first-degree murder.
DR. JORDAN PETERSON DEFIANT AFTER COURT MANDATES SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING: 'THE GOAL IS TO TAKE MY LICENSE'
An international investigation is underway following the arrest in Canada last year of the 58-year-old Law, who was initially charged with two counts of counseling and aiding suicide last year. More charges were announced in December.
Canadian police say Law, from the Toronto area, used a series of websites to market and sell sodium nitrite, a substance commonly used to cure meats that can be deadly if ingested. He is accused of shipping them to people in more than 40 countries.

British police said they are investigating the deaths of 88 people in the U.K. linked to the websites. Authorities in the United States, Italy, Australia and New Zealand also have launched investigations.
Law’s case was set to return before a Newmarket, Ontario, court on Tuesday, but Gourlay said that will not take place as scheduled since the case will instead go directly to trial in Superior Court. Gourlay said his next court appearance is now expected to be next Thursday in Superior Court.
The Ministry of the Attorney General didn't immediately respond to a message asking why the charges were upgraded to first degree murder. Peel Regional Police referred comment to the ministry.

Police have said all charges against Law relate to the same 14 alleged victims, who were between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in communities across Ontario. The believe more than 1,200 packages were sent out globally, and about 160 were sent in Canada.
It is against the law in Canada for someone to recommend suicide, although assisted suicide has been legal since 2016 for people aged at least 18. Any adult with a serious illness, disease or disability may seek help in dying, but they must ask for that assistance from a physician."

Gretchen Whitmer warned on Sunday that President Biden could face protesters when he visits the state amid mounting backlash from progressives over his support for Israel.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request from Michigan’s redistricting commission to overrule an order to redraw 13 Detroit-area seats in the Legislature, a decision that will likely make the legislative maps more competitive.
The redistricting commission had asked the high court to overrule a December ruling by a three-judge federal appeals court panel that Michigan's legislative maps were illegally influenced by race when drawn in 2021. The panel ruled that although nearly 80% of Detroit residents are Black, the Black voting age population in the 13 Detroit-area districts mostly ranges from 35% to 45%, with one being as low as 19%.
The panel ordered that the seven state House districts have their boundaries redrawn for the 2024 election, and it set a later deadline for the six state Senate districts because the senators' terms don’t expire until 2026.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)
The Supreme Court did not explain its decision in the order released Monday. Attorneys for the commission did immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
John Bursch, an attorney for the Detroit voters who sued the commission, said they were ""very pleased"" by the order. Bursch said the commission could still appeal, but he called the Supreme Court's order ""a strong indicator that such an appeal will likely fail.""
Although it’s unknown how the new maps will be drawn, there would likely be an increase in the number of ""Detroit-focused"" districts that would be solidly Democratic, said David Dulio, a political science professor at Oakland University in Michigan. That would likely affect districts in the suburbs, which would become more competitive as a result, he said.
""You could see these districts, or even a subset of them, really be where the fight for control of the state House is,"" Dulio said.
The office of Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had supported the commission's request to the Supreme Court in recent days. It wrote in a filing that the Democrat was concerned about having new district lines in place by the August primary.
""My commitment to maintaining fair and secure elections remains steadfast, and I look forward to working with our clerks in the months ahead to ensure everyone is ready and prepared to administer safe and accessible elections this year,"" Benson said in a statement Monday.
Michigan Democrats were able to flip the state House and Senate in 2022 while retaining the governor’s office, giving them full control of state government for the first time in 40 years. The party’s success had been attributed, in part, to legislative maps that were redrawn in 2021 by an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.
State lawmakers drew the boundaries for Michigan’s seats in Congress and the Legislature until voters in 2018 created an independent commission to handle the once-a-decade job. The commission's first maps were produced for the 2022 election.
BIDEN STRUGGLING IN MICHIGAN, DEMOCRATS WARN, AS LEVEL OF CONCERN GROWS: 'THE PROBLEM IS THE MAN'
Experts repeatedly told the redistricting commission in 2021 that certain percentages regarding race were necessary to comply with federal law. The appeals court judges disagreed, though.
""The record here shows overwhelmingly — indeed, inescapably — that the commission drew the boundaries of plaintiffs’ districts predominantly on the basis of race. We hold that those districts were drawn in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution,"" Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote.
The redistricting process had reduced the number of majority-minority districts in the Legislature from 15 to five, according to the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University.
The 2022 midterms, the first election since redistricting, saw the number of Black lawmakers in the Legislature reduced from 20 to 17. Detroit, which is predominantly Black, was left without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the early 1950s."

Biden challenger Dean Phillips defied his party's efforts to squash the primary process, saying that he would ""win as a Democrat.""
The Democratic presidential candidate joined ""Fox & Friends"" Monday ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Biden chose to skip the state's primary entirely after New Hampshire declined to give up its first primary slot to South Carolina.
Phillips said he felt compelled to enter the race because his party needs new leadership and Americans aren't on board with Biden.
""I see this trainwreck occurring and someone has to say the quiet part out loud. All I'm doing is saying the truth,"" he said.

Poll after poll has shown a majority of Americans, and even Democrats, want a different candidate on the 2024 ballot, citing the president's age and increasing dissatisfaction with the economy.
Phillips has been open about his belief that Biden's dismal approval ratings are because Americans think he is too old to continue leading the country.
""He is not standing in front of the press. He is not here meeting voters. He is not answering questions. He is not doing town halls and he won’t do debates. I think he is a good man. I don’t think he has cognitive issues. But he is 81 years old, he's in decline. By the way, we have issues coming down the pipeline; Artificial Intelligence, wars in the Middle East and in Europe. A southern border that’s a disaster. And costs are out of control. We need new leadership. That’s what this is about more than anything,"" Phillips argued.
Despite being a long-shot candidate, Phillips reiterated his high hopes to secure the nomination.

""We started at 0% ten weeks ago, last tracking poll yesterday, 32%. People want change,"" he argued.
The Biden challenger also shot down rumors he was considering a third party run.
""I'm a Democrat, I'm going to run as a Democrat and I'm going to win as a Democrat,"" he insisted.
Iowa and New Hampshire have historically been the first states in the Democrats' election process. However, President Biden and the DNC attempted to change the primary calendar this year to kick off with South Carolina, a state that propelled the president to victory in 2020, to try and increase racial diversity in the election process.
The Democratic National Committee called the New Hampshire election outcome ""meaningless.""
While Biden supporters are organizing a write-in campaign to prevent Phillips from securing a win, he still says he hopes to secure upward of 20% of the vote.

Police in Illinois have arrested the girlfriend of Romeo Nance, the shooter accused of killing 7 family members in a series of homicides at two homes last weekend before taking his own life earlier this week in Texas.
The Joliet Police Department says 21-year-old Kyleigh Cleveland-Singleton is now being held at the Will County Adult Detention Facility on a charge of Obstructing Justice.
""Upon locating Cleveland-Singleton, she voluntarily agreed to be transported to the Joliet Police Department for questioning in reference to the homicides,"" police said in a Facebook post. ""Following questioning of Cleveland-Singleton, Detectives believed that she made statements in order to prevent the apprehension of the suspect and obstruct this investigation.""
Nance ultimately was found by U.S. Marshals near Natalia, Texas, at about 8:30 p.m. Monday and shot and killed himself with a handgun following a confrontation with law enforcement there, according to police.

An attack on Israel's forces in the Gaza Strip on Monday left 21 soldiers dead, its military said Tuesday. The attack was the deadliest for Israeli troops since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7 that triggered the war.
According to the Israeli military, reservists were preparing explosives to demolish two buildings in central Gaza when a militant fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a tank nearby. The blast from the rocket outside the buildings triggered the explosives inside them, causing both two-story buildings to collapse on the soldiers.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mourned the loss of the soldiers, saying Monday was ""one of the hardest days"" since the war began.
At least 217 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began in late October, including three in a separate event on Monday, according to the military.

Monday’s attack could become a major setback to renewed calls for a cease-fire as Netanyahu vowed the IDF will continue its war with Hamas until ""absolute victory.""
""In the name of our heroes, and for our own lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory,"" he wrote on the social media website X, formerly Twitter.

Hours after Israel announced the attack, its military said ground forces had encircled the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israel claims Hamas’ leaders are in hiding.

A cease-fire in November resulted in Hamas releasing more than 100 of its hostages – of some 250 hostages it took during its surprise attack on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7 – in exchange for a weeklong cease-fire and the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
International pressure and pressure from within Israel’s Knesset have urged Israeli leaders to negotiate another cease-fire for the remaining captives.

According to the Associated Press, a senior Egyptian official said Israel has proposed a two-month cease-fire to free the remaining hostages. In exchange, Israel would release additional Palestinians from its prisons and Israel would allow top Hamas leaders in Gaza to relocate to other countries.

NEW DELHI (AP) — The French president arrived Thursday in India where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was set to be the chief guest at the country’s national day celebrations.
Emmanuel Macron began his visit with some sightseeing in the western city of Jaipur, a popular tourist destination, where he visited a 17th-century fort and an 18th-century observatory.
FRANCE CLAMPS DOWN ON MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BY HALTING APPOINTMENT OF FOREIGN CLERICS
Modi greeted him at the observatory and the two stood in an open jeep as they were driven for about 1.5 kilometers (one mile). Large crowds lining the streets welcomed them with a showering of rose and marigold petals.
Large cutouts of their images with the inscription ""India-France Friendship"" dotted the route. Macron waved at the crowd.
French President Emmanuel Macron will be the guest of honor at India's Republic Day parade.
""His presence not only strengthens the ties between our nations but also adds a significant chapter to our shared history of friendship and collaboration,"" Modi said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Macron and Modi later held a meeting at a hotel in Jaipur before flying to New Delhi. There was no immediate official statement about the outcome of the meeting, but they were expected to discuss major global challenges including economic, defense, space and cyber security, as well as France's role in the Indo-Pacific region.
France is looking to strengthen cooperation with India in areas ranging from climate to military sales, despite frictions over the two countries' attitudes toward Russia's war on Ukraine.
""Macron is committed to the pursuit of a closer dialogue with India, a key player on the international scene from a demographic point of view, as well as economic, scientific and diplomatic,"" his office said in a statement on Wednesday.
France has reiterated its commitment to a defense relationship with India, including sharing technology. The two countries are working on co-development and co-production defense projects, the Indian External Affairs Ministry said.
The two leaders were expected to continue discussions on India’s plans to purchase 26 French Rafale fighter aircraft for its navy, approved by India's Defense Acquisition Council last year. The council also approved a plan to purchase three Scorpene submarines, jointly developed by France and Spain.
France already has delivered 36 Rafale fighter aircraft ordered by the Indian Air Force.
Three ministers are traveling with the President: Sébastien Lecornu, Minister of the Armed Forces; Stéphane Sejourne, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs; and Rachida Dati, Minister of Culture.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Thousands of people on Thursday joined growing street protests across Slovakia against a plan by populist Prime Minister Robert Fico to amend the penal code and eliminate a national prosecutors' office.
The proposed changes have faced sharp criticism at home and abroad.
SLOVAKIA'S GOVERNMENT, LED BY FIERY CRITIC OF UKRAINE AND JOURNALISTS, SURVIVES MANDATORY CONFIDENCE VOTE
The plan approved by Fico’s coalition government includes abolishing the special prosecutors’ office, which handles serious crimes such as graft, organized crime and extremism. Those cases would be taken over by prosecutors in regional offices, which haven’t dealt with such crimes for 20 years.
The planned changes also include a reduction in punishments for corruption and some other crimes, including the possibility of suspended sentences, and a significant shortening of the statute of limitations.
Protests against plans to amend Slovakias penal code have gained steam in the Eastern European nation.
Thursday’s protests took place in two dozens of cities and towns, including the capital, and spread also to Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Krakow in Poland and Paris.
""We’re not ready to give up,"" Michal Šimečka, who heads the liberal Progressive Slovakia, the strongest opposition party, told the big crowd that filled the central SNP square in Bratislava.
""We will step up our pressure,"" Šimečka said. ''We will defend justice and freedom in our country,"" he said.
""Mafia, mafia"" and ""Fico mobster,"" people chanted.
Earlier Thursday, the ruling coalition voted to use a fast-track parliamentary procedure to approve the changes. That means the draft legislation won’t be reviewed by experts and others usually involved in the common legislative procedures.
The coalition also voted to limit the discussion in the first of the three parliamentary readings. The opposition condemned the move.
""They decided to silence us in Parliament but they won’t silence you all,"" Šimečka said.
The second reading, in which changes could possibly be made to the draft legislation, could take place next Wednesday while the final vote is possible by the end of next week.
President Zuzana Čaputová said the proposed changes jeopardize the rule of law and cause ""unpredictable"" damage to society.
Also, the European Parliament has questioned Slovakia’s ability to fight corruption if the changes are adopted. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office has said Slovakia’s plans threaten the protection of the EU’s financial interests and its anti-corruption framework.
Čaputová said she is willing to bring a constitutional challenge of the legislation. It’s unclear how the Constitutional Court might rule.
Fico returned to power for the fourth time after his scandal-tainted leftist party won Sept. 30 parliamentary elections on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform.

A number of people linked to the party face prosecution in corruption scandals.
Fico’s critics worry his return could lead Slovakia to abandon its pro-Western course and instead follow the direction of Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán."

FIRST ON FOX: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Monday promised that ""the fight is not over"" after the Supreme Court granted an emergency appeal by the Biden administration to allow Border Patrol agents to resume cutting razor wire set up by Texas at the southern border.
""The Supreme Court’s temporary order allows Biden to continue his illegal effort to aid the foreign invasion of America,"" Paxton said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""The destruction of Texas’s border barriers will not help enforce the law or keep American citizens safe,"" he said. ""This fight is not over, and I look forward to defending our state’s sovereignty.""
SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH BIDEN IN TEXAS BORDER WIRE CASE; BORDER PATROL UNION BLASTS THE DECISION
The court ruled in a 5-4 decision to allow the federal government to resume the removal of the fence installed by Texas along the southern border near Eagle Pass while litigation continues.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the three liberal justices in a 5-4 vote to allow the practice to resume. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh would have denied the application to vacate injunction, the court said.

Paxton had sued the administration in October over its damaging of the wire, accusing the administration of disrupting state efforts to secure the border and damaging the ability to deter illegal entry.
The Biden administration has argued that once migrants are on U.S. soil, Border Patrol agents must apprehend them, and has claimed the wire ""inhibits Border Patrol’s ability to patrol the border."" The administration has also argued that federal immigration law supersedes Texas' own efforts to control the border.
A Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals panel had granted a request for a preliminary injunction. The DOJ had asked the Supreme Court for temporary relief so that it could remove razor fence at the federal government’s discretion.
""The court of appeals’ contrary ruling inverts the Supremacy Clause by requiring federal law to yield to Texas law,"" its application to the Court argued. ""If accepted, the court’s rationale would leave the United States at the mercy of States that could seek to force the federal government to conform the implementation of federal immigration law to varying state-law regimes.""
The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that it welcomed the Supreme Court order.
""Enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility,"" a spokesperson said. ""Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the State of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law.  We can enforce our laws and administer them safely, humanely, and in an orderly way.""
DOJ RENEWS SCOTUS PUSH TO ACT AFTER TEXAS SEIZES BORDER AREAS, BLOCKS BORDER PATROL FROM ENTERING

Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, said the ruling would ""undoubtedly encourage more illegal immigration.""
""Unfortunately, this means Border Patrol agents are going to be tied up dealing with give ups rather than going after the criminal elements that constantly cross our borders illegally,"" Judd said in a statement to Fox News. ""The administration no doubt will say this is a win for border security, but if they sought rank and file input, they would be told this will do the exact opposite. Agents support what Texas was trying to accomplish in the absence of true border security policies from this administration.""
WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY STATEMENTS REGARDING MIGRANT DROWNINGS AS TEXAS SLAMS ‘VILE’ NARRATIVE
The battle is one of a number between the federal government and the Lone Star state over the situation at the southern border. The DOJ has also sued the state over the deploying of buoys in the Rio Grande to stop illegal crossings.
Meanwhile, the federal government has also sued over a recently-signed anti-illegal immigration law which allows state and local law enforcement in Texas to arrest illegal immigrants.

""As with all Minnesota law enforcement officers, state troopers may only use deadly force when it is necessary to protect a person from a specific identified threat of great bodily harm or death that was reasonably likely to occur. That did not exist in this case. Ricky Cobb II should be alive today,"" Moriarty said.

Londregan shot Cobb after he refused to leave his car during a stop on a Minneapolis freeway, according to the Minnesota Public Safety Department’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates police shootings.

Trooper Brett Seide initially pulled Cobb over when he saw the taillights were out on the Ford Fusion Cobb was driving, according to the bureau.

The bureau has said previously that Seide checked Cobb’s record and found he was wanted for a ""probable cause arrest for a felony order-for-protection violation"" issued by the nearby Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office.
Londregan and Trooper Garrett Erickson arrived later and helped as Seide tried to pull Cobb out of the car before Londregan shot him and Cobb drove away. The vehicle Cobb was driving stopped on the interstate shortly after that, and the bureau said the troopers attempted to save Cobb. He died at the scene."

Michael McCaul, R-Texas, discusses Congress' extension of the budget deadline, the border crisis and the impeachment push against Alejandro Mayorkas.
A caravan of over 500 migrants seeking to cross into the U.S. dissolved before reaching the border, Guatemalan officials said Monday.
The caravan originated in Honduras but dissolved shortly after crossing the border into Guatemala on Sunday, the Guatemalan Migration Institute says. Guatemalan authorities stopped the caravan a few miles after it entered the country and returned those without proper documentation to Honduras.
Those who had documentation were allowed to continue on, though Guatemala did not offer details on how many of the migrants had such documentation.
Several similar caravans have crossed into the U.S. illegally in recent months.

The failed Honduran caravan comes roughly a month after a caravan of roughly 8,000 people made its way through Mexico toward the U.S. in late December.
President Biden's administration has sought to downplay record-high levels of illegal immigration seen in the late months of 2023. As many as 10,000 migrants were arrested daily at the southwest U.S. border in December, but the White House sought to pass it off as a seasonal surge.

There were 242,418 migrant encounters at the southern border in November — the highest November on record and the third-highest month ever.

""What we’re seeing here at the border, the increased migration flow, certainly, it ebbs and flows,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""And we’re at a time of the year where we’re seeing more at the border. And it’s not unusual. This is an immigration system that has been broken for decades. And the president has taken this very seriously to try to do more. That’s why we have the comprehensive immigration policy legislation that the president put forth on day one.""
In the past, Mexico has let migrants go through their southern border, trusting that they would tire themselves out walking along the highway.

This has historically been the case as, according to The Associated Press, no migrant caravan has walked the entire 1,000 miles to the U.S. border. However, in recent years, migrants have secured access via buses, trains and other transportation to get them to the border.

American University in Washington, D.C., has been hit with a federal complaint alleging that Jewish and Israeli students have experienced ""persistent and threatening anti-Semitic rhetoric and conduct"" on campus.
The complaint was filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and Jewish on Campus Jan. 17 with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, according to a press release. It alleges university staffers were ""fully aware of the pervasive and hostile environment for Jewish students"" and not only ignored it, but in some cases ""chose to subject Jewish whistleblowers to harassment and disciplinary proceedings.""
The 24-page complaint attached to the Brandeis Center release details alleged incidents on campus, including one incident where a Jewish Israeli student was spit on by fellow students and his piano recital flyer was vandalized with swastikas and ""DEATH TO THE ZIONISTS HITLER WAS RIGHT.""
Dormitory doors and posters of Jewish and Israeli students have also been vandalized with swastikas and threats, according to the complaint. Anti-Israel protests have been referred to as ""out-of-control"" while also disrupting classes.

""Jewish students report feeling fearful, anxious, shunned, isolated and marginalized,"" the Brandeis Center press release says.
""American University supports the safety, well-being, and sense of belonging of our Jewish students. They are a community which is and always has been an important part of the fabric of AU,"" the school's vice president and chief communications officer, Matt Bennett, said in a statement.

A small unincorporated community in northern New Hampshire was the only region of the Granite State to cast ballots during a midnight voting tradition for Tuesday's primary and all six registered voters voted for former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley.
The six Dixville Notch voters cast their ballots after polls opened at midnight in a tradition that began with the 1960 election.
Two of the other communities that typically cast the state's first ballots decided not to participate in midnight voting this year. Hart's Location and Millsfield will instead hold voting for the primary during daytime hours.

""Our population is getting older in Millsfield, and getting up at midnight to go vote is getting harder and harder for our population,"" Millsfield election official Shawn Cote previously told WMUR.
The process of casting and counting votes in Dixville Notch is quick given the low number of voters and the results are immediately reported across the country.

Barry Loudermilk giving a Capitol tour to a group that included a rioter.
EXCLUSIVE: The former House Select Committee on Jan. 6 deleted more than 100 encrypted files from its probe just days before Republicans took over the majority in the House of Representatives, Fox News Digital has learned.
The House Administration Committee's Oversight Subcommittee is leading an investigation into Jan. 6, 2021, led by Chairman Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. The panel is investigating the security failures on that day, as well as the ""actions"" of the former select committee investigating the Capitol riot.
HOUSE INVESTIGATION INTO 'WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6' ENTERING 'NEW PHASE' WITH SPEAKER JOHNSON SUPPORT
Loudermilk, last week, told Fox News Digital his investigation has entered a ""new phase"" with renewed support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who has committed additional resources to the panel’s investigation.
Sources familiar with Loudermilk’s investigation told Fox News Digital that, per House rules, the former select committee, which was chaired by Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., was required to turn over all documents from its investigation to the new, GOP-led panel, after Republicans secured the majority of the House of Representatives following the 2022 midterm elections.

Sources told Fox News Digital that Thompson had told Loudermilk that the select committee would turn over four terabytes of archived data, but that the new committee only received approximately two terabytes of data.
Fox News Digital has learned that Loudermilk’s committee hired a digital forensics team to scrape hard drives to determine what information they were not given.
The forensics team, according to sources familiar with their search, determined that 117 files were both deleted and encrypted. Sources said those files were deleted on Jan. 1, 2023 – just days before Thompson’s team was required to transfer the data to the new committee.
Fox News Digital has learned the forensics team has recovered all 117 deleted and encrypted files. Now, Loudermilk is demanding answers and passwords to access the data.
Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a letter Loudermilk sent to Thompson, requesting access to recovered digital files by his forensic team.
""As you acknowledged in your July 7, 2023 letter, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (Select Committee) did not archive all Committee records as required by House Rules,"" Loudermilk wrote. ""You wrote that you sent specific transcribed interviews and depositions to the White House and Department of Homeland Security but did not archive them with the Clerk of the House.""
REP. LOUDERMILK BLASTS JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE FOR TARGETING HIM: 'THERE IS A WAR ON THE TRUTH IN THIS COUNTRY'
Loudermilk added that Thompson also ""claimed that you turned over 4-terabytes of digital files, but the hard drives archived by the Select Committee with the Clerk of the House contain less than 3- terabytes of data.""

Loudermilk explained that after a forensic analysis of the data and archived hard drives, he was able to recover ""numerous digital records from hard drives archived by the Select Committee.""
""One recovered file disclosed the identity of an individual whose testimony was not archived by the Select Committee,"" Loudermilk wrote. ""Further, we found that most of the recovered files are password-protected, preventing us from determining what they contain.""
Loudermilk asked that Thompson provide him ""a list of passwords for all password-protected files created by the Select Committee"" so that his committee can ""access these files and ensure they are properly archived.""

Meanwhile, Loudermilk also penned letters to White House general counsel and the general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, requesting ""unedited and unredacted transcripts"" of White House and DHS testimony to the former select committee.
Loudermilk's committee knows the transcripts of these interviews exist, but said they were not turned over by the Thompson-led committee.
Loudermilk demanded the White House and DHS comply with his request by Jan. 24.
""It’s obvious that Pelosi’s Select Committee went to great lengths to prevent Americans from seeing certain documents produced in their investigation. It also appears that Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney intended to obstruct our Subcommittee by failing to preserve critical information and videos as required by House rules,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital.
""The American people deserve to know the full truth, and Speaker Johnson has empowered me to use all tools necessary to recover these documents to get the truth, and I will.""

How to spot, prevent phishing attacks in your inbox","By Kurt Knutsson, CyberGuy Report Fox News","Published January 22, 2024 6:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dont-click-that-link-how-to-spot-prevent-phishing-attacks-in-your-inbox,"Kurt Knutsson provides advice on how to identify safe email links and tips for safeguarding your email account against phishing attacks.
Imagine this nightmare scenario. You receive an email from your health insurance provider, let's say it's Blue Shield, asking you to update your personal information by clicking on a link. You think it’s a routine request, so you click on the link and enter your name, date of birth, and social security number. The next thing you know, your identity is stolen, and your credit score is ruined.
This is a common occurrence of a phishing attack, a type of online scam that targets your email account. Phishing attacks are designed to trick you into clicking on malicious links, opening infected attachments, or providing personal information to hackers who want to steal your money, identity, or data. It's definitely a concern of Don, from Michigan, who wrote to us asking,
""You mention not to tap/select links in emails, how do I know if email links are OK to select? (like Blue Cross Blue Shield??)"" — Don, Michigan
Well, Dan, that is a great question that we will answer and share some tips on how to protect yourself from these attacks.

A person typing on a laptop (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Here are three simple and effective ways to check if an email link is safe to select. These tips will help you avoid clicking on links that could lead you to phishing websites or malware downloads.
One of the best ways to check if a link is safe to select is to inspect the link before clicking on it. To do this, you can carefully hover your mouse over the link and look at the web address that appears. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, or unfamiliar, don’t click on it.
When in doubt, go directly to the company’s website by manually typing in the web address, or searching for the site in a search engine. Most often, the first or second result that comes up is legitimate. If you see the word ""Sponsored ""above the search result, take a beat before clicking it and consider clicking on the result below it.
Example of inspecting a link in an email (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Another way to check if an email link is safe to select is to verify the sender of the email. Make sure that the email is from a legitimate source and not a spoofed or fake one. Scammers often use slight variations or impersonate legitimate sources. You can do this by looking at the sender’s email address and name. If the email address or name doesn’t match the sender’s identity, don’t trust the email.
If you’re still unsure about the authenticity of an email or a link, you can contact the sender directly and ask them to confirm. Don’t use the contact information provided in the email, but look for it on their official website or other trusted sources. Whatever you do, do not click on any links or provide personal information.

Pause before clicking. Before you click on any link or open any attachment, take a moment to evaluate it and ask yourself these 3 questions:
If the answer is no to any of these questions, then you should absolutely not click on any link or open the attachment. These links or attachments may look harmless, but they can actually contain harmful malware that can damage your device or steal your data. It’s better to be safe than sorry when it comes to email attachments.

MORE: ANOTHER HOME THERMOSTAT FOUND VULNERABLE TO ATTACK
Here are 6 tips to protect your email account from phishing attacks.
#1 CyberGuy tip: Use antivirus software: This is perhaps one of the best investments you can make for yourself to protect yourself from phishing scams. Having antivirus software actively running on your devices will make sure you are stopped from clicking on any malicious links or from downloading any files that will release malware into your device and potentially have your private information stolen. Read my review of my best antivirus picks here.
2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Whenever possible, enable 2FA for your online accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a unique code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.
3) Keep software up to date: Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and antivirus software to ensure they are equipped to detect and prevent the latest threats. You can regularly check for these updates on your device's settings app for software updates, and you can go to your App Store or Google Play Store (depending on the device you have) to check for updates on individual apps. Follow these steps here.
4) Be cautious with personal information: Be wary of sharing sensitive information online, especially if it's unsolicited or seems suspicious. Legitimate organizations rarely ask for personal details via email.
5) Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization's official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.
6) Educate yourself and others: Stay informed about the latest phishing tactics and share this knowledge with friends, family, and colleagues. Awareness is a powerful tool in preventing scams.

If you've been hacked, it's not too late. There are several ways you can protect yourself from hackers, even when they have access to your information.
First, you'll want to scan your computer with a reputable and legitimate antivirus program. See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.
If you've inadvertently given your information to hackers or malicious actors, they could have access to your social media or banking accounts. To prevent this, you should change your passwords for all your important accounts as soon as possible. However, you should not do this on your infected device, because the hacker might see your new passwords. Instead, you should use ANOTHER DEVICE, such as your laptop or desktop, to change your passwords. Make sure you use strong and unique passwords that are difficult to guess or break. You can also use a password manager to generate and store your passwords securely.
You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, report it to the service provider or the authorities as soon as possible. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see signs of identity theft or fraud.
Phishing emails target your personal information. Hackers can use this information to create fake accounts in your name, access your existing accounts, and pretend to be you online. This can cause serious damage to your identity and credit score.
To avoid this, you should use identity theft protection services. These services can track your personal information, such as your home title, Social Security Number, phone number, and email address, and notify you if they detect any suspicious activity. They can also help you freeze your bank and credit card accounts to stop hackers from using them. Read more of my review of best identity theft protection services here.
If hackers have obtained your bank or credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should contact your bank and credit card companies and inform them of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges, and issue new cards for you.
If hackers have accessed your email or social media accounts, they could use them to send spam or phishing messages to your contacts. They could also impersonate you and ask for money or personal information. You should alert your contacts and warn them not to open or respond to any messages from you that seem suspicious or unusual.
If you want to make sure that your device is completely free of any malware or spyware, you can restore it to factory settings. This will erase all your data and settings and reinstall the original version. You should back up your important data before doing this, and only restore it from a trusted source.

Making you and your family resilient from these growing dangers needs to be your number one priority. Protecting yourself from phishing attacks is crucial. Falling victim to such scams can result in identity theft, financial losses, and data breaches. Don't let yourself become a target. By following the steps we’ve outlined above and staying vigilant, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling prey to phishing attacks. Your online security is in your hands, so make informed choices to protect your personal information and data.

1KY0ATBAEF_QJ85WAITGFAS0FP,US laughs off reports of Putin eyeing Alaska as Russia's 'former real estate': 'Not getting it back',By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 7:25am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-laughs-off-reports-putin-eyeing-alaska-russia-former-real-estate-not-getting-it-back,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The U.S. State Department on Monday brushed off reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to look into reclaiming what he deems former Russian ""real estate,"" including Alaska.
""Let me just understand that he signed something today that said that the sale of Alaska is illegitimate? Well, I speak for all of us in the, in the U.S. government to say that certainly he is not getting it back,"" State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said at his daily briefing when asked about the reported decree.
According to the Russian state news agency TASS, Putin signed a decree on Friday to allocate funds to the Russian Department of Foreign Property of the Administrative Directorate of the President of the Russian Federation to cover ""the process of searching the real estate property owned by the Russian Federation, the former Russian Empire, the former USSR,"" as well as for ""due registration of [property] rights"" and ""legal protection of this property.""
It is unclear if Putin had his sights on Alaska, but the Institute for the Study of War, an American think tank, noted on Friday that, ""A prominent milblogger responded to the decree by implausibly calling for Russia to start enacting the law in ""Alaska"" and throughout a significant portion of eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia.""
""We suggest starting with Alaska, the Dnieper Ukraine, Bessarabia, the Grand Duchy of Finland, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Central Asian states of Russian Turkestan, most of the Baltic provinces, and a significant part of Poland,"" the Russian nationalist blogger wrote on Telegram, sharing a photo of Putin's decree. ""Property can be searched both in the GDR and in other Warsaw Pact countries. An expedition of combat legal defenders has already set out for Africa.""

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev seemed to mock Patel's comment about Alaska later Monday. ""According to a State Department representative, Russia is not getting back Alaska, which was sold to the U.S. in the 19th century. This is it, then. And we’ve been waiting for it to be returned any day. Now war is unavoidable,"" he wrote on X.
During a 2014 question-and-answer session, Putin, when asked if he had plans regarding the ""annexation of Alaska,"" described the 1867 sale at $7.2 million as ""inexpensive.""
""Alaska was sold sometime in the 19th century. Louisiana was sold to the United States by the French at about the same time. Thousands of square kilometers were sold for $7.2 million, although in gold. We can calculate the equivalent amount, but it was definitely inexpensive,"" Putin said, according to a Washington Post transcript. ""Russia is a northern country with 70% of its territory located in the north and the far north. Alaska is not located in the southern hemisphere, either, is it? It’s cold out there as well. Let’s not get worked up about it, all right?""
Russian journalist Kirill Kleimyonov had joked during the session, ""That's a popular joke, Mr. Putin. They call Alaska ‘Ice Crimea’ in jest.""

However, the prospect of Moscow reclaiming Alaska was also referenced by Russian politician Sergey Mironov as recently as December, when he reacted on X to Venezuela approving a referendum to take over neighboring oil-rich Essequibo region controlled by Guyana.
""Did you want a new world order? Receive and sign. Venezuela annexed a 24th state, Guyana-Essequibo. This is happening right under the nose of the once great hegemon of the United States. All that remains is for Mexico to return Texas and the rest. It's time for Americans to think about their future. And also about Alaska,"" he wrote on Dec. 6.

Russia ""offered to sell Alaska to the United States in 1859, believing the United States would off-set the designs of Russia’s greatest rival in the Pacific, Great Britain,"" according to the State Department's Office of the Historian. ""The looming U.S. Civil War delayed the sale, but after the war, Secretary of State William Seward quickly took up a renewed Russian offer and on March 30, 1867, agreed to a proposal from Russian Minister in Washington, Edouard de Stoeckl, to purchase Alaska for $7.2 million. The Senate approved the treaty of purchase on April 9; President Andrew Johnson signed the treaty on May 28, and Alaska was formally transferred to the United States on October 18, 1867.""

The purchase ""ended Russia’s presence in North America and ensured U.S. access to the Pacific northern rim,"" the office says, noting how the 1867 sale, ""marked the end of Russian efforts to expand trade and settlements to the Pacific coast of North America, and became an important step in the United States rise as a great power in the Asia-Pacific region.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Sri Lankan lawmakers on Tuesday began debating a controversial internet safety bill that has been criticized by opposition politicians, journalists and rights groups as a move by the government to stifle freedom of speech.
Public Security Minister Tiran Alles introduced the bill in Parliament, saying it seeks to address problems related to online fraud, abuse and false statements that threaten national security and stability.
He said the laws are necessary to deal with offenses committed online, noting that last year more than 8,000 such complaints were filed with police related to sexual abuse, financial scams, cyber harassment, data theft and other offenses.
SRI LANKA PRESIDENT FLEES COUNTRY, PROTESTERS STORM PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AS STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED
However, media, internet and civil rights groups say the bill would have ""a chilling effect on free speech,"" as several provisions would serve to undermine human rights and freedom of expression. The groups have demanded that the government withdraw the bill.

Lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday.
The bill aims to establish an online safety commission with ""wide-ranging powers to restrict free speech"" that could direct users, service providers and others to ""take down content and block access to accounts on extremely vague and overbroad grounds,"" said Article 19, a rights watchdog, and 50 other groups.
Opposition lawmaker Rauff Hakeem said the government is trying to throttle freedom of speech in Sri Lanka, adding that ""a very oppressive environment is going to be created.""
""This is a manifestation of a government which is trying to dismantle even the remaining few safeguards for freedom of expression in this country and to destroy democracy,"" Hakeem said.
Alles rejected the accusations, saying the bill was not drafted with the intention of harassing media or political opponents.
Debate over the bill comes as Sri Lanka struggles to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which hit the island nation two year ago. The country declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half of it to foreign creditors.
SRI LANKA DRUG CRACKDOWN LEADS TO MORE THAN 40,000 ARRESTS, DRAWING CRITICISM FROM UN
The crisis caused severe shortages of food, fuel and other necessities. Strident public protests led to the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The IMF agreed last March to a $2.9 billion bailout package.
Under new President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine have largely abated over the past year and authorities have restored power supply. But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government’s effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses.
Media and civil rights groups accuse the government of trying to introduce more repressive laws in an attempt to ""suppress the public’s right to expression as a narrow effort with the aim of winning the upcoming elections at any cost.""
Sri Lanka’s presidential and parliamentary elections are likely to be held later this year or early next year."

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil's federal police are investigating the former head of the nation's intelligence agency as part of a probe into alleged spying on political opponents under former President Jair Bolsonaro, according to an officer with knowledge of the operations.
The former intelligence chief, Alexandre Ramagem, was among those targeted by the 21 search warrants police carried out Thursday morning, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to comment publicly on the case.

Ramagem did not comment publicly on the search warrant.
Police are investigating an ""organized crime"" group within the intelligence service, known by its Portuguese acronym ABIN, according to a police statement. The group ""used tools and services of the state intelligence agency for illicit actions, producing information for political and media use, to obtain personal benefits and interfere with police investigations,"" it said.

Bolsonaro appointed Ramagem to lead ABIN in May 2019. The right-wing leader had previously appointed him to be federal police chief, but quickly yielded to growing criticism around the nomination due to the fact that Ramagem was widely seen as too close to the president's family.

Members of Brazil's intelligence agency are suspected of using spy technology to track cellphones without judicial authorization, according to police. In October, the force arrested two people and carried out 25 search warrants.
Ramagem is now a federal lawmaker and pre-candidate for mayor in Rio de Janeiro, with elections slated for October. Local paper O Globo reported that Bolsonaro's son, Carlos, will coordinate Ramagem's social media during his campaign."

Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt weighs in.
A judge on Monday ordered court records of the divorce proceedings of a special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who is handling the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump, be made public and delayed the decision on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis will be deposed.
Cobb County, Georgia Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson ruled that he was vacating a previous order that kept records of the divorce proceedings sealed. That is what attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman, had asked the court to do.
""I find that the prior order, although it was by consent parties, was not properly entered because uniform's superior court rules require a hearing to be had. We can find no evidence that any such hearing was ever had so I'm going to grant the motion, vacating the consent order sealing the record. And I'll do that today. I have your written order,"" Thompson said. The judge then said Merchant could be dismissed from the hearing.
Thompson later addressed Cinque Axam, a lawyer for Willis, saying the court would not yet decide on whether the Fulton County DA will be deposed. Willis' deposition was originally set for Tuesday, but the judge said he first wants to hear from Nathan Wade on allegations of an extramarital affair directly during an evidentiary hearing in the divorce case set for Jan. 31.

""It seems to me that Mr. Wade would be the first and best source of information on what his income has been and how he's been spending it. And that he would have firsthand knowledge of whether he's engaged in an extramarital affair,"" Thompson said. ""Only after I hear what Mr. Wade has to say, do I think I can make a determination of whether the proposed deponent has any unique knowledge about these issues, because once again, this is a math problem, and we need to find a solution to.""
""So with all that being said, I'm not prepared. Mr. Axam, to grant your protective order. But since the deposition is set for tomorrow and our first evidentiary hearing is set for the 31st, I will issue a stay,"" the judge continued. ""And I will stay the deposition until I'm in a better position to make a determination of whether the proposed deponent would have any unique knowledge, unique being the key word there, that is not possessed by Mr. Wade himself.""
A motion filed last week by the defense attorney in the election case alleges that Willis was involved in a romantic relationship with attorney Nathan Wade.

Axam wrote in a filing Thursday that lawyers for Wade's wife, Joycelyn Wade, served a subpoena to the district attorney last week.
The filing says that the subpoena is being sought ""in an attempt to harass and damage"" Willis’ professional reputation and accuses Joycelyn Wade of having ""conspired with interested parties in the criminal Election Interference Case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass, and oppress"" the district attorney.
The attempt to question Willis is ""obstructing and interfering"" with an ongoing criminal case, Axam wrote in the court filing Thursday seeking to quash the subpoena.
Andrea Hastings, a lawyer for Joycelyn Wade, said they want to help her ""resolve her divorce fairly and privately.""

In a response filed Friday, Hastings wrote that Nathan Wade has taken trips to San Francisco and Napa Valley, Florida, Belize, Panama and Australia and has taken Caribbean cruises since filing for divorce and that Willis ""was an intended travel partner for at least some of these trips as indicated by flights he purchased for her to accompany him.""

The filing includes credit card statements that show Nathan Wade, after he had been hired as special prosecutor, bought plane tickets in October 2022 for him and Willis to travel to Miami and bought tickets in April to San Francisco in their names. Joycelyn Wade’s filing says she is seeking to question Willis about ""her romantic affair"" with Nathan Wade, saying there ""appears to be no reasonable explanation for their travels apart from a romantic relationship.""
Trump and 18 allies were indicted in Georgia over their alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, with prosecutors using a statute normally associated with mobsters to accuse the former president, lawyers and other aides of a ""criminal enterprise"" to keep him in power.

The United States is urging allies around the world during a monthly defense meeting on Tuesday to continue supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, despite running out of funding to do so itself.
The U.S. has hosted this monthly gathering since April 2022 and has been Ukraine's chief financier during that span, but it will now have to do so for the first time without available funds to give to Ukraine. Instead, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is attempting to convince about 50 countries to continue sending ammunition and missiles to Ukraine and to keep bridging the gap in support until Congress passes a budget with money for Ukraine’s fight.
Austin appeared at the meeting virtually as he is still recuperating at his home from prostate cancer surgery.
""Our support for Ukraine's struggle against tyranny makes all of our countries more secure,"" Austin said. ""If we lose our nerve, if we flinch, if we fail to deter other would be aggressors, we will only invite even more bloodshed and more chaos. So a sovereign and secure Ukraine is critical to global security and we must not waver in our support for Ukraine.""

According to deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh, Tuesday's meeting is focusing on Ukraine’s longer-term needs.
""Even though we aren’t able to provide our security assistance right now, our partners are continuing to do that,"" Singh said.
The U.S. has been emptying its stockpiles to assist Ukraine and has been using Congress-allocated funding to replenish these reserves. However, it has run out of money and has not been able to provide additional munitions since December 2023.
The last security assistance for Ukraine was sent on Dec. 27. It was a $250 million package that included 155 mm rounds, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other high-demand items, the Pentagon announced.

The ability of the Defense Department to continue funding Ukraine’s war with Russia as well as Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza hinges on policy priorities between the White House and the U.S. Congress, including funding disagreements between the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate and the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.

1U2MDL7LZM_61MPTM6YEKZLR7I,UK museums return looted artifacts to Ghana under long-term loan arrangement,Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 1:15pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-museums-return-looted-artifacts-ghana-long-term-loan-arrangement,"Fox News contributor David Webb responds to news that 'Doctors Against Genocide' was set to protest inside the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
Two British museums are returning looted gold and silver artifacts to Ghana under a long-term loan arrangement as U.K. institutions face increasing demands to hand over treasures acquired at a time when the British Empire ruled over people around the globe.
The British Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, together with the Manhyia Palace Museum in Ghana, announced the ""important cultural’’ collaboration on Thursday. The loan sidesteps U.K. laws that bar the repatriation of such cultural treasures and have been used to prevent the British Museum from returning the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, to Greece.
Some 17 items are involved in the loan arrangement, including 13 pieces of Asante royal regalia purchased by the V&A at auction in 1874. The items were acquired by the museums after British troops looted the royal palace in Kumasi during the Anglo-Asante wars of 1873-74 and 1895-96 and represent a small fraction of the artifacts held in the U.K.
US RETURNS MORE THAN 250 STOLEN ARTIFACTS TO ITALY WORTH MILLIONS
""These objects are of cultural, historical and spiritual significance to the Asante people,’’ the museums said in a statement. ""They are also indelibly linked to British colonial history in West Africa, with many of them looted from Kumasi during the Anglo-Asante wars of the 19th century.""

(Dominic Naish, Victoria and Albert Museum, London via AP)
Countries including Nigeria, Egypt and Greece, as well as indigenous peoples from North America to Australia, are demanding the repatriation of artifacts and human remains amid a global reassessment of colonialism and the exploitation of local populations.
Nigeria and Germany recently signed a deal for the return of hundreds of Benin Bronzes, a general term for a trove of sculptures, cast plaques and royal regalia created from the 16th century onwards in the West African kingdom of Benin. That followed French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to sign over 26 pieces known as the Abomey Treasures, artworks from the 19th-century Dahomey kingdom in present-day Benin, a small country in west of Nigeria.
But the U.K. has been slower to respond. Officials argue that the objects were acquired legally and that institutions like the British Museum have long preserved them in an environment where they can be seen and studied by people from around the world.
The British government said the Ghana deal did not set a precedent for the Parthenon Marbles, which are the subject of a long-running diplomatic battle between the U.K. and Greece. The sculptures originally decorated the frieze of the Parthenon in Athens and were acquired by Lord Elgin, a British aristocrat and collector, in the early 18th century.
""This isn’t a new approach,"" said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesman, Max Blain. ""There have been a number of loans. These take place from time to time between museums.""
He added that Britain ""would expect the items to be returned at the end of that loan period.""
'JERUSALEM OF GOLD': VOLUNTEER UNEARTHS ARTIFACT OF 'GREAT VALUE' AT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE
The items covered by the loan agreement include a ""soul disk,"" which the Asante king wore to protect his soul, as well as a peace pipe and seven sections of sheet-gold ornaments. They represent only a small portion of the Asante objects held by British museums and private collectors around the world. The British Museum alone says it has 239 items of Asante regalia in its collection.
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, special adviser to Ghana’s culture minister, said the deal was a ""starting point,"" given British laws that prohibit the return of cultural artifacts. But ultimately the regalia should be returned to its rightful owners, she told the BBC.
""I’ll give an analogy, if somebody came into your house and ransacked it and stole objects and then kept them in their house, and then a few years later said, ‘You know what, I’ll lend you your objects back,’ how would you feel about that?"" she said."
1VCFK3F1AU_JJGW1J45SA0YE0L,US lawmakers express bipartisan support for Taiwan during congressional visit,Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 2:25pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-lawmakers-express-bipartisan-support-taiwan-during-congressional-visit,"The Federalist senior contributor Helen Raleigh breaks down the significance of Taiwan’s election amid China tensions.
A bipartisan delegation from the United States Congress reaffirmed support for Taiwan during a visit Thursday following its election of a new president. The delegation’s visit is the first by U.S. lawmakers to the island since the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third-straight term in the Jan. 13 election.
China, America’s chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring the self-governed island under its control. Beijing strongly condemned Lai Ching-te's election and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage with the island’s government — a practice that's been in place since outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016.
""The support of the United States for Taiwan is firm. It’s real, and it is 100% bipartisan,"" U.S. Representative Mario Díaz Balart said.
TAIWAN'S ELECTIONS WERE A BIG SUCCESS. JUST ASK XI
Balart, a Florida Republican, was joined by California Democrat Ami Bera. ""In the 21st century, there’s no place for aggressive action. We have to learn to live together, to trade together, to work together, to solve problems together,"" Bera said.
""Just know that we are proud of the people of Taiwan. We are proud of the relationship, and as strong as that relationship has always been. That is assured. It will even be stronger,"" Balart said.
""So, we look forward to working together to continue to protect the peace, prosperity (and) the future of Taiwan. It’s up to people of Taiwan,"" Bera said.

President-elect Lai thanked the visiting co-chairs of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus for their visit, saying that ""today’s Taiwan is a Taiwan of the world.""
Lai also touched on continued military assistance from the U.S. and a proposed agreement to avoid mutual taxation of companies.
Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan. In 2022, it responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile launches and a simulated blockade of Taiwan. It views visits by foreign government officials as a recognition of the island’s sovereignty.
President Joe Biden, seeking to calm that complaint, insists there’s no change in America’s longstanding ""one-China"" policy, which recognizes Beijing as representing China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taiwan.
Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island has the ability to defend itself. That has translated into a heavy reliance by Taiwan on U.S. military hardware and a law saying that Washington must treat threats against the island as a matter of ""grave concern.""
China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and harass Taiwan, with 18 planes and six ships operating near the island in the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Thursday. Three Chinese balloons were recorded as crossing the island, although it remains unclear whether they have a military or intelligence gathering purpose.

""We understand the pressures and the type of coercion of the Chinese Communist Party, and yet the Taiwanese people spoke loud and clear,"" Balart said at a late Thursday news conference. ""Taiwan is a beacon of hope and of life and of freedom and of democracy and it is such a direct contrast to what we're seeing coming from the Communist Party of China.""
Bera said Taiwan's future ""should not be dictated by any external power. But the future of Taiwan is up to the people of Taiwan.""
The U.S. does not want to change the status quo between China and Taiwan, but ""we have to respond to external pressures and others that potentially are changing that status quo,"" Bera said. ""It's about seeking peace, prosperity and the right to your own future."""

A New Hampshire National Guard officer who led a battalion on the southern U.S. border has pleaded guilty to assault and several other crimes and been sentenced to a reprimand, the U.S. Army said Thursday.
A military judge in Texas on Wednesday convicted and sentenced Lt. Col. Mark Patterson as part of a deal in which he pleaded guilty to assault consummated by a battery, sexual harassment, conduct unbecoming an officer, violation of a general order and other charges, said Army spokesperson Leah Garton. She said that the sentence was ""consistent with the terms of a plea agreement.""
Defense attorney Joseph Jordan said his client owned up to his errors. He said the judge also took into consideration that Patterson had a brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.
NEW HAMPSHIRE NATIONAL GUARD OFFICER EXPECTED TO BE CHARGED WITH ASSAULT, SEXUAL HARASSMENT
""He took responsibility for exactly what he did wrong, and that is why his sentence was only a reprimand. It is important to remember that this is a decorated combat veteran who suffers greatly from documented PTSD and TBI,"" Jordan said. ""All of that was taken into account, yesterday.""

Patterson, of Weare, New Hampshire, was deployed with his unit to the southern border in October 2022 and assigned to support U.S. Border Patrol. In January 2023, the Army opened an investigation and Patterson, then commander, was reassigned, an Army spokesperson said previously. The investigation concluded in May and led to the court-martial at Joint Base San Antonio–Fort Sam Houston in which Patterson pleaded guilty.

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — The president of Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland has said his government will press ahead with an agreement signed earlier this month with landlocked Ethiopia to give it access to the sea by way of Somaliland’s coastline.
The deal has been condemned by regional and international groups, as well as Western countries, which say it interferes with Somalia’s territorial integrity and is causing tensions that could threaten stability in the Horn of Africa region.
US FORCES CARRY OUT AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTHERN SOMALIA, KILLING 3 AL-SHABAAB TERRORISTS
Somalia has also protested the deal as a threat to its sovereignty by Somaliland, a region strategically located along the Gulf of Aden that broke away from Somalia in 1991 as the country collapsed into warlord-led conflict. Somaliland has not been internationally recognized.
Somaliland's President Muse Bihi Abdi gave more details about the memorandum of understanding he signed on Jan. 1 with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in an interview with Somaliland National Television on Wednesday.

Ethiopia, Abdi said, is seeking to lease a segment of the coastline for a naval base — and not for commercial activities as previously thought. In exchange for leasing a 20 kilometer- (12.4 mile-) stretch of Somaliland's coastline, Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland as an independent state.
Ethiopia will still be able to conduct its import and export activities through the port of Berbera, the largest in Somaliland. Berbera is not part of the coastline stretch planned for the lease.
With a population of more than 120 million, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world. It lost its access to the sea when Eritrea seceded in 1993. Since then, Ethiopia has been using the port in neighboring Djibouti for most of its imports and exports.
Somalia has protested vehemently against the agreement that would grant Ethiopia access to the strategically important Gulf of Aden and beyond that, to the Red Sea.
Somaliland's citizens are divided over the deal, with some seeing potential economic benefits while others fear compromising their sovereignty. The breakaway region's defense minister, Abdiqani Mohamud Ateye, resigned over the deal.
Earlier this month, a meeting of officials from the African Union, European Union and United States reaffirmed their support for Somalia's sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, including the breakaway region of Somaliland.
Michael Hammer, U.S. special envoy for the Horn of Africa, said during that meeting that the U.S. is particularly concerned that tensions over the deal could undermine international-backed efforts to combat al-Qaida-linked militants in Somalia.
Matt Bryden, a strategic consultant at Sahan Research, a think tank based in Kenya, said several diverse actors in the region could unite against the agreement — including Egypt, Eritrea and even the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militants — and oppose a more powerful role of Ethiopia.

""Eritrea is likely to be deeply concerned, given its deteriorating relationship with Ethiopia and its long Red Sea coastline,"" Bryden said.
Egypt, embroiled in a dispute with Ethiopia over Addis Ababa's construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam that Cairo says could hamper its share of the Nile River water, could also oppose the project, he added."

""Blue Bloods"" star Donnie Wahlberg and Jenny McCarthy are ""very much in love"" but don't want to be considered a ""Hollywood couple.""
""We're proud of the fact that we're a successful couple,"" Wahlberg, who partnered with Clean Fuels Alliance America, told Fox News Digital. ""We kind of shudder at the term Hollywood couple. Like, when we got together and people were like, 'New Hollywood couple, they'll last two years.'""
Wahlberg explained he took offense to those comments and doesn't believe Hollywood defines him and McCarthy's relationship. The actor and actress tied the knot in 2014 and will be celebrating their 10-year wedding anniversary in August.

""We're like, first of all, we're going to last more than two years. Second of all, we're not a Hollywood couple. We're a couple. Hollywood has nothing to do with our relationship and, frankly, we have very little to do with Hollywood,"" Wahlberg explained.

Donnie told Fox News Digital his secret to a happy marriage consists of two things.
""First of all, we're very, very much in love. Two things that really have helped us the most is we put our relationship first in our lives despite the fact that we're both very busy,"" he said. ""We really put our relationship first in the decisions we make in our careers. We consult each other.""
Wahlberg recently partnered with Clean Fuels Alliance America, which connects ""leaders across the biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel industries to deliver better, cleaner fuels now for people and the planets,"" according to the company's website.
Donnie's decision to partner with the organization was partly due to McCarthy.

Wahlberg told Fox News Digital the partnership with Clean Fuels Alliance America was ""unusual"" for him at first, but he was intrigued by the ""home heating oil aspect of it.""
""I grew up in a house in Boston that had a giant oil tank in the basement. I remember the oil guy coming and filling the tank and a lot of the homes in that region, in neighborhoods like I grew up in. Those homes, they need oil,"" he said.
Wahlberg explained Clean Fuels Alliance America as an opportunity for families, like the one he grew up in, to make an affordable change to help save the environment.

As for Donnie's second secret to a successful marriage with Jenny? It was learning from his past mistakes. The actor told Fox News Digital that since he and McCarthy both had past marriages, they ""both desperately wanted it to work.""
""So, we had to put in the work, and that's the other secret,"" Wahlberg said. ""People say relationships shouldn't be work, but if you care about something, you work hard at it. So many times people don't want to put that work into their relationship, and they think of work in a relationship as problems, but it's actually problem prevention and problem-solving if you put it in the work.""
Donnie often shows off his wife on social media and what they like to do for fun. On Tuesday, Wahlberg shared a video of himself and McCarthy dancing through the hallways of a hotel.
""Stay cool and Keep dancing!"" he captioned the post.
Wahlberg explained that it's very ""healthy"" for his children and McCarthy's son to see the pair putting in the work and effort to maintain a successful relationship.

Donnie shares two sons, Xavier and Elijah Wahlberg, with his ex-wife, Kimberly Fey. Jenny has one son, Evan, with her ex-husband, John Asher.
To Wahlberg, incorporating date nights into his routine with McCarthy is considered putting in the work.
""Date nights are work, you know? I don't mean it's difficult to have a date night, but you have to make the choice to give each other that time,"" Wahlberg said. ""It's very easy to get caught up in the kids and the jobs and the pets and the bills and all this stuff, and you just stop caring about the relationship.""

22PTEUM1FQ_RSL132V9IVAU1YZ,Pilot miraculously survives plane crash near New Hampshire home,By Michael Dorgan Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 2:49pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/pilot-miraculously-survives-plane-crash-new-hampshire-home,"A small plane crashed in a neighborhood in Londonderry, New Hampshire, Friday morning. (WFXT)
A small plane crashed in a wooded area behind a home in southern New Hampshire shortly after takeoff Friday morning, and the pilot — the sole occupant — was pulled alive from the wreckage, officials said.
The aircraft, a Beechcraft Model 99 twin-engine turboprop cargo plane, went down at the edge of a backyard on Colonial Drive in Londonderry around 7:30 a.m. after departing Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, according to the Londonderry Fire Department and a spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The pilot, who has not been identified, was pulled from the wreckage and transported to a local hospital and then to a hospital in Boston, Londonderry Fire Chief Bo Butler said at a press conference.
Officials did not reveal the nature of the victim's injuries, although the pilot was one of several people to call 911 for help and was conscious the entire time, Butler said.

Photos from the scene show the twisted metal of the wreckage on the ground between trees, and the tail of the aircraft appears to have broken off.
""He [the pilot] was probably about 70 feet from a residence, a single-family residence, where the line of the residence met the tree line of the woods,"" Butler said.
""Very, very close.""
Wiggins Air Flight 1046 was on its way to Presque Isle International Airport in Maine when it crashed, the FAA said.
It is unclear what caused the aircraft to crash, although investigators said the pilot radioed for help shortly after takeoff.
""It was a challenging environment because, as you can imagine, the fuselage is very compromised and damaged,"" Butler said. ""So, getting access to the pilot himself through the crews and through the rescue tools was very, very difficult. But, ultimately, they pulled it off relatively quickly.""

Butler said the pilot was lucky to survive.
""He ought to play the lottery, for sure. This was a very significant emergency response that we responded to, and a lot of things could have gone wrong further than the aircraft crashing itself. So, the mitigation efforts were very impactful and successful in this case.""
Butler praised his team for its quick response. A crew was on the scene eight minutes after receiving the 911 call, he said.

""This was an incredibly high-risk, low-frequency event that was professionally and competently mitigated by members of the Londonderry Fire Department,"" Butler said, noting there were downed power lines and the aircraft had around 250 gallons of fuel on board. A hazardous materials management (HAZMAT) team also responded, but there was no fire, he said.
Eddie Saktanaset, who owns the home near the crash site, told WBZ-TV that he and his wife heard a loud boom, and they started getting calls from their neighbors.

""I was surprised to see a plane crash,"" Saktanaset said. ""It sounded more like trees falling down.""
The crash had no impact on other flights using Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.

Authorities in Zambia said Tuesday they were frantically pumping water and mud from a Chinese-owned copper mine where seven miners were trapped underground.
The two Chinese workers and five Zambian ones were caught on Monday when water and mud entered the shaft where they worked at the Macrolink mine in Ndola, about 248 miles from the capital, Lusaka. Another miner escaped.

Copperbelt Province police commanding officer Peacewell Mweemba told The Associated Press that authorities were mobilizing equipment from various mining companies for what they hoped was still a rescue mission.

26AZRZMHEO_QLUQPQBHY5XL1Q4,Who’s protecting consumers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?,By Patrick Brenner Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 8:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/whos-protecting-consumers-consumer-financial-protection-bureau,"Legal battle looms over control of the agency.
Did you know that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) does not accept complaints against itself? That is what I was told when I tried to make such a complaint, right before being directed to submit my complaint by email to an address that is no longer monitored.
So much for protecting consumers….
Earlier this year, a former employee of the CFPB forwarded confidential records of 256,000 consumers to their personal email account.

The breach, which CFPB described as a ""major incident,"" was reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed by CFPB officials to lawmakers on March 21.
THINK TANK LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM CFPB AFTER AGENCY DATA BREACH
The records not only included details of consumers from one institution but also from seven other firms, compromising confidential supervisory information of 45 institutions in total. The reason for the unauthorized transfer remains unknown.
On behalf of the 256,000 American consumers whose protected information was compromised by the agency tasked with protecting consumers, what are we supposed to do? That’s a lot of consumer data lost. Are you affected? Am I affected? According to the latest reports, the CFPB has still not notified affected consumers.
Despite the CFPB's request, the employee hasn't deleted the emails, although no evidence suggests the data was shared further. The CFPB investigation found numerous emails with confidential and personal information.
The incident has drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers questioning the CFPB's data handling. In response, the CFPB emphasized its commitment to data privacy.
SUPREME COURT TAKES UP CASE THAT COULD DETERMINE CFPB'S FATE
As a consumer, what recourse do we have? If the CFPB found that a financial institution had suffered a breach of a similar magnitude, the fines and fees would be astronomical. For example, a 2017 data breach suffered by Equifax resulted in a settlement that would provide $700 million in monetary relief and penalties.
In a press release, I recently learned that CFPB Director Rohit Chopra was visiting Albuquerque, New Mexico. I called the CFPB to ascertain details of the visit with the intention of asking Chopra more about the anticipated outcomes of the data breach and any subsequent investigation. I was directed to call the news office, which failed to return my call and has not responded to my email.
Since I won’t be able to ask these pertinent questions of the director, I sought to emulate the complaint process by filing a complaint. I called the CFPB to file a complaint against the CFPB. ""We don't take complaints against ourselves"" was the official response.
The call center agent kindly provided me with an email address of the Office of the Inspector General and the phone number for that office.
WHAT IS THE CFPB?
I sent an email with my concerns about the data breach to the provided email, and received an automated response:
""The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Hotline no longer accepts e-mailed complaints and this mailbox is no longer monitored by OIG staff.""
After some searching, I found the online form for the OIG Hotline and was able to complete and submit my complaint there. But I received no confirmation that my complaint had been received with a notice that OIG is ""unable to provide status updates"" about my complaint.
CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER
No paper trail for consumer complaints against the CFPB? That’s odd. Despite the inability of the CFPB to receive and process complaints about themselves, I promptly filed a complaint using the CFPB’s online portal since I was left with no other alternative.
One of the fields on the complaint form asks a pertinent question: ""What would be a fair resolution to this issue?"" My response was ""Complete defunding and deconstruction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.""
The CFPB has given me the runaround. I can only imagine how hopeless the other 255,999 consumers feel about their privacy being violated by the agency supposedly tasked with safeguarding American consumers.

Something tells me that we need the Bureau to Protect Financial Consumers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the BPFCCFPB.

27AI5W3D7U_S2W0IVAUG1LGOSC,US expresses concerns over Sri Lanka's controversial internet regulation law,Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 4:22pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-expresses-concerns-sri-lankas-controversial-internet-regulation-law,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The United States expressed concerns over Sri Lanka's online regulation bill Thursday, a day after it passed overwhelmingly in Parliament over protests by the media, opposition and rights activists.
The Online Safety bill allows the government to set up a commission with a wide range of powers, including ordering people and internet service providers to remove online posts deemed ""prohibited statements."" It can also legally pursue people who publish such posts.
SRI LANKA PRESIDENT FLEES COUNTRY, PROTESTERS STORM PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AS STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED
Julie Chung, the U.S. ambassador in Sri Lanka, said the United States has concerns about the potential impact of the legislation and urged ""Sri Lanka to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people .""
""In addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs,"" Chung said in a statement posted on her X account.
Sri Lanka's so-called Online Safety bill has been the subject of significant opposition.
Critics say the law is an attempt by Sri Lanka’s governing coalition to stifle speech in an election year as the Indian Ocean island nation copes with an economic crisis that required an international bailout.
The media, opposition lawmakers, internet and civil rights groups say the measure would undermine human rights and freedom of expression.
Human Rights Watch said Wednesday that the bill would create a repressive law with broad and vague ""speech-related offenses punishable by lengthy prison terms.""
The Asia Internet Coalition, which has Apple, Amazon, Google and Yahoo as members, warned that the bill could undermine potential growth and foreign direct investment into Sri Lanka’s digital economy.
The government said the legislation addresses problems related to online fraud, abuse and false statements that threaten national security and stability. It denied the bill was drafted to harass media or political opponents.
Sri Lanka is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which hit the island nation two years ago. The country declared bankruptcy in 2022, with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half of it owed to foreign creditors.
The crisis caused severe shortages of food, fuel and other necessities, which fed strident public protests that led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. After Rajapaksa fled, then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as president by parliament.
The IMF agreed last year to a $2.9 billion bailout package for the hard-hit country.

Shortages of necessities have since abated, but public dissatisfaction has intensified as the government imposed new taxes on professionals and businesses and raised energy bills.
Rights groups say that with the presidential election coming later this year, Wickremesinghe has sought to stifle dissent by cracking down on anti-government protests and arresting protestors and activists."

A former Border Patrol official is putting a positive spin on the Supreme Court's decision to give the federal government authority over Texas' efforts to secure its southern border.
In court papers, the Biden administration argued that Texas' use of a razor wire fence along the state's border with Mexico impedes Border Patrol agents from reaching migrants as they cross the river. More notably, the government asserted that in any case, federal immigration laws trump Texas' own efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the country.
Retired Yuma Sector Border Patrol Chief Chris Clem told Fox News Tuesday that the high court siding with the executive branch would give a future Republican administration authority over states to secure the border.
SENATOR HAWLEY INTRODUCES BILL TO SLASH DHS FUNDING OF ‘LIBERAL PROPAGANDA’
""While it kind of hurts right now, let's play the long game,"" Clem said on ""America's Newsroom."" ""These Supreme Court rulings are going to set precedent. Three of the four border states on the southern border are run by Democratic governors who really aren't enforcing the law. Texas is. When there's a change in administrations, hopefully as soon as this upcoming election, we're going to use those precedents to go ahead and do what we need to secure this border.""
In a 5-4 vote Monday, the justices granted an emergency appeal from the Biden administration, which has been in an escalating standoff at the border with Texas and had objected to an appellate ruling in favor of the state.
The court’s decision allows Border Patrol agents to cut concertina wire that Texas had installed along the border near Eagle Pass while litigation continues.

The roughly 30 miles of wire had been installed as part of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's broader fight with the administration over immigration enforcement and attempts to stem the historic flow of migrants across the border since Biden's term began.
""This is Abbott vs. Biden,"" Clem argued. ""This isn't the state of Texas vs. Border Patrol, which is what I see and hear from some of the talking heads coming out of Washington and DHS.""
Brandon Judd, president for the National Border Patrol Council, said the court's ruling would ""undoubtedly encourage more illegal immigration.""
""Unfortunately, this means Border Patrol agents are going to be tied up dealing with give ups rather than going after the criminal elements that constantly cross our borders illegally,"" Judd said in a statement to Fox News.

Deputies said just before 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, they were called to an apartment complex where they found a man bleeding from the head from an apparent gunshot wound. Deputies told WGN 9 that the victim later died.
The victim was later identified as Toyosi Bakare, 28, who was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the U.S. for nearly three years, WGN 9 reported.
According to deputies, about ten minutes before the fatal shooting, a 42-year-old man was shot in the leg and sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Authorities stated the victims in Sunday’s shootings are not connected to one another and appear to be random in nature.
Officials said the plate numbers on the vehicle that authorities believe Nance is driving match the vehicle spotted near both shooting scenes on Sunday.
According to the Patch and court records, Nance was charged about a year ago after he tried to shoot a woman multiple times. Police found him near his home and arrested him after a brief struggle with officers.

LAURA INGRAHAM: Good news from the Texas AG Ken Paxton today: The Lone Star State does not intend to bend to federal agents trying to enter Shelby Park in Eagle Pass. Now, the agents use the park as kind of a staging ground to process migrants and do other things — migrants crossing into the United States. Texas Gov.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A new, smaller caravan of about 1,500 migrants started walking north from southern Mexico on Thursday, a week after a larger group that set out on Christmas Eve largely dissolved.
The migrants, most from Central and South America, said they had grown tired of waiting in Mexico’s southern city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border. They said processing centers there for asylum or visa requests are overloaded and the process can take months.
MEXICAN MILITARY SWARMS POPULAR AMERICAN TOURIST SPOT AMID CRIME SURGE
The migrants carried a sign reading ""Migrating is not a crime, it is a crime for a government to use repression against migrants.""
The group managed to walk past two highway control checkpoints Thursday as immigration agents and National Guard troopers stood by.

Migrant Alexander Girón said he left his native El Salvador because his wages did not cover basic necessities.
In previous years, many people left El Salvador because of gang-related violence. But even though the Salvadoran government has brought down the homicide rate with a tough crackdown on gangs that has imprisoned tens of thousands, Girón said he still had to leave.
""Safety isn't enough if there is no work,"" said Gíron, who was traveling with his wife and two teenage sons in hopes of reaching the U.S. ""Wages just can't keep pace, everything is very expensive. We are going to look for work and to give our sons a better life.""
The earlier Christmas Eve caravan once numbered about 6,000 migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Central America. But after New Year’s Day, the Mexican government persuaded them to give up their trek, promising they would get some kind of unspecified documents.
By the next week, about 2,000 migrants from that caravan resumed their journey through southern Mexico, after participants were left without the papers the Mexican government appeared to have promised.
The migrants wanted transit or exit visas allowing them to take buses or trains to the U.S. border. But they were given papers restricting holders to Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state, where work is scarce and local residents are largely poor. By last week, only a hundred or two had made it to the border between neighboring Oaxaca state and the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, mainly on buses.
Mexico in the past let migrants go through, trusting they would tire themselves out walking along the highway. No migrant caravan has ever walked the full 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the U.S. border.
U.S. officials in December discussed ways Mexico could help stem the flow of migrants at a meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
López Obrador confirmed that U.S. officials want Mexico to do more to block migrants at its border with Guatemala, or make it more difficult for them to move across Mexico by train or in trucks or buses — a policy known as ""contention.""
Mexico felt pressure to address the problem after U.S. officials briefly closed two vital Texas railway border crossings, claiming they were overwhelmed by processing migrants. That put a chokehold on Mexican exports heading to the U.S. and on grain moving south for Mexican livestock.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said the spike in border crossings seen in December across the southwest U.S. border coincided with a period when the ""immigration enforcement agency in Mexico was not funded,.""

The British royal family is taking a page from Hollywood.
In what has been described as an ""extraordinary"" move by Daily Mail reporter Robert Hardman, Kensington Palace recently announced that Kate Middleton, who turned 42 earlier this month, underwent a ""planned abdominal surgery"" at The London Clinic. The Princess of Wales is postponing all public duties until after Easter.Moments after the announcement, Buckingham Palace revealed that King Charles III was seeking treatment for an enlarged prostate. They noted that the 75-year-old’s public engagements ""will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.""
""When I heard the second announcement, I thought, ‘Is this a repeat?’"" Hardman told Fox News Digital. ""I thought it was just extraordinary to have two major royal medical bulletins on the same day within a couple of hours.""
QUEEN CAMILLA SAYS KING CHARLES IS DOING ‘FINE’ AHEAD OF TREATMENT FOR ENLARGED PROSTATE
Robert Hardman has written a new book about King Charles III titled ""The Making of a King."" (Pegasus Books)
Hardman has written a new book, ""The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy."" It explores the king’s reign and the pivotal events that led to his coronation in May.

Hardman noted that it’s unusual for the royals to release details about their health. However, the twin announcements may help to avoid speculation if events featuring the king or the Princess of Wales have to be postponed or canceled over the coming weeks.
""I think what was equally surprising was that level of detail,"" said Hardman. ""I think it says a lot about the new tone, the new style of the monarchy.""
It’s the kind of transparency we would expect from a celebrity breaking their silence about a health struggle, he shared. The publicity around the king’s surgery is seen as an opportunity to encourage other men to have their prostates checked, in line with public health advice.

The Princess of Wales was admitted to the hospital on January 18, 2024, in London, England for abdominal surgery. The procedure was successful and she will recover in the hospital for the next 10-14 days. She is not expected to resume formal engagements until after Easter. ( Ming Yeung)
""The king's release was extremely personal,"" Hardman explained. ""I’ve never seen words like ‘enlarged prostate’ in a Buckingham Palace report before. But he’s taken a view that if you are a monarch, you lead. And one of the things he can do is lead by example. And in Britain, in the last 24 hours, online searches for ‘prostate cancer,’ ‘prostate enlargement’, the keywords have gone up. I think the latest figures are a thousand percent.""
""What he’s done is very similar to what a number of celebrities, well-known public figures do when they face something personal – they talk about it to raise levels of awareness,"" Hardman added.
The monarch sought treatment ""in common with thousands of men each year,"" the palace said.

An enlarged prostate is common in men over age 50. The condition affects how one urinates and isn’t usually a serious health threat. It’s not cancer and doesn’t lead to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.
The U.K. and foreign media have been focused on the health of Britain’s senior royals in recent years, first as the late queen faded from public view during the last months of her 70-year reign, then when Charles ascended the throne at an age when most of his contemporaries were long retired.
Hardman noted that it’s not the first time in recent years the royals have been candid with the public about their health.

""It’s part of what we’ve seen the king’s sons do – both William and Harry,"" said Hardman. ""They talk about things like mental health. And a few years ago, no royal would talk about mental health. Now both of them do.""
""So I think what all of this points to is a greater degree of transparency,"" Hardman shared. ""They’re not obviously going to suddenly let the cameras in and film everything, but it’s definitely a move toward a greater openness with the media and with the public.""
In 2021, Prince Harry was filmed undergoing a form of therapy known as EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) for the Oprah Winfrey-led series, ""The Me You Can't See."" The Duke of Sussex said it has helped him cope with anxiety stemming from the death of his mother Princess Diana. Harry was 12 when his mother, 36, was killed in a car accident.

On Sunday, it was also announced that Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, had been diagnosed with skin cancer. The 64-year-old previously spoke out about her battle with breast cancer. Her eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, is the patron of the British Skin Foundation and has worked with skin cancer patients.

Like any celebrity, the royals know the importance of good publicity. That’s why we can expect Zara Tindall, the daughter of Princess Anne, and her husband Mike Tindall to become familiar faces in the upcoming months, Hardman said. It will boost the royal family’s public image while its senior members recover.
Tindall, 42, and her brother Peter Phillips are not full-time working members of The Firm and don’t have royal titles. The granddaughter of the late queen married the former rugby player in 2011. Anne, 73, decided not to give her children royal titles in hopes they could have an easier childhood.

""I think what we are probably going to see is not private citizens… suddenly being elevated to frontline royalty,"" Hardman explained. ""I don’t think that’s going to happen, but I think what you will see is when there are big events, when there are occasions where you do need extra support, [they will be there].""
""For example, if there’s [something] like a state banquet or a state visit, those moments when you need a bit of a royal team around you, then I could see a situation, yes, where someone like Zara is being invited, encouraged to play a part. But I wouldn’t expect her to see her or Mike Tindall or anybody else like that have a formal role and attend formal engagements.""
""You’re either fully royal or you’re not,"" Hardman pointed out. ""You can’t be halfway.""

One royal we shouldn’t expect to see in the spotlight anytime soon is Prince Andrew. The disgraced Duke of York has been nuclear when it comes to elevating the royal family’s publicity.
The 63-year-old was named in previously secret court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that were unsealed in the new year.
Epstein, an American financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead behind bars in 2019 at age 66. The U.S. attorney in Manhattan prosecuted Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, 62, for helping recruit his underage victims. She was convicted in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison term.

The king has been facing mounting pressure to evict his younger brother from his lavish Royal Lodge home, a 30-room mansion that extends to 98 acres. Andrew moved into the property in 2004.
Andrew has retained his title as the Duke of York. He also maintains his place in the line of succession to the British throne, which is eighth behind Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s two children. However, he cannot use the title of HRH or ""His Royal Highness"" in any capacity.
Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019. He was stripped of his honorary military titles. The queen also removed his honorary leadership of various charities, known as royal patronages.
Royal watchers have wondered if King Charles III (right) would strip his younger brother Prince Andrew (left) of his royal titles. (Max Mumby/Indigo)
In a lawsuit filed in 2020, Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre accused Andrew of sexually exploiting her on three occasions in 2001 when she was 17. Though Andrew has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, he agreed to an out-of-court settlement paid to the American woman in February 2022. The prince made a substantial donation to his accuser’s charity and declared he never meant to malign her character.
The settlement amount was reported to be anywhere between $3.6 million to $14.8 million.
""Andrew will forever be tainted,"" said Hardman. ""I think the future for Prince Andrew is… very uncertain. It's not a return to public life, which is what he wants. If you're going to play a part in public life, that is predicated on the fact the public wants you and, self-evidently, the public doesn't particularly want to see the Duke of York. They just expect him to keep a low profile.""
""I think that's a difficult thing to ask someone who's been in the public eye since they were born,"" Hardman warned. ""He's fit. He doesn't drink. He's in his early 60s… he's got a long time ahead of him. But he has no real purpose as a royal.""

A teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard University is looking to retract or correct dozens of papers authored by top researchers following an investigation into allegations of data falsification.
The probe into whether data falsification occurred is underway at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston comes after claims were levied against the institute's CEO, Dr. Laurie Glimcher, Chief Operating Officer Dr. William Hahn, Clinical Investigator Research Program Director Dr. Irene Ghobrial and Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center Program Director Dr. Kenneth Anderson.
Dana-Farber's Research Integrity Officer, Dr Barrett Rollins, told the Harvard Crimson that the hospital has already begun six retractions to research papers, and another 31 are currently being corrected.
All four researchers have full faculty appointments with Harvard Medical School and have ""primary responsibility for the potential data errors,"" according to Rollins.

The institute is still investigating whether 16 papers that contain data from other Dana-Farber and Harvard researchers contain similar data discrepancies.
The probe began after biologist Sholto David posted to a blog and flagged 57 papers published between 1997 and 2017. Many of the papers researched the biology of cancer development and were republished in several top journals, including ""Cell, Nature, Medicine"" and ""Science.""
David, who also works as a freelance data sleuth, identified instances where identical protein blots, bands and graphs were posted more than once in the same paper to identify different experiments.
""For some of these mistakes, it's hard to understand how it could have happened by accident,"" David said.
The information was first reported by The Harvard Crimson, which at the time said Dana-Farber had begun to investigate the allegations in 2023.
""The presence of image discrepancies in a paper is not evidence of an author's intent to deceive,"" Rollins told ScienceInsider. ""That conclusion can only be drawn after a careful, fact-based examination which is an integral part of our response. Our experience is that errors are often unintentional and do not rise to the level of misconduct.""

He also revealed the investigation may continue for up to 1 year.
The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.
The new claims come after Harvard President Claudine Gay announced her resignation following widespread allegations of plagiarism against her.
Gay was accused last October of plagiarizing several passages in published academic articles stretching back to the 1990s.
Following the initial claims, Harvard also noted that it had been made aware of additional plagiarism allegations, which included charges against Gay's dissertation, through social media on December 10. However, a subcommittee reviewing her work had not included her dissertation in its initial review.

Two days later, on December 12, the subcommittee released a statement in support of Gay and made reference to the corrections she had agreed to make. The board again backed her on December 21 and detailed additional corrections, including ones to her dissertation.
Following her resignation, Gay returned to the Harvard faculty. Issues that arise with faculty are typically reviewed by a university committee, which reports to the university president.

2PNLTIE4PB_4TT4OOXYDIAGJ8G,California’s next crisis? Experts race to solve explosion in Los Angeles stray cat population,By Nikolas Lanum Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 5:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/californias-next-crisis-experts-race-explosion-los-angeles-stray-cat-population,"Animal disease experts are raising concern about the spread of the avian flu in the Bay Area after two farms euthanized around 250,000 birds this week.
Community leaders, nonprofits and government agencies are racing to curtail an exploding cat population in Los Angeles, where animal advocates estimate there are almost as many felines as there are people.
The Citywide Cat Program estimates there are around 960,000 unowned ""community cats"" in the City of Los Angeles, but various nonprofits and animal rights groups have suggested this number could be as high as three million in a city of 4 million humans.
The program was approved in late 2020 and in February 2020, the Los Angeles Board of Animal Services Commissioners adopted rules and regulations applicable to the trapping of cats, so long as it adheres to permits issued by the Department of Animal Services.
""By engaging individuals and community organizations to humanely trap community cats, spay and neuter them, and then return the sterilized cats back to their outdoor homes — where they were found — will reduce the number of unowned, stray cats in our streets and shelters,"" the program's website states.
MAINE'S SURGE IN CAT POPULATION CAUSES CROWDED ANIMAL SHELTERS: 'SAD SCENARIO'

The process of trapping, neutering and returning unowned cats is more commonly known as TNR, one of several methods communities are using to control evolving cat populations.
Experts and proponents of the movement have said the spaying of community cats can prevent unwanted litters, decrease the number of cats euthanized, improve their health, reduce nuisance behavior and help save taxpayer dollars spent on putting cats in municipal shelters.
Dr. Alex Crow, a veterinary surgeon focused on laparoscopic neutering, said the population of feral cats is difficult to determine as they often keep their distance from people. But with many around, Crow said they are causing some issues that people may not be aware of.
He noted that large groups of feral cats (reaching up to 200 cats per cluster) frequently hunt lots of local birds and small animals, which, over time, can take its toll on the wildlife population. Research suggests that feral cats have reduced the population of at least 27 species.
""They're also a public health risk since they can carry things like fleas, ticks, and ear mites that jump onto our pets and even us. It's not uncommon for me to treat dogs and indoor cats who suddenly have fleas or ticks out of nowhere, thanks to a feral cat colony nearby,"" he added.
The massive cat population in Los Angeles is not unique to the City of Angels. Brooklyn nonprofit Flatbush Cats estimates that as many as half a million feral cats live in New York City.

Istanbul, Turkey, has had hundreds of thousands of cats roaming the city for centuries, earning it the nickname of the City of Cats or ""Catstanbul."" Australia, in particular, has been proposing several extreme laws to control a rapidly expanding cat population.
Access to facilities and shelter, the weather (lack of freezing temperatures), the number of people offering food, and the average cat's survival rate all determine areas that are likely to experience cat overpopulation.
Dr. Sara Ochoa, a vet practicing in the Los Angeles area, said she has witnessed firsthand the city's challenges regarding the cat population.
""On a daily basis, I see the results- cats left abandoned and struggling to survive on the streets. My own neighborhood has several colonies of strays that locals try to manage through makeshift TNR efforts. My heart goes out to these animals,"" she said.
Crow claimed that the TNR has done little to decrease the cat population or address the long-term disease risk since they are still freely roaming. During his career, he surmised that the number of wild cat cases in his facility has doubled.
""A better strategy is carefully removing feral colonies in sensitive wildlife areas, which has led to real declines, according to groups I've worked with,"" he said.
Ochoa agreed with Crow that TNR alone cannot ""realistically cope"" with the sheer number of cats the city sees.
""No matter what people say, that's the reality. I've participated in rescue group efforts to trap, neuter and return cats in abandoned industrial sites, yet the populations seem to rebound rapidly. More needs to be done,"" she said.

Responsible ownership through indoor confinement and spaying/neutering goes a long way into cutting Los Angeles' growing feral cat situation down to size, Crow added.
""Large-scale removals are also needed where colonies threaten sensitive habitats. We can better manage this issue with the right balanced approach while still caring for ferals,"" he said.
In her practice, Ochoa makes it a point to educate clients on spaying/neutering. However, budgets are tight, and there are more cats than resources available. She often supports the exploration of vouchers to expand access and creative solutions that bring together local leaders and resource groups.
""The feral cat population got out of hand due to human actions. It will take human cooperation to humanely address it,"" she added.
""Rover"" Applied Animal Behaviorist Dr. Mikel Delgado told Fox News Digital that cats are very prolific reproducers with the capacity to have multiple litters several times a year and from a very young age. Research suggests that cats can give birth to up to 24 kittens every year from the time they are four months old.
She noted that ""community cats"" is the preferred nomenclature over ""feral cats,"" as not all cats living outside have been deprived of human socialization. Additionally, some are actually house cats that have been abandoned or released.

For example, a socialized cat typically is handled and has positive interactions with humans during the window when they are between 2 and 7 weeks old. These cats are more likely to grow into loving pets, whereas cats that are deprived of this interaction are more likely to be wary or shy when approached by a human, thus leading to the term ""feral.""
Delgado, a leading national cat expert, noted that one of the big obstacles with TNR is the shortage of access to care that would allow a mass number of animals, including people's pets, to get neutered. She also stressed that evidence suggests killing off segments of the population would not be any more effective.
If more pet owners had access to free spay-neuter, and it was simpler to complete the process, Delgado surmised it could limit behavioral problems that might lead to a cat being removed from a person's house and reproducing out on the street.
""The question, I think, really is, is this a problem that we can even solve given the current technology we have to control the reproduction?"" Delgado said.
""We have created a relationship with them over the past several thousand years, and we have an obligation to care for them because we basically created them,"" she added.

The New York Police Department is investigating reports that Columbia University students were attacked with chemical spray last week during a pro-Palestinian protest.
Eight students were hospitalized and dozens more sought medical attention after the Friday attack on the Ivy League campus, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, two student groups based at the university, said in a joint statement.
The chemical caused some students to experience nausea and burning eyes, the groups said.

The NYPD said a 24-year-old woman told authorities that she was informed by others that an unknown substance was sprayed into the air during the demonstration.
""The victim smelled an unknown odor and began to feel nauseated and experienced a burning sensation in her eyes,"" a police email said.
No arrests have been made.
On Monday, Columbia’s interim provost, Dennis Mitchell, wrote in a campus email that the alleged, ""perpetrators identified to the University were immediately banned from campus.""

""The New York City Police Department is taking the lead role in investigating what appear to have been serious crimes, possibly hate crimes,"" he wrote. ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community.""
The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is demanding the NYPD investigate the attack as a possible hate crime.
""The alleged use of a chemical agent on the grounds of a college campus in NYC is beyond heinous,"" CAIR-NY Executive Director Afaf Nasher said in a statement. ""It is an escalation of violence launched against peaceful protesters by individuals who seek to inflict harm and undermine the principles of peaceful dialogue and dissent upheld in any democratic society.""
Some students said the chemical used in the attack was ""skunk,"" which is used by the Israeli military against protesters in the Palestinian territories, CAIR said.
Students participate in a protest in support of Palestine and for free speech outside Columbia University, Nov. 15, 2023, in New York City.
Columbia and other Ivy League institutions have been at the center of pro-Palestinian protests since Israel was attacked by Hamas on Oct. 7. Many of the schools have come under heavy criticism for protests against Israel and issues surrounding free speech on college campuses.

2RNYFZQHNW_RJHCXHN1833UDMY,Bikini company tells critics to 'keep scrolling or unfollow' after backlash to male modeling women's swimsuit,By Alexander Hall Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 8:18pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bikini-company-tells-critics-keep-scrolling-unfollow-backlash-male-modeling-womens-swimsuit,"Branding and marketing expert, Karen Tiber Leland, said the Adidas LGBTQ swimsuit ad campaign will hurt the company brand after facing fierce backlash.
A bikini company and its owner are responding to criticism after posting video of a male model wearing their women's swimwear.
Moana Bikini, owned by Australian body positivity influencer Karina Irby, touts its brand as being ""at the forefront of a positive movement of female empowerment and inclusivity, centred around the utilisation of Social Media as a positive force for change.""
However, many women were outraged on social media after a recent promotional video on the Moana Bikini Instagram page showed male model Jake Young modeling one of their one-piece women's swimsuits.
After many questioned the brand’s commitment to women by having a man wearing an ostensibly feminine swimsuit, Irby herself took to the IG comments section.

TARGET CEO SAYS WOKE CAPITALISM ‘GREAT’ FOR THEIR BRAND AND ‘THE RIGHT THING FOR SOCIETY'
""Moana has been empowering ALL bodies since 2011. This video really should [sic] shock you at all. If you have to announce your ‘anger’ I strongly urge you to listen too – YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN by Taylor Swift, as I believe it was written for you,"" Irby declared in the comments. ""See you are special.""
Taylor Swift’s 2019 song, ""You Need to Calm Down"" is known for its pro-LGBTQ lyrics urging people, presumably more socially conservative individuals, to ""control your urges to scream about all the people you hate, 'cause shade never made anybody less gay.""
When one account suggested the company was being disrespectful for referencing this song, the Moana Bikini brand account responded by quoting the lyrics, ""you need to calm down. You’re being too loud.""

ADIDAS SWIMSUIT AD DRAWS BACKLASH FOR ‘ERASING WOMEN’: ‘THIS SEEMS COORDINATED’
An account appearing to represent the model, Jake Young, responded, ""There are many different types of women. Women with different anatomy to what you consider ‘normal.’ I am not a woman nor have I ever claimed to be. This post is simply empowering a minority & I’m forever grateful for that. Your hate is a reflection of your own insecurities, not mine.""
Recent posts from Young’s account largely feature him in what appears to be more feminine clothing, even though he lists the pronouns on his profile as ""he/him.""
A spokesperson for the company sent Fox News Digital a statement that defended the video and said people are cherry-picking the post.
""We find it quite absurd that people would cherry-pick this one, individual post from our 12 years of business to make a wild statement about us not being empowering to women,"" the statement reads. ""Many commenters are using the excuse that they believe it is ‘insulting to women,' when in reality, it’s quite clear they are homophobic and have an issue with someone expressing their sexuality proudly and confidently.""

""We’re happy to receive and hear people’s feedback - both negative and positive. But we’re not here to please everyone. That’s an impossible task. If people aren’t happy with this individual post of a proud, gay man wearing a piece of clothing he feels confident in… they can just keep scrolling or unfollow, can’t they?,"" the statement continued. ""Imagine living a life where you choose to be offended by something and stick around, comment and engage, only to make yourself more and more angry.""
The statement concluded, ""This sounds like a them problem, not an us problem, to be honest.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out at former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley one last time as he dropped out of the presidential race this week.
DeSantis blasted Haley as a representative of ""corporatism"" and emphasized his endorsement for former President Trump. Haley is now the sole remaining challenger to Trump in the GOP primary.
""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear – a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism – that Nikki Haley represents.

DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race and endorsed former President Donald Trump on Sunday, just two days before the New Hampshire primary.

""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis continued. ""They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.""

Bob Good, R-Va., who voted to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, tells ‘Your World’ that ‘nothing has changed’ for him.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., endorsed a primary challenger against House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., Monday, further pushing herself away from the ultra-conservative group she was once part of.
""John McGuire is a Navy SEAL who has stood with President Donald J. Trump since he came down the escalator,"" Greene wrote on X.
""Bob Good is an angry, disloyal, MAGA traitor who was caught on camera trashing President Trump and doing everything he could to defeat President Trump. Bob Good is NO GOOD and cannot be trusted.""

Greene’s endorsement came just a day after Good endorsed Trump for president and as he faces criticism from MAGA circles for not falling in line behind the ex-president earlier.
An attack ad released against Good by the Virginians For Conservative Leadership PAC shows what appears to be a secret recording of the congressman saying, ""I can’t sit by and watch and then regret that we nominated Trump.""

A Mississippi mother protected herself and her three children from a knife-wielding home intruder by shooting him in the arm on Monday, according to Carroll County authorities.
The mother and her three children heard the suspect, 42-year-old Steven Lamar Goss Jr., banging down the front door of their home and went to hide in the closet – which the family had designated as their safe room – and pray, the sheriff's office said.
When Goss found them, the mother shot the suspect in the arm while he was holding a knife.
""We can all learn a lot from this family about the importance of having an emergency plan in place in our homes and, most importantly, the power of prayer,"" Carroll County Sheriff Clint Walker said in a Monday statement. ""I thank the Lord for this father’s preparation; the bravery shown by the mother and children, and that what could have been a tragedy was transformed into a testimony of their faith in God.""

The Biden administration’s self-inflicted crisis at the border will have dire consequences for the future of the United States.
While cities and states struggle with the immediate impacts, we mustn’t overlook the hundreds of thousands of minors from distant countries who will enroll in our public education system – a system that condemns nationhood, disregards merit, ignores personal responsibility, and sows seeds of anti-Americanism, victimhood and tribalism.
Our education system was once an essential component to assimilate immigrants into American culture. Sadly, Leftist policies, rooted in DEI, have destroyed this process. This militant education system jeopardizes core American values that have bound our nation together for over two centuries.
As a professor, I was already troubled with the large majority of natural-born Americans who know so little of our history. (FNC)
Since President Biden took office, there have been more than 463,000 border encounters with unaccompanied children (UC). According to a House Judiciary report, at least 300,000 unaccompanied minors have been released into the United States, but the Biden administration refuses to disclose an exact number.
MARYLAND COUNTY CLAIMS SCHOOL BOARD CAN CREATE SEAT ONLY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAN VOTE ON: REPORTS
Introducing hundreds of thousands of new students, many of whom do not speak English, into these indoctrination mills has profound consequences.
While the overall quality of education for all students will inevitably decline, I am more concerned with how these new students, with little understanding or knowledge of America, will be taught under the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) virus that has infected curriculums throughout the country, especially in New York state.
Rather than focus on American exceptionalism and the totality of American history, these students will be subjected to a steady stream of anti-Americanism. Moreover, they will be instilled with a sense of entitlement under the banner of equity and indoctrinated with the belief that they are victims of an oppressive culture.
Take a look at how police officers are portrayed in the NYS Board of Regents DEI Framework, which incorrectly emphasizes ""the senseless, brutal killing of Black and Brown men and women at the hands of law enforcement.""
HOUSE DEMS' $3.5T SPENDING BILL INCLUDES FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
It explicitly describes America as an inherently racist country, and claims that ""systemic racism pervades all aspects of our lives, including policing, education, health care, employment, housing, access to capital, and in almost every other conceivable realm.""
Think about the message this sends to those who traveled thousands of miles and have little knowledge of the United States. Why would hundreds of thousands of young minds want to assimilate into a culture that they have been programmed to perceive as inherently evil?
This undermines the concept of E Pluribus Unum – out of many, one – a principle that George Washington warned is necessary for our national survival.
Consider how our universities have deemed the concept of the melting pot as a ""racist microaggression,"" including the University of California – one of the largest university systems in the country.

It is now taboo to demand that a person coming to the United States should assimilate to our culture and values. Rather, the far-left agenda demands America must assimilate and bow to the cultures of those that come here, which further erodes the American identity.
As a professor, I was already troubled with the large majority of natural-born Americans who know so little of our history, our system of governance and their role within it. As this ignorance grows, our identity unravels and the cohesion that once united us dissipates.
A corrupt system unable to educate its own people, combined with hundreds of thousands of newly enrolled unaccompanied minors, risks the continued degradation of American citizenry. No other nation in the world would be foolish enough to instruct its own people and those just arriving to harbor a sense of loathing that will ensure our nation’s demise.

The president holds the authority to end this crisis immediately. His open border policy has put the future of the United States at risk by creating the conditions that weaken our core American values and culture.
We can restore an assimilation process that has worked for two centuries by overhauling our education system. We must reestablish an education system that teaches our national values, preserves the American identity, and focuses on good citizenry over social justice advocacy. The future of our country is at stake.

Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she's going to New Hampshire to support former President Donald Trump ahead of the first-in-the-nation primary election on Tuesday.
Greene announced on social media that she is heading to the Granite State to support Trump in his push for the top of the GOP ticket in 2024, proclaiming the former president will have an ""historic"" win.
""I’m so excited to be heading to The Granite State today to support President Trump in the first in the nation primary!"" Greene wrote on Monday. ""Tomorrow’s victory will be historic!""

""Live Free or Die!!"" she added, quoting the New Hampshire state motto.
Greene's name has been thrown around in recent years as a potential running mate for Trump as he vies for his second term.
However, Trump has not made a decision on who will be joining him on his 2024 ticket.
Still, speculation has been fueled by the Georgia Republican's appearances at Trump's rallies, and she has been a top surrogate for the president before.

Greene's travel comes before the critical New Hampshire primary election.
The GOP primary field has dwindled down to two major names, Trump and his former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign on Sunday.
Trump and Haley are both campaigning hard ahead of Tuesday's primary, and a win for either of them is crucial.
If Trump wins, he will likely solidify himself as the GOP nominee for president in 2024, setting up a rematch with President Biden.

Trump, who is running a third straight time for the White House, stands at 57% support in a daily tracking poll released on Monday by Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 in Boston, with Haley at 38%.

34A5KV5WPM_1A4C6OMGGY55AQB,Hungary is the last holdout for Sweden's NATO membership. So when will Orbán follow Turkey's lead?,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 7:34pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hungary-last-holdout-swedens-nato-membership-when-orban-follow-turkeys-lead,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — With Turkey completing its ratification of Sweden's bid to join NATO, Hungary is the last member of the military alliance not to have given its approval.
After more than a year of delays, and consistent urging from its Western partners to move forward with Sweden's application, the Central European country and its conservative populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, are once again in the spotlight.
ORBÁN COMPARES HUNGARY'S EU MEMBERSHIP TO SOVIET OCCUPATION IN FIERY SPEECH
Orbán has long promised that Hungary wouldn't be the last NATO member to ratify Sweden's request to join the alliance. Yet Monday's approval in Turkey's parliament has upended those guarantees, and others in the alliance are now asking: When will Budapest follow Ankara's lead?
Hungary's government, Orbán says, is in favor of bringing Sweden into NATO, but lawmakers in his governing Fidesz party remain unconvinced, offended by ""blatant lies"" from some Swedish politicians that have excoriated the quality of Hungary's democracy.
Hungarys right-wing leader, Viktor Orban, claims he does not oppose Swedens membership in NATO.
Yet Orbán's critics say that there is no such schism within his party, and that when it comes to Hungary's approval of Sweden's NATO membership, Orbán alone is in control.
While Turkey made a series of concrete demands from Sweden as preconditions for supporting its bid to join the alliance, Hungary's government — long under fire in the European Union for alleged breaches of democracy and rule-of-law standards — has expressed no such requirements, hinting only that it expects a greater degree of respect from Stockholm.
Hungary's opposition parties, which favor Sweden's membership in NATO, have made several attempts over the past year to schedule a vote on the matter. But lawmakers from the Fidesz party, which holds a two-thirds majority in parliament, have refused to lend their support.
Agnes Vadai, a lawmaker with Hungary’s opposition Democratic Coalition party and a former secretary of state in the Ministry of Defense, said that the opposition would once again seek to force a vote on Sweden's membership before parliament's next scheduled session in late February.
But there's ""very little chance"" that Orbán’s party will support the initiative, she said, adding that Hungary's intransigence on the issue is the prime minister's attempt to prove his weight on the international stage.
""It has nothing to do with Sweden now, it has nothing to do with Turkey now. It’s merely Orbán’s personal attitude,"" she said. ""It shows that he's driven not by political rationale, but by personal vanity. There is no gain for Hungary in this game anymore, because it's a game that he's playing.""
As Turkey's parliament prepared to vote on the ratification on Monday, Orbán announced that he'd sent a letter to Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to negotiate on NATO membership.
Kristersson hasn't commented publicly on Orbán’s letter, but Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said that he saw ""no reason"" to negotiate with Hungary on the matter, noting that Budapest hasn't presented any conditions for accepting Sweden into the alliance.
On Tuesday, Orbán tweeted that he’d had a phone call with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in which he had ""reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,"" and that he would continue to urge his parliament to approve its bid.
But Dorka Takacsy, an analyst and research fellow at the Centre for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Democracy, said that Orbán's invitation to Kristersson showed that the fate of Sweden's NATO bid lies not in the hands of Hungarian lawmakers, but with Orbán himself.
Orbán's letter, she said, ""dismantled the narrative that there was any dispute within the parliamentary group of Fidesz ... It simply points to the fact that it is Orbán, the prime minister himself, who manages this whole issue single-handedly.""
Vadai, the opposition lawmaker, agreed.
""Anybody who believed that it’s in the hands of the governing party lawmakers was seriously mistaken,"" she said. ""It’s the decision of Orbán and nobody else.""
A vote on the protocols for Sweden's NATO accession hasn't yet appeared on the Hungarian parliament's agenda, and barring a surprise emergency session, the matter is unlikely to go before lawmakers until at least late February.
Hungary's delays, as well as Orbán's friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, have frustrated other allies who want to expand the alliance and provide security guarantees to Sweden amid the war in Ukraine.

With such stakes, Vadai said that she worries Orbán's conduct on the international stage has damaged Hungary's relationship with its Western partners.
""He pushes Hungary to the very edge of NATO now, he's marginalizing my country,"" she said. ""This is just a sin."""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
For the three out of every 100,000 children who are born with Batten disease, the diagnosis is one of the most devastating that a family can receive.
Emily Blackburn, 32, found out in March 2023 that her 7-year-old son, Grayson Naff, has the rare, genetic, fatal disorder.
Now, the Ohio family is faced with the harsh reality that Naff will ultimately lose his sight, then his cognitive abilities and motor skills.
The life expectancy for children with Batten disease is usually five or six years after symptoms begin.
HEART DISEASE RISK INCREASES FOR YOUNG ADULTS WHO HAVE LOST A SIBLING, STUDY FINDS
Shortly before her son started first grade, Blackburn took him to the eye doctor for what she thought was a routine visual exam.
She’d noticed it was more difficult for him to see the TV screen, so she assumed he needed glasses.
Grayson Naff, 8, pictured at right and with his family, was diagnosed with Batten disease in spring 2023. ""I really don't have words for it,"" said mom Emily Blackburn to Fox News Digital.  (Emily Blackburn)
During the exam, the doctor noticed something concerning in Naff's retina and sent the family to a retina specialist in Cincinnati.
""At first, they thought it was a disease called Stargardt, which causes you lose your central vision and become legally blind,"" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in an interview.
That was heartbreaking in itself, she said — ""enough to send you into a spiral"" — but things got even worse when the doctors decided to do some genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.
Grayson Naff was 7 when he was diagnosed with Batten disease. He still attends his same public school, where he is in second grade. (Emily Blackburn)
It turned out the first diagnosis was incorrect. And with tears in their eyes, the geneticists informed Blackburn during a Zoom call that her son actually had Batten disease.
""We went from thinking our son would become legally blind to finding out that he has this fatal disease with no cure,"" Blackburn said. ""I really don't have words for it. It's unbelievable. It’s soul-crushing.""
A fatal genetic disorder, Batten disease interferes with the body's ability to eliminate cellular waste, per Cleveland Clinic's website.
As the excess lipids and proteins build up, they cause vision loss, seizures, cognitive decline, impaired mobility and death.
There is currently no cure for the disorder.
""It's unbelievable. It’s soul-crushing.""
Batten disease is usually diagnosed through genetic testing, when an abnormal change is found in one of the several genes associated with the disease, noted Christelle Moufawad El Achkar, M.D., a neurologist in the Division of Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology at Boston Children's Hospital. (Achkar is not involved in Naff's care.)
There are 13 different types of Batten disease, each involving a different gene. Naff was diagnosed with CLN3.
Grayson Naff is pictured with his little brother. ""Grayson is such a great big brother to Beckett,"" Blackburn said. ""They’re best friends."" (Emily Blackburn)
""Within each gene, there can be different clinical subtypes with different ages of onset and severity, starting from infancy until adulthood,"" Moufawad El Achkar told Fox News Digital.
""This can make diagnosis harder, especially in the early stages of the disease.""
Early diagnosis is very important, the doctor emphasized, especially because some types of disease can be slowed with therapies.
PENNSYLVANIA MOTHER AND SON BOTH BORN WITH RARE GENETIC DISEASE: 'CLOSER BECAUSE OF THIS'
Initial symptoms of Batten include loss of balance, falls and slurring of speech.
Epilepsy or seizures can be an early sign in some subtypes, but might only happen later in the course of the disease for some patients, said Moufawad El Achkar.
Gradual loss of vision is seen in almost all cases.
""We try to keep him as educated as we can on his vision while still allowing him to be the same little boy he is now,"" Naff's mother told Fox News Digital.  (Emily Blackburn)
""It is crucial to suspect and test for Batten disease in any child who has loss of skills, especially if accompanied by seizures, at any age,"" the doctor said.
As her son's vision had already declined considerably at the time of his diagnosis, it is now 20/200, which qualifies as legally blind, Blackburn shared.
Only Naff's vision has been impacted so far, but doctors have warned Blackburn of what’s to come over the next couple of years — including dementia, decline in motor skills and seizures.
Grayson Naff will have an EEG (electroencephalography) each year to monitor his brain waves for seizure activity. (Emily Blackburn)
As of now, Naff only knows about his vision struggles — Blackburn has not told him about the Batten disease diagnosis.
""We try to keep him as educated as we can on his vision while still allowing him to be the same little boy he is now,"" Blackburn told Fox News Digital.
""We feel like the weight of all the other symptoms is just too hard, too much for him to carry.""
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY BREAKTHROUGH: FDA APPROVES FIRST-EVER GENE THERAPY FOR RARE CHILDREN’S DISEASE
Naff still attends the same public school, where he works with a teacher for the visually impaired.
""We have amazing teachers and amazing friends in our community,"" Blackburn said.
Patients affected by Batten disease need a multidisciplinary team to help manage their symptoms and design a plan to provide the best quality of life possible, Moufawad El Achkar noted.
Naff’s primary care team is at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
Twice a year, the family drives to the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics to see an eye doctor, who prescribes an experimental medicine to help preserve Naff's vision for as long as possible.

They also travel to Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston to see a neurologist.
Naff will have an EEG (electroencephalography) each year to monitor his brain waves for seizure activity.
He is currently taking a medication called Miglustat, which could help to ease or slow down symptoms. Although the drug is FDA-approved for another condition called Gaucher disease, it is not yet approved for Batten.
""Since it's not FDA approved, it has a hefty copay cost — if insurance doesn’t cover it, it’s about $100 a pill, or $9,000 a month,"" Blackburn said.
PENNSYLVANIA PARENTS HONOR THEIR DAUGHTER WHO DIED OF A RARE GENETIC DISEASE: 'SWEETEST GIRL IN THE WORLD'
Through an initiative called Guiding Grayson, the family has held events to help raise money for Naff’s costly care.
""Having the support from our community and our friends has been one of the best things to come out of this,"" said Blackburn.
All the funds raised for Naff have gone toward the cost of the Miglustat.
""We feel like the weight of all the other symptoms is just too hard, too much for him to carry.""
Blackburn, who used to work as a project manager, has opted not to return to a full-time job so she can take care of Naff and her younger son.
""There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of scary things, but we hope that the medication can hold off Grayson’s symptoms for as long as possible until there's a cure,"" she added.
Because each gene involved in the various types of Batten disease has a different mechanism, finding treatment for each one has been a very difficult process, noted Moufawad El Achkar.
""There have been some oral medications that over time might have shown some delay in the progression of the disease, but none have been shown to affect the course of the disease,"" she said.
Through an initiative called Guiding Grayson, the family has held fundraising events to help collect money for Naff’s costly care. (Emily Blackburn)
A drug called Cerliponase Alpha has been shown to significantly slow down symptoms of Batten disease type 2, noted Moufawad El Achkar.
Gene therapies have also been developed for some types and are in early clinical trial stages, but have not yet been administered in the U.S.
Emily Blackburn is pictured with her family. Grayson Naff, center, is now legally blind due to his Batten disease. (Emily Blackburn)
""Research is ongoing to look for therapies for virtually all of the subtypes, but most are at the pre-clinical stage at this time,"" said Moufawad El Achkar.
""A lot of strides have been made, but we need a lot more treatment options to be developed, tailored to each subtype, and we need them as soon as possible.""
""Collaboration between scientists, medical teams and family associations all over the world is absolutely necessary to make any meaningful progress in treating these extremely rare disorders,"" the doctor added.

Blackburn said she is holding out hope for a cure in her son's lifetime.
""Scientists are working tirelessly to try to find a cure for this disease,"" she said. ""It just takes a while for gene therapy to be approved, so that’s what is scary.""
""One of our main goals is to raise awareness for research and funds for a cure — and just to let Grayson know how much we love him.""
""Some days, I’m really hopeful and I feel like Grayson can beat this, and then some days it's just debilitating and gut-wrenching — it feels like we’re in a nightmare,"" Blackburn went on.

3AB13ENVT8_HOGQCJEN13OA2N9,Former California Democrat shreds 'fake actor' Katie Porter in plea to voters: 'She's no better than a bully',By Kristine Parks Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 8:00pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-california-democrat-shreds-fake-actor-katie-porter-plea-voters-no-better-than-bully,"2024 Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips discusses President Biden skipping the New Hampshire primary and shares his vision for the country if elected.
A retired California Democrat slammed his former colleague Katie Porter as a privileged ""liar"" who is ""unfit for the US Senate"" in a scathing opinion piece on Monday.
Former Rep. Harley Rouda  described how Porter, who is running to fill the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein's seat, had lied about him and his family repeatedly in her recent memoir and had bashed him as an out-of-touch ""rich guy"" who prompted her ""outrage.""
But Rouda argued it was actually Porter who was lying to voters about her own ""privilege.""
""Katie Porter built her brand around being a minivan driving, single mom, but the truth of the matter is she’s a boarding school, Harvard, and Yale grad. Katie had more choices and more privilege than virtually everyone else,"" he wrote in his Monday op-ed for the Orange County Register.

""She lives in a deeply subsidized home – worth about two million dollars – courtesy of UCI and California taxpayers, because she is on 'leave from being a professor,'"" he continued.
The Democrat accused Porter of being a hypocrite who lied to voters about rejecting donations from special interest groups as well.
""Porter boasts about taking on powerful special interests – using her whiteboard prop to scold executives – but after pledging to reject their campaign contributions, she ‘has accepted tens of thousands of dollars worth of contributions from powerful people with influence at the highest echelons of Wall Street,' he wrote, quoting a recent investigative report from The Daily Beast.
""Talk about hypocrisy. Her whiteboard everywoman act is a fake. She is, at heart, an accomplished actor who stages classless photo opps on the House floor,"" Rouda slammed. ""But she doesn’t want you to see her that way. Instead, she’s the victim. Always.""

Rouda accused Porter again of lying to voters and about his family as he made his final pitch to voters to reject the Democratic ""bully"" for Senate.
""Like your own staffers have said, you’re in this for power and position, the ability to bully, and be in the spotlight. Your book revealed your true nature. Your minivan is a prop, and your life is of your choosing. As they say, you made your bed. But Californians still have a choice,"" he wrote.
""If you’re not Katie Porter, I hope you vote for someone with character, stability, and wisdom. To me, Katie’s not that person, she’s no better than a bully. A bully with a white board who is in this for power and her ego. The last thing we need is more self-centered politicians like Katie Porter,"" he continued.
Rep. Porter's office did not return a request for comment.

Before Porter announced her run for Senate last year, former staffers came forward with complaints of a toxic work culture and accusations she had made racist remarks.
Rouda served as the U.S. representative for California's 48th congressional district from 2019 to 2021. He ran to fill Porter's open House seat last year but dropped out of the congressional race after suffering a fall and brain injury.

Spreading demonstrations by French farmers against low wages and other grievances were hit by tragedy Tuesday when a woman was killed and her husband and daughter seriously injured in a traffic collision at a protest barricade.
A car plowed into straw bales that demonstrators had placed across a road, hitting the three people before it came to a stop against a tractor's semi-trailer, prosecutor Olivier Mouysset said in a statement.
The fatal crash in southwest France represented a dramatic turn for the growing protest movement among French farmers for better remuneration and against what they consider to be excessive regulation, mounting costs and other problems.
FRANCE CLAMPS DOWN ON MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BY HALTING APPOINTMENT OF FOREIGN CLERICS
The months of demonstrations have become increasingly vigorous in recent weeks, with traffic barricades, dumps of foul-smelling agricultural waste outside government offices and other protests. Farmers have also been turning road signs upside down to protest what they argue are nonsensical agricultural policies.

France is one of Europe's agricultural powerhouses, with powerful farming lobbies but also deep discontent among farmers who say they struggle to make ends meet despite working long hours to feed the country and boost its exports with their produce.
French President Emmanuel Macron's government has been working to assuage farmers' concerns before their anger blows up into a wider movement, like the yellow vest protests against economic injustice in 2019 that dented Macron's popularity and saw frequent violence between protesters and riot police.
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, newly installed by Macron in a government reshuffle this month, posted Tuesday on social media that ""being a farmer means working without respite. It’s working for us, for the French. We are and will remain at their side.""
FRANCE APPOINTS GABRIEL ATTAL AS YOUNGEST-EVER PRIME MINISTER FOLLOWING RESIGNATION OF PREDECESSOR
The woman hit and killed by a car in the Ariège region of southwestern France was a farmer, Attal said. French media reported that she raised cows.
""All our farmers are in mourning. Our nation is shocked,"" Attal said.
Macron, in a social media post, described the accident as a tragedy that ""upsets us all"" and said he ordered his government to find ""concrete solutions"" to the difficulties that farmers are highlighting.
The car that rammed into the barricade of straw bales in the Ariege town of Pamiers was carrying three people, the prosecutor said in his statement.
The woman killed in the pre-dawn collision was in her thirties, the statement said. Her husband was seriously injured and hospitalized and their 14-year-old daughter also was helicoptered for hospital treatment and is in critical condition, the prosecutor said.
His statement said the collision did not appear to be intentional. Police detained the three occupants of the car for questioning."

The Israeli government and Hamas leadership are at a stalemate as both claim to want a cease-fire to facilitate a prisoner swap but cannot agree to conditions.
Both Israeli and Hamas leaders have expressed a desire to pause ongoing violence to allow an exchange, but the finer points of an agreement are proving difficult to resolve.
Hamas has turned down Israeli offers for a long-term cease-fire, rejecting the Jewish state's condition that top Hamas commanders leave the Gaza Strip for foreign exile.

U.S., Qatari and Egyptian mediators have sought to negotiate terms for a month-long cease-fire with a staggered exchange, beginning with civilians and eventually leading to the release of soldiers.
Hamas has largely refused to agree to any conditions that do not include plans for a permanent end to violence in the region.
""We are engaging in serious discussions with both sides,"" said Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari during a press conference this week. ""We have presented ideas to both sides. We are getting a constant stream of replies from both sides and that, in its own right, is a cause for optimism.""

An attack on Israel's forces in the Gaza Strip on Monday left 21 soldiers dead, its military said Tuesday. The attack was the deadliest for Israeli troops since the Hamas-led massacre on Oct. 7 that triggered the war.
According to the Israeli military, reservists were preparing explosives to demolish two buildings in central Gaza when a militant fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a tank nearby.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mourned the loss of the soldiers, saying Monday was ""one of the hardest days"" since the war began.

3H8O2SFPEO_9JJJDYX5FEU2ABI,'Libs of TikTok' creator appointed to Oklahoma library advisory committee,By Joshua Q. Nelson Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 6:50pm EST",20230124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/libs-tiktok-creator-appointed-oklahomas-library-advisory-committee,"'Libs of TikTok' creator Chaya Raichik blasts pornographic books in education, including an incident involving a Maine sixth grader who took a sexually explicit book home to his father.
The creator of social media account Libs of TikTok was appointed to a position in the Oklahoma State Department of Education on Tuesday.
Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters announced that Chaya Raichik was appointed to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s (OSDE) Library Media Advisory Committee (LMAC).
Walters posted a press statement on his X account, adding that he appointed Raichik because she was on ""the front lines showing the world exactly what the radical left is all about – lowering standards, porn in schools, and pushing woke indoctrination on kids.""
Walters sent Fox News Digital a statement about the appointment.
""Chaya Raichik and I have developed a strong working relationship to rid schools of liberal, woke indoctrinators, union smut peddlers, and Epstein Island advocates. Oklahoma is ground zero to take back our schools from the radical leftists.  I am proud to have her as a fierce defender of conservative values,"" he said.

'LIBS OF TIKTOK' CREATOR, CHAYA RAICHIK, NOW HELPING FAMILIES TO 'SPOT PREDATORY BEHAVIOR'
Walters' office explained to Fox News Digital that the LMAC is a ""volunteer advisory board"" hand-picked by the superintendent himself. It consists of parents, librarians, and English literature teachers.
The committee was established to guide the Oklahoma State Board of Education in their curation of books and materials within K-12 schools and is ""aimed at removing pornographic or sexualized content from public schools in the State of Oklahoma.""
Raichik is the woman behind the ""Libs of TikTok"" social media account, which gained popularity for exposing controversial elements in the education system, such as sexually explicit material in books.
""Libs of TikTok"" often reposts TikTok videos of left-wing users espousing their thoughts on cultural and racial issues.
""We will get porn out of schools,"" Raichik said in reaction to the announcement.
Raichik formerly worked as a real estate agent in Brooklyn. She launched @LibsofTikTok on X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2021.
""Libs of TikTok"" has garnered over 2.8 million followers since its creation.

Walters' decision came after he called for eliminating ""woke"" library standards from Oklahoma schools, guidelines developed by the American Library Association.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education voted in March last year to require schools to notify parents about their child's gender identity or pronouns and to ban ""pornographic material"" and ""sexualized content"" from school libraries.
Both policies were proposed by Walters.

The appointment of Raichik was met with push back from some lawmakers, with one questioning Raichik's qualifications.
Democratic state Rep. Mickey Dollens questioned Walters' decision to appoint someone who he claimed lacked an educational background to the advisory committee.

""Why did Superintendent Walters appoint a social media influencer to the state’s Library Media Advisory Committee? What are her qualifications? Is she a librarian? No. Education background? No. Does she even live in Oklahoma?"" Dollens said. ""No. Is she a right-wing extremist social media influencer responsible for perpetuating repeated bomb threats on Oklahoma public schools? Yes. We cannot overlook why Superintendent Walters made this controversial appointment,"" he said.

Last week’s many news reports of back-to-back health issues facing King Charles and Princess Kate of Wales highlight the fact of the monarchy’s human vulnerability. Though in most cases committed to life service, the royals are, of course, mortal like the rest of us.
Our own shores have given refuge to a British prince and his actress-wife who abdicated public service to enrich self-interests, as was their right.
But at a time when the Sussexes might have actually contributed something valuable, their personal flaws and failures are newly exposed. Indeed, their behavior lets down not just Harry’s family in a difficult moment, but an entire nation.

The monarchy is an ancient societal pillar of our mother country, whose history (including Magna Carta and the 1688 Glorious Revolution) and legacy inspired our own values of individualism, freedom and justice. It has endured, albeit with a 17th-century blip, for more than a millennia and as the many U.S. column inches devoted to the royals prove, holds a deep fascination even in our contrarian colony on this side of the Atlantic.
SARAH FERGUSON, DUCHESS OF YORK, ADMITS ‘SHOCK’ FROM 2ND CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITHIN A YEAR: ‘BE DILIGENT’
Revelations of 75-year-old King Charles III's diagnosis of an enlarged prostate and the subsequent corrective procedure highlight the reality of the oldest-ever British monarch to assume the throne. Simultaneously, much beloved, and seemingly robust Kate’s unexpected abdominal surgery, and extended hospital stay, have added to the anxiety.
The public disclosure of these health episodes, typically a delicate matter, has fueled copious global media attention.
Prince Charles' vision of a ""slimmed-down monarchy"" is being tested as medical hurdles sideline key members of his family who represent the nation in public life. With the withdrawal from this life of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, as well as the marginalization of Charles’ brother, Prince Andrew (implicated in the Epstein scandal), the ranks of family members available to carry out royal duties are sparse.
Compounding the reduction in force of these errant members, Prince William, heir to the throne, putting family first, has taken himself out of service temporarily to support his children and wife during her convalescence.
However, the royal show must go on as the monarchy has constitutional responsibilities. The robustly popular and tireless Princess Anne, as well as Charles’ other brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, and his wife Sophie emerge as reliable figures to pick up the slack, but the small bench emphasizes the limitations of a reduced royal workforce.

KATE MIDDLETON IS SELFLESS DESPITE HOSPITALIZATION, CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER PATIENTS AND KING CHARLES: EXPERT
Once a beloved figure known for his dedication and engaging personality, Prince Harry departed from meaningful royal service in 2020 to pursue self-enriching paths in America. His absence leaves a void.
The unforgivable statements made and actions taken by Harry and his wife to damage the monarchy and his family personally add to the betrayal. Under such circumstances, who could disagree with the public outcry for the prince and his wife to have their royal titles revoked?
Though the royal workforce is taxed by their absence, the monarchy is actually far better off without the malicious, untrustworthy pair, endeavoring to monetize all aspects of the only thing that makes them noteworthy and relevant – the relationship with Harry’s family.
Monarchy can survive only as long as there is public support. But Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seem to have incinerated their popularity in Britain, America and even in Hollywood, where they were once the toast of the town.
This week’s publication of Robert Hardman’s ""The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy,"" gives the world a new reason to scrutinize the Sussexes.

It reveals how the couple tortured the final years of the beloved queen, even going so far as to ""infuriating"" her by the way they presented the naming of Harry and Meghan’s daughter, ""Lilibet"" – a cherished nickname for Queen Elizabeth used only by a few of her dearest family members.
The Daily Mail reported the queen is said to have remarked in anger: ""I don't own the palaces, I don't own the paintings, the only thing I own is my name. And now they've taken that.""
Over the weekend, Hardman clarified: ""I've seen a lot of reports that the queen was furious about the name,"" Hardman said. ""It wasn't the naming that was the issue; it was the way that the naming was presented. The sort of war of words.

""It was the fact it was presented that she was in favor of this and then the BBC reported that actually she wasn't asked. And then the Sussexes said, ‘That's not true; here’s a lawyers’ letter,’ and the palace were asked to endorse this and very pointedly did not.""
We wish King Charles and Princess Kate full and speedy recoveries. Charles' first year as king has reinforced the monarchy's sense of permanence, stability and continuity. While they are irreplaceable, a short absence will highlight their value. As for the Sussexes, they forfeit an opportunity to earn some much-needed respect.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
It sounds like spring 2024 will be abuzzing as more than a trillion cicadas are expected to appear across the U.S.
For the first time in 221 years, the two groupings of cicadas, brood XIX and XIII, will emerge from the underground in 17 states across the country, according to Fox Weather.
Some of the states that will see both broods in 2024 are Illinois and Indiana.
ODD BUGS: FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT PRAYING MANTISES, WALKING STICKS AND OTHER UNIQUE-LOOKING INSECTS
""Most cicada species come out every year, but in the United States, there are two periodical broods of cicadas that stay underground for either 13 years or 17 years,"" Fox Weather reported.
""The last time they came above ground at the same time was in 1803.""
For the first time in 221 years, two broods of cicadas will emerge simultaneously across North America — overlapping in two states. (iStock)
This year will see a ""simultaneous explosion"" of cicadas across North America, Hannah Fry, a British mathematician and science presenter, said in a video posted to her Instagram page.
Fox Weather noted that the last time the cicadas rose above ground simultaneously was in 1803. ""when Thomas Jefferson was president, and Napoleon was thinking about invading England,"" Fry said on Instagram.
Fox News reached out to Fry for comment.
GOOD LUCK OMENS! WHY THE PRAYING MANTIS, BUTTERFLY AND LADYBUG ARE THOUGHT TO BRING GOOD THINGS
What makes this emergence so unique is that different broods co-emerge every five to six years, but there is usually a separation geographically, Fox Carolina reported.
""This year is different since the two broods are adjacent to each other and even have a slight overlap,"" the station wrote.
Brood XIX last emerged in 2011 and Brodd XIII came out in 2007.
The explosion of Brood XIX and Brood XIII will overlap in areas across Indiana and Illinois. (iStock)
""Brood XIX is arguably the largest (by geographic extent) of all periodical cicada broods, with records along the east coast from Maryland to Georgia and in the Midwest from Iowa to Oklahoma,"" researchers at the University of Connecticut (Uconn) wrote on its website about the species.
Cicada Mania, a website dedicated to cicada insects, states that Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia will witness the emergence of Brood XIX in the spring of 2024.
PHOTOGRAPHER WHO SHOCKED PEOPLE WITH ANT FACE PIC SHARES MORE PHOTOS THAT STUN: 'LOOKING FOR UNSEEN ANGLE'
Brood XIII is set to emerge in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and possibly Michigan, the Cicada Mania added.
The body of a cicada is composed of a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Its head has two antennae, two compound eyes, three simple eyes and a clypeus ""that connects the beak to the head,"" according to cicadamania.com. (iStock)
The number of cicadas that are set to emerge this year exceeds a trillions, Uconn reported.
""The state of Delaware is roughly 1.5 million acres in size. If the total combined area of a periodical cicada emergence is roughly the size of Delaware,"" Uconn wrote in its online article titled, ""The 2024 Periodical Cicada Emergence.""

The emergence is believed to take place in the middle of May and end in June.
""When they emerge, it gets noisy – 105 decibels noisy,"" the Associated Press (AP) wrote. ""Like ‘a singles bar gone horribly, horribly wrong,’"" entomologist John Cooley of the University of Connecticut told the news outlet.
University of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum told the AP that some people ""dread the cicada emergence.""
Cicadas aren’t poisonous. They don’t bite or sting and are ""largely harmless to humans and animals,"" researchers at Purdue University in Indiana wrote in an article titled, ""Emergence of the 17-Year Cicada.""
""However, the material their exoskeleton is made of is difficult for some animals to digest and may upset their stomach. If you are concerned about your pet, we strongly recommend consulting with your veterinarian.""

Nerozzi Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 9:39am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/anti-war-russian-presidential-candidate-collects-150000-signatures-supporting-campaign,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The anti-war candidate for Russia's presidency has successfully gathered tens of thousands of signatures, more than necessary to qualify for the upcoming election.
Civic Initiative Party candidate Boris Nadezhdin reports 158,000 signatures in support of his campaign — 58,000 more than the 100,000 signatures needed to qualify, according to reports from Russian outlets.
Nadezhdin announced the milestone on Tuesday, stating that the massive amount of extra signatures is meant to ensure against any attempts to find logistical issues with his candidacy.

The campaign claims the 158,000 figure does not include signatures collected from Russian voters overseas. Signatures must be submitted for review by Jan. 31.
Nadezhdin is enjoying a spike in relevance due to his popular anti-war messaging and his promise to end the invasion of Ukraine if elected.
While Nadezhdin is taking the election seriously, the Kremlin remains unconcerned.
President Vladimir Putin submitted his nomination papers to the Central Election Commission last month for the March 17 election, which he is widely expected to win. The former intelligence officer continues to hold overwhelming political power in Russia's government and institutions.

Liberal Democratic Party candidate Leonid Slutsky and New People Party candidate Vladislav Davankov were approved for the March election by officials earlier this month.
Danankov currently serves as the deputy speaker for the state Duma — Russia's lower legislative chamber. Slutsky is the head of the state Duma's foreign affairs committee.
The Russian Communist Party has registered candidate Nikolai Kharitonov to stand in the election.

While ostensibly rivals for the nation's top executive position, communist Nikolai Kharitonov, nationalist Slutsky and liberal-leaning Davankov are widely seen as mere token opposition by analysts.
Not all individuals seeking to run against Putin have been given clearance to stand for election.
Yekaterina Duntsova — an independent politician who wanted to run on a platform to end the war with Ukraine — had her candidacy application unanimously rejected by the country’s electoral commission on Saturday, which cited ""numerous violations"" in the papers she had submitted.

A Wisconsin mom recently welcomed a new baby in a McDonald's parking lot when she and her husband couldn't make it to the hospital in time for the delivery they had planned for.
Analysia Beck, a Muskego resident, started having contractions late in the night before waking her husband, Daniel Beck, when the pain grew stronger.
""By the time he was up, and he came downstairs with me, I was ready to go,"" Analysia Beck, a mom of three, told Fox News Digital.

""So I had him call the hospital and the hospital, of course, is asking all these questions, and they asked what my plan for pain was, and I [responded], ‘An epidural immediately.’""

A Florida couple was arrested Tuesday after police discovered three children in their care were living in ""deplorable"" conditions at their home, authorities said.
Officers initially responded to a call about an argument between neighbors at the home of Michelle Sofia, 38, in Bunnell, where she lived with her live-in boyfriend, 41-year-old Willie London, and her three children, aged 11, 12 and 17, the Bunnell Police Department said.
When officers arrived, their priorities changed upon uncovering the living conditions inside the house.
Officers described what they found inside as ""deplorable,"" observing ""layers of dirt, piles of soiled clothing, layers of feces and piles of rat droppings throughout the residence.""

Search and rescue teams in Vermont hiked for miles in the frigid backcountry on Saturday to help 23 skiers and snowboarders who had gotten lost, authorities said.
Officers initially received a call around 2:30 p.m. about seven to nine lost skiers and snowboarders near Killington, a town located about 56 miles south of Montpelier, the Killington Police Department said.
Killington police and Vermont State Police search and rescuers determined that a total of 21 individuals, which included six juveniles, were actually lost, according to the department.
A crew of 12 search and rescuers hiked, snowshoed and used skis with skins on the roughly five-mile trek in frigid temperatures to reach the lost party. Temperatures in Vermont at the time had dropped to the low teens and single digits.

Rescuers escorted the group out of the woods to safety and warmed them up in a Killington Fire Department Heavy Rescue truck and inside the personal vehicles of crew members.
As the crew was ready to leave the area, a second call came in about two additional skiers lost in the backcountry. The team sent six members into the woods to reach the lost skiers and walked them to safety at around 7:30 p.m.
The rescue team later got a call for two more skiers who had gotten lost in the backcountry. (Killington Police Department)

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A woman from Dothan, Alabama was arrested earlier this month after she allegedly reported a burglary was taking place at her home, but instead, she was afraid of the weather, according to police.
The Dothan Police Department received a 911 call on Jan. 9 from 39-year-old Kelley Carole Giniebra, who claimed someone was burglarizing her home.
When officers arrived, they determined a burglary was not happening in the home.
After speaking with Giniebra and conducting an investigation, officers learned the caller falsely reported the crime, so officers would show up to her home promptly.

The officers also discovered the reason Giniebra wanted them to arrive so quickly was because she was afraid of the bad weather happening that day, police reported.
Giniebra was ultimately arrested and charged with making a false report to law enforcement.

Jean Carroll defamation case.
Former President Trump took the stand on Thursday in his defense in the civil defamation damages trial stemming from E. Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit claiming he sexually attacked her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.
The 2024 GOP frontrunner has vehemently denied the allegation. His denial resulted in Carroll slapping Trump with a defamation lawsuit, claiming that his response caused harm to her reputation.
Upon taking the stand Thursday, Trump was asked three questions by the defense.
First, Trump was asked whether he saw his deposition played in court, to which he replied: ""Yes.""
Second, he was asked if he stands by his statements in the deposition, to which he replied: ""100 percent. Yes.""
And third, he was asked if he ever threatened Carroll in his tweets and social media posts.
""No,"" Trump said. ""I was only defending myself from what I believe was a false allegation.""
The judge struck statements from Trump that went beyond a yes or no answer.
On the way out of the courtroom, Trump repeatedly said: ""This is not America.""
Writer E. Jean Carroll arrives at Manhattan federal court in New York on Jan. 17. Less than a year after convincing a jury that former President Donald Trump sexually abused her decades ago, Carroll is set to take the stand again to describe how his verbal attacks affected her after she came forward. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez, File)
Trump and his legal team insist that Carroll's allegations are fabricated, with the former president's initial reaction including an accusation that Carroll was motivated by wanting to sell copies of her book.
Trump has repeatedly told Fox News Digital that he has ""absolutely no idea who this woman is.""
Carroll, 79, alleged that Trump raped her at the Bergdorf Goodman department store across from Trump Tower in Manhattan sometime in 1996.

A federal jury in New York City decided last year that Trump was not liable for rape but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president was ordered to pay $5 million.
Trump, on his Truth Social account last week, posted images of Carroll’s tweets dating back to 2015. In one image, Carroll wrote: ""How do you know your ‘unwanted sexual advance’ is unwanted, until you advance it?""
Trump also posted that Carroll ""has been ‘all over the place’ on the timing of this alleged ‘incident,’ which never took place, and is being coached by Lunatic Radical Left Democrat operative attorney, Roberta Kaplan, who has sued me before, and just lost.""

A Chicago Democrat plans to propose a bill effectively banning natural gas in new buildings — a move that would follow in the footsteps of other liberal cities trying to prohibit gas stoves in new homes.
Officials in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and New York City have pursued restrictions on gas-powered furnaces, ovens and stoves. In Chicago, Alderwoman Maria Hadden plans to introduce her own proposal Wednesday setting emissions standards that appliances using natural gas can't meet, the Chicago Tribune reported.

""This is a matter of real survival and the future of our city — and especially our economic future,"" Hadden told the outlet. ""We’re being forced in this direction by nature, but also by policy and by business and industry.""
Supporters of banning gas-powered products have argued that eliminating or reducing natural gas hookups would reduce carbon emissions and help meet climate goals. Indoor gas stoves were also associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, according to a 2022 study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

""People are making these decisions because it’s economical, it’s healthier, it’s safer,"" Hadden told the Chicago Tribune.
New York, in 2023, became the first state to pass a ban on natural gas connections in new buildings. Hookups will be banned in smaller buildings starting in 2026 and in larger buildings in 2028, according to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.
American Gas Association President and CEO Karen Harbert said natural gas is a cost-effective solution for Americans.
""From providing affordable energy to consumers to driving down emissions, the benefits this fuel has for our nation are tangible and impossible to ignore,"" American Gas Association President and CEO Karen Harbert told the Chicago Tribune in a statement. ""Any push to ban natural gas in Chicago would raise costs to consumers, jeopardize environmental progress and deny affordable energy to underserved populations.""

But Citizens Utility Board Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz said going fully electric would save consumers money, the Chicago Tribune reported. She pointed to a 2022 Energy Futures Group anaylsis that found going electric could save Chicago residents between $11,000 and $24,000 over a 20-year period.
""Status quo with regards to heating in Chicago is unsustainable in almost every sense of the term,"" Moskowitz told the outlet. ""People’s gas bills are already extremely high, the gas utility is trying to get rate increases, people are paying a minimum of $50 a month before they even use any gas, and we have vast swaths of the city structurally unable to afford their heating bills.""

New Hampshire voters from across the state were handed a unique ""I Voted"" sticker after casting their ballots on Tuesday, thanks to creative fourth grade students.
Voters across the country are accustomed to receiving some version of a red, white and blue sticker with the phrase ""I Voted"" across the front at the polls. New Hampshire put a twist on an old idea by creating colorful new stickers designed by students.
The New Hampshire Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary of State ran the first ""I Voted"" Sticker Contest during this 2024 election cycle.

FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS: WHAT NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS WANT IN A GOP NOMINEE
Over 1,000 fourth graders from across the state sent in their designs, and three were chosen to be given out during the state's primary election.
""We were thrilled by the number of submissions we received from highly engaged fourth graders across New Hampshire,"" said Deputy Secretary of State Erin Hennessey in a statement. ""Their designs showed a high level of talent, home state pride, and engagement in our election process. It was difficult to pick just three winners!""
The rules for the contest were simple. The phrase ""I Voted"" was required to be somewhere on the sticker. Additionally, designs had to be drawn on a two-inch wide template. The stickers had to capture the spirit of the state while also encouraging people to get out and vote in the presidential primaries.

Grace of Milton, Jacob of Auburn and Rilynn of Mount Vernon, created unique designs it onto the final selection of voting stickers.
Grace's ""I Voted"" sticker features the Old Man of the Mountain, a beloved symbol of the Granite State. The Old Man of the Mountain, a rock formation that resembled the side profile of a man's face, crumbled on May 3, 2003. Even though the rock formation no longer exists on Cannon Mountain in Franconia, New Hampshire, the former landmark still serves as a symbol of the state. On Grace's sticker, the Old Man of the Mountain rests against an American flag.
Jacob also incorporated an American flag into his design, on the upper half of the sticker. Below, a fisher, shaped like the state of New Hampshire, casts a line into the blue water.

It may not be so safe in a tropical paradise.
The U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas issued a warning and travel advisory to Americans on Wednesday, citing the 18 murders that have occurred on the island nation since Jan. 1.
""Murders have occurred at all hours including in broad daylight on the streets,"" the warning states. ""Retaliatory gang violence has been the primary motive in 2024 murders.""

The embassy warned Americans traveling to the Bahamas to ""exercise extreme caution"" in the eastern portion of New Providence Island and to keep a low profile.
U.S. officials also urged those traveling to the island to not physically resist when being robbed and use caution when traveling at night.
The State Department put the Bahamas on its ""Exercise Increased Caution"" warning and said gang violence is behind the increase in murders.
""Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults,  occur in both tourist  and non-tourist  areas,"" the warning said. ""Be vigilant when staying at short-term vacation rental properties  where private security companies do not have a presence. ""

In response to the uptick in crime, Prime Minister Philip Brave Davis said authorities will put up roadblocks and initiate more police action, The Nassau Guardian reported.
""We will not violate anyone’s civil liberties, but you are likely to be impacted by more roadblocks and unannounced police action,"" he said. ""This may make you late for your appointments, or delay plans you have, but this is a small price to pay for the collective benefit of having our streets made safer, and our lives less blighted by murder and other violent crimes.""
Earlier this week, the State Department put Jamaica on its ""reconsider travel"" advisory.
""Violent crimes, such as home invasions, armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides, are common. Sexual assaults occur frequently, including at all-inclusive resorts,"" the warning states. ""Local police often do not respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a conclusive sentence.""

4CJKRCWHF5_FINV65YCR8YS3ZB,Ex-FBI official who shut down Hunter Biden lines of investigation violated Hatch Act with anti-Trump posts,By Brooke Singman Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 2:03pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-fbi-official-shut-down-hunter-biden-lines-investigation-violated-hatch-act-anti-trump-posts,"Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reacts to reports that a former FBI agent hid intelligence regarding Joe and Hunter Biden’s business dealings.
EXCLUSIVE: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel determined a former FBI official violated the Hatch Act in his political posts on social media — the same official whistleblowers claimed had shown a ""pattern of active public partisanship"" which ""likely affected"" investigations involving former President Trump and Hunter Biden.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had referred former Washington, D.C., Field Office FBI assistant special agent in charge Timothy Thibault amid allegations that he engaged in prohibited political activity on social media for investigation.
FBI RECEIVED 'CRIMINAL INFORMATION' FROM OVER 40 CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES ON JOE BIDEN, HUNTER, JAMES: GRASSLEY
Grassley’s calls for investigation came after whistleblowers approached his office alleging Thibault was instrumental in the opening of the elector investigation into the Trump campaign and its associates based, in part, on information from a left-aligned organization.

The whistleblowers alleged that Thibault did so by ""circumventing normal process and procedure to open full field investigations.""
Grassley had learned through whistleblowers that Thibault’s opening memo calling for a full investigation, which was ultimately approved by FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland, allegedly ""scrubbed and diluted"" details of the sources’ political bias.
Fox News Digital also had previously reported that Thibault ""ordered closed"" an avenue of ""derogatory Hunter Biden reporting"" in October 2020."" At the time, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson were investigating Hunter Biden's business dealings. Hunter Biden also was under federal investigation at the time--an investigation beginning in 2018.
The FBI ultimately removed Thibault from his post as an assistant special agent in charge. He later resigned.
Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a letter the Office of Special Counsel sent to Grassley this week.
""This letter responds to your request that the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, and Federal Bureau of Investigation investigate former FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault and allegations that he engaged in prohibited political activity on social media,"" the letter states, noting that the Office of Special Counsel has ""exclusive jurisdiction over civil Hatch Act matters,"" and that Grassley’s investigative referral was passed on to its office.
""Although Mr. Thibault has left government service, we completed our investigation and concluded that he violated the Hatch Act,"" the OSC wrote.
DOJ KNEW HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP WAS 'NOT MANIPULATED,' CONTAINED 'RELIABLE EVIDENCE' IN 2019: WHISTLEBLOWER
The Hatch Act governs the political activity of all federal civilian executive branch employees and prohibits them from using their official authority or or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election; knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving political contributions from any person; being candidates for public office in partisan elections; and knowingly soliciting or discouraging the political activity of any individual with business before their employing office.
The Hatch Act also prohibits employees from engaging in political activity while on duty, in a federal room or building, wearing an official uniform or insignia, or using a government vehicle.

The OSC explained that employees in agencies like the FBI are ""further restricted"" and ""prohibited"" from participating in partisan political management and campaigning by engaging in activity that is ""in concert"" with a political party, partisan political group or candidate for partisan political office.
OSC explained that when applied to social media, employees are restricted from sharing or retweeting messages from partisan political groups because ""like traditional leafletting, social media communications also promote the group’s message.""
With regard to Thibault’s social media activity, the OSC reviewed his posts on Twitter, now X, and LinkedIn.
WRAY SAYS FBI DOWNPLAYING HUNTER BIDEN INFORMATION IS 'DEEPLY TROUBLING,' AS REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS
One post was from July 2020, in which Thibault retweeted a post from the Lincoln Project. OSC described the group as a ""hybrid political action committee, which is considered a partisan political group.""
""The Lincoln Project’s tweet included an article from The Atlantic entitled, ‘Donald Trump is a Broken Man,’"" the OSC states.
""By retweeting the Lincoln Project’s message, Mr. Thibault engaged in modern-day leafletting on social media,"" the OSC determined, while noting that even though Thibault was ""on leave"" at the time he retweeted the post, the Hatch Act prohibits all employees, ""even when they are off duty and away from work.""

""Accordingly, because Mr. Thibault shared a message from a partisan political group on Twitter, OSC has conduced that he acted in concert with a partisan political group, in violation of the Hatch Act,"" OSC determined.
GRASSLEY PRESSES DOJ, FBI FOR TRANSPARENCY ON 'PARTISAN' POLITICIZATION OF AGENCIES, HUNTER BIDEN PROBE
""Mr. Thibault has been warned that if in the future he engaged in activity prohibited by the Hatch Act while employed in a Hatch Act-covered position, OSC would consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law that could result in disciplinary action,"" OSC wrote.

Grassley told Fox News Digital that the American people ""deserve to have confidence that the officials entrusted to lead the top echelon of our federal law enforcement agencies are not letting political bias infect their work.""
""These federal employees should not blur their official business with their political viewpoints,"" Grassley stressed, telling Fox News Digital that OSC confirmed that Thibault ""failed to meet that standard.""
""I’ve warned that this sort of political bias will erode public confidence in the FBI,"" Grassley told Fox News Digital. ""It’s up to the bureau to restore that trust through transparency and cooperation with congressional oversight.""

Acclaimed filmmaker Norman Jewison has died at age 97.
Jewison, who earned a total of seven Oscar nominations throughout his career and took home the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1999, died ""peacefully"" on Saturday, according to his publicist, Jeff Sanderson. No cause of death was provided.
The Canadian-born director was best known for directing classic films like ""In the Heat of the Night,"" starring Sidney Poitier, ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" starring Topol, and ""Moonstruck,"" starring Cher.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Cher praised her ""Moonstruck"" director, thanking him for helping her earn the best actress Oscar for the film.

""In the Heat of the Night"" is one of Jewison's most celebrated films, starring Poitier as a Black detective working with a racist small-town sheriff, played by Rod Stieger, to solve a murder in the American South.
He drew on his experiences hitchhiking through the Jim Crow South after World War II, and in his autobiography, ""This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me,"" he wrote about racism and injustice being a recurring theme in his work.
""Every time a film deals with racism, many Americans feel uncomfortable,"" he wrote. ""Yet it has to be confronted. We have to deal with prejudice and injustice or we will never understand what is good and evil, right and wrong; we need to feel how ‘the other’ feels.""
The film earned five Oscars, including best picture and best actor for Stieger.

4IEVGF5I18_XI0WL44TXIXJ413,The DeSantis media strategy: Would embracing liberal press sooner have made any difference?,By Joseph A. Wulfsohn Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 9:00pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/desanits-media-strategy-would-embracing-liberal-press-sooner-made-difference,"Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume on the two-person Republican primary contest between Haley and Trump after DeSantis drops his campaign.
As Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis officially bows out of the presidential race and offers his support to former President Trump, his yo-yo approach to the legacy media is fueling questions about whether it had an impact on his now-failed candidacy.
In the final days of his campaign, DeSantis was self-reflective and acknowledged an ""error"" he made in an interview last week with radio host Hugh Hewitt.
""I came in not really doing as much media. I should have just been blanketing,"" DeSantis said. ""I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything. I started doing that as we got into the end of the summer, and we did it. But we had an opportunity, I think, to come out of the gate and do that and reach a much broader folk. Now, I’m everywhere. I mean, I’ll show up wherever.""
DOWN AND OUT: WHAT WENT WRONG WITH RON DESANTIS' RUN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION?

DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall told Fox News Digital it was a ""mistake"" for DeSantis to ice out the media, saying he ""diminished his own relevance.""
""The curious thing was that there was no need for DeSantis to fear the media exposure,"" McCall said. ""He is quite good at fending off partisan attacks, and he is clearly smarter than the journalists who would have been questioning him. His potential supporters would have delighted in seeing DeSantis disarm partisan media interviewers with his wit and rational arguments.""
The strategy of avoiding the liberal press didn't start with his presidential launch. It began in the lead-up to his 2022 reelection bid, which he won by a whopping 20-point margin after squeaking out a victory in 2018 by less than one point. And it didn't happen in a vacuum.
While his profile was certainly elevated when he was first elected governor, it wasn't until the COVID pandemic that he truly entered the national spotlight. DeSantis was among the leaders from red states who made headlines for defying lockdown groupthink, prompting members of the media to attack him with names like ""DeathSantis"" as they praised blue state governors like New York's Andrew Cuomo for their responses. And presumably he was running for president as his popularity with Republicans continued to rise, some in the media as early as 2021 were pushing the notion that electing him would be even ""more dangerous"" than electing Trump.
What earned him plenty of conservative praise was his combative style with reporters like one with CNN about Florida's vaccine rollout and another from a local NBC affiliate who referred to parental rights legislation with the liberal activist-peddled name ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

The media's hostile treatment towards DeSantis went beyond press conferences. News organizations promoted false narratives about the governor like when CNN and MSNBC heavily boosted fired Florida health official Rebekah Jones' fake conspiracy theory that the DeSantis administration had altered COVID data to reopen the state. Or when CBS' ""60 Minutes"" infamously accused DeSantis of a pay-for-play scheme.
Members of DeSantis' team would often retaliate by either leaking email exchanges from liberal journalists exposing overt biases or preemptively responding to what they called ""hit pieces"" being written about him.
Eventually, it reached a boiling point with Team DeSantis, which implemented a media strategy in 2022 that was ultimately carried into DeSantis' presidential bid: ""cut them off.""
""Treat them like activists because that's what they are… You're on a campaign helping a Republican candidate get elected, would you allow a Democrat tracker that you recognize into a private campaign event? I would hope not. That's how you should view mainstream media activists…. They are not there to report fairly on you,"" DeSantis aide Christina Pushaw explained back in September 2022. ""They need access or else if they have no access to any conservatives, any Republican elected officials, then they are seen by everybody as what they are, which is Democratic Party communication operators and activists. So you do not have to grant them access.""
The newly-implemented strategy led to liberal reporters being shut out of DeSantis campaign events. Whether it was the correct strategy at the time will remain a mystery, but was not a mystery was the resounding victory DeSantis achieved in the 2022 midterm election that was broadly disappointing for Republicans nationwide.
CONSERVATIVES CELEBRATE DESANTIS DROPPING OUT AND ENDORSING TRUMP: ‘UNITING THE GOP’

Fresh off his successful reelection bid, early GOP primary polls leading into 2023 showed DeSantis extremely competitive against Trump, who officially launched his presidential bid one week after the November midterms. In the meantime, DeSantis remained on the sidelines, delaying his entry to the race til the end of Florida's legislative session in the spring.
However, a seismic shift occurred in presidential politics: the indictment by New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg. The indictment against Trump, centered on whether laws were broken in the 2016 hush money payments he made to pornstar Stormy Daniels, was widely-criticized over its legal flimsiness. But outside the courtroom, Republicans rallied behind the former president as they saw the first of what ultimately became four rounds of indictments they perceived as the targeting the Democrat-controlled justice system of a political opponent. And that translated in a major boost for Trump in the polls.
DESANTIS TAKES PARTING SHOT, SAYS HALEY REPRESENTS ‘WARMED-OVER CORPORATISM’
""I don't know if there is anything Ron DeSantis could have done to overcome the rally-around effect of the indictments against Trump,"" Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News Digital. ""With each successive indictment, a significant number of Republicans continued to move towards Trump in defiance of the political establishment.""
""If Democrats wanted Trump to be the nominee because they thought he would be easier to beat, they accomplished the mission of preventing DeSantis from rising again. To a large extent, the events were beyond DeSantis' ability to control,"" Jacobson added.
Fast-forward to May 2023. DeSantis finally entered the race. Except he forwent the traditional televised rally often where a candidate is joined onstage by their beautiful family and adoring fans in the backdrop to launch the campaign. Instead, he went for an audio conversation with Elon Musk on X that was plagued with technical difficulties and crashes (The DeSantis campaign spun the blunder as the governor ""breaking the internet."").
Despite the ridicule from the legacy media and Trump supporters, DeSantis carried on and maintained the strategy of dodging the liberal press.

Several weeks of campaigning have not translated into any shift in the polls for the Florida governor. In July, RealClearPolitics had him averaging at 21% while the former president was averaging over 52%. In January, it was only a 14-point spread between the two of them.
Desperate times called for desperate measures. And desperate measures meant DeSantis breaking his liberal media boycott, granting an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.
That led to an avalanche of TV hits from CNN to NBC to ABC to CBS, even multiple appearances on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""
Those network interviews were largely cordial. While DeSantis would at times be combative, his interactions with liberal journalists paled in comparison to his COVID-era press conferences that had real fireworks.

Though DeSantis himself has express regret for not embracing the liberal media from the get-go of his campaign, would it have made any difference if he did?
""Nope,"" Fox News contributor Joe Concha told Fox News Digital. ""It wouldn't have changed one vote.""

Concha commended DeSantis for being ""prepared"" in his various media appearances in the closing stretch of his campaign but in the end, it's ""near impossible"" to peel off Trump's support, especially since the former president ""blows out the sun as far as media attention and coverage.""
Jacobson agreed. Regardless of what DeSantis' media strategy was, ""none of it mattered.""
""No interaction with the media could have changed things,"" Jacobson added.

4KDFYR6CF9_TWKRE6KUYPQX4HM,Fossil fuel industry unleashes on Biden for halting key natural gas projects,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 12:55pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fossil-fuel-industry-unleashes-biden-halting-key-natural-gas-projects,"Former pipeline worker Bugsy Allen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how the Biden administration has weakened the U.S. energy sector.
A large coalition of more than 30 fossil fuel industry associations is raising the alarm over an expected White House decision to delay permitting for key natural gas export facilities over their potential climate impacts.
The groups — including the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Exploration and Production Council (AXPC) — penned a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, saying the actions would be a ""major mistake,"" harming U.S. jobs and putting allies at risk. The letter came shortly after The New York Times reported President Biden will soon order climate impact analyses for 17 proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects.
""The United States is the world leader in natural gas production, meeting record domestic demand and becoming the top exporter of LNG in 2023,"" the joint letter stated. ""Our nation’s abundant supply of natural gas is an impactful geopolitical tool, helping insulate American consumers from increasing global instability while advancing American national interests and ensuring the energy security of key U.S. allies.""
""Moving forward with a pause on U.S. LNG export approvals would only bolster Russian influence and undercut President Biden’s own commitment to supply our allies with reliable energy, undermining American credibility and threatening American jobs,"" they continued.

According to industry, LNG export facilities are vital to meet energy demand in Europe and Asia as nations look to wean off Russian natural gas supplies. In the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Biden traveled to Europe and struck a deal with the European Union, vowing to send more U.S. LNG to the bloc.
And this month, energy associations Eurogas and the Asia Natural Gas & Energy Association (ANGEA) issued strong statements of support for continued permitting of U.S. LNG export terminals. Eurogas reiterated such exports were critical for ensuring the full phase down of Europe's dependence on Russian natural gas, while ANGEA added U.S. LNG is needed to meet Asia's decarbonization goals.
BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION
However, the New York Times report Wednesday, citing three unnamed officials with knowledge of internal deliberations, stated Biden would require the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct a more rigorous environmental review process for 17 pending LNG export terminals.
While the DOE still needs to sign off on the proposed projects' permits, it was not previously required to analyze their contribution to climate change. The agency has never before rejected a gas export application on climate grounds.

""This would be a win for Russia and a loss for American allies, U.S. jobs and global climate progress,"" API CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. ""There is no review needed to understand the clear benefits of U.S. LNG for stabilizing global energy markets, supporting thousands of American jobs and reducing emissions around the world by transitioning countries toward cleaner fuels.""
""This is nothing more than a broken promise to U.S. allies, and it’s time for the administration to stop playing politics with global energy security,"" he said.
ENERGY DEVELOPER AXING KEY COAL POWER PLANTS TO MEET ECO GOALS, JEOPARDIZING POWER FOR MILLIONS
In addition, proponents of increased LNG exports have noted that transitioning the world's economy to more natural gas reliance would also help ensure nations meet decarbonization goals. Without increased LNG, they argue, nations would rely more heavily on coal-fired power generation, which has a much larger carbon footprint when burned than natural gas power generation.
The industry letter to Granholm noted that the U.S. has led the world in carbon emissions reductions thanks in large part to greater reliance on natural gas. Coal produced the largest share of electricity generated in the U.S. for decades until 2015 when natural gas surpassed it.

""America should be exporting more LNG not less, and any action or future plan to hinder American LNG exports, including the White House's reported pause on CP2, is misguided policy that undermines the US economy, our allies' security, and global emissions goals,"" AXPC CEO Anne Bradbury said in a statement.
Among the projects that would be impacted by the DOE's review is the so-called Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2) project, a proposed $10 billion LNG terminal located on a 546-acre site in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which would be the largest export terminal of its kind in the nation.

According to its developer Venture Global, the facility would have a nameplate export capacity of 20 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG and a peak capacity of about 24 MTPA. In 2023, the U.S. exported 88.9 MT of LNG, according to a FOX Business analysis of tanker tracking data, meaning the CP2 facility would alone increase exports by a staggering 23%.
""It appears that individuals within the White House are trying to force policymaking through leaks to the media. This continues to create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on US LNG for their energy security,"" Shaylyn Hynes, a spokesperson for energy developer Venture Global, said in a statement. ""If this leaked report from anonymous White House sources is true, it appears the Administration may be putting a moratorium on the entire U.S. LNG industry.""
""Such an action would shock the global energy market, having the impact of an economic sanction, and send a devastating signal to our allies that they can no longer rely on the United States,"" Hynes added. ""The true irony is this policy would hurt the climate and lead to increased emissions as it would force the world to pivot to coal.""

4KW4HF69C0_ECF9CU1EO8BDDSX,Pentagon greenlights manufacturing of nuclear-capable stealth bomber: reports,By Greg Wehner Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 8:42pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/pentagon-green-lights-manufacturing-nuclear-capable-stealth-bomber-reports,"Former Air Force Brigadier General Chris ""Mookie"" Walker announced he was launching a campaign for Congress because the moment for the nation was ""too important"" to leave to career politicians.
Pentagon officials announced the low-rate production of Northop Grumman’s B-21 Raider, a stealth bomber expected to be in service by 2027, according to reports.
Defense News reported that the Pentagon’s acquisition chief, William LaPlante told reporters he approved production in the Fall, after seeing results of the aircraft’s flight and ground tests.
""One of the key attributes of this program has been designing for production from start – and at scale – to provide a credible deterrent to adversaries,"" he said. ""If you don’t produce and field warfighters at scale, the capability doesn’t really matter.""
The B-21 will be part of the Air Force, which will begin fielding a fleet of a minimum of 100 B-21 Raiders, the first of which will go into service by 2027.
US AIR FORCE UNVEILS NEW PHOTOS OF B-21 RAIDER DURING COLORADO SYMPOSIUM
Unveiled in December 2022, the B-21 Raider will be a dual-capable, penetrating-strike stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. The B-21 will form the backbone of the future Air Force bomber force consisting of B-21s and B-52s. (U.S. Air Force)
The new stealth bomber is being rolled out to replace the current B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit and is expected to enter service by 2027. By 2040, the B-21 is expected to completely replace the older bombers.
The Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) says on its site that the B-21 will be a dual-capable penetrating strike stealth bomber that can deliver both conventional and nuclear munitions.
""The B-21 will form the backbone of the future Air Force bomber force consisting of B-21s and B-52s,"" the site says. ""Designed to operate in tomorrow’s high-end threat environment, the B-21 will play a critical role in ensuring America’s enduring airpower capability.""

According to a Pentagon estimate in 2022, the B-21 Raider will come in at a cost of nearly $700 million for each aircraft. The first test flight of the new bomber is expected to take place later this year.
General Thomas A. Bussiere, commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command, spoke at the 2023 Air and Space Forces Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colorado in March 2023, and said the Air Force plans to acquire 220 or more bombers, in the long-term plan.
The U.S. Air Force said in a press release that the plane was designed with an open architecture that allows for the quick insertion of mature technologies. It was also designed for supportability, maintainability and sustainability.

""The technologies that are integrated, and the open architecture system will provide any potential capabilities to advance, modernize and keep that weapon system on the leading edge of a threat in the future,"" Bussiere said.
The B-21 Raider is the first new American bomber aircraft in more than three decades, and almost every aspect of the program has been classified.
When the bomber was first unveiled in December 2022, Northrop Grumman said the rollout of the newest nuclear stealth bomber marked the first time the world’s first sixth-generation aircraft would be seen by the public.

""When delivered to the Air Force, the B-21 will join the nation’s strategic triad as a visible and flexible deterrent; supporting national security objectives and assuring the nation’s allies and partners,"" the company said in a release.

4LHT3T5V82_S9VS76CDPTDFF6U,GOP lawmakers urge DOJ to forgo immigration lawsuit against Lone Star State: 'Texas should not be punished',By Kyle Morris Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 10:55am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-urge-doj-forgo-immigration-lawsuit-against-lone-star-state-texas-should-not-punished,"Eagle Pass, Texas resident Carlos Herrera speaks out of the border crisis on 'America Reports.'
FIRST ON FOX: Several members of the Texas Republican congressional delegation are calling on the Justice Department to forgo its recent lawsuit against the Lone Star State, saying the Biden administration has ""failed Texans and the American people with their open-border policies.""
In a letter slated to be sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday, more than a dozen House Republicans from Texas called out the Biden administration for its inability to secure the southern border while simultaneously targeting those who attempt to do so.
""We write to you with grave concern regarding the ongoing legal challenges being faced by the State of Texas in relation to Senate Bill 4 (SB4) passed on November 21, 2023, which grants the State of Texas the authority to arrest individuals who illegally crossed the border from Mexico,"" the lawmakers, led by Texas GOP Rep. Roger Williams, wrote in the letter.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Texas over SB4, pitting Republican Gov. Greg Abbott against the Biden administration as both remain at odds over how to handle the escalating crisis at the southern border.

The lawsuit, filed in an Austin federal court, came after Abbott signed into law last month a measure challenging the federal government's authority over immigration matters. In addition to President Biden, several blue cities like New York and Chicago have pushed back against Abbott for having thousands of migrants bussed from his state to their jurisdictions.
Pointing to a passage in the suit against their home state — one in which the DOJ noted ""the Constitution assigns the federal government the authority to regulate immigration and manage our international borders"" — the Republican lawmakers insisted the Biden administration and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ""have repeatedly refused to enforce our immigration laws and stop the flow of illegal migrants into our country.""

""Since President Biden took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has documented more than 6.7 million illegal border crossings; with an additional 1.7 million logged as 'got-aways.' This Administration’s open-border policies have failed the American people and turned every state into a border state,"" the House Republicans said. ""The record high levels of illegal migration have taken a toll on Texans throughout the state, prompting Governor Abbott to take action where the Biden Administration has not.""
The lawmakers said the DOJ's claim that SB4 is unconstitutional ""neglects the fact that the Texas law simply follows current federal immigration law which already makes it a crime to cross into the U.S. illegally.""
Highlighting their support for Abbott, as well as other state officials who are looking to reduce the number of illegal border crossings, the lawmakers said the Biden administration's policies have ""enticed migrants to continue to cross.""

""Texas has a responsibility to ensure the safety of its residents and must be allowed to act in a manner that is consistent with that goal,"" they wrote. ""President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have failed Texans and the American people with their open-border policies. Texas should not be punished for this Administration’s refusal to enforce our current immigration laws.""
""We urge that you reconsider your lawsuit and allow the state of Texas to act as necessary to secure the safety of its residents,"" the Texas Republicans concluded.
MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER HIT RECORD 302K IN DECEMBER, SOURCES SAY
Under the Texas law, migrants could either agree to a judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Those who do not leave could face serious felony charges if arrested again. Those ordered to leave would be sent to ports of entry along the border with Mexico, even if they are not Mexican citizens. The law can be enforced anywhere in Texas, but some places are off-limits, including schools and churches.
""Against all odds, Texas, and Texans, have stepped up in the fight to secure our border,"" Williams said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""If President Biden is not going to take responsibility for the invasion of our country, Texas must be allowed to protect itself without fear of retaliation. I, along with the members of the Texas Delegation, ask that the DOJ reconsider its harmful suit, but most importantly, it’s past time they do their job and secure our border.""

As of publishing time, 15 Republicans had signed the letter expected to be sent to Garland on Wednesday evening. Those who have signed the letter include: Texas GOP Reps. Dan Crenshaw, Keith Self, Pat Fallon, Lance Gooden, Jake Ellzey, Morgan Luttrell, Michael McCaul, Ronny Jackson, Monica De La Cruz, Pete Sessions, Chip Roy, Beth Van Duyne, Michael Burgess, John Carter, and Brian Babin.
Abbott has repeatedly accused the Biden administration of failing to address issues at the border amid record numbers of migrants crossing into the United States. The bussing program has angered Democrats in blue cities, who say their jurisdictions lack sufficient resources to care for migrants they have received.
Following a Monday ruling by the Supreme Court that gave Border Patrol agents the ability to cut or clear out razor wire that Texas had placed along the banks of the Rio Grande to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally, Texas officials vowed to maintain strict border security measures.
Lt. Chris Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety said the state, under Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, ""will maintain its current posture in deterring illegal border crossings by utilizing effective border security measures.""
That includes reinforced razor wire and anti-climb barriers along the Rio Grande, Olivarez said in the post to X.

Sources with Customs and Border Protection told Fox News Digital earlier this month that migrant encounters hit a staggering 300,000 incidents in December 2023, reaching a level thought unimaginable just years ago.

Between Dec. 1 and December 31, more than 302,000 migrants were documented attempting to cross the U.S. southern border. It is the highest total for a single month ever recorded. It is also the first time migrant encounters have exceeded 300,000.

President Biden will win the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night, the Fox News Decision Desk projects.
Biden will claim victory solely from write-in-ballots after failing to file in the state last year.
No delegates will be allocated Tuesday night as the primary is unsanctioned, but the Democratic National Committee is expected to review the matter down the line.
Biden is projected to defeat his Democrat rivals, including Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is likely to finish in double digits, and self-help author Marianne Williamson.
Phillips entered the race calling for a ""new generation of leaders.""
Biden's victory is a symbolic one. Because of the dispute between the DNC and New Hampshire over which states should vote first, there will be no delegates on the line tonight.
LIVE UPDATES: NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
Democrats in the state launched a write-in campaign in an attempt to prevent an electoral embarrassment for the president as he runs for a second term in the White House.

Biden, last year, proposed a nominating calendar for the 2024 election cycle that would move New Hampshire from its first-in-the-nation standing and replace it with South Carolina — a much more diverse state that Biden won in a landslide in 2020. That win ultimately catapulted him to the Democrat nomination and eventually the White House.
In the 2020 New Hampshire Primary, though, Biden came in fifth place.
But New Hampshire ignored the proposal and moved its primary up, in accordance with a state law that mandates its presidential primary be held seven days ahead of a similar contest.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — An official in Mali says more than 70 people are dead after an unregulated gold mine collapsed late last week, and a search continues amid fears the toll could rise.
Karim Berthé, a senior official at the government's National Geology and Mining Directorate, confirmed the details to The Associated Press on Wednesday and called it an accident.
UN PEACEKEEPERS WITHDRAW FROM NORTHERN MALI AS VIOLENCE RISK ESCALATES
It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse that occurred on Friday and was reported on Tuesday in a Ministry of Mines statement that estimated ""several"" miners dead. The collapse occurred in Kangaba district in the southwestern Koulikoro region.
Such accidents are common in Mali, Africa’s third-largest gold producer. Artisanal miners — small-scale, informal ones — are often accused of ignoring safety measures, especially in remote areas.
""The state must bring order to this artisanal mining sector to avoid these kinds of accidents in the future,"" Berthé said.
The Ministry of Mines statement ""deeply regretted"" the collapse and urged miners as well as communities living near mining sites to ""comply with safety requirements.""
In recent years, there have been concerns that profits from unregulated mining in northern Mali could benefit Islamic extremists active in that part of the country.
The region of this latest collapse, however, is far to the south of that and closer to the capital, Bamako.

""Gold is by far Mali’s most important export, comprising more than 80% of total exports in 2021,"" according to the International Trade Administration with the U.S. Department of Commerce. It says more than two million people, or over 10% of Mali's population, depend on the mining sector for income.
The Ministry of Mines has estimated that the country has 800 tons in gold deposits."

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., also congratulated Haley on a well-run campaign but endorsed Trump earlier this week.
""South Carolina is Trump country and he is crushing it right now,"" Mace told Fox News on Wednesday. ""I want to say that Nikki Haley ran a great race. She made it deep into the playoffs, but the playoffs are now over and it's time to start the Superbowl. We have got to take on Joe Biden right now if we're going to take our country back.""

Haley vowed to keep pressing forward during a campaign appearance in the state on Wednesday, however.
""This is a choice between more of the same, or going forward. More of the same is not just Joe Biden, more of the same is Joe Biden and Donald Trump,"" she told supporters in Charleston. ""So we are not going to sit there and just give up.""

Haley's optimism has visibly enraged Trump, who attacked her as ""delusional"" on social media Wednesday night. He then took the issue onto the stage at a campaign event.
""Who the hell was the impostor that went up on the stage before and, like, claimed a victory?"" Trump said, referencing Haley's reaction to her New Hampshire performance.

4O56UJAWGN_Z26B6XMHCIJSS94,Texas Gov. Abbott insists courts will side with state over feds in border battle: 'We can win',By Kendall Tietz Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 3:09pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-gov-abbott-insists-courts-side-state-over-feds-border-battle-win,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the ongoing fight with the federal government and says Texas has the right to protect its border
Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said President Biden's press secretary was ""uninformed"" in her rhetoric about the state's border security measures, adding Thursday he believes the state will prevail in the courts over the Biden administration.
Karine Jean-Pierre said in a new interview it was ""unfortunate"" that Abbott ""has politicized this issue of what's happening on the border, and it's not making people's lives safer.""
""It's actually making it harder for law enforcement at the border to do their job,"" she told CNN.
Abbott fired back on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, calling it ""a very uninformed comment on her part.""
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS PUSH TO BAN FEDS FROM REMOVING BORDER BARRIERS AFTER SUPREME COURT DEFEAT
""There's really only one person in America not doing their job, and that's the President of the United States, who's not enforcing immigration laws,"" he said.
""Also, as she has already been called out, and the president and other Democrats and media, they have cast a false narrative about some people dying on the border, that apparently Texas denied Border Patrol access to, that's been completely debunked.""
The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration on Monday in a case involving a razor wire fence along Texas’ border with Mexico, allowing Border Patrol agents to cut concertina wire that Texas had installed while litigation continues.
But Abbott said the high court only issued two sentences and did not hand down an opinion on the matter. He expressed confidence that the state will prevail if the case is heard ""on its merits.""
""I think, maybe, we will get it to the Fifth Circuit on its merits, where I believe we can win. And I do believe when it gets to the Supreme Court, we can win… No one knows what the [justices] were thinking at all. All we know is they wanted to send it back to the Fifth Circuit,"" he told Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino.

Abbott said the Biden administration had broken the compact between the federal government and the state of Texas as laid out by the Constitution.
""Included in that agreement was the compact that the federal government would take care of the states and Article IV, Section IV of the Constitution speaks to that and says that if the federal government does not take care of the states and the states are in danger… we can ask the federal government to live up to its obligations.""
SENATE BORDER BILL TO ALLOW 5,000 MIGRANTS A DAY BEFORE TITLE 42-TYPE LIMIT STARTS; SPARKING CONSERVATIVE FURY
""Then the authors of the Constitution knew there would be times when the federal government would not live up to its duty and so they empowered states in Article I, Section X, the right of self-defense,"" he added. ""What Texas is asserting is our Article I, Section X right of self-defense because the President of the United States is not fulfilling his duty to enforce the laws passed by Congress that deny illegal entry into the United States.""
In a 5-4 vote Monday, the justices granted an emergency appeal from the Biden administration as part of the escalating standoff at the border with Texas.
When asked if he would instruct Texas law enforcement officers to physically prevent federal officers from accessing the contested part of the border, Abbott said ""the Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws.""
CHIP ROY URGES TEXAS OFFICIALS TO IGNORE SUPREME COURT ORDER ON BORDER RAZOR WIRE: ‘GO TO HELL’
""Texas, very simply, is securing the border,"" he added. ""There are criminals coming across our border. Texas has a right as a state to stop criminals from coming into our state to make arrests of those criminals. We have National Guard, as well as Texas Department of Public Safety officers, who are there to make those arrests and to deny illegal entry.""
""Joe Biden actually does have an option here,"" he added. ""Joe Biden's option is to enforce the laws of the United States and stop this illegal entry.""

4U07TLMYVA_2SO8OFBBXSHYUS4,Speaker Johnson says House will vote on impeaching Mayorkas 'as soon as possible',By Elizabeth Elkind Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 10:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speaker-johnson-says-house-vote-impeaching-mayorkas-soon-possible,"Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., discusses the Republican push to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the ongoing border crisis.
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told fellow Republican lawmakers that he intends to hold a House-wide vote on whether to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ""as soon as possible.""
Johnson made the announcement in a letter to colleagues sent on Friday, a copy of which was obtained by Fox News Digital.
""The facts show that President Biden and his Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas have willfully ignored and actively undermined our nation’s immigration laws,"" the speaker wrote. ""Rather than accept accountability, President Biden is now trying to blame Congress for what HE himself intentionally created.""
Johnson pointed out polling that showed illegal immigration as an increasingly urgent issue for American voters.

""The American people know better, and that’s why public opinion polls show the country has overwhelmingly sided with us on this issue. When we return next week, by necessity, the House Homeland Security Committee will move forward with Articles of Impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas,"" he said. ""A vote on the floor will be held as soon as possible thereafter.""
Johnson also reaffirmed the House GOP’s support for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott amid a tense standoff with the federal government at the U.S.-Mexico border.
""I made clear that we stand with Texas Governor Greg Abbott in his heroic efforts to protect the citizens of his state and all Americans, and I am emphasizing again today that House Republicans will vigorously oppose any policy proposal from the White House or Senate that would further incentivize illegal aliens to break our laws,"" Johnson said.
It comes as a bipartisan deal on border security between the Senate and White House, talks Mayorkas has been a part of, appears increasingly out of reach.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who is involved in the talks, told reporters on Thursday that they would know in the next 24 to 48 hours whether a border deal was possible. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who is leading talks for the GOP, said later when asked about text coming next week, ""That's been the hope. Of course, a week ago I said we would have text that week, too.""
When asked about Johnson's Friday letter, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pointed Fox News Digital to an earlier memo emphasizing Mayorkas' role in the talks to solve the crisis. ""Instead of working in a bipartisan way to fix our broken immigration laws, the House Majority is wasting time on baseless and pointless political attacks by trying to impeach Secretary Mayorkas,"" they added.
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS STRIKE DEAL TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES
But House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have warned that whatever comes out of the Senate will not just be accepted by their chamber.
Johnson has gone further both in public and in private, calling for nothing short of the measures in H.R.2, the border security bill House Republicans passed in May. That bill, which includes Trump-era policies like Remain In Mexico, has been called a nonstarter by Democrats.

Republican lawmakers have also expressed skepticism of the talks over Mayorkas' role, after blaming him and President Biden for the current border crisis. The GOP-led House Homeland Security Committee is expected to advance articles of impeachment against Mayorkas next week.
Republicans are also demanding concessions on border security in exchange for support on Democrats' $106 billion supplemental funding request for Ukraine.

4UH3TSQ96Z_KGSA2FTHNWIAB3X,"Biden calls Trump 'most responsible' for 'stripping away' abortion, vows to veto any nationwide ban",By Brooke Singman Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 6:17pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-calls-trump-most-responsible-stripping-away-abortion-vows-veto-any-nationwide-ban,"Will 2024 be the charm for a third-party candidate?
President Biden on Tuesday said former President Trump is ""most responsible"" for the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, blaming his predecessor for ""stripping away"" abortion rights and vowing to veto any potential national abortion ban.
Biden made the comments at a ""Reproductive Freedom"" campaign rally in Manassas, Virginia, on Tuesday afternoon.
BIDEN CALLS ON CONGRESS TO RESTORE ROE V. WADE ABORTION PROTECTIONS AS FEDERAL LAW: 'THIS IS NOT OVER'
""I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,"" Biden said. ""A New Supreme Court made an extreme decision overturning Roe v. Wade with their Dobbs decision.""
Biden said the high court ""did what it had never done before.""
""It ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years and that was so important to so many Americans for so long,"" Biden said, stressing that the ""health and lives of women in this nation would be at risk.""

Jackson Women's Health overturned the landmark 50-year-old Roe v. Wade case and erased a federal right to an abortion.  (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)
Biden said women are ""being turned away from our emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care, forced to go to court to plead to help to protect themselves, and the ability to often have children in the future.""
""The cruelty is astounding and it's a direct affront to a woman's dignity to be told by extreme politicians and judges to wait to get sicker and sicker before anything can happen, even to the point where, as you heard your life had been determined to be in danger, or the idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she'd been raped or the victim of incest,"" Biden said. ""It's outrageous.""
""Or the idea a woman receives competent medical advice that the fetus she's carrying won't live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future and she still can't get medical care,"" he continued. ""I think it's unconscionable that anyone think that anyone think that this is where America is going in 2024.""
""Let there be no mistake: the person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,"" he said. ""Trump says he’s proud that he overturned Roe v. Wade.""
SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK OPINION
The Supreme Court ruling in 2022 came in the court's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The ruling returns the issue of abortion back to the states after nearly 50 years.
Biden pointed to the 21 states that have enacted abortion bans, and blamed Trump.
Biden has criticized Trump for creating a conservative majority on the high court. Trump, during his administration, appointed conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
""The reason women are being forced to travel out of state—women are being forced to travel across state lines for health care is Donald Trump,"" he said. ""When you are threatened with prosecution, it's because of Donald Trump.""
""And the reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump, and because of Donald Trump, doctors are fleeing their home states, setting up practices in other states because they're afraid they'll be put in prison if they exercise their responsibilities in states like Texas,"" Biden said. ""Doctors Can get a life sentence for providing the care they were trying to provide. It's Outrageous.""
Biden claimed that Trump and ""MAGA Republicans,"" which he said includes House Speaker Mike Johnson ""are hell bent on going even further.""

""To date, MAGA republicans in Congress propose three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every state,"" Biden said. ""Let me tell you what they are: First is a zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions. The second one introduced is a six-week ban with a penalty for violating — it is jail. And the third is a 15-week ban and the penalty is a five-year jail sentence.""
Biden warned that ""even if you live in a state where extremist Republicans are not in charge of the state government, your right to choose your right to privacy is still risk.""
""But as long as I have power of the presidency, know, this — if Congress are to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it,"" Biden said. Look, MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication.""
Biden added: ""I don't think this court and the MAGA Republicans have any clue about the power of women in America. I don't think that they have any clue but they're about to find out.""
Biden went on to say the 2024 election is ""going to be the most important election we've had since 1864.""

""I mean, the reasons are clear. Democracy is on the ballot. Freedom is on the ballot — like the freedom to choose, the freedom to vote, the freedom to love who you want, the freedom to go to work, go to school, go to your house and worship without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war,"" Biden said.
""So my question to you is simple. Are you ready? Are you ready to defend democracy? Are you ready to protect our freedoms? And are you ready to win this election? Let's get this done,"" Biden said. ""Talk to your families and friends. Organize your community. Register to vote. Get people to the polls. And let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.""

A U.S. congressional committee has requested documents from the University of Pennsylvania regarding the school’s ""abysmal"" response to antisemitism on its campus, the committee said Wednesday.
Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, sent a letter to the university’s leadership asking for all reports of antisemitic occurrences on campus and any documents showing disciplinary action taken by the institution since Jan. 1, 2021.
Foxx wrote that the request comes as questions remain about the institution’s ""willingness to address antisemitism seriously"" following numerous statements that UPenn’s then-President Elizabeth Magill made during a congressional hearing last year.
""When asked whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Penn’s code of conduct, Ms. Magill replied that ‘it is a context-dependent decision,’"" the letter reads, in part.

Foxx wrote that despite the resignations of Magill and Scott Bok, then-Chairman of Penn’s Board of Trustees, the institution’s failures in addressing antisemitism ""extend well beyond the two leaders.""

In the letter, Foxx accused UPenn of a ""clear double standard"" when defending how it addressed antisemitism on campus.
""In defense of this disgraceful record, Penn has cited its supposed commitment to free speech. … However, Penn has demonstrated a clear double standard by tolerating antisemitic vandalism, harassment, and intimidation, but suppressing and penalizing other expression it deemed problematic.""

The letter includes multiple examples of what the committee called a ""deeply troubling pattern"" of antisemitic incidents at the university that occurred both before and after the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel.

50G9N0OOBW_OKJ8XTVQ5THZBK1,"As Trump easily beats Haley in New Hampshire, she vows to stay in the race",By Howard Kurtz Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 3:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-easily-beats-haley-new-hampshire-she-vows-stay-race,"Kayleigh McEnany discusses what else former President Trump needs to do to unite the Republican Party and what Nikki Haley is still campaigning for on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
Nikki Haley swept the first votes cast in New Hampshire, but it was downhill from there.
In the town of Dixville Notch, which has this strange ritual of voting after midnight, all six votes went to Haley, with journalists outnumbering them 10 to 1.
It was clear that many at CNN and MSNBC were rooting for Haley, grasping at exit-poll figures that seemed favorable and downplaying Trump-friendly statistics, such as that 63% described themselves as very or somewhat conservative. ""The Nikki Haley campaign has to be happy so far with what they’re seeing,"" MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow said.
Well, not so much. When the last polls closed at 8 p.m. ET, the cable news networks said the race was ""too early to call."" By then, Trump had jumped out to a 52 to 46% lead.
HALEY VOWS TO CONTINUE ON AFTER FALLING TO TRUMP IN HIGH-STAKES NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY

Ron DeSantis having dropped out of the race two days earlier, Trump and fellow candidate former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are battling it out in this first-in-the-nation primary.  (Getty Images)
Within 13 minutes, NBC and Fox News projected Donald Trump the winner. Five minutes later, CNN called the primary for Trump as well.
The only question now was the margin.
Almost immediately, Haley came out smiling and swinging away, as if she had just cruised to victory. ""What a great night. God is so good. Thank you, New Hampshire!""

She seemed detached from reality, until she devoted one sentence to congratulating Trump on his victory.
Then the former governor declared ""we got close to half the vote."" Except, well, in a two-person race that’s not good enough.
Haley then started attacking the man who named her U.N. ambassador, a montage of lines she has used before. Clearly fired up, she said Republicans have lost election after election under Trump. She said it was ""time to put the negativity and chaos behind us."" She said Trump had a ""senior moment,"" after describing how he blamed her for Jan. 6 when he meant Nancy Pelosi. And her favorite, well-worn line: ""A Trump nomination is a Biden win and a Kamala Harris presidency.""

By the time Haley finished, Trump’s lead was up to 10%. Half an hour later, it was up to 12%.
On CNN, former Obama White House official David Axelrod expressed doubt that Haley would want to contest her home state of South Carolina, where Trump has a huge lead in the polls.
Even Maddow conceded ""she can’t win in South Carolina.""When Trump came out, he mocked Haley’s address:
""She’s doing a speech like she won. She didn’t win, she lost… She pretended she won Iowa… She had a very bad night… She’s still hanging around.""
Then came the accusation he can’t let go of: ""We also won in 2020.""
And noting his lead in most general election polls, Trump said: ""Beating Biden–who the hell can’t.""
And then he pivoted to the border mess.
When Haley’s day began with a ""Fox & Friends"" interview, it was clear that she had reached the when-are-you-dropping-out stage, and the former South Carolina governor pushed back hard against what she calls the ""elite media.""
""No, I don’t get out if I lose today… We’ve had 56,000 people vote for Donald Trump,"" Haley said, meaning in Iowa.
""I don’t care how much y’all want to coordinate Donald Trump. At the end of the day, that’s not what Americans want. Americans want a choice.""
Brian Kilmeade jumped in: ""I’m really wondering why you think we’re the enemy.""
NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOWDOWN: WHY TRUMP IS CONNECTING WITH VOTERS AND HALEY AND DESANTIS HAVE NOT
""Because I’ve looked at the media, look at the media saying, ‘Oh, this is Donald Trump’s to have,’ look at the political class all coalescing and saying, ‘everybody needs to get out.’ That’s not democracy. That’s not who we are, who we are. When have we ever had two people, down to two people in New Hampshire? And you say, oh, it’s over.""
Could Haley have made it a tighter race in what should be her best state, in part because independents – and Democrats who changed their registration months ago – can vote in the GOP primary?
It turns out that Ron DeSantis, who also faced a barrage of are-you-toast questions, hurt Haley by dropping out Sunday and endorsing Trump. Polls show that his voters went to the former president by a 2-to-1 margin.
Haley’s miscalculations included canceling two debates with DeSantis, in which she could have made a passionate appeal to the voters, and not hitting Trump hard until the final few days. She also kept a light schedule, didn’t take town hall questions for days and basically stuck to her stump speech, which didn’t make much news.
Her campaign soon put out a memo saying ""not going anywhere"" and explaining why several states ""are fertile ground for Nikki.""
In Trump’s final speech, in which he called Haley ""not electable,"" he’s widely reported to have slurred some words (though I don’t know why critics are obsessing over a brief reference to himself in the third person).

""We have become a drug-infested, crime-ridden nation which is incapable of solvin’ even the swollest, smallest problem, the simplest of problems we can no longer solve. We can’t do anything.
""We are an institute in a powerful death penalty! We will put this on!""
Joe Biden’s campaign jumped on this as part of a concerted effort to portray the 77-year-old front-runner as clearly slipping – obviously to counter the liability that even many Democrats see the 81-year-old president as too old for a second term.
Much of the media, especially some MSNBC shows, are also pushing the narrative that Trump is confused, especially since he mixed up Haley with Nancy Pelosi.
A headline in the liberal New Republic says ""Donald Trump is Losing It. Will the Media Make It a Story?""
But even before the results were in, the media pivoted to whether Trump can win the general election, which shows they consider him the nominee, as does the veepstakes chatter.
Politico says ""Donald Trump has a problem no matter what happens in New Hampshire on Tuesday night: There’s a whole swath of the Republican electorate and a good chunk of independents who appear firmly committed to not voting for him in November if he becomes the nominee."" Political veterans warn this ""makes it much harder for him to win back the people he’s alienated, including those once willing to vote Republican.""
John Kelly, Trump’s second chief of staff, gave a statement to CNN about his ex-boss: ""A person who cavalierly suggests that a selfless warrior who has served his country for 40 years in peacetime and war should lose his life for treason – in expectation that someone will take action. A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.
""There is nothing more that can be said,"" the retired general concluded. ""God help us.""
But if he feels that strongly, why wait until New Hampshire primary day to say so?

Look for much more of this. To be sure, Trump drew a flood of negative coverage during the runup to Iowa and New Hampshire, but it was mixed with grudging admiration for his comeback since Jan. 6, ju-jitsu flipping of the four indictments, and surge in the polls. One might even have detected a sense that the media wanted Trump to win the nomination: He’s always the best story, and was viewed as the only candidate President Biden could beat.
Now that he’s overtaken the incumbent in most polls, the media are already shifting to full opposition.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A bill to allow composting of human bodies as an alternative to burial or cremation received overwhelming approval in the state House on Tuesday.
The measure passed the House on a 37-2 vote and now goes to the Senate. It authorizes a practice called ""natural organic reduction,"" often referred to as ""human composting.""
Chief sponsor Rep. Sean Lynn, a Dover Democrat, called the practice a ""gentle, respectful, environmentally friendly death care option.""
DELAWARE GOV. JOHN CARNEY DELAYS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS OVER ILLNESS
""Natural organic reduction is a sophisticated process that applies cutting-edge technology and engineering to accelerate the natural process of turning a body into soil,"" he said.
Testing in other states that allow the practice found the resulting soil to be ""high quality and regenerative,"" Lynn added.
Human composting is currently legal in Washington, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, California, New York and Nevada, and legislation has been introduced in more than a dozen other states, according to Recompose, a Seattle-based company that offers the service and advocates for its expanded use.

Lynn said the Delaware measures takes into account the precedent from other states, but it includes additional environmental and health safeguards. If the bill is enacted into law, specific regulations would be developed over the ensuing year, he said.
The organic reduction process involves putting a body into a large tank that also holds straw, wood chips or other natural materials for about 30 days. The human remains and organic materials would mix with warm air and be periodically turned until the body is reduced to a soil-like material that can then be given to the dead person’s family.

Supporters of the bill have said human composting is a more environmentally friendly alternative to cremation that uses less energy and doesn’t involve the use of formaldehyde or the release of carbon dioxide and mercury into the atmosphere.
Under the bill, remains could not be accepted for composting if they contain radioactive implants, or if the person died as the result of a radiological incident. Also off-limits would be the remains of those suspected of having certain infections, such as the Ebola virus or diseases that can affect both animals and humans and lead to incurable neurodegenerative disorders, such as mad cow disease.
Lynn said he expects human composting will become more popular amid greater emphasis on environmental sustainability and land-use issues regarding cemetery space."

A New York City man wanted for raping a 10-year-old girl earlier this month after meeting her online has been arrested and charged.
Drequan Drayton-Howard, 23, gave himself up to law enforcement on Wednesday and was charged with rape, sex abuse and endangering the welfare of a child.
Drayton-Howard, of the Bronx, met the girl on January 6 after they connected online via an adult dating app, police previously told Fox News Digital. Fox 5 reports that Drayton-Howard used the Bumble app to lure his victim.

MAN ACCUSED OF KNIFEPOINT NYC RAPE RELEASED DUE TO TECHNICALITY
The suspect then took the victim back to the apartment where she lives in the vicinity of Third Avenue and East 122nd Street in Harlem, where he raped her, police said.
The victim’s mother was out at the time of the alleged rape, according to local reports. As the victim's mother arrived home, she reportedly encountered the suspect, who fled.
The victim was taken by EMS to a local hospital in stable condition for evaluation.

5AR12GTFBP_3GG1JY9RMXTJGE6,UK grants extension for Northern Ireland to revive its collapsed government,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 12:36pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-grants-extension-northern-ireland-revive-collapsed-government,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The U.K. government on Tuesday gave Northern Ireland politicians until Feb. 8 to restore the collapsed regional government in Belfast, after a deadline this month passed without an end to the deadlock.
The extension comes amid signs Northern Ireland's largest British unionist party is close to deciding whether to end a boycott that has kept the power-sharing administration on ice for almost two years.
The British government is legally obliged to call new Northern Ireland elections now that a previous deadline of Jan. 18 has passed. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said he would bring a bill to Parliament on Wednesday to set a new date of Feb. 8.

He said ""significant progress"" had been made towards reviving the Northern Ireland Executive, and the short extension would give ""sufficient"" time for it to bear fruit.

The Democratic Unionist Party walked out in February 2022 in a dispute over post-Brexit trade rules. Ever since, it has refused to return to government with the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein. Under power-sharing rules established as part of Northern Ireland’s peace process, the administration must include both British unionists and Irish nationalists.
The walkout left Northern Ireland’s 1.9 million people without a functioning administration to make key decisions as the cost of living soared and backlogs strained the creaking public health system.
Teachers, nurses and other public sector workers in Northern Ireland staged a 24-hour strike last week, calling on politicians to return to government and give them a long-delayed pay raise. The British government has agreed to give Northern Ireland more than 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) for its public services, but only if the executive in Belfast gets back up and running.
The DUP quit the government in opposition to new trade rules — put in place after the United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020 — that imposed customs checks and other hurdles on goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K.
SCABIES OUTBREAK IN UK LINKED TO DRUG SHORTAGES, EXPERTS CONFIRM: 'PROGRESSIVELY WORSE'
The checks were imposed to maintain an open border between the north and its EU neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process. The DUP, though, says the new east-west customs border undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the U.K.
In February 2023, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a deal to ease customs checks and other hurdles for goods moving to Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. But it was not enough for the DUP, which continued its government boycott.
Protracted negotiations failed to persuade the DUP to return to government. But there have recently been signs of movement in the political stalemate.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said Monday that talks with the U.K. government had made progress, and ""we will endeavor to close the remaining gaps between us.""
Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill said it was ""decision time"" for the DUP.
""Workers and their families cannot be left in the lurch any longer,"" she said. ""The DUP leader should do the right thing and restore the democratic institutions."""
5BSOCJGJVK_Q6FL5SUUEPUG8LZ,NBC News reporter says Trump campaign stopped him from covering New Hampshire event,By Brian Flood Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 1:25pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbc-news-reporter-trump-campaign-stopped-him-covering-new-hampshire-event,"New Hampshire’s highly anticipated primary comes on Tuesday, January 23.
NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard said former President Trump's campaign stopped him from covering a New Hampshire event on Sunday – but the campaign said it doesn't ""bar reporters based on their reporting"" and simply scrapped a network pool.
Hillyard was serving as a pool reporter representing five television networks, a longstanding practice in which TV news organizations take turns sending a single reporter to cover campaign events when there isn’t space for multiple crews.
It was NBC’s turn to send a pool reporter to a Trump event on Sunday, but Hillyard notified the other networks ""the pool would be cut off for the day"" if he was the representative.

""Your NBC News pooler has been informed that the pool will no longer travel with and take part in the former president’s OTR stops today before his Rochester rally. Your pooler was told that if he was the designated pooler by NBC News that the pool would be cut off for the day,"" Hillyard sent to the pool, which includes ABC, CBS, CNN, and Fox News, along with NBC.
""After affirming to the campaign that your pooler would attend the events, NBC News was informed at about 2:20pmET that the pool would not be allowed to travel with Trump today,"" Hillyard wrote.
The Trump campaign said Hillyard was not banned or barred based on his reporting.
""We don’t ban or bar reporters based on their reporting,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital. ""Just decided not to do a pool.""

The New York Times reported that Hillyard was allowed to cover a different Trump campaign event later in the day on Sunday.

While the campaign said his reporting was not the issue, Hillyard has agitated the former president and his allies in the past.
On Friday, Hillyard briefly sparred with Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., over E. Jean Carroll’s claims Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. Stefanik told Hillyard she didn’t believe Carroll’s claims – which Trump has long denied. A jury found Trump liable last year for sexually abusing Carroll.
Last year, Trump reportedly demanded the NBC News reporter be removed from his plane after objecting to a question about Manhattan DA Alvin Brag’s criminal probe, according to audio obtained by the Washington Post.

The former superintendent of the Chicopee Public Schools in Massachusetts pleaded guilty Tuesday to lying to federal agents investigating 99 threatening text messages sent to a candidate for police chief in 2021, prosecutors said Tuesday.
Lynn Clark, 53, of Belchertown, pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Mastroianni has scheduled sentencing for April 30.
Chicopee, a city of about 55,000 residents roughly 80 miles west of Boston, was in the process of hiring a new police chief in December 2021 when law enforcement received a report that a candidate for the job had received texts from unknown numbers that seemed intended to force them to withdraw, prosecutors said.

The candidate pulled their application, and the city delayed the selection process. Clark was charged in April, 2022 and removed from her duties as superintendent a few weeks later.

Investigators said about 99 threatening messages threatening ""reputational harm"" were sent from fictitious phone numbers purchased through a mobile app. Phone and internet records revealed the numbers were purchased by Clark and that the accounts sent each of the threatening messages.
Investigators said Clark falsely said she received threatening text messages from unknown phone numbers, when, in fact, she sent the messages to herself.

She also falsely named other city workers who she felt may be responsible for sending the messages, according to prosecutors. They said Clark also denied that she had downloaded a mobile app with which she purchased the fictitious phone numbers to send the messages.
Clark later admitted that she sent the messages and downloaded the app, prosecutors said.
The charges of making false statements each carry a sentence of up to five years in prison, up to one year of supervised release, and a fine of up to $10,000."

Johnnie Moore, president of the Congress of Christian Leaders, discusses genocide against Nigerian Christians in the name of jihad.
Human Rights Watch said Thursday that Burkina Faso’s security forces last year killed at least 60 civilians in three different drone strikes, which the group says may have constituted war crimes.
The West African nation’s government claimed the strikes targeted extremists, including jihadi fighters and rebel groups that have been operating in many remote communities.
The accusation by the New York-based watchdog were the latest in a string of similar charges raised by various rights groups.

The report also said the strikes were ""in violation of the laws of war"" and showed ""little or no concern"" for civilians. HRW had said last year that it found Burkina Faso's forces were carrying out extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and torture in conflict-hit communities.
The drones targeted crowds at a market and a funeral between August and November last year, according to Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at HRW.
The government did not respond to inquiries made regarding the findings, the HRW said. The Associated Press could not independently verify the facts surrounding the strikes.
The report was based on interviews with at least 23 witnesses and non-government organizations. The strikes were reported by state-owned media as successful operations that killed Islamic extremists, it said, without mentioning any civilian casualties.

The first drone strike, on Aug. 3, hit a weekly market in the village of Bouro said to be controlled by al-Qaida-linked extremists, HRW said. It quoted three survivors as saying that jihadi fighters were seen entering the market at the time of the strike. One of those interviewed said it was ""full of civilians when the drone hit.""
The second strike, on Sept. 24, in the village of Bidi in the Nord region near the border with Mali took place as about 100 men were attending a funeral. There was no militant presence there at the time, the report said, adding that 25 people were killed and dozens injured.
The third strike, in November, targeted a market across the border near the Malian town of Boulkessi. According to the witnesses quoted, while there were some militants present at the time, ""almost all"" at the market were civilians.
The military in Burkina Faso and those in other parts of Africa's Sahel region have struggled to contain jihadis and rebel groups."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Some scientists are warning of the potential for ""Arctic zombie viruses"" in Siberia, according to reports.
The claim is that as climate change causes the Arctic permafrost to thaw, it will release ancient viruses that could put people at risk of disease.
National Geographic defines ""permafrost"" as ""a permanently frozen layer below Earth’s surface [that] consists of soil, gravel and sand, usually bound together by ice.""
NEW COVID VARIANT JN.1 NOW COMPRISES UP TO 30% OF US CASES: CDC
Jean-Michel Claverie, PhD, a geneticist and an emeritus professor at the School of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University in the South of France, has conducted extensive research on Arctic zombie viruses, also referred to as ""Methuselah microbes.""
In 2015, a research team unearthed several viruses from the permafrost, which were estimated to be 30,000 years old, as Claverie wrote in an article published by Think Global Health on Jan. 18.

""It is now clear that a significant proportion of prehistorical viruses can remain infectious for even longer periods of time,"" Claverie wrote.
After being stable for the last 400,000 years, the Siberian permafrost could become ""threatened"" due to global warming, according to the researcher.
CDC'S COMMENTS ON TODAY'S PNEUMONIA OUTBREAKS VS. THE EARLY COVID CASES, AS COMPARED BY EXPERTS
Thawing ""increases the release and revival of permafrost microbes, including ancient ones from the late Pleistocene (i.e., the last 100,000 years),"" Claverie wrote.
""Our species — hence, our immune system — has never been in contact with most of those microbes during its evolution.""

Previous research has identified many different types of bacteria in permafrost that are linked to some common human pathogens, according to Claverie.
Those have included Acinetobacter, Bacillus anthracis, Brucella, Campylobacter, Clostridia, Mycoplasma, various Enterobacteria, Mycobacteria, Streptococci, Staphylococci and Rickettsia.
""Our species — hence, our immune system — has never been in contact with most of those microbes.""
While Claverie said we can ""reasonably believe"" that modern antibiotics could control many of these older pathogenic bacterium, he also said the situation would be ""much more disastrous"" in the case of an ""ancient or unknown virus"" being released from permafrost and causing animal or human diseases.

""As unfortunately well-demonstrated by the most recent pandemics (for example, COVID and AIDS), each new virus, even related to previously known families, requires the development of highly specific medical responses, such as new antivirals and vaccines,"" he said.
Fox News Digital reached out to Claverie requesting additional comment.
NEW ANTIBIOTIC KILLS DEADLY, DRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA IN ‘SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH’
Marion Koopmans, PhD, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience in the Netherlands, confirmed that there is documentation of hidden viruses that can still infect bacteria and unicellular organisms.
""That means the potential is there,"" she told Fox News Digital via email. ""You then would have to assume that viruses that may be able to infect humans or wild animals also could be present and at some point be released.""
Koopsmans added, ""Given that, I think it is wise to think through where risk of exposure could be highest and monitor for health effects in those places.""

Edward Liu, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, acknowledged that permafrost viruses are a ""valid concern, if long-disappeared viruses start circulating in a naive population.""
He also told Fox News Digital, ""But so are zoonotic viruses (animal viruses), which spread to the human population when people and animals come into contact due to demand for wet markets, which was a possible source of COVID-19 in China.""
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IS ON THE RISE, DOCTOR WARNS: ‘THIS IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM’
Other potential sources include bush meat (African markets that allow exposure to animal viruses) or just human civilization pushing into wildlife areas, Liu added.
""In each case, a virus enters a naive population, so we have no herd immunity to slow it down,"" he said.
To reduce the risk, Liu called for ""cooperative internal research"" into animal viruses and possibly permafrost viruses.
Other potential sources of novel viruses include wet markets, an expert noted. (iStock)
""When a new virus hits, scientists can then sequence the genetic material,"" he said.
""MRNA vaccine technology is much faster at creating new vaccines than older technologies, which involved growing viruses and inactivating them,"" Liu went on. ""So we can make an effective vaccine in weeks rather than years.""
""In each case, a virus enters a naive population, so we have no herd immunity to slow it down.""
Liu also said we need systems that pick up new outbreaks faster — ""so we can send experts to determine their cause before it spreads into an epidemic.""
He added, ""Nations have to agree to allow access during outbreaks and avoid political interference.""

Dr. Christian Sandrock, who specializes in emerging infectious diseases at the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California, also weighed in on the potential risk of frozen viruses.
""As climate change and other human-related issues occur, we are always exposed to new things,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""This has been happening for a long time. The real issue arises if these microbes can then become transmissible to humans and cause sustained transmission afterward that can lead to a pandemic.""

""Right now, we are just discovering what is there,"" he added.

Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, noted that while it’s possible that there are viruses in the melting permafrost that could cause sickness, there would likely need to be ""several steps"" that occur before they would spark a pandemic.

""They would likely have to go through many changes to adapt to or spread among modern hosts,"" he told Fox News Digital.
""Much more concerning is the close contact with animals and humans in Asia, which can and does lead to zoonotic spillover to humans,"" said Siegel.

James Comer, R-Ky., discusses Hunter Biden’s upcoming appearance for his deposition on ""Hannity.""
Nearly two dozen current and former officials serving in the White House and Biden administration, including the president's national security adviser and the secretary of state, have extensive ties to Hunter Biden, who is accused by Republicans of selling access to his father dating back over a decade.
A Fox News Digital analysis reveals the extent of Hunter's potential reach in the White House as the embattled first son faces federal tax charges in California, as well as a congressional investigation into his alleged influence peddling and foreign business deals.
Hunter pleaded not guilty during his initial court appearance this month after being charged with nine tax crimes stemming from an investigation by Justice Department Special Counsel David Weiss. A day earlier, he made a shocking appearance at a House Oversight Committee meeting where members were considering whether to hold him in contempt for defying a subpoena as part of the impeachment inquiry into his father, President Biden.

The most notable individuals from Fox's analysis include two members of Biden's Cabinet, one former Cabinet member, a top aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a national security adviser, four top Biden White House aides, the communications director for first lady Jill Biden, and multiple other former staffers.
All emails were reviewed and verified by Fox News Digital.
Former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, who departed the role last year but is still a staunch defender of the Biden administration and serves as an outside surrogate, previously communicated with Hunter in 2016 about a column written by Joel Goldstein, a law professor, praising his father's presidency.
""It is excellent. We will move it around to the WH press corps,"" she wrote to Hunter and a number of others. Bedingfield was serving as then-Vice President Biden's communications director at the time.
Other emails from 2015 showed Bedingfield later tried to quash a Bloomberg story about Hunter at the request of his firm, Rosemont Seneca. The emails showed a close relationship between Biden's office, Hunter's longtime business partner Eric Schwerin, and the media.
Schwerin, who was the then-president of Hunter's now-defunct Rosemont Seneca Partners investment firm, asked Bedingfield whether there was any ""follow up"" by other news outlets on a New York Times story that said the ""credibility of the vice president’s anti-corruption message may have been undermined"" by Hunter’s serving on the board of Burisma Holdings.

Bedingfield, who is now a CNN political commentator, responded that a Bloomberg reporter had asked about it but was ""doing everything she can to not use it.""
""…VP just finished an interview with the Bloomberg reporter traveling with us and she asked about it, though she assures me she's doing everything she can to not use it,"" she wrote. ""I will have a transcript soon but my quick notes on his answer are: No one has any doubt about my record on corruption, I don't talk to my son about his business and my children don't talk to me about mine, I have complete faith in my son.""
Schwerin responded, ""I would just urge her (as I know you are doing) that there is no new news there. And even if she uses it — she should avoid getting into past stories (Navy, etc.) that have nothing to do with this.""
The story was ultimately published.
John Nevergole, a business executive who was tapped in 2022 to serve another term on President Biden's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), previously worked as a senior adviser to Rosemont Seneca and strategized with Hunter on brokering business deals in western Africa years prior to his appointment in the current administration.
Emails show Nevergole’s relationship with Hunter dating back to at least 2011. In an Aug. 5, 2011, email chain, Schwerin, then-president of Rosemont Seneca Advisors, informed Hunter that Nevergole had requested to split a retainer fee 70/30 for helping broker a deal between Rosemont and Brazilian construction giant OAS.

After Hunter pushed back on the price, Schwerin, who was also a member of ABD’s board of advisers for several years, said, ""So, I am OK with 70/30 … Mainly because I think the relationship can bear fruit in other areas down the line, e.g. in Africa if we choose to focus there.""
Longtime Hunter Biden business partner Eric Schwerin told Hunter in 2011 he was OK with the 70/30 split because ""the relationship can bear fruit in other areas down the line"" in places like Africa. (Fox News Digital)
A few years later, Schwerin emailed Hunter on May 29, 2014, saying he ""talked to John Nevergole yesterday, and he said you had mentioned to him you wanted to discuss natural gas at some point.""
At the time, Hunter had just been appointed to serve as a board member for Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings, for which he had received intense scrutiny over several years that prompted him to later admit he used ""poor judgment"" and that he would not join the board again if he could do things over.
The two communicated frequently from 2010 to 2017.
Michael Hochman, a White House aide who has held multiple positions in the Biden administration, including White House deputy staff secretary, previously spent nearly two decades at a Delaware law firm that was heavily involved with corporate entities tied to Hunter, his business associates and other Biden family members.
Between January 2021 and June 2022, Hochman served as the White House deputy staff secretary before joining the White House’s recently created Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), which advises Biden on cybersecurity policy and strategy. Hochman started out as the deputy general counsel and deputy chief of staff before being promoted to chief of staff last November.
Fox's analysis found several emails between Hochman and Hunter sent during the Obama-Biden administration, in addition to nearly a dozen Biden-linked corporate entities that were registered through the law firm where Hochman spent most of his career.

The review found that Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder had served as the registered agents for Owasco LLC, Rosemont Seneca Advisors, and Robinson Walker LLC, which is owned by Hunter's former business partner, Rob Walker. Fox News Digital previously reported that members of the Biden family received more than $1 million in payments from accounts related to Walker's LLC and their Chinese business ventures involving CEFC affiliate State Energy HK in 2017.
Multiple Biden family accounts, including those belonging to Hunter, Hallie Biden and an unnamed Biden, also received approximately $1.038 million from the same Walker LLC account after Bladon Enterprises, which reportedly belonged to Gabriel ""Puiu"" Popoviciu, a Romanian tycoon, deposited over $3 million between November 2015 to May 2017. According to a 2017 email from Walker, which was obtained by the Senate Finance Committee, Walker viewed himself as a ""surrogate"" for Hunter and his uncle, Jim Biden, when ""gauging [business] opportunities.""
Less than six months before Hunter and his longtime business partner, Devon Archer, became board members at the Burisma energy company in Ukraine in 2014, email correspondence shows that a top aide to then-Secretary of State John Kerry, who announced this month that he was leaving the Biden administration to serve as an adviser for the Biden campaign, was telling some of his fellow State Department officials that Kerry and Hunter had a close friendship and that Hunter asked Kerry to speak to his Georgetown University grad students on March 18, 2014.
""Just spoke with Hunter Biden, good friend of S, who teaches a class at Georgetown on advocacy,"" David Wade wrote. ""He'd like S to speak to his class on 3/18. If S is here, he'll for sure want to do this. Class would come here to HST.""
EMAIL REVEALS HUNTER'S COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIGHEST LEVELS OF OBAMA'S STATE DEPT. AS FARA ACCUSATIONS SWIRL
On the day of the class, Archer told Hunter he would send a briefing he put together on Burisma ahead of Hunter's trip the following day to New York City to meet with him. It is unclear whether Kerry had knowledge of the conversations between Hunter and Archer about Burisma in March 2014 or in the weeks following the class.
Kerry's stepson, Chris Heinz, was a business partner of Hunter and Archer at the time, but he reportedly severed ties with the firm later that year. And a spokesperson attributed their Burisma board memberships as a ""major catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationships with Mr. Archer and Mr. Biden.""
However, he still remained friendly with them in emails more than a year after they joined the Burisma board.
Hunter Biden and President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, served together on the board of the Truman National Security Project, a liberal foreign policy think tank, for roughly two years before Sullivan joined the president’s campaign in 2020.
Hunter, who started serving on the board in 2012, and Sullivan both served on the Washington-based nonprofit’s board between 2017 and early 2019, according to internet archives captured by Wayback Machine.
During that time, Hunter was also serving on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings and the Chinese private equity fund BHR Partners. The federal investigation into Hunter's foreign business dealings, which is still ongoing, also launched during the same time frame in 2018.

JAKE SULLIVAN SERVED ON A NATIONAL SECURITY BOARD WITH HUNTER BIDEN FOR 2 YEARS, RAISING QUESTIONS FROM GOP
Sullivan has been accused by former White House official Mike McCormick of being a ""conspirator"" in the Biden family's ""kickback scheme"" in Ukraine when Biden was vice president.
Sullivan denied the allegations, telling reporters that he had nothing to do with such an operation.
White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, who led the federal COVID-19 pandemic response between early 2021 and April 2022, met Hunter multiple times in 2016, according to emails and White House visitor logs.
Zients met with Hunter Biden twice in February 2016 and on another occasion in May 2016, just months before Biden, the vice president at the time, was set to leave the White House.

Biden attended the first two meetings, both of which took place at the U.S. Naval Observatory, where the vice presidential residence is located.

Additionally, Anne Marie Muldoon, who was an assistant for then-Vice President Biden between 2014 and 2017, sent Hunter Biden an invitation to attend a potential fourth meeting with his father, Zients, David Bradley, a Washington, D.C.-based political consultant and chair of media group Atlantic Media, and Eric Lander at the Naval Observatory on July 12, 2016. While it is unclear whether Hunter Biden joined the meeting, Muldoon sent him a copy of the meeting agenda after it took place.
Biden’s former White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, who stepped down last year, previously served as the chief of staff for Vice President Biden until the end of January 2011. In September 2012, Klain reached out to Hunter for help in raising $20,000 for the Vice President's Residence Foundation (VPRF), telling him to ""keep this low low key"" to prevent ""bad PR,"" according to emails Fox News Digital previously reported on.
""The tax lawyers for the VP Residence Foundation have concluded that since the Cheney folks last raised money in 2007 and not 2008, we actually have to have some incoming funds before the end of this fiscal year (i.e., before 9/30/12 – next week) to remain eligible to be a 'public charity,'"" Klain, who had left his chief of staff position in Vice President Biden's office a year earlier but was the foundation's chair at the time, said in an email to Hunter.

RON KLAIN SOLICITED MONEY FROM HUNTER BIDEN FOR VP RESIDENCE IN 2012, EMAILS SHOW: 'KEEP THIS LOW LOW KEY'
""It's not much – we need to raise a total of $20,000 – so I'm hitting up a few very close friends on a very confidential basis to write checks of $2,000 each,"" Klain continued. ""We need to keep this low low key, because raising money for the Residence now is bad PR – but it has to be done, so I'm trying to just collect the 10 checks of $2,000, get it done in a week, and then, we can do an event for the Residence Foundation after the election.""
Hunter then forwarded the email to Schwerin, who helped manage a majority of Hunter's finances, and the two discussed donating to the foundation, though it's not clear what was ultimately decided.
Klain's career with Biden dates back to his failed presidential campaign in 1988 and serving as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Annie Tomasini, an assistant to the president and the current director of Oval Office operations, was in frequent communication with Hunter, referred to him as her ""brother"" and often ended her emails with ""LY"" for ""love you,"" according to emails dating from 2010 to 2016.
Biden publicly announced on Dec. 20, 2010, that Tomasini was stepping down to take a position with Harvard University, and Tomasini kept Hunter clued in on the details of that position before she took it, according to emails. The month prior, on Nov. 19, 2010, she forwarded information to Hunter about Harvard’s employee benefits and added, ""Thanks.""

""Hey – I looked at benefits[.] And they look pretty amazing. Any word on comp?"" Hunter responded on Nov. 23, 2010.
""I'll keep you posted. Thanks for looking at all the background Hunt,"" Tomasini replied.
Tomasini was offered the job on Nov. 30, 2010, writing to Hunter, ""Director of intergovernmental relations. > 120k ish – may be a little higher.""
She later thanked him and said she was going to tell his father the news. Months later, Hunter gave a speech at Harvard but not before running the draft by Tomasini first.
Tomasini has accompanied Biden and Hunter to Camp David on multiple occasions.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a meeting with Hunter Biden at the State Department in July 2015 when he was serving as the deputy secretary of state in the Obama-Biden administration and Hunter was on Burisma's board, according to emails previously reviewed and verified by Fox News Digital.
The meeting was two months in the making after Hunter emailed Blinken in late May 2015, asking, ""Have a few minutes next week to grab a cup of coffee? I know you are impossibly busy, but would like to get your advice on a couple of things.""
Blinken said ""absolutely"" and Hunter forwarded Blinken's full email response to Devon Archer, who was also serving on the Burisma board with him. However, the initial meeting appeared to have been canceled due to the admission of Hunter’s older brother, Beau Biden, to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland because of a recurrence of brain cancer. Beau died on May 30, 2015.
Antony Blinken emails with Hunter Biden on May 22, 2015. (Fox News)
Less than two months later, Blinken and Hunter met, prompting Blinken to send a follow-up email saying it was ""great to see"" Hunter and ""catch up.""
""You will love this,"" Antony Blinken wrote to Hunter Biden on July 22, 2015, ""after you left, Marjorie, the wonderful african american woman who sits in my outer office (and used to be Colin Powell's assistant) said to me: ‘He sure is pleasant on the eyes.’ Tell you wife. Tony."" (Fox News)
In April 2023, former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell testified before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees that Blinken, as President Biden’s then-campaign senior adviser, ""played a role in the inception"" of the public statement signed by intelligence officials to assert that Hunter’s abandoned laptop was part of a Russian disinformation campaign just weeks before the 2020 presidential election.
Blinken denied having any role in getting the letter signed by members of the intelligence community and said, ""One of the great benefits of this job is that I don't do politics and don't engage in it. But with regard to that letter, I didn't – it wasn't my idea, didn't ask for it, didn't solicit it.""
Emails from Hunter's laptop that Blinken allegedly sought to discredit show that Hunter had ties to Blinken and his wife, Evan Ryan, dating back more than a decade. Those emails also show that Hunter scheduled meetings with Blinken while he was on the board of Burisma and Blinken was the deputy secretary of state.

Multiple profile pieces over the years said Blinken has advised Biden on more than just foreign policy in his decades-long friendship with the president and serving as a confidant. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., President Biden's reelection campaign co-chair, told CNN in 2021, ""President Biden is personally close to both Tony Blinken and Evan Ryan, and Tony has been an incredibly loyal, capable and effective adviser, staffer and personal friend of the sort that is rare in Washington.""
Elizabeth Alexander, the communications director for first lady Jill Biden, also has ties to Hunter.
In 2014, Alexander, who served as Biden’s spokesperson when he was a senator and the vice president, reached out to praise Hunter for his statement after he was kicked out of the Navy Reserve for testing positive for cocaine.
""Hey Hunter – just wanted to write you a quick note to say David and I are thinking of you,"" she wrote in an email. ""Your statement was perfect and gracious. Sending you a virtual hug from both of us and hoping you can get some peace this weekend.""
Alexander is married to David Wade, a former State Department staffer who helped advise Hunter with rapid response as he was receiving increased public scrutiny about his lucrative position with Burisma.
Emails uncovered by Fox News Digital last year showed Hunter's firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, was paying Wade for communications consulting, and he strategized with Hunter and his partners on how to respond to inquiries by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
Wade has visited the White House at least five times during Biden's presidency, according to visitor logs.
Evan Ryan, Blinken's wife who is currently serving as White House cabinet secretary, communicated frequently with Hunter and his longtime business partner, Eric Schwerin, when she was working at the White House during the Obama-Biden administration.
Hunter tried to connect with Blinken on June 16, 2010, when he asked Ryan for his non-government email address, according to emails. Ryan, who also worked on Biden's unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign, then provided Blinken's personal email address to Hunter.

White House visitor logs also show that Schwerin, who was the president of Hunter Biden’s investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners for several years, met with Ryan at the White House's Old Executive Office Building (OEOB) in October 2010.
She was also in communication with Hunter and Schwerin about a couple of White House events that year, including the Mexico state dinner and the annual Easter Egg Roll.
""OVP has 250 tix to the Easter Egg Roll and your Mom has an additional 200. Family, etc is coming out of your Mom's allotment,"" Schwerin said in the email to Hunter, referring to Blinken's wife. ""Evan is handling your Dad's and we can pass on names to her for outreach purposes. Let's discuss. I don't think we have 50 spots, but if we had 20 or so names we'd probably be fine.""

""More importantly, OVP has 12 spots to fill for the Mexico State Dinner in May and needs to send in their names by Monday,"" he continued. ""Evan is looking for any suggestions. Hispanic Americans or just any outreach related suggestions. Obviously they won't have trouble filling this number but is still looking for suggestions.""
A couple of months later, Hunter and Ryan exchanged emails about the Mexico State dinner guest list, and she sent him the seating chart for his table.
Fox News Digital previously reported several other ties between Hunter and Ryan.
Kathy Chung, who is currently serving as the Pentagon's deputy director of protocol, communicated frequently with Hunter when she was serving as Biden's executive assistant during the Obama administration.
Throughout much of her five-year tenure working for Biden, Chung regularly shared information with Hunter about his father's schedule and passed messages directly from the then-vice president, according to emails.
Chung's relationship with Hunter also appears to date back to before she worked for his father. The emails showed that Hunter recommended Chung for the executive assistant role when the previous holder of the job, Michele Smith, departed the White House in the spring of 2012.
A month after Chung thanked Hunter for ""thinking"" of her and getting her to apply for a job in the vice president's office, Chung emailed Hunter Biden to inform him that she had been offered the job.

""I cannot thank you enough for thinking about me and walking me thru this,"" she said. ""What an incredible opportunity! Thanks, Hunter!!""
In another email exchange shortly after the Obama-Biden administration concluded, Hunter suggested that Chung come work at his company. It does not appear that she ever joined Hunter's company.
Hunter Biden tells Kathy Chung she should work for him in February 2017, adding that he can ""make everyone money."" (Fox News)
Chung made headlines last year after she was reportedly questioned by federal investigators as part of the probe into the president's handling of classified documents.
Michael Donilon, a current senior adviser to Biden who served as his chief campaign strategist in 2020, was on dozens of emails with Hunter and other members of Biden's inner circle coordinating strategy meetings throughout the 2012 campaign, mulling over a 2016 presidential bid, and later plotting Biden's endeavors post-vice presidency.
In August 2015, Schwerin shared a Politico article with Hunter that said Donilon and a few other advisers from Biden's inner circle, including Hunter, are the only ones ""involved in the real decision-making.""
An email from February 2016 showed that Hunter, Donilon and a few others were also involved in the planning stages for the Biden Foundation. And shortly after Biden left office in 2017, Hunter, Donilon and others in his inner circle were invited to a meeting at Biden's residence in McLean, Virginia, according to emails.
Days later, Hunter, Donilon and several others were invited to a meeting at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, home where classified documents were recently discovered. The meeting took place on Feb. 7, 2017, the same day it was announced that the former vice president would be leading the Penn Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania, where classified documents were also found, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.
Donilon accompanied Biden a few months ago on the trip to Ireland, which included Hunter and Biden's sister, Valerie Biden Owens.
Steve Ricchetti, who currently serves as Biden's White House counselor, was also on dozens of emails with Hunter dealing with strategy meetings and helping Biden with post-VP life.
Fox News Digital reported last year that Schwerin visited the White House at least eight times in 2016, meeting with Ricchetti at least twice when he was serving as Biden’s chief of staff.
Morell, the former CIA deputy director who testified in April, said he received a call in October 2020 from Ricchetti, who was serving as the chair of Biden's campaign at the time, following the Joe Biden's final debate against then-President Trump, when Biden said the Hunter laptop was a ""Russian plant"" and a ""bunch of garbage.""

Morell said the call from Ricchetti was to thank him for spearheading the letter signed by intelligence officials that tried to debunk the laptop.

A Florida man wanted on a weapons possession charge was found in a restaurant parking lot last week with a gun and fake cash inside a box of chicken wings, authorities said.
Bryan Chapman, 26, was arrested on Feb. 17 and faces a slew of charges, including possession of weapon or ammunition by a convicted felon, possession of counterfeited bills and possession of tools for counterfeiting, according to arrest records. He also faces charges for an outstanding warrant from DeSoto County for possession of a firearm by convicted felon, the Columbia County Sheriff's Office said.

Chapman's arrests began when a sheriff's deputy was talking with two people inside a car parked in a Zaxby's parking lot. The deputy smelled marijuana and learned one of the people in the car, identified as Chapman, had an outstanding warrant.
Chapman was detained and the gun and fake currency were found during a car search. Also found was equipment to produce counterfeit money, authorities said.
""I commend Deputy Montemurno for demonstrating such initiative with this investigation,"" said Columbiua County Sheriff Mark Hunter said. ""His willingness to be proactive led to the capture of a felon and helps prevent more people from being victimized.""

5PGQXT7AI7_CLY2Q47QQEP4YPW,European leaders advise Bosnia to accelerate reforms for EU membership talks,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 12:32pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-leaders-advise-bosnia-accelerate-reforms-eu-membership-talks,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The European Commission chief and the prime ministers of the Netherlands and Croatia told Bosnia on Tuesday to press on with reforms and seize a chance to begin accession negotiations with the European Union before the 27-nation block holds a parliamentary vote in June.
The three officials said at a news conference in Sarajevo that while Bosnia has made progress in achieving the criteria to formally start the talks, the troubled Balkan nation must do more to win a positive recommendation in March from the European Commission.
""We have seen some progress, we have seen a real commitment to the accession goal with important laws adopted,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. ""And the more you deliver, the more convincing you are and the better it is, the more you help me to produce a report that reflects this movement forward.""
US WARNS BOSNIAN SERBS AGAINST CELEBRATION OF CONTROVERSIAL SELF-PROCLAIMED HOLIDAY
Bosnia was granted candidate status in 2022 and the European Council said last year that the accession negotiations can start once the necessary degree of compliance is achieved. There will be ""no shortcuts"" for Bosnia, said Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

""EU accession has to be and always will be a merit-based process,"" Rutte said. ""Unfortunately, at the moment ... we have to see what happens in the next six weeks.""
Bosnia is among the six Western Balkan nations that have been seeking EU entry following a period of wars and crisis in the 1990s. The process was stalled for years but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has rekindled the prospects. EU officials are now offering a $6.4 billion package for Western Balkan countries to encourage reform.
""It’s a huge opportunity to increase the prosperity of this country,"" von der Leyen said. Bosnia, she said, could expect 1 billion euros in funds from the package when it carries out necessary economic reforms.
Reform laws that Bosnia still needs to pass to begin the accession talks relate to fighting corruption and money laundering, judicial reform and the rule of law. Bosnian Prime Minister Bojana Kristo promised ""we will remain focused and work hard"" to achieve the goals.
US FIGHTER JETS TO FLY OVER BOSNIA IN SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR COUNTRY AS IT FACES SECESSION THREATS
Bosnia is still ethnically divided and politically unstable long after the 1992-95 war that left more than 100,000 people dead and displaced millions. Pro-Russian Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has repeatedly threatened secession of the Serb-run half of the country from the rest of Bosnia.
Western officials fear that Russia could try to stir instability in Bosnia and the rest of the Balkans to divert attention from its attacks on Ukraine. They have said that stepping up the bloc’s engagement with Western Balkans nations is more crucial than ever to maintaining European security.
Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic urged Bosnia to grasp what he said were ""tectonic"" changes in EU policies because of Ukraine. He warned that ""if we miss March, the whole year will be lost"" because of the expected vote for the European Parliament on June 6-9.
""My message, my appeal to all our friends and partners, is to use this opportunity, this window that has been opened,"" he said."
5PHHWMZ5ZU_M6PT95E1YGI43NK,Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich passes 300 days in Russian detainment,"By Brian Flood , David Rutz Fox News","Published January 23, 2024 4:11pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-detained-russia-300-days,"Wall Street Journal editor Paul Beckett discusses his work behind-the-scenes to help secure the freedom of his colleague Evan Gershkovich, who's been held in Russia since March.
Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich marked 300 days in a Moscow prison being held on dubious espionage charges on Monday.
""300 days is 300 too long for Evan to be wrongfully detained by Russia. Evan was doing his job as a journalist, and any portrayal to the contrary is fiction,"" Wall Street Journal assistant editor Paul Beckett told Fox News Digital.
The Wall Street Journal had Beckett, who previously served as Washington bureau chief for the paper, concentrate solely on efforts to free Gershkovich, the 32-year-old American son of Soviet immigrants whose plight has attracted international attention and calls for his release.
WALL STREET JOURNAL EDITOR WORKING ON EVAN GERSHKOVICH'S RELEASE SAYS PATH FORWARD 'EXTREMELY COMPLICATED'
""We're encouraged that both the US and Russia have recently indicated they want to do a deal, and we hope it will lead to a rapid conclusion,"" Beckett said.

Russia seized Gershkovich last March 29 while he was reporting in Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in Russia, and accused him of espionage. Gershkovich, the U.S. government and the Wall Street Journal all deny the spying charges, and he's been declared wrongfully detained by the Biden administration. He has been denied all his appeals and faces a likely conviction.
Gershkovich has since been held in the notorious Lefortovo prison in Moscow for nearly a year, spending roughly 90% of his day in a small cell, according to the WSJ.
Gershkovich's parents Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich detailed how their son is holding up earlier this month during an interview with WSJ editor-in-chief Emma Tucker.
EVAN GERSHKOVICH STAYING STRONG AS FRIENDS, FAMILY REMAIN FRUSTRATED OVER INDEFINITE RUSSIAN DETAINMENT
""He’s doing the best he can under the circumstances, and the circumstances are very hard,"" Milman said, adding that Lefortovo prison is ""basically designed to isolate you and break you down.""
""He doesn’t see daylight, it’s hard,"" his mother continued. ""But he’s fighting, he’s answering letters, we get a letter from him every week… he gets to read and he requests literature that he wants to read, he keeps his spirits up and his letter are humorous, make me laugh. He tries hard, I think, for us. We are worried about him, he is worried about us.""
U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy has visited Gershkovich in prison and kept his family updated on his condition. His friends have also told Fox News Digital he's kept his sense of humor and tried to stay upbeat while languishing in custody.

EVAN GERSHKOVICH'S PARENTS PLEAD WITH BIDEN TO GET HIM HOME: ‘IT’S BEEN 250 DAYS AND EVAN IS NOT HERE’
Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed calls for the release of Gershkovich, as well as former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, at his annual press conference in December. He suggested an ""agreement"" was possible to return them both but said the ""American side must hear us and make an appropriate decision, one that suits the Russian side.""
Beckett has previously said he had no insight as to why Gershkovich was targeted by Russia, besides simply being someone the U.S. would very much want back.
""From our perspective, really, Evans was just the next in line for taking somebody with the prospect of having leverage over the U.S. and getting somebody that mattered to them back,"" he told Fox News Digital last year.

That incident took place inside the 42nd Street-Bryant Park station at around 4:45 p.m. when police attempted to remove a disorderly man from the station after he became combative with a group of teenagers.
But the man became irate and punched a cop in the face before he was subsequently arrested with charges pending.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Rwandan authorities accused Burundi's leader of making ""incendiary allegations aimed at inciting division among Rwandans,"" raising tensions that persist after Burundi closed all border crossings with Rwanda earlier this month.
Relations between Rwanda and Burundi have deteriorated in recent weeks after Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye renewed accusations that Rwanda is funding and training the rebels of the RED-Tabara group.
Burundian authorities consider RED-Tabara a terrorist movement and accuse its members of being part of a failed coup attempt in 2015. The group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015.
BURUNDI DEPORTS RWANDANS, CLOSES BORDER, ALLEGING NATION BACKS 'TERRORIST' REBEL GROUP
Ndayishimiye spoke of Rwandan youth in ""captivity"" at an event in the Congolese capital Kinshasa on Sunday, saying the region needs to continue to fight until Rwandan people put pressure on their own government.

He was addressing a youth conference after attending the inauguration of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. He apparently spoke in his other capacity as the African Union Champion for Youth, Peace and Security.
In a statement late Monday, Rwandan authorities described Ndayishimiye's remarks as ""inflammatory,"" saying calls for an uprising against the government undermine unity in Rwanda and threaten regional security.
""For anyone to try and undermine this progress by calling on young Rwandans to overthrow their government is troubling. But for a leader of a neighboring country to do so, from an African Union platform, is deeply irresponsible and a flagrant violation of the African Union Charter,"" the statement said.
Earlier this month Burundi closed all border crossings with Rwanda and started deporting Rwandan citizens, asserting that it was responding to Rwanda's alleged support for RED-Tabara. Those rebels attacked the Burundian village of Gatumba near the Congo border last month, killing at least 20 people.
BURUNDI'S PRESIDENT CLAIMS RWANDA IS BACKING REBELS FIGHTING AGAINST HIS COUNTRY
RED-Tabara, which is based in the South Kivu province of eastern Congo, took responsibility for the attack in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""As long as they have a country that provides them with uniforms, feeds them, protects them, shelters them, maintains them, we will have problems,"" Ndayishimiye said in a national radio broadcast last month, referring to RED-Tabara.
Rwanda has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Rwanda and Burundi are both members of the East African Community bloc, whose trade ambitions have suffered in recent years amid sporadic flare-ups that undermine the free movement of people and goods.
Congolese authorities also cite Rwandan aggression in eastern Congo, where government troops are fighting to dislodge the violent M23 rebels who control some territory there. Rwanda denies having authority over M23."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
An Oklahoma state lawmaker is proposing a bill that not only prohibits the production or dissemination of ""unlawful"" pornography, but also punishes those who watch media depicting sexual intercourse with fines.
State Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, introduced an Act into the state legislature that, if approved, would prohibit Oklahomans from producing or disseminating ""unlawful"" pornographic materials lacking ""serious"" scientific, political, educational, literary or artistic value.
""For far too long, civil society has conflated liberty for license,"" FOX 25 in Oklahoma City quoted the lawmaker as saying. ""These bills are aimed at strengthening the God-instituted bedrock of society, that is, the family. A strong, prosperous and flourishing society depends on strong families.""
The Baptist preacher's proposed legislation would also ban state residents from aiding or abetting in the creation and spread of pornography. It also bans sexting between non-married individuals.

According to the legislation, anyone who engages in media that depicts sexual intercourse, masturbation or stimulation could face up to a year in prison and a fine of at least $2,000.
""Each of the items of unlawful pornography… are depictions of sexual conduct which are patently offensive under contemporary community standards in this state, and have as their dominant theme an appeal to prurient interest in sex under contemporary community standards of this state, and may not be produced or distributed within the state if they lack serious literary, artistic, educational, political, or scientific purposes or value,"" the bill reads.
Anyone caught acting, photographing, posing, modeling or selling ""obscene"" material could face punishments, as could anyone else who exhibits or publishes the media.

The legislation covers films, pictures, video games, books, magazines, drawings and statues.
Civil suits can also be filed by complainants, in which they could receive $10,000 in statutory damages for each ""depiction"" in an effort to prevent violators from repeatedly breaking the law.
Deevers did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital about the legislation.

Deevers, the station reported, explained that the bills aim to guide the requisite legal structures necessary to afford individuals and families the best chance of success.
The bill also strengthens punishments for those who engage in watching, obtaining or purchasing child pornography, which is a felony.
Anyone found guilty of child pornography-related charges could face up to 20 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. They would also be required to register as a sex offender.

CNN commentator and ex-Obama official Van Jones advised President Biden on Tuesday to hide from the public, just like he did in the 2020 campaign, because he is not a good public communicator.
""If I were Biden, I would stay hidden,"" Jones said. ""I will tell you why. He doesn’t inspire confidence. He is not a great messenger for himself.""
Jones then criticized the president's campaign, arguing that while Biden has ""done a tremendous job for this economy,"" he should be letting other people speak on his behalf.
DAVID AXELROD CONTINUES TO VOICE CONCERNS ABOUT BIDEN, DISMISSES CRITICS: 'I DON'T REALLY GIVE A S--T'
CNN commentator Van Jones advised President Biden to hide from the public just like he did in the 2020 campaign because he is not a good public communicator in a debate Tuesday. (CNN screenshot)
""Union members, union leaders are racking up win after win,"" he said. ""They should be put forward. There are clean energy executives in red states that are putting people to work.""
""There’s something wrong with this campaign where we are somehow expecting Joe Biden — frankly, he hid during the last campaign — to just somehow come out and be Flash Gordon and save his own campaign,"" Jones continued. ""The people who are benefiting from the Biden economy — and they exist — should be empowered to speak.""
Jones briefly served as a special adviser to President Obama on green jobs before resigning in 2009.
Former Obama official David Axelrod also weighed in on Biden's campaign during the panel discussion on CNN, predicting that his possible rematch with former President Trump will be ""trench warfare.""
""They will spend more time talking about Donald Trump than Joe Biden, and he will be spending a lot of time talking about Joe Biden,"" Axelrod said.

Axelrod has also repeatedly called out the Biden campaign in public, deflecting critics who say that his advice is unwarranted.
In early January, Axelrod said he cared more about Biden beating Trump than about whether he is liked within pro-Biden circles.
""I’m at a stage in my life where I don’t really give a s--t,"" Axelrod said in an interview with Politico. ""I’m 68. You know, everybody in Washington sort of thinks that the most important thing is that the president likes you and that you get invited to parties and s--t like that. I’ve been to plenty of parties. I worked in the White House. That’s not the thing.""
Biden's supporters in the media and in the Democratic Party have expressed concerns about his low popularity ahead of November, with the president's approval rating plummeting to the lowest on record for a U.S. president in the last 15 years, according to a new poll by ABC News.
Biden's approval rating sits at just 31%, according to a national survey produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, with fieldwork by Ipsos Public Affairs via its online, probability-based KnowledgePanel. The poll found 58% of respondents disapprove of the job Biden is doing as president. That makes his approval rating worse than even former President Trump’s lowest in office, which was 36%, according to ABC News. It also marks the lowest since former President George W. Bush's administration in the mid-2000s.

Western countries used a regular U.N.-backed review of China's human rights record on Tuesday to press Beijing to do more to allow freedom of expression, protect the rights of ethnic minorities and repeal a security law in Hong Kong that is derided by independent activists, among other things.
China's ambassador in Geneva, Chen Xu, led a delegation from some 20 ministries in China for the ""universal periodic review"" under the U.N. Human Rights Council. He stressed China's progress in poverty eradication, said citizens engage in ""democratic elections"" and said freedom of religious belief is safeguarded.
""China upholds respect for and protection of human rights as a task of importance in state governance,"" Chen said through an interpreter. ""We have embarked on a path of human rights development that is in keeping with the trend of the times and appropriate to China’s national conditions and so-called historic achievements in this process.""
BIDEN'S CHINA STRATEGY 'DETRIMENTAL' AS 'INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM IS BREAKING DOWN,' EXPERTS SAY
""We uphold the people-centered philosophy and strive to deliver a better life for all the people,"" he said.

Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group meeting to review China's human rights record, at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, on Jan. 23, 2024. (Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone via AP)
The process, which encourages constructive recommendations over sharp criticism, nevertheless gave way to firm, if not scathing, advice to China from some leading Western countries.
Leslie Norton of Canada called on China to end ""all forms of enforced disappearances targeting human rights defenders, ethnic minorities and Falun Gong practitioners"" and urged the repeal of the Hong Kong security law.
Czech Ambassador Vaclav Balek urged China to ""end the criminalization of religious and peaceful civil expression by ethnic and religious groups — including Muslim, Uyghurs and Buddhists, Tibetans and Mongolians — under the pretext of protecting state security"" and ""stop cross-border kidnappings and intimidating Chinese citizens living abroad.""
Anita Pipan, Slovenia’s ambassador in Geneva, recommended China ""establish a moratorium on the death penalty"" on the way to abolishing it. U.S. Ambassador Michele Taylor presented a list of concerns, concluding with, ""We condemn the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and transnational repression to silence individuals abroad.""
Some independent organizations and the United States have accused China of genocide in Xinjiang, but no U.N. bodies have affirmed that. China lashed out at a 2022 report by the then U.N. human rights chief citing possible crimes against humanity committed in the western region.
Kozo Honsei, Japan's deputy permanent representative in Geneva, called for better protections of the rights of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang.
The hearing offered a wide-ranging look at the human rights situation in China. Bolivia's envoy commended China's efforts to reduce deforestation, Burundi's representative urged China to improve access to health care in central regions and to better housing in Hong Kong and Macao, and Iran praised China's ""national action plan for human rights.""
First secretary Ilia Barmin of Russia's diplomatic mission advised China ""to consistently improve the understanding and capacity of citizens to use standard spoken and written Chinese in Xinjiang,"" and Frankye Bronwen Levy, political affairs counselor for South Africa, called on China to strengthen an anti-domestic violence law passed eight years ago.
An extraordinarily high number of more than 160 countries — some critics of Beijing, some allies — registered to take part in the discussion. That meant each country had a maximum of 45 seconds to speak, forcing some ambassadors into what at times felt like a speed-reading exercise.
China's delegation had a total of 70 minutes to make its case.
The ""universal periodic review"" involves all U.N. member states coming up for scrutiny — at times sharp — by other countries roughly every five years. The 3 1/2-hour discussion aims to offer constructive criticism and produce a written report that will offer recommendations, not criticism.
LANDSLIDE IN CHINA BURIES 47 PEOPLE IN MORE THAN A DOZEN HOMES
Several groups such as Falun Gong and pro-Tibet activists held small demonstration outside the U.N. Geneva compound during Tuesday’s discussion. Inside, roughly 100 activists from nongovernmental groups attended the session or watched it from a ""spillover room"" in the vast U.N. complex, officials said.
Several human rights groups had events planned outside China's review, and the Tibet Advocacy Coalition, the World Uyghur Congress and human rights defenders in Hong Kong were expected to hold a joint news conference after the proceedings.
Another advocacy group aims to speak out against the forced repatriation from China of women from North Korea who fled the nation under leader Kim Jong Un's rule.
On Monday, four independent human rights experts who work under a mandate from the council called for the release of Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong publisher on trial for alleged national security violations, and for all charges against him to be dropped.
At China's last review in 2018, the United States and other countries voiced concerns about its treatment of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang."

McConnell supports President Biden's authority for Iran airstrikes, urging stronger action against terrorist threats. (Credit: Senate TV)
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor Thursday morning that President Biden has ""clear authority"" to continue carrying out airstrikes in the Middle East and urged the president to do more to deter attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.
""The Constitution of the United States, the consensus of our nation's founders and the weight of exhaustive historical precedent gives the president the clear authority to use military force when American lives and interests are under attack,"" McConnell said. ""The commander in chief does not lack authority. Rather, he is failing to sufficiently exercise the authority that he has right now.""
Despite military responses and warnings in Iraq and Syria, U.S. troops are still being targeted. According to the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on foreign policy in the Middle East, Iranian proxies have attacked U.S. forces 18 times in Syria and 10 times in Iraq since Jan. 4.
The orchestrated attacks appear to be part of Iran's response to Israel's war in Gaza after its ally, Hamas, attacked Israel on Oct. 7.

""When President Biden took office, Senate Republicans warned him not to go soft on Iran,"" McConnell said. ""We urged him not to abandon maximum pressure, not to obsess over restoring a failed nuclear deal, and not to ignore Iran's relentless, relentless campaign of terror. But the president failed to hear this advice.""
""Instead, his administration slipped through glaring indications that Iran backed terror was actually reaching a tipping point. So today, America and our allies face an adversary profoundly undeterred,"" he said.
McConnell tallied that Iran's proxies are responsible for more than 150 attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 7.
""We have yet to see signs that the administration understands how to compel Iran and its proxies to stop even with the world's strongest military at the ready,"" he said. ""The commander in chief has failed to deter Iran and its proxies. Instead, a figure of escalation has only invited more aggression from Tehran to Moscow to Beijing.""
Earlier this month, Biden received backlash from some House Democrats for striking Houthi positions – a Yemen-based Islamist militant group – without congressional approval. Biden said the airstrikes were in response to Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.
""Mr. President, they are profoundly mistaken,"" McConnell said of dissenting voices who have criticized the airstrikes. ""Exercising the right to defend against imminent threats to our nation and service members is a central responsibility of the commander in chief.""

The U.S. carried out a ""self-defense"" strike in Yemen on Wednesday morning, targeting and destroying two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were preparing to launch, aimed at commercial ships in the southern Red Sea, U.S. officials said.
U.S. forces targeted three facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group and other Iran-linked groups, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.
The Kataib Hezbollah headquarters was targeted, along with storage and training locations for rocket, missile and one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities, U.S. Central Command said.
The strikes were in response to the Iran proxy group Kataib Hezbollah's massive ballistic missile attack on al-Asad air base on Saturday, and an attack on al-Asad on Tuesday, a U.S. defense official told Fox News. The group fired 17 ballistic missiles and rockets at the base, where the majority of the 2,500 troops in Iraq are stationed.

Authorities suspected it was a suicide, but her family has questioned the conclusion in a wrongful death lawsuit. (Holland family)
A 39-year-old Missouri doctor has died unexpectedly, and she is the second woman to be discovered dead in the same suburban St. Louis firefighter’s house in three years, according to his former fiancee's family.
Dr. Sarah Sweeney, a West Virginia native, had recently opened her own practice in St. Louis, her funeral home posted in an online obituary.
Her ""sudden death"" is under active investigation, Frontenac Police Cpl. Tim Duda told Fox News Digital.

Sweeney did her surgical residency in Miami before moving to Port Arthur, Texas, according to the obituary. At the age of 6, she was diagnosed with a rare and painful condition called Perthes disease.
Frontenac police said they found Sweeney dead at 6:39 a.m. on Jan. 13. She had ""no apparent signs of trauma,"" the department said in a statement.
Her mother, Teresa Sweeney Light, told Fox News Digital the doctor was also diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome. The condition can be life-threatening, but she said her daughter had it under control with medication and carried an EpiPen.
""We just wish we could have her back,"" she said. ""We just want closure, we want it to be truthful and fair, and as of right now, we're still in shock.""
Robert Daus is named as the 911 caller in the Frontenac police report. The firefighter met Sweeney when she was working an emergency room shift shortly after she moved to St. Louis, her mother said. The two began dating, but Sweeney's family never met him, Light said.
Read the incident report
Police in Creve Coeur found another woman named Grace Holland dead in the firefighter's prior home in 2021 – she had a single gunshot wound to the head.
When Sweeney's family learned about Holland's case, they sent her some of the news stories. But by November 2021, she had stopped answering text messages from her mother and stepfather.
""She was a grown adult, a doctor and a woman,"" her mother said. ""We didn’t know what to do.""
She declined to speculate about her daughter's death and said the family is awaiting the results of the autopsy and toxicology reports, which could take another three to five weeks, Duda said.
""I’m leaving that to the investigators, and I’m leaving that to the medical examiner’s office, to hopefully do a good job of this,"" Light told Fox News Digital.
As for the Holland family, they are suing Daus, alleging he caused her wrongful death either by killing her or by encouraging her suicide.

Holland was a mother of four. Investigators said her death was a suicide. However, her family has been skeptical of that conclusion, and a local media station, KMOV-TV, obtained text messages that portrayed a rocky relationship between her and the firefighter.
A 911 recording provided by Holland's family shows a man called in and told the dispatcher Holland shot herself in the head right in front of him.

""My brothers in blue are not going to do anything to me. I've already taken care of that. You're the crazy girlfriend.""
""My fiancee just shot herself,"" he said before adding, ""It's a mortal wound.""
A wrongful death lawsuit filed by Holland's family identifies that caller as Daus. The two were dating and had been engaged for two years, according to the court filing. A call to his listed number went unanswered Monday, and his attorney did not immediately respond to multiple attempts to reach her.
Holland was discovered dead in Daus' house on Fairway Circle. At the time, she had dedicated months to a renovation project at their new home, which is where police found Sweeney's body.
Read the wrongful death lawsuit:
According to her family's wrongful death lawsuit, Daus controlled Holland's finances. Her parents suspected domestic violence in the months before her death, and a relative allegedly overheard Daus telling her, ""My brothers in blue are not going to do anything to me. I've already taken care of that. You're the crazy girlfriend.""
Text messages included in the lawsuit indicate that while the couple fought frequently, Daus repeatedly told her he wanted out of the relationship.
""I absolutely cannot b w you."" he wrote, using shorthand. ""I'm not marrying you.""
Holland's family has alleged in the lawsuit that the circumstances surrounding her death were suspicious. She was right-handed but shot in the left temple. Her $20,000 engagement ring appeared in crime scene photos but is now missing. Seven hours before her death, she was smiling in a selfie taken with Daus at the Conway house.

A divided federal appeals court refused on Tuesday to revive the lawsuit of a Texas-based online citizen journalist who said she was wrongfully arrested for seeking and obtaining nonpublic information from police in a case that drew attention from national media organizations and free speech advocates.
A state judge dismissed the criminal case against Priscilla Villarreal — known online as La Gordiloca — saying the law used to arrest her in 2017 was unconstitutional. But Villarreal still wanted to sue officials for damages. She lost Tuesday in a 9-7 decision from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which saw strong dissents from a group of ideologically diverse judges appointed by Republican and Democratic presidents.
The majority held that the police officers and other officials Villarreal sued in Laredo and Webb County were entitled to legal immunity.
FEDERAL COURT HEARS TEXAS CITIZEN JOURNALIST'S CASE
""Villarreal and others portray her as a martyr for the sake of journalism. That is inappropriate,"" Judge Edith Jones wrote for the majority. ""She could have followed Texas law, or challenged that law in court, before reporting nonpublic information from the backchannel source.""

The ruling included lengthy opinions covering more than 50 pages from three of the seven dissenting judges.
The law, according to court records, defined the criminal ""misuse of official information"" as using information that ""has not been made public ... with intent to obtain a benefit or with intent to harm or defraud another."" Authorities had argued that Villarreal could benefit from using the information — the identities of a person who killed himself and a family involved in a car accident — to gain fame on her Facebook page, Lagordiloca News LaredoTx.

Other dissenters included three more nominees of Republican presidents, and three nominated by Democrats.
Villarreal and an attorney who represented her said in an email that they would take the case to the Supreme Court.
""I’m disappointed,"" Villarreal said, ""but I’m going to keep up the fight for my rights and those of all Americans."""

Police in Philadelphia have arrested an 18-year-old who allegedly helped a ""dangerous"" teenage murder suspect escape from custody while at a children’s hospital.
Michael Diggs is now facing multiple charges including hindering apprehension and criminal conspiracy in connection to the disappearance of 17-year-old Shane Pryor, who remains on the run on Friday after vanishing two days earlier.

At approximately 11:56 AM, upon their arrival at the hospital, Pryor managed to escape custody and disappeared in the surrounding area,"" the Philadelphia Police Department said in a statement.
""A comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated, leading the police to trace Pryor's movements and gather information suggesting that Pryor had been picked up by an individual driving a cream-colored Ford,"" police added, noting that later that day, they intercepted the vehicle and detained its driver, Diggs, for questioning.

""The arrest marks a significant step forward in the ongoing efforts to bring all those involved in the incident to justice,"" police also said. ""Shane Pryor has not been located. Pryor is considered dangerous.""
Pryor has been behind bars since he was charged with the 2020 murder of 54-year-old Tanya Harris at 14 years old. He is still awaiting trial.
Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner of Investigations Frank Vanore said Pryor was in the parking lot of the emergency room at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia when he escaped. Two prison staff members were in the car with Pryor, according to Vanore, but he was not handcuffed when he exited the car.

On Thursday, the U.S. Marshals shared a video showing Pryor by himself inside the lobby of the Hub for Clinical Collaboration building near the children’s hospital shortly after his escape.
Pryor asked a front desk receptionist there for the use of a phone, was told no, and he then left that building, according to Fox29 Philadelphia.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Kansas teenager was hospitalized last week after he fell onto a pair of pliers, and one of the metal handles ended up impaling his skin and breaking his hip bone.
Joey Zeman, 15, of Wakeeney, was shoveling snow with a friend when an icy surface caused him to slip and fall onto a pair of pliers he was carrying last Saturday. When he stood up, he attempted to resume his work but could not locate the pliers — that is, until he found they had punctured his body, FOX Television Stations reported.
""I didn't know they were in there [his body] until I looked down,"" he said, clarifying that he often carries pliers as is customary for farm work. ""Then I tried to pull them out and they didn't come out.""
Joey said he remained calm but then ""started yelling for my friend's mom to come help me."" He was then rushed to the hospital.

The initial hospital airlifted Joey to a second hospital, where doctors removed the pliers. They said the tool fractured Joey’s hip bone but spared his internal organs.
Zeman was then released and was allowed to recover at home, where he is on crutches, FOX Television Stations reported.

En route to the initial hospital, Zeman called his mother, who initially thought the story was a joke as he often pulls pranks and typically avoids receiving professional treatment for injuries.

63QXI3A05P_VZY94SG380Z7QTL,California bill would mandate all new cars have device to 'automatically limit' speed to 10 mph over limit,By Andrew Mark Miller Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 3:33pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-bill-would-mandate-all-new-cars-have-device-to-automatically-limit-speed-to-10-mph-over-limit,"Tesla owner Brandon Welbourne joined ‘FOX & Friends’ to discuss why so many Tesla owners were left stranded as severe winter weather prompts charging challenges for some owners.
A California Democratic lawmaker has introduced a bill he calls ""groundbreaking"" that would require all new cars sold in the Golden State to be equipped with a device preventing them from traveling more than 10 mph over the speed limit.
State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, introduced the Speeding and Fatality Emergency Reduction on California Streets Package this week that includes a provision that would require ""new vehicles sold in California"" to ""install speed governors, smart devices that automatically limit the vehicle’s speed to 10 miles above the legal limit.""
""These changes are a head-on attempt to tackle vehicle fatalities, which are surging across the U.S. — and especially in California — amid a rise in reckless driving since the onset of the pandemic,"" a press release from Wiener’s office explained. ""A recent report from TRIP, a national transportation research group, found that traffic fatalities in California have increased by 22% from 2019 to 2022, compared to 19% for the U.S. overall. In 2022, 4,400 Californians died in car crashes.""
The bill package also ""requires side underride guards on trucks, to reduce the risk of cars and bikes being pulled underneath the truck during a crash"" and ""physical improvements like new crosswalks and curb extensions on state-owned surface streets to better accommodate pedestrians, cyclists, the disability community, and transit users.""

The press release argues that these changes are meant to ""slash"" the ""California road deaths epidemic.""
""The alarming surge in road deaths is unbearable and demands an urgent response,"" Wiener said. ""There is no reason for anyone to be going over 100 miles per hour on a public road, yet in 2020, California Highway Patrol issued over 3,000 tickets for just that offense. Preventing reckless speeding is a commonsense approach to prevent these utterly needless and heartbreaking crashes.""

64TD7B2WMX_T5ROTYQ8DKNFWRA,New leader in LDS church says it should do more to help victims of sexual abuse,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 2:32pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-leader-lds-church-says-should-do-more-help-victims-sexual-abuse,"Mexican police captured three men it claims are responsible for the massacre of the families which carried dual American-Mexican citizenship; William La Jeunesse reports from Los Angeles.
The newest member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' top governing body said every faith — including his — must do more to protect victims of sexual abuse and help facilitate a healing process.
Last month, Patrick Kearon, 62, became the first new member since 2018 named to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the body which oversees the business interests and global development of the faith widely known as the Mormon church.
Speaking to The Associated Press on Tuesday, Kearon, who was raised in England and converted to the faith as an adult, outlined the global, compassionate approach he would take on a range of sensitive issues from the border crisis to the LGBTQ community. He was particularly emphatic on how he would like sex abuse victims to be cared for by the church.
OVER 50 MEMBERS OF UTAH MORMON CONGREGATIONS SUFFER CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING DURING SERVICE
""There is no question in my mind that the abuse of a child or the deliberate abuse of anyone is the most heinous crime and must not be tolerated in any form,"" he said. ""We must all be much better — regardless of which religious group or denomination — in caring for those who have been victims of those crimes heal, and move beyond just surviving that ordeal.""
An AP investigation found that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ sexual abuse reporting hotline can be misused by its leaders to divert abuse accusations away from law enforcement and instead to church attorneys who may bury the problem, leaving victims in harm’s way. The Utah-based faith has stuck by the system despite the criticism and increasing scrutiny from attorneys and prosecutors who argue it is inadequate to quickly stop abuse and protect victims.
Kearon didn’t speak specifically about the hotline, but said the church does have protocols for reporting these crimes, which must be observed.

""We must deploy everything we can to help those who have been mistreated in the most dreadful ways, heal,"" he said. ""There has been a lot of progress made in this regard, but we need to get better. ""
Sex abuse incidents have such catastrophic and lifelong impacts on victims that there is little room for slip-ups, Kearon said.
""Even if one person slips through your fingers in terms of trying to help them heal, it's a disaster,"" he said.
Kearon, who many have described as a rising star in the church, filled a vacancy in the church's top governing body that was created by the death of M. Russell Ballard in November. Members serve lifetime appointments under the church president and his two top counselors.
LDS CHURCH REJECTS WHISTLEBLOWER'S ALLEGATIONS FROM '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW
Born in England, Kearon has lived and worked there, in Saudi Arabia as well as in the U.S. in various industries including health care, food, transportation and communications. After joining the church, Kearon served in several leadership roles of increasing importance.
Raised in the Anglican Church, he converted on Christmas Eve in 1987 after what he describes as a ""two-year journey of learning"" that was peppered with doubt, cynicism, even disbelief. Even though his parents prayed at home, the family attended church only during Christmas and Easter or for special events, he said.
Kearon said he appreciates the ""gentle foundation"" his upbringing gave him because it allowed him to welcome faith as a driving force later in life when he fully understood that it was strong belief that made Latter-day Saints joyful and positive.
He sees his global background as relevant because the church is growing faster globally than it is in the U.S. Last year, the church announced that it reached 17 million members worldwide by the end of 2022, which reflects a 26% increase in convert baptisms compared to the previous year.
""That trend is going to continue,"" he said, adding that having served and lived in different parts of the world helps him think globally about issues that might only seem to affect one region or one country.
Kearon extends his perspective of a global church to issues such as immigration, which is contentious in the U.S. with a presidential election looming. He is well known for his 2016 speech urging compassion for refugees fleeing war-torn parts of the Middle East and Africa.
As a faith leader, while he understands the role of borders, Kearon said he believes in the idea of kindness, inclusion and welcoming the stranger.
""Our father in heaven does not see borders,"" he said. ""Wherever his children are, we should be loving them.""
He extends the same message of empathy when it comes to the LGBTQ community. The faith believes that while having feelings of same-sex attraction is not a sin, acting on it is.

""It's important to try and understand others because we are all children of God,"" he said. ""That takes work, and is not easy. But, when we look at these issues through a clear, simple lens of our belief, that really helps.""
Kearon also emphasized that there should be no room for radicalization or nationalism in this faith.
""Any type of radicalization, as it's most commonly expressed, brings problems,"" he said. ""Wherever we are in the world, we need to be a healing force in our communities and follow Jesus Christ's invitation to love our neighbors."""

Social media users tore into President Biden on Thursday after he made a series of verbal stumbles during an address at a Wisconsin brewery.
Biden gave his speech at Earth Rider Brewery in Superior, Wisconsin, where he touted his economic record – aka ""Bidenomics"" – and the success of his bipartisan infrastructure legislation in a bid to shore up support for his 2024 re-election bid.
However, online onlookers were distracted from the economic talking points by an extended gaffe Biden made about the brewery and its beer.

Partway through his remarks, he appeared to mumble, ""The beer brewed here, it is used to make the brew beered here."" While most of the sentence was unintelligible, he seemed to add, ""Ooh, Earth Rider, thanks for the Great Lakes. I wonder why…""
He trailed off as the audience’s laughter drowned him out, though it seemed unclear as to what exactly they were laughing at.
X users didn’t get the joke, either. Conservative influencer Collin Rugg posted, ""JUST IN: President Biden sounds like he is speaking a different language while giving a speech at the Earth Rider Brewery in Superior, Wisconsin. Don't worry... The media has assured us that he is sharper than ever!""
He then provided his own translation of the speech, adding, ""’The beer brewed here. It is used to make the brewed beer. During is define, oh, earth Rider. Thanks for the Great Lakes. I wonder why,"" Biden said according to my speech transcriber.’ Inspirational!""
The RNC Research account wrote, ""Biden is having a VERY tough time reading from his giant teleprompter today.""

Juanita Broaddrick, the former nursing administrator who accused former President Bill Clinton of raping her, commented on Biden's remarks, saying, ""Joe is unwell.""
The Mark Levin Show producer Rich Sementa described the moment as ""Biden's Best Gibberish Yet.""
Conservative commentator Paul Szypula had a more sober take on the matter, writing, ""Every time I see these clips I’m reminded of how I was raised to respect my elders and treat them with dignity. What Democrats are doing by propping Biden up like this when he’s clearly debilitated is not respectful or dignified. It’s shameful and an insult to all elderly.""
Conservative influencer ""Catturd"" remarked, ""WT-actual-F This is getting so bad. What a freaking joke.""
The account for ""Opie Radio"" asked, ""Anyone speak Biden? Something something about beer??""

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Thursday his state has no plans to comply with an order from the Biden administration to grant Border Patrol agents access to a riverfront park that is at the center of a border dispute.
The defiance comes in the wake of a Supreme Court decision earlier this week that cleared the way for Border Patrol agents to cut or remove razor wire Texas had installed around Shelby Park. The area has become a popular corridor for migrants to illegally enter the U.S.

Texas seized control of the park this month and began denying entry to Border Patrol agents, escalating a feud between Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and the Biden administration, which the governor accuses of not doing enough to curb illegal crossings.
After the Supreme Court’s decision on Monday, Texas said it would be installing more rows of razor wire. The fencing has become one of Abbott's most visible measures to deter migrants in the border city of Eagle Pass.
TEXAS GOVERNOR DOING ‘EXACTLY RIGHT THING’ AMID CONSTITUTIONAL BATTLE OVER BORDER ENFORCEMENT: LEGAL EXPERTS
On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sent the state a letter demanding access again to Shelby Park, which is next to the Rio Grande. It asked Texas to respond by Friday.

Paxton told Fox News earlier Thursday that Texas had no plans to comply with the deadline.
TRUMP, RFK JR SIDE WITH TEXAS IN BORDER FIGHT WITH BIDEN ADMIN AS 25 STATES SHOW SUPPORT
Paxton cast doubts on the prospect of a physical confrontation between state and federal officials, predicting that the matter would play itself out in the courts.
That prediction is shared by National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera, who also told Fox News on Thursday you’d be ""hard-pressed"" to get a Border Patrol agent to go up against their counterparts, i.e., Texas National Guard, on the ground.

Another border agent told Fox News, that each agency knows it has to ""respond to direct orders from superiors,"" adding that there was plenty of mutual respect on both sides.

68CTCXMEOQ_AMQZ4QJFLEJH1O7,Tennessee law regarding HIV-positive sex workers could soon be revised,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 10:31am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tennessees-outdated-law-targeting-hiv-positive-sex-workers-could-soon-revised,"Alissa McCommon, a Tennessee elementary teacher accused of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy in 2021, appeared in court Monday for a preliminary hearing.
Tennessee would no longer be the only U.S. state to impose a lifetime registration as a ""violent sex offender"" on anyone convicted of engaging in sex work while living with HIV under a proposal that advanced Tuesday in the legislature.
The controversial statute still on the books is being challenged in federal court by LGBTQ+ and civil rights advocates. They argue that the law stems from the decades-old AIDS scare and discriminates against HIV-positive people. The U.S. Department of Justice has also weighed in on the decades-old law after completing an investigation in December, saying that it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and called on the state to repeal the measure.
However, Republican Sen. Page Walley on Tuesday stopped short of fully removing the law and instead introduced legislation that would remove those convicted of aggravated prostitution of having to register as a violent sex offender.
CANCER IS NOW LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG HIV-POSITIVE PEOPLE, REPORT SAYS: ‘OF GREAT CONCERN’
""It maintains the charge,"" Walley said. ""But removes the sex offender registration.""
Prostitution has long been criminalized as a misdemeanor in Tennessee. But in 1991, Tennessee lawmakers enacted an even harsher statute that applied only to sex workers living with HIV. Nearly 20 years later, the state legislature revised the law once more by requiring lifetime sex offender registration for those convicted under the controversial statute.
In the years since, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that laws criminalizing HIV exposure — many of which were enacted amid the height of the AIDS epidemic — are outdated and ineffective. Black and Latino communities have been particularly affected by these laws even as the same standards do not apply to other infectious diseases.

Some states have taken steps to repeal their HIV criminal laws, such as Illinois, which repealed all of its HIV-specific criminal laws in 2021. That same year, New Jersey and Virginia repealed all their felony HIV-specific laws.
In Republican-dominant Tennessee, lawmakers have expressed resistance to outright repealing the aggravated prostitution charge. Instead, the GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday agreed to advance a proposal that would drop the lifetime sex offender registration requirement.
Walley described his bill as ""anti-trafficking,"" arguing that the current framework hurts those who may be victims of sexual assault and hinders attempts to get their lives back on track.

According to court documents, 83 people are currently registered sex offenders for aggravated prostitution convictions in Tennessee. The majority of those convictions took place in Shelby County, which encompasses Memphis. The plaintiffs challenging the law in federal court, all named Jane Doe, have described years of harassment and hardships in finding housing and employment that complies with Tennessee's violent sex offender registry.
The legislation would still need to clear the full Senate and House chambers before it could make it to Gov. Bill Lee's desk for consideration. The Republican governor has not weighed in publicly on the bill.
Meanwhile, the federal lawsuit is ongoing. It's currently scheduled to go to trial in 2026."

A Boston resident and law student is concerned that an already tight housing market in her city is being further strained by the migrant crisis.
Videos from Logan Airport show dozens of migrants sleeping on cots on the floors of one of the airport's terminals, after officials have said shelters are filled to capacity.
""Not every state is obligated to undertake what Boston and Massachusetts have committed to do, because Massachusetts is the only state in the country that has the right to shelter law,"" Jill Jacobson told ""Fox & Friends"" host Lawrence Jones on Thursday.
""So there is a legal obligation to provide housing for these individuals, but, Boston already is [in] the midst of a huge housing crisis with its lifelong residents. We have a very tight housing market here, so we're legally obligated to provide housing that, unfortunately, we just don't have.""

Her comments coincide with brewing tensions between Texas and the federal government just days after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Biden administration in a case involving a razor wire fence at the southern border. Migrants additionally continue to strain cities and states across the U.S. that struggle to find sufficient space for them.
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, for instance, previously activated National Guard members to help provide basic services at the emergency shelter hotels in the Bay State.
""Governor Healey has reached out to the Biden administration multiple times asking for assistance, and her requests have largely fallen on deaf ears, unfortunately,"" Jacobson said, telling Fox News she believes the crisis is of ""the Biden administration's making"" and that state and city governments are being left to figure out how to provide migrants with basic needs.
BOSTON MAYOR MICHELLE WU PROPOSES MEASURE TO ADDRESS CITY'S HOUSING SHORTAGE
Costs only warrant more concern.
""It's projected to cost almost $1 billion to handle the migrant crisis,"" Jacobson continued.
""The average price for a one bedroom in Boston, Massachusetts, has exceeded $3,000, and that's for lifelong residents, which is why we're seeing all of our shelters at max capacity. Unfortunately, incoming migrants are being forced to sleep at places like Logan Airport.""
Jones asked Jacobson how she might respond to those who argue that open border immigration policies are ""compassionate"" to those seeking a better life in the U.S., to which she cautioned that such mentalities are ""morally hazardous"" considering the situations the migrants must endure.

""You convince yourself that an open-borders immigration policy, for example, is compassionate because everyone deserves the American dream,"" she said.
""We live in a great country. I would hope that everyone gets the opportunity to contribute to it and be here. It's a great place, but the problem is, when they arrive here, they're not getting the American dream. We do not have the administrative capacity to process work permits. We don't have housing. They end up in really horrible conditions, like sleeping in Logan Airport without showers or food. It's really, really cold in Boston, and they don't have anywhere to go largely, so I would say let's get honest. This is not compassionate and let's be really realistic about the capacity that we have…""
Healey said, Monday, ""Frankly, what you’ve seen at Logan has been the situation, and this is why I said months ago that we are reaching capacity here.""
The crisis has led to similar measures in Chicago, where migrants have been sheltering at O'Hare Airport.

One of Georgia's busy seaports is being awarded a $15 million federal grant to help pay for new docks and other upgrades at one of its shipping terminals, the state's U.S. senators announced Wednesday.
The Port of Brunswick, about 70 miles south of Savannah, will receive the funding through a U.S. Department of Transportation grant funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock said.
Ossoff called the funding ""a big win for coastal Georgia"" and the state's economy overall, noting Brunswick's rapid growth as a U.S. hub for imports and exports of automobiles. He also told reporters the infrastructure law's bipartisan backing shows that lawmakers from rival parties can still work together.

""This is an investment in Georgia that is the fruit of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans,"" Ossoff told an online news conference Tuesday.
In addition to automobiles and heavy machinery, Brunswick also handles bulk cargo such as agricultural goods, paper and rubber. The infrastructure grant will fund improvements to the port's East River Terminal, where bulk goods get loaded and unloaded from ships.
The project includes building a new 540-foot (165-meter) dock after demolishing the old one, as well as replacing half of a second dock on the site. The federal money will also help pay to install new electrical and water systems at the terminal and to dredge one berth to add depth for docking ships.

In a statement, Warnock said the port project will ""ease vessel traffic and the flow of commerce at a major economic hub for our state.""
The federal grant is expected to cover roughly half of the total cost of the terminal improvements, which the Georgia Ports Authority hopes to finish by 2027.

""This $15 million federal grant will enable Georgia grown forest products and other commodities to compete stronger in world markets through a competitive port,"" Jamie McCurry, chief administrative officer for the Georgia Ports Authority, said in a statement.
The authority operates the state-owned seaports in Savannah and Brunswick. The grant award comes as the port authority is investing $262 million in upgrades and expansions for Brunswick to handle increased traffic. Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers is working on a $17.5 million project to widen and deepen portions of Brunswick's shipping channel.
A priority of President Joe Biden's that passed Congress with support from both Democrats and Republicans, the infrastructure law is providing $1 trillion for roads, bridges, ports and rail transit as well as electrical grids and broadband internet."

A Libyan delegation visited Beirut this week to reopen talks with Lebanese officials on the fate of a prominent Lebanese cleric who has been missing in Libya for decades, and on the release of late dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s son who has been held in Lebanon for years, officials said.
The talks were aimed at reactivating a dormant agreement between Lebanon and Libya, struck in 2014, for cooperation in the probe of the 1978 disappearance of Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr, judicial and security officials said.
The fate of the cleric has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. His family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume al-Sadr, who would be 94 now, is dead.

The late Libyan ruler's son Hannibal Gadhafi has been held in Lebanon since 2015 after he was kidnapped from neighboring Syria, where he had been living as a political refugee. He was abducted by Lebanese militants demanding information about the fate of al-Sadr.

Lebanese authorities freed him but then detained him, accusing him of concealing information about al-Sadr’s disappearance.
A legal official familiar with the case said the Libyan delegation left Beirut after spending several days in Lebanon, where they met with the minister of justice and a judge heading a committee investigating al-Sadr’s disappearance.
The official described the talks as ""positive"" but did not elaborate or say if they achieved any results. The delegation is expected to return next week, he said, and added that Lebanese and Libyan authorities are treating the two cases as separate.
He said ""there is no deal"" so far for Gadhafi’s release.
All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.
The Libyan delegation's visit was not publicly announced by either Lebanon or Libya. Libya’s internationally recognized government, seated in Tripoli, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Al-Sadr was the founder of the Amal group, a Shiite militia that fought in Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war and later became a political party, currently headed by the country's powerful Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
Many of al-Sadr’s followers are convinced that Moammar Gadhafi ordered al-Sadr killed in a dispute over Libyan payments to Lebanese militias. Libya has maintained that the cleric, along with two traveling companions, left Tripoli in 1978 on a flight to Rome.
TOP HAMAS OFFICIAL KILLED IN BEIRUT EXPLOSION, HEZBOLLAH MEDIA SAYS
Last August, Libya’s judicial authorities formally asked Lebanon to release Hannibal Gadhafi because of his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike in June and was hospitalized several times.
Human Rights Watch this month issued a statement calling for Gadhafi’s release. The rights group noted that Gadhafi was only 2 years old at the time of al-Sadr’s disappearance and held no senior position in Libya as an adult.
Gadhafi’s ""apparent arbitrary detention on spurious charges after spending eight years in pretrial detention makes a mockery of Lebanon’s already strained judicial system,"" Hanan Salah, the group's associate Middle East and North Africa director, said in a statement.
""It’s understandable that people want to know what happened,"" Salah said. ""But it is unlawful to hold someone in pretrial detention for many years merely for their possible association with the person responsible for wrongdoing."""

Minnesota jail workers ignored the pleas of a 41-year-old man who died of a perforated bowel after spending days begging to be taken to a hospital, with pain so severe that he was forced to crawl on the floor of his cell, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.
Lucas Bellamy was treated like ""he was subhuman, like he was an animal,"" according to the suit filed against Hennepin County and Hennepin Healthcare in the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis.
The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, which operates the jail, offered condolences to the family in a written statement but declined to comment on the lawsuit because it was just filed and is ongoing. Hennepin Healthcare said in a statement that it doesn't comment on pending litigation.
MINNESOTA PRISON EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN 'RESOLVED' AFTER DOZENS OF INMATES REFUSED TO GO BACK TO CELLS
It all started on July 18, 2022, when Lucas Bellamy was arrested on charges of fleeing police in a suspected stolen vehicle and possession of brass knuckles, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports.

During jail intake, he told staff that he had ingested a bag of drugs and was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, known as HCMC, the suit said. He was monitored and returned to jail with instructions to return to the emergency department if he exhibited any concerning symptoms.
The Bellamy family’s attorney, Jeff Storms, showed the news media video of Lucas’ interactions with nurses and jail guards. The last clip revealed him just behind his cell door, the lower half of his body slowly moving about until he went still and died.

His father, Louis Bellamy, who is a director and founded the Penumbra Theatre in St. Paul, said in a briefing that he has seen tragedy on the stage. But he noted he ""could not have built anything more callous, more disrespectful to … humanity, human existence than what I witnessed on that tape.""
The lawsuit alleges that Bellamy’s death was among 15 at the jail since 2015, including eight within the past two years. It alleges that checks on inmate well-being have fallen short of standards, and such was the case with Bellamy.
Storms, the attorney, said he is calling on Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to investigate.
""Lucas could have been saved with proper treatment,"" the suit said. ""Instead, he endured a real-life nightmare and died."""

Dean Phillips, D-Minn., gives his take on the primary election race on ""Special Report.""
Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, the Democratic presidential underdog, fell just short of his stated goal in the New Hampshire primary.
With 95% of votes accounted for, Phillips — who previously said ""getting in the 20s would be an extraordinary accomplishment"" — received 19.5% of the state.
President Biden secured victory with approximately 55% of the vote.

Phillips got a lucky break going into the second primary election: Biden voters were forced to write in the president's name after his campaign failed to register him on the ballot.
More than a year ago, the president proposed a nominating calendar for the 2024 election cycle that booted New Hampshire from its traditional leadoff primary position and replaced it with South Carolina, a much more diverse state where Black voters play an outsized role in Democratic politics.
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) a year ago overwhelmingly approved the calendar change proposed by the president, but New Hampshire leapfrogged South Carolina to honor a longtime state law that mandates that the Granite State holds the first primary.

With the state holding an unsanctioned Democratic contest, the president's re-election campaign last autumn announced that Biden wouldn't file to place his name on the New Hampshire ballot.
Phillips says he's invested $5 million of his own money in his White House bid.
""A lot more than I intended,"" he noted in an interview with Fox News Digital. But he said his investment may be starting to pay off as ""grassroots donors are really starting to pop up.""

While the president is the commanding front-runner for his party’s 2024 nomination, polls indicate that many Americans — including plenty of Democrats — don't want Biden to seek a second term in the White House.
Those same surveys show that voters are not thrilled with the likely prospect of a rematch between Biden and the candidate he defeated in 2020: former President Trump.

6LWOPXDNPI_VL7ZCOP72A7Y75W,Georgia Republican House speaker proposes additional child income tax cut,Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 8:16am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-republican-house-speaker-proposes-additional-child-income-tax-cut,"CPA and market analyst Dan Gertrude explains why the IRS's new tax brackets could put more money in Americans' pockets and startling numbers showing that America comprises approximately one-third of the global debt.
Georgia House Republicans are proposing an additional tax cut for parents.
House Speaker Jon Burns on Wednesday said his GOP caucus will back a plan to raise the amount that parents can deduct per child from their yearly state income taxes to $4,000 from the current $3,000. With Georgia's income tax rate currently at 5.49%, that works out to as much as $55 more per child, or about $150 million statewide.
""While rising child care costs are here with us every day, we’re hoping this extra $1,000 deduction per child will help alleviate some of those costs for the parents,"" Burns, of Newington, told reporters at a news conference.
ATTEMPT BY GEORGIA ELECTIONS BOARD TO INVESTIGATE SECRETARY OF STATE SPARKS LEGAL DEBATE
The new tax cut proposal comes as Burns and the other 235 representatives and senators face reelection later this year.
The speaker also reiterated his earlier proposal to increase the state homestead exemption from $2,000 to $4,000. That amount could save homeowners nearly $100 million statewide, according to projections. Senators have countered with a plan that would cap the rate at which assessed property values could rise for tax purposes, which could limit future property tax increases.
Voters statewide would have to approve the increased exemption in a November referendum if the measure passes.

Burns is also backing a plan announced by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in December to speed up an already-planned cut in the state income tax rate. As of Jan. 1, Georgia has a flat income tax rate of 5.49%, passed under a 2022 law that transitioned away from a series of income brackets that topped out at 5.75%.
The income tax rate is supposed to drop 0.1% a year until reaching 4.99%, if state revenues hold up. The plan announced in December would retroactively drop the rate to 5.39% as of Jan. 1. The total change is projected to cost the state $1.1 billion in foregone revenue, including an extra $300 million for the cut from 5.49% to 5.39%.
Burns also unveiled a plan to move all of Georgia's unallocated surplus cash into its rainy day account, a bill also being pushed by Kemp. Georgia had $10.7 billion in unallocated surplus at the end of the last budget year, in addition to a rainy day fund filled to the legal limit of $5.4 billion, or 15% of the prior year's tax revenue.
Burns said the move would ""allow the state to save responsibly, build our reserves, and provide more taxpayer relief to Georgia families both in the short term and the long term when our financial situation may not be as strong.""
Garrison Douglas, a spokesperson for Kemp, said in a statement that by designating the money as savings ""we are keeping to our commitment to the smart fiscal management that allows us to responsibly address future needs and priorities.""

It's unclear what the practical effect of putting all the surplus cash into the rainy day fund would be. Lawmakers can only spend up to the amount Kemp allows, whether from the rainy day fund, the unallocated surplus, or regular revenue.
However, it could reduce political pressure to spend the unallocated surplus, a move Kemp has mostly resisted before allocating $2 billion of it for spending in his current budget proposal. Democrats have attacked the surplus, saying the state is piling up cash while ignoring critical needs.
""We’re starting this year with a $16 billion surplus, $11 billion in unallocated funds,"" Democratic Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes of Lawrenceville said at a news conference last week. ""This isn’t Monopoly money. This is hard-earned tax dollars that should be reinvested in improving the life of every Georgian."""

Tobin had originally planned to leave her position as senior director for transborder security last summer, but the Biden administration persuaded her to stay on through the end of the year, NBC News reported.
Tobin’s departure comes as the administration faces intense criticism over its handling of migrants illegally crossing the southern border.
Tobin was part of a U.S. delegation that traveled to Mexico to discuss what can be done to decrease illegal crossings, and she led planning for the end of the Trump era Title 42 last year.

He added, ""We will miss Katie’s positivity and thoughtful contributions on an incredibly complex portfolio, but wish her well.""
Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House and National Security Council for comment.

Sources with Customs and Border Protection told Fox News Digital that migrant encounters hit a staggering 300,000 incidents in the last month of 2023, reaching a level thought unimaginable just years ago.
Between Dec. 1 and 31, more than 302,000 migrants were documented attempting to cross the U.S. southern border.

Baldwin was charged again with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on January 19. Hutchins died October 21, 2021, after a gun that Baldwin was holding discharged.
The labor union defended the actor in a statement shared Thursday. SAG-AFTRA noted that it is not an actor's duty to inspect a firearm on set and slammed the prosecution's understanding as an ""incorrect assessment.""
""An actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert,"" the organization said in a statement. ""Firearms are provided for use on set under the guidance of multiple expert professionals directly responsible for the safe and accurate operation of that firearm.""

According to SAG-AFTRA, industry standards require an ""experienced, qualified armorer"" to handle firearms.
""These duties include ‘inspecting the firearm and barrel before and after every firing sequence,’ and 'checking all firearms before each use,'"" the statement said. ""The guidelines do not make it the performer’s responsibility to check any firearm. Performers train to perform, and they are not required or expected to be experts on guns or experienced in their use.""

Baldwin has maintained that he did not pull the trigger of the gun October 21, 2021.
""The trigger wasn’t pulled. I didn’t pull the trigger,"" Baldwin told George Stephanopoulos in an interview shortly after the fatal shooting.
""No, no, no, no, I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger. Never.""
However, the FBI conducted an accidental-discharge test and determined the gun used in the fatal shooting of Hutchins ""could not be made to fire without a pull of the trigger,"" ABC News reported.

Baldwin was originally charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter on January 31, and the charges were dropped in April.
At the time, the prosecution claimed that ""new facts"" had been revealed that require further investigation. In their motion to dismiss, the special prosecutors noted that the inquiry and forensic analysis required could be completed before the start of Baldwin's scheduled preliminary hearing.
Special prosecutors revealed that they would ask a grand jury to decide if Baldwin should face criminal charges for a second time in October, nearly two years after Hutchins' death.

BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts is planning to shutter MCI-Concord, the state's oldest prison for men, as it continues to see a drop in the prison population statewide.
Closing the medium security facility, which opened in 1878, will save the state about $16 million a year according to a $58 billion budget plan Gov. Maura Healey unveiled Wednesday.
TRUMP OPPONENTS IN MASSACHUSETTS LOSE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE FORMER PRESIDENT FROM BALLOT
""It also reflects the fact that our prison population has declined. It's at the lowest point it has been in 35 years,"" Healey said. ""It's a matter of justice too.""
The prison is only at about half-capacity and would need extensive repairs if it were kept open, said state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, Democratic co-chair of the Joint Committee on the Judiciary. The approximately 400 prisoners still at the facility will be sent to other prisons.
Massachusetts will be closing MCI-Concord prison, in a move which will save the state $16M a year.
The prison could be closed as early as June, said Eldridge, who credited the declining number of inmates in part to efforts by the state to reduce recidivism.
""If there was going to be a prison closed in Mass, MCI Concord was the one,"" he said, pointing to a 2018 law that decriminalized some minor offenses and expanded provisions meant to help divert people from involvement in the criminal justice system.
The fiscal year 2025 budget Healey unveiled Wednesday included several proposals the Democrat previewed during her State of the Commonwealth speech earlier this month, including lowering the staggering cost of housing and childcare and making Massachusetts ""the climate innovation lab for the world.""
It doesn't rely on any new broad-based taxes and won't require a withdrawal from the state's rainy day fund, according to Healey, who said the budget would increase spending by just under 3 percent, the smallest growth in about five years.
The budget would spend the anticipated $1.3 billion raised from the voter-approved ""millionaire tax"" on transportation and education, including a universal school meals program and a low-income fare relief program for greater Boston's public transit system.
The release of the budget comes more than two weeks after Healey announced $375 million in budget cuts for the current fiscal year as the administration seeks to close an expected $1 billion shortfall with monthly revenues coming in at a slower pace than expected.
Included in the budget is a proposal that would guarantee that every 4-year-old in the state’s 26 former industrial ""Gateway Cities"" has the chance, at low or no cost, to enroll in a high-quality preschool program by 2026.
Healey said her budget would also help an additional 4,000 low- and moderate-income families afford child care and out-of-school programs.
Healey acknowledged that the state has also come under increasing pressure as it tries to cope with a continued influx of migrants, straining the state’s homeless shelter system.
Her family shelter plan would rely on $325 million out of the fiscal year 2025 budget as well as on a additional proposal that gives the state access to nearly $900 million out of a surplus spending account to help cover cost for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 family shelter costs.
Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr credited Healey for beginning to recognize ""the gathering fiscal storm clouds swirling above our state.""
But he cautioned against proposing increased spending.
""As we navigate through the budgetary process, it is crucial to strike a balance between immediate needs and the long-term sustainability of critical programs,"" the Republican said in statement. ""Now is the time to tighten our belt and prevent avoidable, unsustainable spending.""
The budget also includes a proposal that would allow bail to be paid electronically and another proposal that would let the lottery set rules and regulations for lotteries conducted online or through mobile applications.

The budget now goes to the Massachusetts House and Senate, which must come up with their own proposed budgets. Those two documents will have to be combined into a single budget that will be sent back to Healey for her signature and any vetoes she wants to make.
Healey said the administration is also trying to tackle the state's housing problem by pushing a $4 billion housing plan, which she said would make it easier to find affordable places to live in the state."
6UP7C5CE1L_OQGU5X4J9CR64WB,'Huge for the community': Lewiston businesses reopen following Maine's deadliest shooting,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 7:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/huge-community-lewiston-businesses-reopen-maines-deadliest-shooting,"Ralph Brewer remembers his  brother Peyton Brewer-Ross, who was killed in the Maine mass shooting incident.
Immediately after Maine’s deadliest mass shooting, the owners of the bowling alley and the bar in Lewiston where the gunman killed a total of 18 people were certain their doors were closed for good.
Yet as time passed, they came to the same conclusion: They had to reopen.
In interviews with The Associated Press, Just-In-Time Recreation co-owner Samantha Juray and Schemengees Bar & Grille co-owner Kathy Lebel spoke about their businesses, the Oct. 25 shooting, and how their thinking shifted after support began to build from their families, the Lewiston community, and from across the country.
LEWISTON, MAINE SHOOTING INVESTIGATION COMMISSION SEEKS TO OBTAIN GUNMAN'S MILITARY RECORDS
Kathy Lebel loved to play pool. But she couldn’t fit a full table in her house and spent way too much money at local pool halls.

Then one night in bed, her husband, David, mentioned that one of her haunts, Schemengees, was up for sale. Lebel immediately sat up and said they should buy it.
""He looks at me and says, ‘We’re not going to buy that,’"" Lebel says. ""I’m like, ‘Are you kidding me? I’m going to buy it. I don’t know what it takes, but I want that pool hall.’""
Lebel got her way. After buying it 25 years ago, she relocated the business and expanded it to become Schemengees Bar & Grille.
MAINE SHOOTING: LEWISTON POLICE WERE WARNED ABOUT ROBERT CARD WEEKS BEFORE MASSACRE
She also ignored the advice to change the name — a nickname of the previous owner — amused that people struggled to pronounce or spell it correctly.
After her husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 12 years ago, Lebel became increasingly responsible for the bar's day-to-day management. She also had her own health crisis, surviving inflammatory breast cancer.
Lebel came to rely most on Joe Walker, whom she jokingly called her work husband. Together, they opened a second restaurant in Lewiston just as COVID-19 hit but managed to survive the downturn.
""He’s my biggest cheerleader,"" Lebel says. ""And he don’t give up.""
On Oct. 25, Lebel took a rare night off to celebrate her husband's birthday. At the bar, Walker was sitting down near the cornhole board when gunman Robert Card walked in.
Lebel's phone lit up. She read as far as ""mass shooting.""
""I just stood up, and I said, ‘Joe’s dead,’"" Lebel says. ""Because I always knew how Joe was.""
According to witnesses, Walker tried to stop the shooter but was killed.
Hours later, Lebel posted a message on Facebook: ""My heart is crushed.""
Lebel told herself: ""I’m done. I quit. It’s over."" She didn't even want to leave her house.
Eventually, though, she read some of the messages that were pouring in. They included questions about her plans from Lewiston’s deaf community, four of whom were killed at the bar while playing a cornhole tournament. She realized how much they wanted to return. Some of her relatives implored her not to let it end like this.
""I finally decided that I have to reopen,"" Lebel says.
It will need to be at a new location to help erase the memory of that night, she said. She doesn't know how long it will take.
But one thing is for sure: She's keeping the name.
Justin and Samantha Juray are further along with their plans to reopen Just-In-Time Recreation, the first place that Card opened fire. They have been ripping up floors, repainting, and putting in new seating.
""We’re just trying to change it a bit so that when people come in, it’s not a complete reminder of prior,"" Samantha Juray says. ""Or of the event.""
Juray says that at first, Justin was ""dead set"" against reopening.
""Within a week after, we knew that we had to reopen,"" Juray says. ""Because the community kept asking us, and we knew that everybody kind of needed it.""
They got support from the Bowling Proprietors' Association of America, which waived its annual fees, provided equipment upgrades and sent employees Christmas gift cards.
""We're like Americana. A lot of small towns, we're the place where everybody goes to hang out,"" said Frank DeSocio, the association’s executive director.
Other businesses where mass shootings have occurred have taken various approaches afterward. In Aurora, Colorado, a movie theater where 12 people were killed in 2012 later reopened under a new name. The city of Orlando, Florida, last year agreed to buy the Pulse nightclub site to create a memorial to the 49 people killed there in 2016.
The Jurays hope to reopen in March or April. They also plan to keep the name. When they bought the bowling alley nearly three years ago, the owner was days away from shutting it down. Hence Just-In-Time, which also fit with Justin's name.
""It was a place — or it is a place — where people get to come together, and spend time with friends and family, or create friends and family,"" says Samantha Juray. ""It’s a safe place.""
Two of their employees died in the shooting. The other 17 are all coming back, she says.
One is 69-year-old Tom Giberti, who has worked at the bowling alley for 20 years and is credited with saving at least four children that night.
Giberti recalls that he had just grabbed a screwdriver and was working near the back of the bowling alley when he heard the shots, which he initially thought were bowling balls thudding into the back of the lanes. He saw the panic on people’s faces and the flashes from a gun muzzle.
""I ran up to the kids and I got behind them,"" Giberti says. ""And I and got them back through the door, and as I turned to go through the door is when he shot me.""
MAINE'S 'YELLOW FLAG' LAW INVOKED OVER A DOZEN TIMES SINCE LEWISTON SHOOTING SPREE
One bullet remains wedged behind his left knee. A second blew clean through the side of his right leg, somehow missing bones and arteries. Giberti says he also took shrapnel in both legs, as bowling balls and machinery exploded around him.
Despite having surgery, and then treatment for a subsequent infection, Giberti looked spritely as he walked around greeting friends at a concert in Lewiston this month that was organized by local musician Ken Goodman to raise money for the two businesses.
How is Giberti even walking?
""It’s amazing. I can’t tell you why,"" he says. ""I’ve seen what it did to the machinery. I’ve seen what it did to others. I don’t know. My legs should have been blown right off. Either one of them.""
Giberti says it took him a few visits before he could bring himself to go back to the area where he was shot. Now, he can't wait for the reopening.
""I'm really excited for it,"" Giberti says. ""It's going to be huge for the community."""

A United Kingdom-based investigative group Conflict Armament Research claims a Russian missile fired into Ukraine is marked with a Korean character.
Conflict Armament Research (CAR) documented their findings in a report, saying a piece of wreckage from the ballistic projectile was marked by hand in the foreign language.
""On a barometer documented in Ukraine on January 11, 2024, as part of the missile wreckage, CAR investigators observed a label with the handwritten Korean (Hangul) character 'ㅈ',"" the report claimed.

The meaning of the symbol in relation to the missile component was not immediately clear.
Regardless, the presence of a Korean language character fuels accusations of cooperation between Russia and North Korea — the latter is suspected of producing ballistic missiles for the invasion of Ukraine.
""CAR investigators did not see any Hangul characters on other components,"" the organization reported.

The United States and South Korea have officially claimed North Korea is providing Russia with weaponry, including artillery and missiles, to help refill its supplies drained by its war in Ukraine. In return, North Korea allegedly receives technological and military insights.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed speculation of the Russian-North Korean ballistics deal earlier this month in a White House press conference.
""Our information indicates that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile launchers and several ballistic missiles,"" Kirby told reporters in a briefing at the White House.

6YHOWTVJP9_C38DPNT25G702I9,The feature film 'Trinity's Triumph' is a priest's narrative of sacrifice and joy: 'Human side' of it all,By Lauren Green Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 5:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/film-trinitys-triumph-priests-narrative-sacrifice-joy-human-side,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

It has been said by great theologians — in one way or another — that to truly know yourself, you must first learn to know God.
The great Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel said, ""There is no self-understanding without God-understanding.""
God made us. He knows how everything fits together. And more importantly, He holds the key to our purpose in life. That is the underlying current of a new feature-length movie about three young seminarians, the closest of friends, as they set out on what the film says is ""an extraordinary odyssey to answer the highest of calls.""
FAITH FOR CHRISTIANS MEANS KEEPING A FOCUS ON ‘LIFE THAT IS EVERLASTING,' SAYS CALIFORNIA PROFESSOR
In ""Trinity's Triumph,"" two of the seminarians are composite characters — young men who represent the variations of personalities in seminary. But one is not.
Father Joe is the avatar of Father Stephen Fichter, pastor of St. Elizabeth of Hungary Parish in Wyckoff, New Jersey.
The film ""Trinity's Triumph"" could be the first movie about priests actually written by a priest.   (iStock)
He developed the story and wrote the screenplay based on his journey to his ordination.
The film could be the first movie about priests actually written by a priest.
Says Fichter, ""I felt very strongly in my own vocation to the priesthood that God was calling more young people to serve him.""
PASTOR GREG LAURIE ON WHY HE IS PRO-LIFE: ‘MY LIFE WAS SAVED FROM ABORTION’
He said he wanted to ""make a movie that would be attractive to the modern generation.""
""He said, 'I see what you're trying to do. I think it's wonderful.'""
Film is certainly a good way to attract a younger generation, evidenced by the media attention given to the Catholic conversion of actor Shia LaBeouf.
But Fichter's film was a 25-year journey that started while he was studying in Rome. He talked about the sojourn on a recent episode of ""Lighthouse Faith"" podcast.
Instead of one seminarian's journey, Zeffirelli thought the film would make a better movie if told the story of three young men. (iStock)
""The original title was ‘Daring to Be Different,’ and it was the story of this one young man, and his journey ... trying to respond to the call, trying to be generous to God and the sacrifice they had to make along the way.""
Along the journey, Fichter got some remarkable help. While in the eternal city, a friend of his was able to get the amateur screenplay in front of award-winning Italian director Franco Zeffirelli.
Fichter says, ""I thought, you know, why not give it a try? Well, he loved it!""
Zeffirelli, said Fichter, ""really thought I had a great idea. And he invited me to his villa on the outskirts of Rome, and we were there. It was a Sunday afternoon. And he was just absolutely delightful. He said, 'I see what you're trying to do. I think it's wonderful.'""

Zeffirelli — who died in 2019 at age 96 — mentored Fichter and suggested a major change to the story.
Instead of one seminarian's journey, he thought it would make a better movie if were about about three young men.
The next big-name contribution came while Fichter was serving as pastor of Sacred Heart parish in Haworth, New Jersey. A parishioner who wrote books asked him about a Scripture she was looking for to add to a story (this was before online search engines became the norm). He happily helped her.
FAITH IN JESUS IS THE 'SMARTEST, SCARIEST, MOST THRILLING AND FULFILLING PATH ONE CAN TAKE,' SAYS TEXAS PASTOR
Turns out the parishioner was the bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark, the highest paid woman novelist.
Before her death in 2020, she wrote 51 books, each one a bestseller.
Said Fichter, ""When I first met her, I had no idea who she was. She was at daily Mass during Lent … She was just another parishioner in the pews.""
Fichter was able to cross that hurdle of ""Is this good enough?"" and then had to deal with the difficulty of getting it produced.
Higgins Clark also helped shape the screenplay and gave it little more personality.
She and others also advised those working on it not to avoid the elephant in the room, which was the sexual abuse crisis burgeoning in Boston and what we now know as a worldwide issue.
CHRISTMAS PROVES THAT LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER HATE — EVEN AMID WAR, SUFFERING, TRAGEDY AND TURMOIL
But Fichter was able to cross that hurdle of ""Is this good enough?"" and then had to deal with the difficulty of getting it produced.
He told ""Lighthouse Faith,"" ""Once I felt like I had that affirmation and that approval and that support and encouragement from, you know, two really amazing storytellers in our world, I decided, How can I get this made?""
Hollywood is a strange animal. To get a good actor to play your lead, the potential artist usually wants to know who the director is. To get a good director, he or she wants to know who your lead actor is. To get financing, people want to know who the actor and director are.
As difficult as it was for Fichter to get his film made, he had friends who were willing to invest.  (Joshua Comins/Fox News)
This merry-go-round can be endless.
Luckily, Fichter had friends who were willing to invest. It was low budget, just half a million dollars — hardly the catering bill for a blockbuster film.
Then, through more connections, he was able to snag A-list actor Joe Morton (""Speed,"" ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") to play the lead character, Monsignor Heck, around whom the entire movie pretty much revolves.
NEW JERSEY RABBI SAYS JOSEPH'S STORY IN GENESIS IS A REMINDER TO PUT FAMILY FIRST
Heck is the veteran seminary professor who challenges each of his students to go beyond knowing about God and take the plunge to actually knowing God.
He challenges the seminarians in the exact area where they're blind to their own weaknesses. One seminarian's superior intellect and theological knowledge put him far above his other classmates. But his failings came as he ignored the longings of his heart, believing that knowledge about God would be a talisman against temptation. It was not.
It is Heck who must deal with the fallout of an abusive priest.
It is Heck who must deal with the fallout of an abusive priest.
It is Heck who must debate a young priest struggling to understand why the Catholic Church doesn't allow them to marry and have children as in the Eastern rite or Orthodox churches permit.
""What we're trying to show in the movie is the human side to the priesthood,"" said Father Stephen Fichter of New Jersey.  (iStock)
It is Heck who, in the end, makes the audience feel honor and respect toward the priesthood; something that Hollywood hasn't done since the days when Bing Crosby played Father O'Malley in 1945's ""The Bells of St. Mary.""

Says Fichter, ""What we're trying to show in the movie is the human side to the priesthood. Yes, it's a calling from God. And it's something that the church discerns as a community and then the individual discerns ... and we try to show those sacrifices of not having a wife and a family and, you know, some of that loneliness that sets in.""
Each found that God's grace, truth and mercy would always be their strength.
To know God is experiential. Sometimes it's the weeping in the night, the falling to the knees from the weight of life’s struggles.
It is coming to the end of your human strength and only then knowing the only real thing you have in this life is the God who created you.
A priest is taught this. A good priest knows it and lives it out daily.

At the end of ""Trinity's Triumph,"" each seminarian is on a different path. One drops out before being ordained. One leaves after taking his vows. And only one, Father Joe (Fichter), is a priest.
But all triumphed, though, because in their pursuit of this ""highest of callings,"" each found that God's grace, truth and mercy would always be their strength.

The man accused of slaying a Detroit synagogue leader whose body was found in October outside her home will face trial, a judge ordered Tuesday.
There's enough evidence to bind Michael Jackson-Bolanos, 28, over to circuit court on murder, home invasion and lying to police charges, Judge Kenneth King of Detroit's 36th District Court found. King also added a first-degree premeditated murder charge.
Jackson-Bolanos is accused of fatally stabbing Samantha Woll, a killing that drew attention in part because it came amid the Israel-Hamas war and some speculated it may be linked. That theory, however, has been repeatedly knocked down by authorities, even before Jackson-Bolanos’ arrest.
SAMANTHA WOLL MURDER: WHY DID DETROIT POLICE RELEASE SUSPECT SO SOON AFTER ARREST?
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy has said there is not a ""shred of evidence"" that Woll was killed as a result of antisemitism or any hate crime. She has also said the two did not know each other.

Woll, 40, was president of the Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue. She was found dead outside her home east of downtown hours after returning from a wedding. Investigators believe she was attacked inside the residence.
""She was the victim of a brutal attack,"" King said Tuesday. ""This place was covered with blood all over. This kind of thing should not happen anywhere, let alone in the city of Detroit.""
SAMANTHA WOLL MURDER: DETROIT POLICE NOT NAMING ARRESTED SUSPECT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL, EXPERT SAYS
Police initially arrested another person, but that person was released in November. Jackson-Bolanos, of Detroit, was charged in December.
Police Chief James White has said Jackson-Bolanos came to the attention of investigators trying to solve larcenies in the area.
Testimony Tuesday focused on video surveillance collected by police investigators from downtown and near-east side security cameras before and after the slaying.
The prosecutor's office said Jackson-Bolanos' cellphone placed him near Woll's home. They said a small amount of blood was found on a jacket that belonged to him and was seen on surveillance video.
MICHIGAN JEWISH SYNAGOGUE PRESIDENT SAMANTHA WOLL FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE DETROIT HOME
But Jackspon-Bolanos' defense attorney, Brian Brown, said prosecutors still failed to prove his client killed Woll.
""They threw a theory out there, an assumption of what happened,"" he told King.
King even questioned the small amount of blood found on the jacket.
""This place is literally covered in blood,"" the judge said.
Jackson-Bolanos is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 30 in Wayne County Circuit Court. He was ordered Tuesday to remain in jail.
Besides her work for the synagogue, Woll had worked for Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin and on the political campaign of state Attorney General Dana Nessel."

The Kenyan cult leader charged with hundreds of counts of manslaughter is claiming innocence, along with nearly one hundred alleged accomplices.
Paul Nthenge Mackenzie, his wife, and 93 other suspects in the mass-death of cult members pleaded not guilty to 238 counts of manslaughter.
The 238 counts represent only a portion of the victims discovered in relation to the cult, which totaled over 429 corpses.

MacKenzie, who similarly pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges last week, will undergo a mental evaluation to determine if he is fit to stand trial.
The religious group, known as Good News International Church, is a new-age mutation of evangelical Christianity that developed into a personality cult with an obsession regarding the apocalypse.
""Once inside the villages established by Mackenzie, followers were not allowed to leave the area, nor interact within themselves,"" a Senate committee report on the cult states.

The report continues, ""The followers were required to destroy vital documents, among them national identity cards, birth certificates, certificates of title to property, academic certificates and marriage certificates.""
MacKenzie allegedly instructed believers to starve themselves to death before Armageddon comes to avoid suffering in the end times.
The deranged pastor reportedly preached vehemently against the Western world, including the United States, the United Nations, and the Catholic Church.

Authorities were turned on to the widespread deaths related to the cult after 15 severely malnourished parishioners were found in Kilifi county.
A search was conducted in the area and dozens of mass graves were discovered — while most victims were found to have died by starvation, some seemed to have been strangled or beaten to death.

A Norwegian official who was charged with overseeing how to combat plagiarism, has resigned over reports that she copied her master's thesis from a decade ago.
Sandra Borch, Norway’s minister for research and higher education, stepped down last week after a business student in Oslo discovered that parts of her master’s thesis were copied without attribution from a different author, The Associated Press reported.
Borch has admitted to plagiarizing parts of the thesis.

""When I wrote my master’s thesis around 10 years ago I made a big mistake,"" she told Norwegian news agency NTB. ""I took text from other assignments without stating the sources.""
The student who outed Borch, 27-year-old Kristoffer Rytterager, got upset about the minister's zealous approach to punishing academic infractions.
Several students were acquitted in lower courts of self plagiarism, by which they lifted sections of their own previous work. Borch then took them to the country's supreme court.
""Students were being expelled for self-plagiarism. I got angry, and I thought it was a good idea to check the minister’s own work,"" Rytterager told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
Norway Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Borch’s actions were, ""not compatible with the trust that is necessary to be minister of research and higher education.""

Minister of Health and Care Services Ingvild Kjerkol is also accused of plagiarizing her thesis. She told news outlets that it ""should not have happened"" and was an honest mistake.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The health insurance program for North Carolina government workers, teachers, retirees and their families soon won’t cover popular but expensive anti-obesity drugs, the result of a price fight with the manufacturer of two brand-name medications.
The North Carolina State Health Plan trustees board voted 4-3 on Thursday to exclude coverage effective April 1 of what are known as GLP-1 medications when used for the purpose of weight loss, news outlets reported. GLP-1-related prescriptions for diabetes treatment aren’t affected.
OZEMPIC, OTHER WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS MAY STRENGTHEN NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS, EXPERTS SAY: HEALTH GOAL 'BOOST'
The State Health Plan, which covers more than 700,000 people, has been dealing with massive growth in prescriptions of these drugs and their resulting expense. The GLP-1 weight-loss medications cost the plan an estimated $102 million in 2023, plan officials say, or about 10% of what it paid for all prescriptions.
In October, the board had voted to permit what became nearly 25,000 people with prescriptions for Wegovy, Saxenda or Zepbound for the purpose of weight loss at the end of 2023 to continue receiving them. But no additional prescriptions would be allowed going forward.
NC will decline to provide new prescriptions for popular weight-loss drugs under the state's health plan.
But this shift in drug utilization meant the State Health Plan would lose a 40% rebate on the cost of Wegovy and Saxenda from their manufacturer Novo Nordisk through the contract with plan pharmacy benefits manager CVS/Caremark.
That would have resulted in the plan spending $139 million on the grandfathered prescriptions, instead of $84 million with the rebate. Even with the rebate, the state plan was paying $800 for a month of Wegovy.
By ending coverage for the weight-loss drugs after April 1, the plan said it could save nearly $100 million this year.
""We can’t spend money we don’t have, we just can’t,"" said Dr. Pete Robie, a board member. Thursday’s vote ended the grandfather provision.
If no limits had been set, the State Health Plan would have spent an estimated $170 million on the weight-loss drugs, plan administrator Sam Watts said. That could have necessitated by 2025 a monthly surcharge of $48.50 on each plan member, the plan said, whether that member is using the drugs or not.
Board member Melanie Bush argued that the plan should maintain coverage of the existing prescriptions while negotiations continue with manufacturers and CVS/Caremark.

""This is a life-saving drug, and we’re talking about denying it,"" said Bush, who also helps lead the state's Medicaid program. Board members agreed the vote could be reconsidered if a compromise is reached.
""We have seen movement, but not enough movement to say, ‘Yes we have a solution,’"" Watts said."

Marco Rubio joins 'FOX & Friends' to discuss the growing outrage over Biden's handling of the border and the factors contributing to the military's recruitment crisis.
Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., introduced legislation Thursday that would ban federal authorities from removing razor wire or other barriers from the U.S.-Mexico border.
Collins' move comes after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a narrow 5-4 ruling earlier this week allowing federal authorities to do just that. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is in a pitched battle with President Biden's administration and has deployed the Texas National Guard to stem the flow of migrants.
""President Biden is aiding and abetting illegal aliens who are swarming our border and raiding our country’s resources,"" Collins said in a statement, according to The Hill. ""Why else would he try to stop the state of Texas from turning them back to Mexico?""
""With the Supreme Court siding with the America Last policies of the Biden administration, Congress must stand with Governor Greg Abbott as he fights for the sovereignty of his state and our nation,"" he added.

The Restricting Administration Zealots from Obliging Raiders, or ""RAZOR,"" Act specifically prevents federal authorities like Customs and Border Protection from removing barriers erected by any state.
Biden had ordered federal officers to cut razor wire Texas had placed along certain areas to prevent illegal crossings.

Despite the blow at the Supreme Court, Abbott is pressing forward in his defiance of federal authorities. He published a lengthy statement on Wednesday declaring that the federal government had failed to uphold its compact with Texas by allowing an invasion of millions of illegal immigrants under the Biden administration.
TEXAS AG PAXTON PROMISES ‘FIGHT IS NOT OVER’ AFTER SCOTUS RULE ON BIDEN ADMIN'S RAZOR WIRE CUTTING

Scores of sea turtles stunned by cold temperatures along the North Carolina coast have died, officials said.
The North Carolina State University Center for Marine Sciences and Technology took in 109 cold-stunned sea turtles from Cape Lookout on Sunday, but only 36 survived, the center said in a social media post this week.

After the surviving turtles are treated at the center, they will complete their rehabilitation at the North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores and the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center in Topsail before being released back into their natural habitat, the center said.

Cape Hatteras National Seashore said more than 100 cold-stunned sea turtles were also found in recent days along the shoreline between Bodie Island and Ocracoke. Most of the turtles were taken to the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island’s Sea Turtle Assistance and Rehabilitation center, officials said in a social media post.

About 24 turtles died, aquarium spokesperson Christian Legner said. There are 105 turtles rehabilitating onsite, including other turtles that have arrived at the center since the cold-stunning season began at the end of November, Legner said.
When temperatures drop, the cold-blooded reptiles’ body temperatures synchronize with their surroundings, leaving them lethargic and making it difficult for them to lift their heads above water to breathe, National Seashore officials said in the social media post. The wind carries the lethargic turtles to the shorelines, which are monitored in cold weather by volunteers and seashore biologists."
7MYGGDNMUW_8X20SV9KEHL0VZG,GOP AGs take aim at Dem plea for Biden to shut down critical ammo manufacturer: ‘litany of errors’,By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 4:13am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-ags-battle-blue-state-push-to-shutter-largest-ammo-manufacturer-to-punish-second-amendment-rights,"OutKick founder Clay Travis provides reaction as Hunter Biden is expected to cite the Second Amendment as a legal defense for his firearm purchase while actively using drugs. Fox News Lucas Tomlinson reports.
FIRST ON FOX - Every republican attorney general in the country blasted their Democrat counterparts for attempting to shutter an ammunition factory in Missouri, a letter sent to the White House Wednesday revealed.
In a letter obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, all 28 GOP attorneys general asked President Biden and White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention director Stefanie Feldman to disregard their Democrat colleagues' request to end commercial sales from Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, one of the country’s largest ammo manufacturers.
Democrats had previously asked the administration to investigate the contracting and manufacturing practices of the plant after a New York Times report alleged that ""military-grade rounds"" were sold commercially and were connected to mass shootings.
But the Republicans say the Democrats’ letter contained a ""litany of errors."" ""Perhaps those States should focus more on prosecuting crime to stop mass shootings—rather than trying to stop lawful Americans’ use of guns and ammunition. Their tactic is an overt attempt to punish Americans’ exercise of their Second Amendment rights,"" they wrote.

Among the list of ""errors"" the GOP AGs point out that their Democrat colleages allege that ammunition manufactured for ""military use"" does not belong in communities.
""First, the ammunition manufactured at Lake City and sold into the commercial market is not the primary rifle cartridge used by the United States military. The primary cartridge is proprietary to the Army and may not be sold commercially,"" the AGs note.
""Second, while the United States military purchases and uses a particular type of ammunition, that is not determinative as to whether it is ""military ammunition"" that should be banned for public use,"" they write.
""If the United States military using ammunition precluded that ammunition’s use by civilians, then other widely and commonly available ammunition, including 9mm and 12-gauge shotshells, would also be prohibited for public use,"" they argued, adding that Supreme Court precedent ""does not support such an openly artificial distinction.""
TRUMP TO HEADLINE ‘MOMENTOUS’ NRA EVENT AHEAD OF KEY PRIMARY SHOWDOWN
According to the state’s top prosecutors, Lake City only sells ammunition to commercial customers that is legal to manufacture, and it complies with all the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) requirements.  (Reuters)
According to the state’s top prosecutors, Lake City only sells ammunition to commercial customers that is legal to manufacture, and it complies with all the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) requirements.
The AGs argued that the Democrats’ efforts would undermine national security. ""Gun control advocates are firing blanks when they contend that taxpayers are subsidizing mass shooters. They get causality backward. The law-abiding target shooters and gun owners who buy Lake City ammunition are subsidizing national defense and military readiness,"" they argue.
They note that the Defense Department ""sought to avoid a situation when the military needs surge due to a real-world conflict, ammunition is not readily available,"" adding that ammunition availability requires facilities, production equipment, a skilled workforce, and supply chains to remain in constant operation.
""Machines and production cannot be turned on like the flip of a switch. It takes time to hire and train the highly skilled workers needed to operate production lines to manufacture the highest quality ammunition for U.S. warfighters. Commercial production has allowed Lake City, and its suppliers, to maintain steady labor, maximize equipment run time, ensure a stable supply base, and provide a level of readiness to the U.S. military that would not otherwise be available,"" they added.
The attorneys general also said that Lake City cannot halt commercial use without a ""detrimental loss"" to their communities and economy. If it stopped, the AGs allege it would result in an estimated loss of 500–700 jobs or 30%–45% of the skilled workforce now employed at Lake City and ""countless more"" throughout the supply chain.
FEDERAL JUDGE RULES IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO BAN GUNS FROM POST OFFICES
""Do not be fooled. The anti-gun radicals leading this effort are not honest brokers interested in public safety,"" they AGs told President Biden. ""Gun control advocates want to criminalize making ammunition even while many push back against prosecuting criminals that fire weapons.""
""Do not be fooled. The anti-gun radicals leading this effort are not honest brokers interested in public safety,"" they said. ""Gun control advocates want to criminalize making ammunition even while many push back against prosecuting criminals that fire weapons.""
""Perpetrators of gun violence should be punished—not the firearm and ammunition manufacturers,"" they said.
Montana Attorney General Austen Knudsen in a statement to Fox News Digital called the investigation by the New York Times ""highly questionable"" and, their latest effort to shut down the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is based on a highly questionable ‘investigation' by the New York Times.""
Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird charged that ""if the Biden Administration and anti-gun activists were serious about saving lives, they would start by enforcing the laws on the books to combat violent criminals.""

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey echoed those sentiments, adding that ""Lake City Ammunition did nothing wrong.""
""We should be focused on the free flow of illegal weapons coming across our border – not taking aim at law-abiding patriots,"" Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said, adding that the border crisis ""is exactly why law-abiding citizens need the liberty to defend themselves.""

The defense attorney for Jennifer Crumbley, mother of Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley, quoted Taylor Swift lyrics in her opening statements Thursday on the first day of Jennifer's criminal trial.
""On my way to court today, I blasted Taylor Swift to warm my voice and calm my nerves, and there was a line in one of her songs that summarized what this case is about. 'Band-Aids don't stop bullet holes,' and that's what this case is about,"" Shannon Smith told jurors, referencing Swift's ""Bad Blood.""
Jennifer Crumbley and her husband, James Crumbley, who is being tried separately, are charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter each in Oakland County after Ethan, then 15, killed 16-year-old Tate Myre, 16-year-old Justin Shilling, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, and 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin, and left seven others severely injured on Nov. 30, 2021.
Smith said the case is about prosecutors trying to cover problems related to the school shooting with ""a Band-Aid"" — in this case, the involuntary manslaughter charges filed against Jennifer.
MICHIGAN MOM ON TRIAL FOR SON'S DEADLY SHOOTING MASSACRE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT PARENT CULPABILITY IN SHOOTINGS
Crumbley, 45, is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the Nov. 30, 2021, attack.
""The prosecution has charged Jennifer Crumbley with involuntary manslaughter in an effort to make the community feel better, in an effort to make people feel like someone is being held responsible, in an effort to send a message to gun owners,"" Smith said.
""None of those problems will be solved by charging Jennifer Crumbley with involuntary manslaughter.""
The defense attorney noted that while Jennifer is ""not a perfect parent,"" prosecutors have ""selectively pulled out slivers of evidence from a forest of trees to try and convince you there was something wrong with Ethan,"" and his mother ""should have known"" before he opened fire on Oxford High School.

Prosecutors have argued that Jennifer and James Crumbley purchased the gun that Ethan used in the shooting as a Christmas gift for the then-15-year-old boy. They allege Jennifer posted about the purchase on social media.
Prosecutors have also pointed to Jennifer's text messages to friends and colleagues indicating she knew something was wrong with her son prior to the shooting.
MICHIGAN SCHOOL SHOOTER ETHAN CRUMBLEY SENTENCED TO LIFE AFTER ADDRESSING COURT: ‘I AM A REALLY BAD PERSON’
On the morning of the shooting, James and Jennifer met with school counselors to discuss a disturbing drawing Ethan had made in class that day. Instead of taking him home, prosecutors say, they left. Ethan Crumbley later took a gun from his backpack and opened fire. He is currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole for his crimes.
Assistant prosecutor Marc Keast opened his remarks by naming each of the four victims who were killed on Nov. 30.
""Jennifer Crumbley didn't pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths.""
Keast added that there ""is no claim"" Jennifer Crumbley gifted her son a firearm knowing he would commit a mass shooting, which is why ""she is not charged with murder"" but involuntary manslaughter, which, ""by definition is unintentional,"" Keast said.
The assistant prosecutor also presented a photo of the drawing Ethan made on the morning his mother met with school officials.

""The thoughts won't stop,"" Ethan wrote beneath a drawing of a gun, which he crossed out before meeting with school officials, followed by, ""Help me."" Above a drawing of a bullet, the drawing says, ""Blood everywhere."" Further down on the page are other handwritten words and phrases, including, ""My life is useless.""

The 15-year-old suspect was able to convince school officials during the meeting that the concerning drawings were for a ""video game."" His parents ""flatly refused"" to take their son home, the prosecutor said in 2022.
""Just got to go to my son's school and meet his counselor. S--- day,"" Jennifer Crumbley allegedly texted an acquaintance just before 11 a.m. on Nov. 30 in a conversation about her horse lesson scheduled for later that day.

After the meeting, Jennifer Crumbley suggested in another text that she might take Ethan to the horse farm on the afternoon of Nov. 30 after school, saying, ""He can’t be left alone.""
After learning that her son was the suspected shooter, Jennifer Crumbley texted her boss, ""The gun is gone and so are the bullets,"" and ""Omg Andy he's going to kill himself he must be the shooter."" She also said, ""Ethan did it.""

Their attorneys said they fled for their own safety and turned themselves in several days later and have argued the parents could not have predicted their son's plan to commit a mass shooting.

While some Republicans celebrated Trump's victory, Democrats shared their hot takes on social media, taking aim at Trump's victory.
Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez released a statement on Trump's win in New Hampshire, saying Tuesday night's ""results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party.""
""Trump is offering Americans the same extreme agenda that has cost Republicans election after election: promising to undermine American democracy, reward the wealthy on the backs of the middle class, and ban abortion nationwide,"" Chavez Rodriguez said.
""Joe Biden sees things differently. He's fighting to grow our economy for the middle-class, strengthen our democracy, and protect the rights of every single American,"" she continued. ""While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he'll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.""
Censured California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat running for Senate, tweeted that Tuesday night brought another ""primary night, another win by Donald Trump.""
""We all know he will be the Republican nominee. And we know how important the fight ahead is to stop him,"" Schiff wrote.
""For our democracy. For our families. And for our future,"" he added.
""While Donald Trump barely squeaked out a win tonight in tonight’s Republican New Hampshire primary, President Biden just crushed the Democratic primary — as a write-in candidate,"" Occupy Democrats tweeted.
Former New York state Senator Anna Kaplan tweeted that Trump's ""win tonight makes clear that the threat to our democracy is just as real today as it was on January 6, 2021.""
""We cannot let him win in November. We must mobilize and work to reelect President Biden,"" she wrote.
Trump won the New Hampshire GOP primary on Tuesday night after the race whittled down to just two major candidates: him and Haley.
The race was called quickly as Trump took the Granite State contest over his former United Nations ambassador.
On the other side of the aisle, Biden took the Democratic primary in the Granite State after mounting a write-in campaign when he was not included on the ballot.

Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., says he will remain in the Democratic presidential primary race, despite losing to President Biden in the New Hampshire primary.
""Congratulations to President Biden, who absolutely won tonight, but by no means in a way that a strong incumbent president should,"" he said.
Phillips said voters deserved ""options"" and also praised GOP candidate Nikki Haley for remaining in the race despite her defeat in the Republican primary to former President Donald Trump.

As pressure mounts for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley to suspend her campaign, a counterargument is being made that her dragging out the primary fight actually benefits former President Trump.
On the popular conservative podcast ""Ruthless,"" co-host and former staffer to Sen. Mitch McConnell, John Ashbrook began by acknowledging why the Trump campaign is calling for Haley to drop out of the primary race and to consolidate behind the clear GOP frontrunner in order to focus on the general election against President Biden. He also saw what Team Haley is carrying on towards the South Carolina primary next month after exceeding expectations in New Hampshire.
""Let me give you a perspective on why it might actually be beneficial for Trump to have this continue,"" Ashbrook said on Thursday's podcast. ""Because a conflict between Donald Trump and another Republican has to be covered by the press. And it actually makes Trump look pretty good that he dominates his Republican opponents in Iowa and New Hampshire and whatever other state that he's running against… It runs the clock.""

""And the second that he is the nominee and there is no other conflict among Republicans, the conversation in the mainstream media turns entirely from something about presidential politics and who wants a border wall and who wants lower taxes- directly from that to criminal trial. And the presidential coverage from the mainstream media will be wall-to-wall criminal trial, start to finish,"" he continued.
Ashbrook went on to make clear that while Trump ""probably"" will defeat Haley in her home state as polls have previously suggested, ""75 network embeds"" are headed to South Carolina for the ongoing GOP battle, something he said the media ""must cover.""
Fellow ""Ruthless"" co-host Josh Holmes shared another argument in favor of Haley staying in the race that also helps Trump in the long run.

""If you're concerned that Nikki Haley is the one that's preventing the Republican Party from consolidating, like, don't worry about that. Don't worry about that,"" Holmes said. ""What you ought to worry a lot about is if somebody like Nikki Haley isn't talking to a segment of the electorate that the Trump campaign isn't talking to at all, because that is a majority maker. That is the difference.""
""But the consolidation is inevitable. It's going to happen. Because Joe Biden is that bad. Democrats are that bad. The progressive movement is that bad. It is so divorced from Middle America and the values of America and what we stand for, there's no chance that you're not going to have a consolidated conservative movement,"" Holmes added. ""What I worry a lot about is the people who aren't talked to who have economic concerns with the Biden administration that ultimately are fearful that the Republican Party doesn't represent anything they care about. Well, Nikki's talking to them right now.""
MAJOR GOP DONOR TELLS HALEY TO TAKE CUE FROM KENNY ROGERS: ‘KNOW WHEN TO WALK AWAY'
Trump has dominated the GOP race so far with historic wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, earning more than 50% support in both states. Haley came in third place at last week's Iowa caucuses and nabbed 43% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, going well beyond the roughly 37% polling average she had going into the Granite State, according to RealClearPolitics.
Very few polls have been done in South Carolina but they so far benefit Trump, who averages north of 50% of Republican support in the state while the former governor has been averaging 22%. It's worth noting that the polls were taken with other GOP rivals still in the race, all who have since suspended their campaigns.

Haley's main argument to voters has been that polling has shown she is a stronger general election candidate than Trump, pointing to polls showing her having a wider margin of victory over Biden in hypothetical match-ups. She has also made age and mental acuity a campaign issue against both Biden and Trump, seizing on the former president's recent gaffe when he mixed up Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while discussing Jan. 6 at a rally.
Meanwhile, supporters of Trump say continuing a contested GOP primary will drain money and resources that otherwise could be redirected against Biden as he will likely become the Republican nominee. Trump has also slammed his former U.N. ambassador for her foreign policy stances.

7TZED3XKHK_TFVMJOQUVQ571G3,"Senate border bill to allow 5,000 migrants a day before Title 42-type limit starts; sparking conservative fury",By Adam Shaw Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 5:19pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-border-bill-allow-5000-migrants-day-before-title-42-limit-starts,"NSC strategic communications coordinator John Kirby comments on the immigration crisis and weighs what impact the border crisis may have on 2024.
A border proposal still being hammered out by Senate negotiators would include a Title 42-type authority that would only be mandated if numbers at the southern border exceeded 5,000 migrant encounters a day -- part of a package already drawing fierce criticism from some conservatives in the chamber, with one GOP lawmaker branding it a ""stinking pile of crap.""
Talks have been ongoing for months as lawmakers have tried to find a deal over a fix to the southern border as part of talks for supplemental spending that includes aid to Ukraine and Israel. The Biden administration is seeking over $100 billion in funding, including $14 billion for the border. But Republicans have demanded limits on migrant releases into the interior, including the use of parole, and negotiators have been attempting to find a compromise.
Multiple sources familiar with the proposal tell Fox News Digital that the proposal would tighten the language of the initial credible fear standard for asylum screenings. One source said that those briefing lawmakers had predicted it could lead to the majority of migrants going through the screenings being removed.
Linked to that would be a Title 42-style expulsion authority to quickly remove migrants at the border similar to the COVID-19-era authority. Multiple sources said that the use of that authority would be mandated only if there was a 7-day rolling average of above 5,000 encounters a day.
BORDER DEAL PRICE TAG LIKELY TO COST MORE THAN $14 BILLION, BUT GOP LAWMAKERS GROW RESTLESS TO SEE BILL TEXT

Daily encounters between 4,000 and 5,000 would allow for discretionary expulsions, and any single day where there were over 8,000 encounters, expulsions would be mandated even if the 7-day average was lower. Those expulsions would also be exempted from judicial review.
The use of humanitarian parole at the border by the administration would also be restricted, but migrants could still be paroled in if they cite humanitarian reasons. Those restrictions are not expected to include parole programs in which migrants are flown in, such as those for Afghans and Ukrainians, as well as the Cuban Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program -- which allows 30,000 migrants to fly in to be paroled each month, as part of the administration’s ""expanded lawful pathways.""
One source familiar with the proposal said that the time asylum seekers would need to wait for a work permit would be cut from 180 days to 90 in some cases. Also expected to be in the bill is a proposal to grant work permits to children of legal temporary visa holders, including H-1B workers, who turn 21 while in the country. Those foreign nationals have been dubbed ""Documented Dreamers"" by activists, and it could affect up to a quarter of a million people.
Other additions include an increase in ICE detention beds to 55,000, as well as funding for facilities and additional border officers -- something the Biden administration has requested -- as well as legal assistance to unaccompanied children in the country.
While the provisions of the bill are still fluid, negotiators have said they are hoping to have a bill text soon -- indicating that the provisions, while fluid, are close to being solid. Similar provisions were reported earlier this month, and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.,one of the negotiators, urged caution about believing those reports.
SEN. MARSHALL URGES GOP TO SAY 'HELL NO' TO SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING REQUEST WITHOUT TIGHTER BORDER SECURITY
""I encourage people to read the border security bill before they judge the border security bill. I also advise people not to believe everything you read on the internet….,"" he said.
The proposal, even if it were to pass the Senate, would likely hit a buzzsaw of opposition in the House -- where the Republican majority has said it wants the inclusion of the entirety of the House border security bill passed last year as part of any supplemental spending bill. It also would face considerable opposition in the Senate. A source close to negotiations told Fox News Digital they believed it would make the crisis worse.
""This expensive, back room deal is packed full of quotas making the crisis a norm, quasi-amnesty provisions, and billions of dollars for corrupt NGOs and sanctuary cities—all of which will fuel the invasion at our border, not stop the flow,"" they said. ""Senate offices are quickly realizing the parole and asylum provisions aren’t just window dressing reforms, but will make things worse now and in the future.""
On Tuesday, a sign of the anger over the potential deal was on display in public when a group of Senate conservatives tore into the proposals in no uncertain terms, while expressing anger that they didn’t have the full text of the bill yet.
""[This bill] is a kamikaze plane in a box canyon with no exits headed for a train wreck,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas said at a press conference, later calling it a ""stinking pile of crap bill.""

""This bill is not designed to fix the problem. This bill normalizes 5,000 people a day coming in,"" he said. ""5,000 people a day is over 1.8 million a year. That's called an invasion by the way. Under Joe Biden we've had 9.6 million. So the great Republican compromise is we’re for two thirds of Joe Biden's open borders. We'll let in 6 million instead of 9 million.""
He predicted it would have a 0% chance of passing the House.
""This bill represents Senate Republican leadership waging war on House Republican leadership. It's not designed to secure the border and it won't secure the border,"" he said.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., expressed concern about tying the hands of a future Republican president, and the risk of allowing up to 5,000 people a day into the country.
""The thing is, we're hopefully going to have a new president. When we get a new Republican president, we should make sure we don't pass a bill that's going to impact their ability to secure the border. [Former President] Trump was able to secure the border with the existing laws. Let's make sure we don't pass something that makes it harder for him to do that.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., shared similar concerns.

""Part of my problem with the 4,000 threshold that's discretionary and then the 5,000 mandatory shutting down the border -- my first question is how are you going to do that? Do you have the personnel to actually shut down the border? And do you contemplate that hasn't been answered, but the 4,000 discretionary level, is that going to hinder the next president?"" he said.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said lawmakers must be given time to read and process the bill.
""If they can have access to what they're doing for four months. Three weeks is not too much to ask,"" he said.

Check them out!
Many of the 96 animals seized from a roadside zoo in Virginia last month after an investigation by the state attorney general will not be returned, a judge ruled Friday.
In his ruling, Rockbridge General District Court Judge Gregory Mooney found that prosecutors had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the animals seized from the Natural Bridge Zoo were subject to cruelty or inadequate care, The Roanoke Times reported. Mooney ordered ""disposal"" of 57 of the 96 animals, meaning they will be released to a humane society or animal shelter for adoption.
Mooney said the other 39 animals will be returned to the zoo because he was unable to find that they required seizure.
EUTHANIZED TIGER AMONG MORE THAN 100 ANIMALS SEIZED AS VIRGINIA ZOO FACES ANIMAL WELFARE INVESTIGATION
After confidential informants and undercover officers observed poor conditions at the zoo throughout 2023, Attorney General Jason Miyares' office executed a search warrant at the property in December. During later court proceedings, the office argued for the continued custody of the animals by the state.

State witnesses testified that several deceased animals and animal parts were found in a freezer on the property. They also described birds defecating on tortoises and dead goats lying bloated in their pens during visiting hours.
Attorneys for zoo owners Karl and Deborah ""Debbie"" Mogensen called zoo experts whose testimony contradicted the drastic conditions described by state witnesses.

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will not face trial in Russia for at least another two months, following a Moscow сourt hearing on Friday.
The 32-year-old American journalist was initially arrested on espionage charges in March 2023, but his trial continues to be delayed. On Friday, the Lefortovo District Court extended his pre-trial detention until March 30, meaning he will not even face a trial until he has been imprisoned for a year.
Gershkovich has the right to appeal within three days. However, previous appeals to be released from Moscow's Lefortovo prison have been refused.
The state news agency Ria Novosti aired video of Gershkovich listening to the ruling, wearing a hooded top and light blue jeans in a court cage. He was then escorted toward a prison van.

The Wall Street Journal reporter was initially detained while on a reporting trip to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg as Russia’s Federal Security Service alleged he was attempting to acquire defense secrets.
He was ""acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex,"" Russia claimed.
Gershkovich and the WSJ vehemently deny these accusations and strongly reject the charges against him.

Far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid likened Donald Trump to Hitler on Wednesday and said the former president was ""also viewed as a clown, a goon who could be kept in line.""
Reid opened her show by discussing ""fascism and how it takes root."" Reid said fascism does not take root through a dramatic coup, but ""more often a deal, a bargain between the would-be dictator and the establishment, both political and media,"" who believe power would tame the dictator.
""Like Trump, Hitler was also viewed as a clown, a goon who could be kept in line. And then there are the accommodations that the media makes with autocracy,"" Reid said, noting a New York Times article on Hitler from 1922, which said, ""Hitler’s antisemitism was not so violent or genuine as it sounded.""
Reid compared Hitler's failed coup that had ""set the stage"" for Nazi Germany, known as the Beer Hall Putsch, to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot on Capitol Hill.

The establishment thinks that they can be controlled and poof, they’re stuck with them,"" she said.
Reid turned to the 2024 election and said politicians, voters and the media were talking about a ""dangerous person"" coming back into power.
""And those who are legitimately afraid of this outcome are being quiet about it,"" she said.
Reid cited another New York Times report that said there was a ""consensus"" out of Davos that participants believed Trump would win in 2024.

FIRST ON FOX: School choice scholarships have seen soaring popularity in recent years following the learning loss experienced by children across the U.S. during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to ACE Scholarships, a nonprofit committed to helping parents access better education options for their school-aged children through private school partnerships, a record 14,090 scholarships were awarded to K-12 children across the country through its program for the 2023-2024 school year.
The group is announcing the number amid School Choice Week, and says that the amount of scholarship applications it's received has nearly tripled over the last three years, growing from 12,311 applications in the 2021-2022 school year, to 32,113 applications during the current school year.

It also says that the skyrocketing demand points to a greater donation need for private scholarship programs and expanded educational choice programs across the U.S.
""At ACE, we’ve seen time and again inspiring stories of children finding education opportunities that work best for them and excelling as a result. It’s what bright futures are built on,"" ACE Scholarships CEO Norton Rainey told Fox News Digital.
""Our scholarship program allows lower-income families to access schools that best meet the needs of their children,"" he said.

That number was a record-breaking $4.1 million in Texas alone just throughout last year, which included nearly 1,500 students enrolled in public school alternatives. According to the group, more than 200 private schools in Texas have enrolled ACE Scholarship recipients.
""Increasing choices helps parents find schools that meet the specific needs of their children,"" ACE Scholarships Texas President Jon Lineberger told Fox. ""Traditional public schools work well for many children, but too many kids are relegated to schools that are falling short academically, or don’t have the ability to meet a child’s special needs.""

""Every child deserves a quality education that allows them to flourish,"" Rainey told Fox. ""But not every child attends a school that is safe, academically rigorous, or addresses specific learning needs.""
""Choice programs give lower-income parents the flexibility to access a full menu of educational possibilities to find the learning environment best suited for their children,"" he added.

Last week, Trump notched wins in all but one of Iowa’s 99 counties. The exception was Johnson County, one of the most heavily populated in the state, where Haley came out ahead by a single vote.
Those results illustrate the divide in the GOP – rural voters all across the map turn out for Trump, making the cities must-win for his opponents.

In New Hampshire, Haley must perform well in the four cities with the highest raw vote in the 2016 primary.
For each county below, find Trump’s 2016 primary vote share and, for back-of-the-envelope reference, the combined ""Republican establishment"" vote. In 2016, this meant former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina. When combined, they beat Trump by about 6 points statewide, or 42%-36%.
To be clear, these are not benchmarks for Haley. Thanks to a different field and New Hampshire’s pseudo-open primary rules, there are no simple comparisons to make. She will, however, need to post strong results here to make a race of it.
Bedford is particularly important for Haley. This affluent suburb of Manchester is home to the types of voters most likely to vote for the former governor.
Bedford also flipped to Biden in the 2020 general election, marking the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won there since at least 1972.

Together, there are a lot of votes on the table in these four towns: out of the 234 municipalities in New Hampshire, they were responsible for 16% of the total vote in the 2016 primary.
The same towns are also home to 17% of the state’s total ""undeclared"" voters, who can choose to fill out either a Democratic or Republican ballot.
Johnson County, where Haley took that one vote victory in Iowa last week, is also home to a large university.
In New Hampshire, Haley will be looking for strong results in:
Kasich won Hanover by a whopping 24 points in 2016 – one of just a handful of towns where the former Ohio governor notched a win (Rubio came in second at 18%, Trump was in fourth with 11%). Trump took Durham, but only by 3.5 points over Kasich.
Haley will need to do a lot more than win in these small towns to keep the race competitive tonight, but the size of her margins here will provide some clues about the strength of her overall vote.
Results start coming in at 7 p.m. ET, but 20 towns across the state won’t close until 8 p.m., including Nashua.
Early returns will mostly come from rural areas, so be aware that they may not be representative of the overall vote.

Beijing confirmed Friday that a longtime British businessperson in China had been sentenced to five years in prison in 2022 on an espionage charge.
Ian J. Stones was convicted of being bought off to provide intelligence to ""external forces,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked about the case at a daily briefing. He did not provide any specific details about the charges.
Both the United Kingdom and United States governments have warned about the risk of detention under China's national security laws. A Japanese pharmaceutical company employee was detained last year on suspicion of spying. A new version of the law that took effect July 1, 2023, has heightened concerns about operating in China.
CHINA'S 'PROLIFIC' ESPIONAGE SCHEME TRYING TO 'HEADHUNT' BRITISH POLITICIANS, DEFENSE OFFICIALS, UK GOV'T SAYS
Stones' case was not publicly known until reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. The American business newspaper said that Stones is about 70 years old and has worked in China for about 40 years. His employers included General Motors and Pfizer before he set up up a consulting firm, Navisino Partners, about 15 years ago, the Journal said.

Foreign business organizations and governments called for greater clarity last year on what foreign firms are allowed to do under what is now known as the anti-espionage law. Of particular concern are tighter restrictions on the transfer of data to other parties, and what data is considered related to national security under the law.
Raids on the offices of three foreign companies, two consultancies and one due diligence firm, have further unnerved the business community.
The British government warns about the risk of arbitrary detention in China and the broad scope of the national security law. ""You may be detained without having intended to break the law,"" it says in its foreign travel advice for the country.
CHINA DETAINS SUSPECT ACCUSED OF SPYING FOR BRITAIN'S SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
The U.S. travel advisory says that Chinese authorities ""appear to have broad discretion to deem a wide range of documents, data, statistics, or materials as state secrets and to detain and prosecute foreign nationals for alleged espionage.""
It says that foreigners who have been detained for alleged national security law violations include businesspeople, former government officials, academics, journalists and relatives of Chinese involved in legal disputes.
Stones appealed his conviction, but a court upheld the original ruling in September, Wang said.
He said that the case was handled ""in accordance with the law, ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of both Chinese and foreign parties involved."""

An American scientist found herself in hot water after suggesting Brits change how they make their tea, providing advice with a literal pinch of salt.
""We want to ensure the good people of the U.K. that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain’s national drink is not official United States policy, and never will be,"" the U.S. Embassy in London wrote in a press release.
""Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, a sacred bond that unites our nations,"" the embassy stressed. ""We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our Special Relationship.""

The controversy kicked up when Bryn Mawr College chemistry professor Michelle Francl published her book, ""Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea."" One of the passages claimed that the key to a perfect cup of tea is a pinch of salt.
""I kind of understood that there would hopefully be a lot of interest,"" Frankl told The Associated Press. ""I didn’t know we’d wade into a diplomatic conversation with the U.S. Embassy.""

Francl claimed a small amount of salt, not even enough to taste, makes tea less bitter since sodium ions ""block the bitter receptors in our mouths."" She also suggested pre-warming the teapot, giving the bag a shake and serving the tea in a short, stout mug.

Hugh Grant, in an interview during the press tour for 2022’s ""Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,"" explained how to make a ""perfect"" cup of tea after accusing former co-star Sandra Bullock of serving him tea that was ""undrinkable.""
Grant insisted that the water must be boiling ""the moment"" it hits the tea bag, the bag must stay in for ""at least one minute"" – during which time it can be stirred ""thrice, no more and no less"" – and that proper tea uses only ""normal, fresh cow’s milk"" and not… like oat milk.

Grant even stated that he preferred his tea the color of ""medium taupe."" He said he saw ""no point"" asking an American about making tea.
Tea’s place in American lore – especially regarding relations with the United Kingdom – remains a prominent and contentious point: A proposed community note for the embassy post quipped, ""According to the American tradition, the only way to properly make tea is by dumping it into the nearest harbor.""

8F4MIEG7BA_3XPCVSUS5E74BAR,"Border deal price tag likely to cost more than $14 billion, but GOP lawmakers grow restless to see bill text",By Jamie Joseph Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 10:11am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-deal-will-be-more-than-14-billion-gop-sens-say,"Fox News host Laura Ingraham breaks down the fallout from President Biden's 'disastrous open border policies' on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
Negotiators have finalized a portion of the bipartisan border deal and sent it to the Senate Appropriations Committee to see how the new policies would be funded. But the anticipated cost surpasses the allocated $14 billion from President Biden's national security supplemental request for the border, lawmakers said.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, told reporters the price tag ""will definitely be more"" than $14 billion as the committee received a portion of the agreement dealing with asylum on Monday afternoon. She didn't say how much more it would cost, but Senate Republican Whip John Thune, R-S.D., added that the cost is currently being discussed.
Outstanding issues still remain in the border negotiations between lawmakers and Biden administration officials that would unlock billions in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan — and lead Republicans said they are not expecting a vote on it this week. It's unclear when an agreement will be finalized, but it will likely face an uphill battle when it does get a vote in the upper chamber and makes it to the GOP-controlled House.
""You can't create funding and new programming and then not fund it,"" lead Democrat negotiator Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told reporters Monday. ""So if you're committed to policy change, you have to be equally as committed to funding the policy change.""
SEN. MARSHALL URGES GOP TO SAY 'HELL NO' TO SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING REQUEST WITHOUT TIGHTER BORDER SECURITY

""We also can't have appropriators try to change the deal,"" he added. ""We've worked very hard to get where we are, and we have to sell our caucuses on a deal, but we can't relitigate it in the Appropriations Committee.""
Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., the lead Republican negotiator, said Monday it would be ""quite a push"" to get the legislation to the floor this week as lawmakers had previously hoped, acknowledging that Republicans need to ""have several days to be able to go through it.""
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. (Getty Images)
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted on X that GOP senators need to ""have and review"" the legislation for ""at least 3 weeks"" and be guaranteed the chance to offer amendments, which could push the policy from seeing the light of day even further. Senators are also scheduled to go on recess on Feb. 9, heightening the pressure for a deal to make it into lawmakers' hands before then.
And on Wednesday, lawmakers have a private Senate GOP conference meeting to discuss additional aid to Ukraine as the White House has already depleted the amount of funds it can send without congressional approval. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have remained in lockstep when it comes to pairing Ukraine aid and border security together, despite several dissenting voices in the GOP arguing they should be voted on separately.

""Colleagues continue their work to finalize the most substantial border security policy in 30 years,"" McConnell said on the floor. ""This agreement would come not a moment too soon.""
He added: ""America's allies look to us to lead by example, to deliver decisive capabilities to Ukraine and to step up investments in upgrading our arsenal, expanding our capacity to stock it.""
Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., another one of the key negotiators, told reporters she doesn't have a timeline, but the talks continue to make progress.
A critical sticking point for the bipartisan group of negotiators has been the issue of parole, an integral border policy that allows illegal immigrants to live in the U.S. temporarily and obtain their green cards. It was expanded under the Biden administration to permit 30,000 nationals from four nations to fly in and receive parole into the U.S. monthly, forming part of the administration's strategy to address the continuous crisis at the southern border.
Meanwhile, GOP lawmakers on the outside of the closed-door talks are growing restless without seeing the border deal in writing. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., a voice critical of sending more aid to Ukraine, told reporters Monday that ""we've had everybody tell us this is the best deal in the world, and nobody has seen a scrap of paper.""
Both Hawley and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. – another hawkish eye opposed to more foreign aid without heightened oversight – said there's some talk that the bill text allows up to 5,000 border crossings a day before penalties begin.

""I'm not going to vote for 50,000 green cards a year,"" Hawley said. ""I am not going to vote for 5,000 border crossings a day before you could shut the border down. I mean, absolutely not.""
Paul said, ""5,000 a day would be 1.8 million people.""
""I'm not for just having 1.8 million people come across the border,"" Paul said. ""I think there are national security problems with that. The other thing is, is they're talking about a bill in exchange for sending another $60 billion to Ukraine, which I'm not for.""
The White House's supplemental request, which was sent to Congress in October, includes $61.4 billion for Ukraine, $14.3 billion for Israel (with $10.6 billion allocated for military aid), $13.6 billion for some border security provisions, and significant investments in Indo-Pacific security assistance, totaling around $7.4 billion. Additionally, there's $9 billion earmarked for humanitarian aid in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza.

Now they're suing New Jersey health officials.
West Virginia lawmakers on Thursday soundly rejected a bill that would have expanded a law enforcement database to include collecting DNA samples from people arrested for certain felonies.
Some legislators cited privacy concerns during a lengthy debate before the 66-30 vote by the Republican-dominated House of Delegates. Three members were absent.
""This is just another step away from our liberties,"" said Republican Del. Rolland Jennings of Preston County.
DNA EVIDENCE IDENTIFIES LAST KNOWN VICTIM OF GREEN RIVER KILLER ALMOST 40 YEARS LATER
Current state law requires a DNA sample to be taken from anyone convicted of a felony and certain misdemeanors. The bill would have expanded the law to obtain DNA through cheek swabs from adults arrested on felony charges of violence against someone, a burglary or a case involving a minor. The samples would be sent to a state crime lab and the results stored in an FBI database.
""If you don’t want your DNA taken, don’t do a heinous crime,"" said Republican Del. Scot Heckert, a bill supporter.

(AP Photo/John Raby, File)
But some Democrats were concerned about the bill’s potential infringement on Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
""This bill is extremely broad,"" Ohio County Democrat Shawn Fluharty said. ""It’s dangerous territory to put people in a DNA database simply because they’ve been arrested just for probable cause and accused of a crime.""

Mason County Republican Jonathan Pinson, a bill supporter, said it was no more of a constitutional concern than collecting fingerprints from suspects. Pinson said lawmakers should be more concerned about helping crime victims whose cases remain unsolved ""because we don't know where to look"" for evidence.
The bill also contained steps to expunge someone's DNA records from the database if they were cleared of the felony charges.
Prior to the vote, the House twice rejected bids to halt debate on the bill."

Los Angeles County is recruiting up to 6,000 volunteers to count homeless people around the city. The effort began Tuesday night and is expected to take three days, officials said.
The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority-led street tally helps the county government’s efforts to tackle a homeless crisis, which has crippled the city with tens of thousands of people living on the streets, living in cars, tents and makeshift street shelters. These temporary homes have proliferated on sidewalks and in parks and other community areas.
The so-called ""point-in-time"" count aims to estimate how many people are unhoused and what financial or medical services they may require for potential mental health conditions or from drug addiction.
This count comes as California residents have grown increasingly frustrated over lawmakers’ failure to deter the surging homeless population. Since 2015, homelessness has increased by 70% in Los Angeles County and 80% in the city.

In 2023, officials reported more than 75,500 people were homeless on any given night in LA County, a 9% rise from a year earlier, and about 46,200 within the city of Los Angeles.

Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness on her first day in office in Dec. 2022.
She has announced that over 21,000 unhoused people were moved into leased hotels or other temporary shelter throughout 2023. The city has also cleared out street encampments and has additional housing projects planned, she said last month.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre touted President Biden's Tuesday speech in Virginia on abortion as ""fiery"" despite a much-noticed flub and the near-constant interruptions by protesters concerning his administration's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas.
Her defense of the speech came as she was pressed by multiple reporters during the White House briefing on whether Biden was ""frustrated"" he wasn't able to deliver it as intended, and whether he was braced for more protests at future public events.
""I mean, look, the president, from my view — and I think your colleagues have written about this — it was a fiery speech. It was a deeply, deeply impactful speech. You heard how the crowd reacted to the speech. It was a speech that I think landed in the way that talked about how this president, and his entire administration, is going to fight for women,"" Jean-Pierre said.

She added that Biden believes Americans have the right to have their voices heard ""as long as they do it peacefully."" ""We respect that,"" she said.
Despite her claims, Biden was ripped on social media for one instance during the speech in which he slurred a nearly incoherent line about former President Donald Trump and women in America.
""We’ll teach Donald Trump a valuable lesson: Don’t mess with the women of America unless you want to get the benefit!"" Biden appeared to say. He was subsequently blasted by critics over his age and cognitive ability, a common critique of the president, even from within his own party.

Buddy was born with a hole in his heart that doctors were able to sew shut. Despite that, he is expected to live a healthy life.
""By the grace of God and the wonderful medical team, he really just needed to grow,"" mom Ashley McClinton told FOX TV Stations.
The mother had experienced a miscarriage before she became pregnant with Buddy. At around 20 weeks, Buddy stopped growing in the womb and her blood pressure increased rapidly.

When her baby was finally discharged from Methodist Women's Hospital, Ashley described the day as being ""bittersweet.""
""We have formed such close relationships with all of the people that took care of him for [these] 116 days,"" she explained to FOX TV Stations. ""So it was a joyful day. But also, you know, a lot of tears, too.""

Ashley told Fox News Digital that Buddy is doing great at home.
""We have dreamed of being parents for so long and we are so grateful. Buddy is doing so good!"" the happy mom said. ""He’s very opinionated and most content being held, which we love. We are enjoying every minute with him.""
McClinton hopes that her family's story reminds couples who have experienced pregnancy losses or preterm births that they're not alone.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
NATO signed on Tuesday a $1.2 billion contract to make tens of thousands of artillery rounds to replenish the dwindling stocks of its member countries as they supply ammunition to Ukraine to help it defeat Russia's invasion.
The contract will allow for the purchase of 220,000 rounds of 155-millimeter ammunition, the most widely sought after artillery shell, according to NATO’s support and procurement agency. It will allow allies to backfill their arsenals and to provide Ukraine with more ammunition.
""This is important to defend our own territory, to build up our own stocks, but also to continue to support Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.

Ukraine was firing around 4,000 to 7,000 artillery shells each day last summer, while Russia was launching more than 20,000 shells daily in its neighbor’s territory, according to European Union estimates.
Russia’s arms industry far outweighs Ukraine’s and Kyiv needs help to match Moscow’s firepower.

But the shells will not arrive quickly — delivery on orders takes anywhere from 24 to 36 months, the NATO agency said.
The European Union plans to produce 1 million artillery rounds for Ukraine have fallen short, with only about a third of the target met. Senior EU officials have said that they now expect the European defense industry to be producing around one million shells annually by the end of this year."

An Alabama congressman said everyone ""has some type of racist in them"" during a Wednesday night debate with his Republican opponent.
Rep. Jerry Carl made the remarks during a GOP primary debate against fellow Rep. Barry Moore. Both lawmakers are vying to be the Republican nominee for a congressional seat in the state's March 5 primary after Alabama's congressional maps were redrawn.
During the debate, the moderator asked both men if they agreed with GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who said the United States has ""never been a racist country"" during an interview earlier this month with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade.

Pennsylvania's Republican Party on Monday endorsed York County's district attorney, Dave Sunday, for state attorney general out of a three-person field.
The party's endorsement came the day before candidates could begin collecting the required number of voter signatures to get on Pennsylvania's primary ballot. State committee members met via video link to vote on Monday evening.
Sunday won the endorsement over state Rep. Craig Williams and Katayoun Copeland, both former federal prosecutors who hail from Delaware County in southeastern Pennsylvania. Copeland has said she would not run against the party's endorsed candidate and ended her candidacy, a campaign aide said Monday.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Canadian government will limit the number of foreign students attending their universities for two years in order to ease pressure on the country's housing and healthcare.
The Ministry of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship announced the decision Monday as an initiative ostensibly aimed at benefiting the foreign student community.
""In recent years, the integrity of the international student system has been threatened,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Some institutions have significantly increased their intakes to drive revenues, and more students have been arriving in Canada without the proper supports they need to succeed.""

The ministry continued, ""Rapid increases in the number of international students arriving in Canada also puts pressure on housing, health care and other services.""
The two-year cap, which will start this year, will limit undergraduate study permits to approximately 360,000 individuals.
""In the spirit of fairness, individual provincial and territorial caps have been established, weighted by population, which will result in much more significant decreases in provinces where the international student population has seen the most unsustainable growth,"" the ministry said regarding the cap.

The government assured current students that permit renewals will not be affected by the new policy.
""In the coming weeks, we will no longer issue work permits to spouses of international students, apart from those in masters and doctoral programs,"" Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marc Miller said on X.
The ministry is hoping to exclude professional programs in areas such as law and medicine from the cap.

""International students enrich our communities - but we have an obligation to ensure that they have access to the resources they need to succeed in Canada,"" Miller concluded. ""We will continue to implement reforms to ensure the integrity of the program and uphold the academic experience in Canada.""
The student cap marks only the latest attempt by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to grapple with skyrocketing housing prices across the country.

8UGJA4LO4X_HZKW2ZNSA45TJWV,This Democratic US senator says it's time to get the job done and secure our southern border,By Jon Tester Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 5:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democratic-us-senator-says-time-get-job-done-secure-southern-border,"Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has more on the president's confrontation over the border crisis while defending Mayorkas amid lawmakers' impeachment efforts on 'Special Report.'
When it’s seeding time on our farm, we seed. When it’s haying time, we put up the hay. And when it’s harvest time, we bring in the crop. We don’t sit around and hope that somebody else will do the job for us. We handle it the Montana way: rolling up our sleeves and getting to work.
That’s the kind of mentality that small business owners, farmers, ranchers and hardworking Montanans all across our state bring to their jobs every single day. And it’s the type of mentality that my colleagues in Congress and President Biden urgently need to bring to the table to secure our border.
Montanans know that what’s happening at our southern border right now is a serious problem, plain and simple. No matter your political beliefs, allowing anyone to enter the country without being properly vetted or going through a legal process undermines our national security.

We know that drug cartels are taking advantage of these gaps in our border security to traffic drugs and people across the border. That needs to stop.
14 HOUSE DEMOCRATS JOIN REPUBLICANS TO REBUKE BIDEN OVER BORDER CRISIS
For too long, Congress has kicked the can down the road on securing our southern border and some have even refused to fund it. It’s time to stop kicking and get the job done.
When I talk to Montana sheriffs and mayors in communities big and small, they all tell me that the situation at our southern border and the deadly fentanyl crisis are having disastrous impacts on the folks they’re sworn to protect. We can save lives by taking action now.
The stories of those impacted Montana families, local governments’ budgets that are stretched thin, and our national security are front of mind for me when I’ve told President Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that what’s happening on our southern border is unacceptable.
SPEAKER JOHNSON SAYS VP HARRIS WANTS ‘LAWLESSNESS’ AT BORDER AFTER SHE ATTACKED GOP ON MIGRANT CRISIS
That is why I urged Senate leaders from both parties to prioritize a solution to the border crisis, one that I believe we should have stayed in Washington and worked over the holidays to solve.
The lack of urgency from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address this crisis is frankly disturbing.
When I visited our southern border, I stood at a section of the wall near McAllen, Texas, and spoke directly with Border Patrol agents who told me they need additional manpower and resources to get the job done. That’s why I’ve worked with Republicans and Democrats to introduce bipartisan legislation like my FEND Off Fentanyl Act and my ANTI Drugs Act.

These bills would give law enforcement the tools and funds they need to tackle this crisis head on. But politicians who would rather score cheap political points and play politics with our border blocked our bipartisan efforts.
It’s time for Congress to quit the political gamesmanship, put our shoulder to the wheel, and use commonsense proposals like the ones I’ve put forward, and others, to finally get a border deal done that protects our state and country.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Simply put, protecting our country by securing our southern border shouldn’t be a partisan issue – it’s an American issue. Montanans from all political stripes understand that the current systems in place are broken. They want to know why their elected leaders are so dysfunctional that they can’t seem to fix it.
My message to the president and my colleagues in Congress is simple: It's time to stop pointing fingers, quit using the border as a political talking point, and roll up our sleeves. I’m committed to working with anyone, Republican or Democrat, to get a deal done that secures our borders and protects our state and our country.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The animal rights group PETA wants to replace Punxsutawney Phil, the beloved groundhog that is used to forecast weather during the annual Groundhog Day celebration in Pennsylvania, with a gold coin, the group said this week.
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote an open letter on Monday to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club in Pennsylvania, in which they encouraged its president, Tom Dunkel, to remove the animal from the celebration. Should he formally retire Phil and take him to a sanctuary, then PETA would present the group with ""a giant coin,"" they said in the letter.
""Beyond a shadow of a doubt, a groundhog’s weather prediction is no more accurate than flipping a coin,"" the animal rights group said. ""He is not a meteorologist and deserves better than to be exploited every year for tourism money.""
It added: ""Should kindness prevail, the huge coin could easily replace him as the Pennsylvania town’s gimmick to draw in tourists.""

PETA has consistently called for Phil's retirement in recent years, offering multiple suggestions on how to replace him as the town’s gimmick, including an animatronic groundhog.
""Groundhogs are shy, solitary animals who socialize with other groundhogs only to choose a partner,"" the animal rights group said. ""They don’t want to live in confinement in a local library, where they can’t do anything that’s natural and important to them. They also don’t want to be used to prognosticate the weather or be exposed to flashing cameras, human handling or noisy crowds.""

""Phil is an individual who, although intelligent and self-aware, can’t predict the weather,"" they wrote. ""Even if he could, keeping him or any other animal imprisoned for a cruel annual gimmick is abusive.""
Ahead of Groundhog Day, PETA is also placing several advertisements throughout Sun Prairie, Wisconsin – which uses its own Jimmy the Groundhog – to encourage the city to retire his use as well.

The House Education and Workforce Committee is threatening retaliatory action against Harvard University after accusing the Ivy League school of an insufficient response to its antisemitism investigation.
Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., slammed Harvard’s response to the House GOP probe as ""unacceptable.""
""Upon initial review, Harvard’s production to the Committee in response to its antisemitism investigation is woefully inadequate,"" Foxx said. ""Rather than answering the Committee’s request in a substantive manner, Harvard has chosen to provide letters from nonprofits and student handbooks, many of which are already publicly available.""

""This is unacceptable. Harvard must produce the remaining documents in a timely manner, or risk compulsory measures,"" she warned.
It is continued fallout from former Harvard President Claudine Gay’s testimony before Congress late last year in which she failed to definitively say that calls for genocide against Jewish students on campus constituted harassment.
As scrutiny and demands for her resignation swelled from Republicans and pro-Israel groups, it was also revealed that Gay was found to have plagiarized dozens of past academic works.
CRITICS CHEER RESIGNATION OF 'ANTISEMITIC PLAGIARIST' HARVARD PRESIDENT CLAUDINE GAY
Claudine Gay resigned as president of Harvard University on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024, in the wake of controversies that sullied the reputation of America's oldest and one of its most prestigious university.
Foxx sent a letter formally requesting records from the school earlier this month.
""As you are aware, the Committee on Education and the Workforce (the Committee) is investigating Harvard University’s response to antisemitism and its failure to protect Jewish students. We have grave concerns regarding the inadequacy of Harvard’s response to the antisemitism on its campus,"" the chairwoman wrote.
""While Dr. Gay has since resigned, Harvard’s institutional failures regarding antisemitism extend well beyond one leader. There is evidence antisemitism has been pervasive at Harvard since well before the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack.""

Harvard responded to Foxx's Wednesday statement, ""Harvard is committed to cooperating with the Committee’s inquiry and providing information, including the submission made today, which addresses important questions raised by the Committee.""
""We denounce any form of antisemitism in the strongest possible terms and are committed to the safety and well-being of our students. We intend to continue to engage with the Committee in a dialogue to respond to their ongoing requests.""

The December hearing that precipitated Gay’s resignation also drove out University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill, who gave similar answers to Gay when broaching the topic of genocidal calls on campus.
Meanwhile, a group of Jewish students sued Harvard earlier this month, accusing the college of having ""become a bastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred.""

92W4R3QHWS_Q3LC0V6A5ZA4T5A,James Carville predicts that Trump can win the election if 'he's treated like a normal candidate',By Jeffrey Clark Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 10:52am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-carville-predicts-trump-can-win-election-hes-treated-normal-candidate,"James Carville told the media not to treat former President Trump like a regular candidate because that might help him win the presidential election.
Democratic strategist James Carville advised the media not to treat former President Trump like a regular candidate as campaigning for the presidential election heats up ahead of November.
""This is not a typical election,"" Carville said Wednesday on MSNBC.
Carville complained that there is a ""massive effort"" to normalize Trump's candidacy for president and then compared the Republican front-runner to Nazi military leader Hermann Goering, one of Adolf Hitler's closest lieutenants.

""Nothing is normal about this at all,"" Carville said of Trump's treatment by the press. ""And if you watch his speech last night, it was completely unhinged.""
""What I am obsessed with is, stop treating him like he is a normal candidate,"" Carville said, emphasizing that Trump is not like other Republican politicians or past GOP nominees Bob Dole or Mitt Romney.
""But if you look at this, there is a chance that Trump could win this election,"" he continued. ""And the way that he wins is he is treated as a normal candidate.""
Multiple polls have found that Trump is leading Biden in multiple key demographics and battleground states, including among young voters by a 13-point margin, per a Fox News poll.
Forty-one percent of respondents under 30 said they'd vote for Trump in the 2024 general election, while 28% said they'd vote for Biden, 14% said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., 7% for Jill Stein, and 5% for Cornel West. In that scenario, those under 45 years old also favored Trump, with 41% saying they'd vote for Trump, versus 31% who'd cast their vote for Biden.
Carville has made numerous attacks against Republican leaders in the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election. (Screenshot/HBO)
Carville suggested that The New York Times and other major outlets should give context to Trump by writing that he has been ""found to be a rapist by a jury.""
""We’re ill-informing the public of just what a wretched human being this man is,"" Carville said. ""And there is a giant effort to try to normalize this.""
A federal jury in New York City found last year that Trump was not liable for rape but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president has been ordered to pay advice columnist E. Jean Carroll $5 million.
Carville, who once served as an adviser to former President Clinton, has made numerous attacks against Republican leaders in the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election.
In December, Carville said that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other ""Christian nationalists"" like him are a bigger threat to the country than al-Qaeda.
Carville has repeatedly argued in recent months that Democrats should be concerned about President Biden's waning popularity with voters and especially with his age. (Getty Images)
BIDEN HAS BEEN SECRETLY MEETING WITH DONORS TO EASE CONCERNS, INCLUDING HIS AGE AND ENERGY: REPORT
But the political strategist has also called attention to vulnerabilities within his own party, notably warning that Biden's age and unpopularity may cost him the election.
Carville has repeatedly argued in recent months that Democrats should be concerned about Biden's waning popularity with voters and especially with his age. At 81 years old, Biden is the oldest serving president in American history.
""The idea that this should not be aired out and should be discussed in hushed tones is ludicrous,"" Carville has said of Biden's poll numbers. ""This needs to be discussed.""

The alleged person behind the wheel of a white Kia that plowed into a popular Latino bakery in Southern California before a mob of looters ransacked the business has been identified as a 13-year-old boy. That same boy was involved in another robbery just days later, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna announced Tuesday.
The ""street takeover"" happened at Ruben's Bakery & Mexican Food on Jan. 2. A white Kia could be seen on CCTV repeatedly ramming the front door until it gave way, which led to about 100 looters running wild inside.
Earlier this month, Ruben Ramirez Jr. told ""America Reports"" that the material losses had accumulated to $70,000 and that there was even more unimaginable damage to the bakery and to the realities of his family left to pick up the pieces.
Days after the bakery incident, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy said he was walking into a Carson 7-Eleven store toward the end of his shift when he realized he walked into an armed robbery in progress, FOX 11 reports.

The lifeless bodies of six victims were found in a remote desert community in California Tuesday, and details of how they died remain shrouded in mystery.
Five of the bodies were discovered at around 8:15 p.m. Tuesday when deputies from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department responded to a welfare check in the community of El Mirage.
They came across the shocking discovery on Highway 395, between Lake Los Angeles and Adelanto.
A sixth body was found at the scene Wednesday morning, Mara Rodriguez, the spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, said at a noon press briefing. She said the deputies were accompanied by members of the California Highway Patrol's Aviation Division.

Several reports said the deceased were fatally shot, and images taken from the scene by Fox 11 show one vehicle, a navy SUV, riddled with bullet holes. There were yellow police markings placed around the vehicle while another vehicle was also found at the scene.
Rodriguez was unable to provide the age or sex of the deceased, and police did not reveal the cause or manner of the deaths. She did confirm the case is being treated as a homicide.
""We have not confirmed any cause or manner of death or any gunshot wounds,"" Rodriguez said. ""This is a very remote desert area.
""It’s going to be heartbreaking no matter what the situation is, what they discover out there as far as the circumstances surrounding it.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The non-profit advocacy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence published a letter Tuesday blasting the proposed World Health Organization (WHO) pandemic treaty, questioning the United States' continued membership in the international body.
Pence's non-profit, Advancing American Freedom (AAF), is urging the U.S. government to withdraw from the WHO, citing the ""equity theater"" of the guidelines and its implications for free speech contained in its ""pandemic treaty.""
""The [WHO] proposal to consolidate power and erode the United States of America of its sovereignty through the WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty is untenable and raises serious and significant questions regarding America’s independence of action and ability to respond to global pandemics,"" the letter from the AAF stated.

WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus has called on countries to sign on to the health organization’s pandemic treaty so the world can prepare for ""Disease X.""
Disease X is a ""placeholder"" virus that does not exist but could hypothetically emerge and threaten international health. It was added to the WHO’s short list of pathogens for research in 2017 that could cause a ""serious international epidemic,"" according to a 2022 WHO press release.
Ghebreyesus, speaking in front of an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, said that he hoped countries would reach a pandemic agreement by May to address this hypothetical ""common enemy.""

The AAF points out that the treaty — ostensibly intended to save lives through international prioritization of the best medical practices — emphasizes race and ""equity"" before almost every other value in its ""general principles and approaches.""
""The draft treaty, released on October 30, 2023, uses the word 'equity' at least 9 times and 'equitable' at least 20 times,"" the AAF writes. ""It presents ‘equity’ as its 3rd general principle, ahead of responsibility, transparency, accountability, and science and evidence – principles that are magnitudes more important than ‘equity’ during a global pandemic.""
The AAF also warned about articles in the treaty related to freedom of expression, with one article specifically calling on signing nations to ""combat false, misleading, misinformation or disinformation, including through effective international collaboration and cooperation.""

The proposed treaty would also give the WHO control of international supply chains in the event of another pandemic event, intended to allow more efficient manipulation of resources.
""The United States should withdraw from the World Health Organization, not further enmesh itself in an unsalvageable body that rejects American leadership in favor of the Chinese Communist Party’s quest for world domination,"" the AAF letter said of the proposed treaty. ""The Trump-Pence Administration was right to cut off American tax dollars to, and to formally withdraw from the WHO.""
The deadline for the proposed treaty is May 2024, when the World Health Assembly is slated to meet.

Warning: Graphic image below
A U.S. Border Patrol agent was attacked by suspected human smugglers Tuesday while arresting illegal immigrants in Arizona, officials said.
The unidentified agent was taking several migrants into custody when he was attacked with rocks near the border city of San Luis, Arizona, the U.S. Border Patrol said.
Authorities with the Border Patrol's Yuma Sector were investigating the incident.
An image released by the agency shows an agent with what appeared to be a deep cut above the eye with blood running down his face.

No other information was released.
Border agents have been attacked with more regularity in recent months amid record numbers of migrants attempting to cross the southern border. Two Mexican citizens recently pleaded guilty to assaulting an agent last summer as he was attempting to arrest them in New Mexico.
Another agent was attacked in September while trying to take down a migrant in Texas.
The Biden administration has faced heavy scrutiny over its handling of the border, including attacks on U.S. personnel. Texas has taken it upon itself to police the border in defiance of the federal government.
""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now,"" a lengthy statement by the Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday. ""President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""

Abbott is currently fighting multiple legal battles with the administration and the federal government has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, while lawsuits are ongoing over the administration’s cutting of razor wire set up by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.
Texas is also being sued by the administration over a recently signed law that allows state and local officials to arrest illegal immigrants.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sided with Texas on the matter.
""If the Constitution really made states powerless to defend themselves against an invasion, it wouldn’t have been ratified in the first place and Texas would have never joined the union when it did,"" he posted Wednesday on X. ""TX is upholding the law while Biden is flouting it. FL will keep assisting Texas with personnel and assets.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer plans to urge state lawmakers to pass legislation that would provide free community college tuition for all high school graduates during her sixth State of the State speech on Wednesday.
Whitmer also prioritized community college access in her annual address last year. State lawmakers responded by temporarily lowering the minimum age for free tuition from 25 to 21 years old. The Democratic governor now wants to expand the program by removing all age requirements for free community college, according to details of her plan provided to The Associated Press by Whitmer’s office.
Whitmer's administration created the Michigan Reconnect program in 2021, aiming to increase the percentage of the state's workforce with a postsecondary degree or training from 50.5% to 60% by 2030. It made Michigan residents 25 years and older eligible for free community college tuition.
DEMOCRATIC GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER WARNS BIDEN COULD FACE PROTESTERS IN MICHIGAN WHEN HE VISITS
By the end of the 2023 academic year, over 32,400 student had enrolled in the program since its launch and at least 4,400 have earned a degree or certificate, according to the governor's office.
Lowering the program’s minimum age to 21 last year made it accessible to 350,000 more residents without college degrees, and 8,500 residents have signed up, according to the governor’s office. That change is only in place through this fall's semester, when it is set to return to 25 unless lawmakers approve Whitmer’s proposal.

The program was given an initial investment of $30 million when launched in 2021 and an additional $70 million when the minimum age was temporarily lowered to 21 years old. The governor's team did not provide a cost estimate for the program's expansion to all high school graduates.
Brandy Johnson, president of the Michigan Community College Association, praised the governor’s proposal, saying in a statement that it would help remove financial barriers that ""make attaining a postsecondary education seem impossible,"" for many high school graduates.
Under Whitmer's proposal, eligible students must have lived in Michigan for the year prior to enrollment, must have a high school diploma and must not have previously completed a college degree. Students would have up to three years to obtain their associate’s degree.
Community college enrollment in Michigan has been on the decline. Michigan community colleges saw a 2.8% drop in enrollment last spring compared to the year before, even as national enrollment increased by 0.5%, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
Across the country, the number of students at community colleges has fallen 37% since 2010, or by nearly 2.6 million, clearinghouse said.
Community colleges are far cheaper than four-year schools. Published tuition and fees last year averaged $3,860 per year, versus $39,400 at private and $10,940 at public four-year universities, with many states offering programs that make community college free.
Last year, much of what Whitmer wanted in her State of the State speech — including tax cuts and a repeal of right to work — was passed by a Legislature controlled entirely by Democrats.

A West Virginia judge has ordered a woman to testify in a child homicide case, thwarting potential plans by the suspect to exclude her key testimony due to a possible marriage between the defendant and witness.
Cabell County Circuit Court Judge Paul Farrell ruled Tuesday in the case against Shannon Overstreet, who is charged with murder, child abuse and concealment in relation to the disappearance of his daughter Angel, WCHS-TV reported.
Special prosecutor Philip Morrison said in his request for the deposition that phone calls intercepted at the facility where Overstreet is being held tipped them off. He added in court Tuesday that the witness' statements and actions do not coincide.
""[She] called in and said, 'I don’t intend to marry this guy, and haven’t talked to him since Dec. 29.' I thought: 'Well, OK good.' Then I find out she’s been emailing him after the fact,"" WCHS states.

MSNBC has refused to respond after former host Tiffany Cross went off on the network last week, insisting executives questioned her intelligence and wanted her to be part of the anti-Trump ""echo chamber"" before she was shown the door in 2022.
MSNBC suddenly severed ties with Cross in November 2022, deciding not to renew her contract after two years. She broke her silence about the sudden exit last week on her new podcast, ""Native Land Pod,"" which she hosts with former CNN contributor Angela Rye and former Democratic Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum.
Cross, who hosted the weekend program ""The Cross Connection,"" slammed MSNBC for a variety of things, including a suggestion that network executives only wanted her to spend time criticizing former President Trump.

""The network’s philosophy was Trump, Trump, Trump. They wanted me to be part of the echo chamber,"" Cross said.
Cross also said that her scripts were scrutinized and nitpicked by MSNBC executives who don’t treat White males the same way, accused the network of planting negative stories about her in the press that were ""filled with outright lies"" and referenced reports that MSNBC president Rashida Jones tried to control the narrative about Cross' firing with a surprise visit to the set of ""The View"" in 2022.
Cross also said she was treated ""in the most condescending ways"" by MSNBC executives who didn’t allow her to offer an on-air farewell to viewers, so she would be seen as unhirable within the industry.
FAR-LEFT HOST TIFFANY CROSS OUT AT MSNBC OVER 'BAD JUDGMENT' ON AND OFF THE AIR
MSNBC has refused to respond after former host Tiffany Cross flamed the network.
MSNBC has ignored multiple requests for comment about Cross’ remarks, despite the fact that she directly named the network’s president and accused the organization of planting negative stories in the press.
Cross’ comments have generated a plethora of negative headlines for the liberal network, such as The Daily Beast reporting Cross ""puts MSNBC on blast.""

When MSNBC first parted ways with Cross, a network source told Fox News Digital that the move was made because of ""repeated bad behavior on and off-air"" and ""bad judgment."" Shortly before Cross was let go, she told Comedy Central's Charlagna Tha God that Florida was the country's ""d--k"" and should be ""castrated.""
Former MSNBC star Keith Olbermann defended Cross and blasted current ""caged, declawed, gutless"" MSNBC hosts that didn't speak out in support of her.
""Where is the statement of protest about the firing of Tiffany Cross from Lawrence O’Donnell? Where is the anger from Chris Hayes? Where is the condemnation of a women’s voice silenced from Alex Wagner? Where is the threat to walk out, to boycott, to quit, to stand on principle from Rachel Maddow?"" Olbermann asked.
""We have television performers who will make sure they are seen in the easy fights,"" Olbermann continued. ""But when it is bad, who will draw a line and fight and protect one thing and one thing alone — [their] paychecks.""

Fox News host Sean Hannity unpacks the ""showdown"" at the border on ""Hannity.""
SEAN HANNITY: Now, in recent weeks, the state of Texas, they finally, out of mere necessity, had to take total control of a public park. This is one in Eagle Pass that served as a very key entry point for waves of illegal immigrants. Joe Biden unvetted illegal immigrants, now around the 10 million mark. For three long years, Joe Biden has refused to secure this location or almost any other location along our southern border. We're now, as I said, approaching 10 million illegal unvetted Biden immigrants pouring into Texas. And then, of course, being distributed. Free transportation by Joe Biden, more than the entire population of Dallas now going to city and states that, frankly, have no idea what to do with these people. And few, by the way, have undergone any, certainly not proper security vetting, no health screening, all requiring your public assistance dollars.
ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS ‘RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE’ FROM MIGRANT ‘INVASION’ AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN
This is a crisis that impacts and affects every single corner of the country, but it's the most severe in border states. So, Governor Greg Abbott, well, they're not going to enforce the law. He had to take matters into his own hands, as he should. And he declared a disaster, which it is. He deployed state police, the National Guard, to secure the Texas border. He booted the feds out of Shelby Park in Eagle Pass. They weren't doing their job. He ordered the installation of new barriers and razor wire to deter illegal crossings. So how did the Biden administration thank Texas for their effort to do their job for them and secure the border? They sued Texas.
Now, this is the same Joe Biden, you know, Vladimir Putin can shoot down our drones no consequences. Invade Ukraine, eh, not a lot of consequences. President Xi's spy balloons, unfair trade practices, intellectual property theft, confronting our Air Force in international airways, our Navy in international waterways. The mullahs in Iran walk all over Joe. What does he do? Nothing. All of a sudden now, your president wants to act tough because he's dealing with the state of Texas, because the governor is doing Joe's job? That the governor is upholding the law? That Governor Abbott is trying to secure the border in his state and enforce the laws of our country to keep not only his citizens safe, but all of us? And Biden's suing the state over a new law enabling local law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants in this country? And he even sued Texas over the installation of razor wire at the border in what was that insane 5-4 decision. The US Supreme Court ruled that the federal government can take down the wire.
However, if you look at that ruling, they didn't prohibit Texas from putting it up. So now Abbott has ordered the installation of even more razor wire. And the court, by the way, did not give an opinion on Abbott's decision to boot the federal government out of Shelby Park. So now we're going to have a law enforcement bizarre showdown, which is now underway between Abbott and Texas. They want to enforce the law, secure the border versus Biden and the federal government, the ones that have encouraged lawlessness and asylum abuse. The very people that have been aiding and abetting those people, breaking the law, allowing unvetted people from all over the world into our country. And Abbott, by the way, is not standing alone.

Governor Sarah Sanders, Arkansas, ""If President Biden won't defend us, states will have to defend themselves."" Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, ""The Biden administration's policy has been a total failure. We need change now. I support Texas and support Governor Abbott.""

A Michigan family shopping at Walmart had their Amish horse and buggy stolen from the parking lot over the weekend, police said.
The victims exited the retail store around 5:30 p.m. Saturday, when they realized their horse and buggy were gone, the Sturgis Department of Public Safety said.
A truck driver who was parked in the parking lot told authorities that he saw a woman steal the buggy. He gave police a description of her.

Greg Abbott on the ongoing fight with the federal government and says Texas has the right to protect its border
The U.S. Supreme Court just ruled 5-4, to lift a lower court’s injunction preventing Biden administration officials from removing concertina wire the state of Texas erected on the border with Mexico to slow the rush of would-be immigrants. The court has yet to rule on the merits of the case, so in the meantime, the invasion continues.
President Joe Biden’s border crisis started even before he was sworn into office in January 2021, with illegal immigrants rushing the U.S.-Mexico border in anticipation of Biden’s promised lax border enforcement.
And who could blame the would-be migrants? Then-candidate Biden promised to not build ""another foot"" of Trump’s border wall while suggesting that those seeking asylum should ""surge to the border.""
GOP GOVERNORS RALLY BEHIND TEXAS AS ABBOTT DEFIES BIDEN: 'DERELICTION OF DUTY'
As a result, the estimated population of illegal aliens in America has soared from 14.5 million at the end of President Donald Trump’s term of office in 2020 to 16.8 million in 2023. This year, the rate of illegal entries into the U.S. is on pace to hit 3 million with about 1 million of those likely to be released by the Border Patrol — and this doesn’t include an additional 600,000 or so ""got-aways"" who elude the Border Patrol, many of whom are drug runners, criminals and potential terrorists.

By the time Biden completes four years in office, the illegal immigrant population in America will have increased by 4 million, a stunning 28% increase — one in every 85 people in the U.S. will be an illegal immigrant who arrived under Biden’s term.
There is a chance those numbers might be a bit smaller, should Biden agree to the Mexican president’s audacious immigration extortion offer. Knowing that American voters are overwhelmingly displeased with the breakdown on the border and knowing that Biden’s reelection prospects are in jeopardy, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador laid out three demands in exchange for slowing the flow into the U.S.
Those included $20 billion in U.S. aid for corrupt and authoritarian Latin American governments, dropping sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela and the authorization for 10 million migrants from south of the border to work in America.
Should this gambit fall short in boosting Biden to a second term, what happens next?
A Republican president will likely order a strong crackdown on the border, as well as significantly boost deportations of illegal immigrants, including those who falsely claimed asylum. As a result, a significant portion of those who are illegally living in the U.S. will be returned to their countries of origin.
Of the 18.4 million people in the U.S. illegally, just over half originated from Latin America, including Caribbean nations such as Haiti. About 5.4 million of these are non-Mexican illegal immigrants, mostly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and Haiti.
Biden put Vice President Kamala Harris in charge of solving the border crisis. In 2021, Harris described climate change as a prime cause of Central American migration. Since the vice president kicked off the effort to address the ""root cause"" of illegal immigration, illegal immigration has only increased.
But rather than climate change driving immigration, a lack of investment caused by crushing levels of corruption is the most likely culprit for driving people to make the trek north.

Transparency International publishes an annual corruption index. It notes that ""Corruption undermines governments’ ability to protect people and erodes public trust, provoking more and harder to control security threats."" Of the six nations in the Western Hemisphere that send America the most immigrants, illegal and legal, El Salvador ranks 116 of 180 nations for corruption; Mexico, 126th; Guatemala, 150th; Honduras, 157th; Haiti, 171st; and Venezuela, a stunning 177th.
With economic opportunity lacking in these corrupt nations, especially in the poorer Latin American nations, if the 5.4 million non-Mexican Latin Americans are returned home, the full consequences of Biden’s border crisis will be felt in unexpected ways. For instance, Guatemala could see a more than doubling of the nation’s ranks of the unemployed.
By the time Biden completes four years in office, the illegal immigrant population in America will have increased by 4 million, a stunning 28% increase — one in every 85 people in the U.S. will be an illegal immigrant who arrived under Biden’s term.
Without a comprehensive plan, the pending wave of deportations could have a destabilizing effect on the Western Hemisphere — something that China may seek to amplify through the social media platforms they directly control, such as TikTok, as well as other means of delivering propaganda.

As China ramps up its effort to bend the Indo-Pacific to its will, it will seek to have a free hand to intimidate its neighbors. Forcing America to focus on chaos in its own back yard would be a natural component of China’s war plans.
Biden’s border crisis is a direct national security threat.

9HGYH82FVF_1YHJR71NNUT3ZX5,LAURA INGRAHAM: Nikki Haley is veering towards power to the plutocrats,By Fox News Staff Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 6:31am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/laura-ingraham-nikki-haley-veering-towards-power-plutocrats,"Fox News host Laura Ingraham has a message for Nikki Haley ahead of the New Hampshire primary on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’
Fox News host Laura Ingraham breaks down where things stand in the GOP primary race the night before the standoff between former President Trump and Nikki Haley Monday on ""The Ingraham Angle.""
LAURA INGRAHAM: For some reason, [Nikki] Haley thinks that the right way to attract working-class Republicans and independents is to court Wall Street. The Hill is reporting that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, Henry Kravis, Ken Langone and Cliff Asness are reportedly planning a fundraiser for Haley, a big one on January 30th. It's going to be in New York, then. But that's not all, because after that, she'll be hitting Miami and Palm Beach to meet with wealthy donors and also go to California and Texas before the South Carolina primary, where she hopes she's going to meet more donors, according to a source.
Now, Haley's team is bragging about all this, bragging about their $24 million fourth-quarter money haul. And that's a lot of money. But it also got a third-place finish in Iowa for her, and the spending on all that adds [up].Did it really work? It's hardly impressive to me.
She's hoping an additional $4 million ad buy in South Carolina is going to ensure that she's no Jeb Bush. She's not the Jeb Bush of 2024. No way. But in this climate where the winning message is closer to power to the people, she's veering toward power to the plutocrats. It's not smart at all for either the billionaires or Governor Haley. They might as well light their money on fire at this point. Throw it off the top of the tallest building they can find, or send it to their favorite cause. I don't know, I'm trying to be creative here. Ukraine. Send it right to Zelenskyy.
HALEY REVEALS PITCH TO DESANTIS VOTERS, PLEDGES SHE'LL ‘ABSOLUTELY’ MOVE ON TO SOUTH CAROLINA AFTER NH PRIMARY
Haley is finished, and prolonging the obvious is just ensuring that she has no political future. It's not really going to hurt Trump at this point. Well, maybe she has a political future if you think Liz Cheney has a bright political future.
Now, Trump didn't win because DeSantis ran a weak campaign. A lot of people are dumping on DeSantis. Trump won because the Republican base was never going to abandon him once the Biden administration decided to use the Justice Department against him. I mean, conservatives understand properly that we can never let the Democrats pick our nominee. Never. And we know that if they succeed in weaponizing the DOJ against President Trump, they're going to use the same tactics against anyone who ever really threatens their hold on power. That sort of tyranny cannot stand, and Republicans have wisely pulled together to make sure it doesn't.
Now, under these circumstances, most Republicans were not looking for an alternative in 2024. But let's not forget all those former Republicans who claim that they were appalled by the chaos of President Trump. For almost eight years, they told us that they weren't so concerned with President Trump's policies. Oh, no, they were just upset that he didn't follow the norms, that he was dangerous. Now Governor DeSantis' campaign proved that those people were actually lying, because if they really had been looking for the principled conservative they claim they wanted, they would've rallied to Governor DeSantis. But they didn't because they don't like DeSantis' policies either, or his beliefs. They want open borders. They want the U.S. to be China's equal or even maybe junior partner. And they want social conservatives to stand down. And they want war. Lots and lots of war.

So, as long as it doesn't inconvenience the CCP, that is. That's what they've always wanted. That's what they want now. Everything else they tell you is a lie. They aren't conservatives, and frankly, they're not really patriots, not least the way I think of patriots. They're not principled, and that's why they had little to no interest in supporting DeSantis, because they only support politicians they can control.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is touting a right to ""self-defense"" from a migrant ""invasion"" at the southern border, as the state fights a multi-pronged battle with the Biden administration.
""The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the States,"" a lengthy statement by the Texas Republican says. ""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now. President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""
Abbott is currently fighting multiple legal battles with the administration. The federal government has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, while lawsuits are ongoing over the administration’s cutting of razor wire set up by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.
The Supreme Court this week found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas along the border. Texas this week published images of it strengthening physical barriers along Eagle Pass.

The administration has also sued over a recently signed law that allows Texas state and local officials to arrest illegal immigrants. The administration has accused Texas of interfering with federal control over immigration and border security, and has said it is putting agents and migrants in danger.
Abbott, however, cited constitutional language that demands the federal government ""protect each [State] against invasion"" and the right of states to protect their own borders.
Abbott argues that ""the failure of the Biden administration"" to fulfill those duties triggers a clause in Article 1 that ""reserves to this State the right of self-defense."" He notes he has already declared an ""invasion"" to invoke the authority, which he calls ""the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary.""

The arguments from Abbott are unlikely to dissuade the administration, which has cited Supreme Court precedent for federal control over immigration and border authority.
The administration has also claimed it is following immigration law, and has pointed to numbers of removals since May that outpaced the entirety of FY 2019. Instead, it says it needs more funding from Congress and comprehensive immigration reform to fix what it says is a ""broken"" system.
SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH BIDEN IN TEXAS BORDER WIRE CASE; BORDER PATROL UNION BLASTS THE DECISION
""Whether it is leaving migrants on the side of the road in the dead of winter, installing razor wire to make Border Patrol’s job more dangerous, promoting extreme and unconstitutional laws like S.B. 4, or his latest actions in Eagle Pass, Governor Abbott has repeatedly proven that he is not interested in solutions and only seeks to politicize the border,"" a recent White House statement said.

""The President has been clear that we need adequate resources and policy changes, and that our immigration system is broken. That is why on his first day in office he presented Congress with a comprehensive immigration reform plan, and that is why he is working to find a bipartisan agreement with Congress that includes funding and meaningful reforms,"" it added.

The NYPD is cracking down on unlicensed mopeds being driven around New York City by illegal migrants.
The police department posted on X Monday that it had confiscated 80 such vehicles that had been parked outside the Roosevelt and Watson Hotels in Manhattan. The two hotels have been converted into migrant shelters and are known to have lines of mopeds parked outside.
New Yorkers have long complained about the illegal migrants using the mopeds to zip around the city, with many migrants flouting the rules of the road by driving the opposite way down streets, along sidewalks and on bicycle lanes.

Many migrants use mopeds to make deliveries for food app companies since they cannot find other jobs without work permits.
However, the vast majority seen outside the hotel shelters are unregistered with no license plates. Under New York law, all mopeds must be registered and insured, but unlicensed mopeds cannot be insured. Additionally, drivers are required to wear helmets.
""Your complaints have been heard about the blight of illegal mopeds parked in front of the Roosevelt Hotel and Watson Hotel in Manhattan,"" the NYPD wrote on one of its pages on X.
""We teamed up with officers from @NYPDMTS (NYPD Midtown South) and @NYPDMTN NYPD Midtown North, along with @NYCSanitation (New York City Dept. of Sanitation) and removed 80 vehicles, helping to address the issue.""

""Because we’re immigrants, we don’t have many options,"" one migrant told Fox 5 after a similar sweep in September. ""One of the easiest options is to grab a motorcycle and apply on Uber.""
Food delivery work does not require a license, according to Fox 5.
However, New Yorkers say the bikes also spoil the neighborhood, with one Upper West Side resident describing them as a ""canker sore"" to Fox 5.
One Venezuelan migrant told the Daily Mail that he and other men living in the Roosevelt Hotel are making as much as $1,500 every two weeks by delivering food and other items. Many delivery apps require drivers to submit a license before being able to pick up deliveries, but the men told the publication they get around that by using apps designed for bicycle deliveries.

New York is currently housing around 69,000 illegal migrants, with more than 160,000 migrants arriving into the city since the middle of 2022, some of whom have been bused in by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Last week, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed providing $2.4 billion of taxpayer money to New York City to handle the crisis. New York City Mayor Eric Adams says the crisis will cost the Big Apple at least $12 billion by the end of FY 2025.
In September, the Biden administration fast tracked work authorization and deportation protection for some 470,000 Venezuelan migrants.

A man wanted for a firearms violation in Pennsylvania was arrested in Georgia on Tuesday after firing a dozen gunshots at a driver following a minor traffic collision.
The Chamblee Police Department released footage of the incident on Thursday after obtaining doorbell video from a home near the intersection of Shallowford Road and Dresden Drive, where the incident took place last weekend.
In the video, an SUV can be seen quickly approaching a smaller car stopped at a red light before the driver slammed on the brakes in an attempt to not rear-end the car. The SUV ultimately hit it at a low rate of speed, prompting the driver of the smaller car – later identified by police as Alex Bane – to get out and approach the other driver.

As Bane walks toward the SUV, its driver begins to back up quickly while he can be heard yelling ""don't pull off"" multiple times.
Though he walks out of the video frame, audio captures 12 gunshots being fired toward the SUV, Chamblee police said. The driver was not injured, but the vehicle was hit a few times, according to FOX 5 Atlanta.
Bane then gets back in his car and speeds off.

9U80ORG4YR_FT12W8ML0SYOT49,Georgia Senate Republicans consider special panel to investigate Fani Willis misconduct allegations,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 11:12am EST",20240116,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-senate-republicans-consider-special-panel-investigate-fani-willis-misconduct-allegations,"Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins ‘America Reports’ to discuss the misconduct allegations against the district attorney in former President Trump’s Georgia case.
George Senate Republicans are vying to create a special panel to investigate misconduct allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
State Sen. Greg Dolezal, a Republican representing Cumming, introduced legislation Monday to establish the Senate Special Committee on Investigations in response to a series of public reports, court filings and allegations of misconduct involving Willis, whose office is prosecuting the 2020 election interference case against former President Trump and 18 of his allies.
Willis was accused in a motion filed earlier this month by attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman, of engaging in an inappropriate romantic relationship with Fulton County special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, an outside attorney who Willis hired for the Trump case.
""Today, in response to a wave of concerning reports and court filings regarding District Attorney Fani Willis of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit, I am calling for the establishment of the Senate Special Committee on Investigations. The multitude of accusations surrounding Ms. Willis, spanning from allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to questions about the use of public funds and accusations of an unprofessional relationship, underscores the urgency for a thorough and impartial examination,"" Dolezal, chairman of the Senate Committee on Transportation and chief deputy whip, said in a statement. ""We owe it to the public to ensure transparency, accountability and the preservation of the integrity of our justice system.""
The proposed legislation, which states, ""such relationship, if proven to exist, would constitute a clear conflict of interest and a fraud upon the taxpayers of Fulton County and the State of Georgia,"" seeks to establish the Senate Special Committee on Investigations, comprising nine members, with three representatives from the minority party. The committee will be assigned to conduct a legislative investigation and will have the power to administer oaths and to call any party to testify under oath at such investigations, among other responsibilities.
JUDGE UNSEALS FULTON COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S DIVORCE CASE, FANI WILLIS DEPOSITION DELAYED

The resolution would have to win approval in the Republican-majority state Senate before any panel could be appointed.
Also on Monday, the Georgia House of Representatives' Judiciary Non-Civil Committee advanced a bill that would revive a new state commission to discipline and remove state prosecutors – this time removing the requirement of the state Supreme Court's oversight of the commission's rules. State lawmakers had created the Prosecuting Attorneys Qualifications Commission last year to sanction prosecutors, namely accusing Willis of focusing too heavily on the Trump investigation instead of moving criminal cases through initial hearings that could ease overcrowding at the Fulton County Jail. The initial law hit a roadblock in the state Supreme Court over constitutionality concerns.
Merchant alleges that Willis' office paid Wade large sums and that Willis improperly benefited when Wade then paid for the two of them to go on vacations. A filing last week by Wade's wife, Joycelyn Wade, in their divorce case includes credit card records that show that Wade bought plane tickets for Willis to travel with him to Miami, San Francisco and Aruba.
Willis, in another filing in the divorce case, has accused Wade's wife of attempting to obstruct the district attorney's prosecution of Trump and his allies.
JUDGE IN TRUMP PROSECUTOR’S DIVORCE CASE CUTS OFF DA FANI WILLIS LAWYER DURING HEARING: ‘LET ME INTERRUPT YOU’
Willis was expected to give a deposition Tuesday in the divorce case, but during a hearing Monday, Cobb County, Georgia, Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson delayed a decision on whether the district attorney will be required to do so until the court first hears from Nathan Wade during an evidentiary hearing scheduled for Jan. 31. Thompson notably cut off Willis' attorney during the hearing when the lawyer tried to argue the district attorney was too busy with the Trump case to be deposed in the Wade divorce proceedings.
""We have questions. I want to know how he's been spending his money. I have a reason to believe he's spending it on another woman. That's my client's money. And I want to ask questions about that. She's trying to hide under the shield of her position improperly,"" Andrea Hastings, the attorney for Joycelyn Wade, said during the hearing.
Meanwhile, Merchant's motion asks Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to remove Willis and Wade and their offices from any further prosecution of the Trump case.

McAfee has the power to do that. In fact, another judge, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, took that step in July 2022 when he was presiding over the special grand jury investigation that preceded the indictment in the election case. Then-Sen. Burt Jones, one of 16 Georgia Republicans who signed a certificate stating that Trump had won the election and declaring themselves the state's ""duly elected and qualified"" electors, had been told he was a target in the election case.
Jones argued that Willis had a conflict of interest because she had hosted a fundraiser for his Democratic opponent in the lieutenant governor's race. McBurney ruled in Jones' favor, writing that the situation had gone beyond bad optics and had created ""a plain – and actual and untenable – conflict."" He prohibited Willis and her office from prosecuting Jones in the case.

If McAfee decides to take similar action and to remove Willis and her office from the election case, it would be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to find another prosecutor to take the case. That person could continue on the track that Willis has taken, could choose to pursue only some charges or could dismiss the case altogether.
McAfee said he expects to set a hearing on the motion in February.

9UW75FFL5Y_N25C783UQSU0E5U,House Republicans unveil effort to block Biden admin from tearing down key hydro dams,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 11:18am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-unveil-effort-block-biden-admin-tearing-down-key-hydro-dams,"CFACT President Craig Rucker outlines why his group is protesting offshore wind projects while the Biden administration pushes a green energy agenda.
FIRST ON FOX: A group of House Republicans are introducing legislation that would prohibit the federal government from breaching, or tearing down, four hydroelectric dams in Washington state.
The five lawmakers, led by Congressional Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., unveiled the so-called Defending Against Manipulative Negotiators (DAMN) Act on Wednesday morning. The legislation would prohibit federal funds from allowing or studying the breach or alteration of the Lower Snake River dams which environmentalists have targeted, arguing they have led to declining salmon populations in the region.
GOP Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee; Cliff Bentz, R-Ore.; Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore.; and Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, joined Newhouse in introducing the legislation. The action comes a month after the White House entered into a legal settlement with environmental groups and tribes to study breaching, potentially paving the way for future breaching.
""The Biden Administration has crossed the line with its blatant, hypocritical assault on the Lower Snake River Dams,"" Newhouse told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. ""This Administration, since its campaign, claims to advocate for green energy solutions, yet disregards that notion when told to by manipulative environmental activists who do not understand how critical the dams are to the Pacific Northwest and a clean energy future.""

""The Defending Against Manipulative Negotiators Act is the first of many pieces of legislation coming that combats this Administration’s radical, unfair, and unsubstantiated effort to destroy our dams and the livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on them,"" the Washington Republican added.
Under last month's agreement, the White House Council on Environmental Quality announced the tribes and environmental groups which had sued the federal government in an effort to forcibly breach the dams agreed to stay their litigation through 2028. The agreement further includes $1 billion for wild fish restoration and a plan to develop new clean energy power operated by tribes.

The White House said the investments agreed to would ensure continued energy reliability, transportation and other services currently guaranteed by the continued operation of the four dams ""in the event"" that the dams are breached. Officials stopped short of committing to a breach plan as demanded by plaintiffs in the case and said that decision would require congressional approval.
Still, industry groups that represent companies reliant on the dams, have expressed deep concern with the Biden administration's legal settlement which was negotiated behind closed doors.
President Biden previously pledged to work with proponents of breaching the four lower Snake River dams to ""bring healthy and abundant salmon runs back."" (Getty Images)
""The four lower Snake River dams are critically important to the economy of the Tri-Cities and the entire Pacific Northwest region,"" Karl Dye, the president and CEO of the Tri-City Development Council, said Wednesday. ""Their importance was underscored earlier this month when the Bonneville Power Administration reported record high electricity demand, which could not have been met without the power produced by these dams.""
""Congressman Newhouse has always been a champion of the Snake River dams, and we sincerely thank him for his continued support.""
The dams were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers primarily to ensure the Snake River — which winds through Idaho and Washington before feeding into the Columbia River and Pacific Ocean — was passable for barge transportation.
MAJOR US POWER SOURCE FACING EXTINCTION THANKS TO RED TAPE, SPARKING CALLS FOR REFORM
However, since then, the main benefit has been their reliable clean energy output. They still provide about 8% of the state's electricity, enough to serve millions of residents, and have a large total capacity of 3,000 megawatts.
Removing the dams would likely chip away at U.S. climate goals since their energy production would likely need to be replaced by fossil fuel alternatives. According to federal data, replacing hydropower generated by the dams with natural gas generation would increase carbon emissions by up to 2.6 million metric tons per year, the equivalent of 421,000 passenger cars.

In addition to the impacts on energy and climate ambitions, removing the four Snake River dams would harm agriculture exports. Aided by the dams, barges traveling along the Columbia River system carry about 60% of Washington's annual wheat exports and a staggering 40% of the nation's total wheat production.
WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED TO GRANT 'QUASI-REGULATORY AUTHORITY' TO FOREIGN GREEN GROUPS
""The Washington Association of Wheat Growers (WAWG) applauds the introduction of the Defending Against Manipulative Negotiators Act by Rep. Dan Newhouse,"" WAWG said in a statement. ""The Lower Snake River Dams are vital to the livelihood of Washington’s wheat farmers.""
""Any alteration or breaching of these dams would negatively impact our ability to transport wheat, thus causing adverse impacts to local businesses, including family-owned farms, and the broader regional economy,"" the group added.
Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory said the agreement last month represented the first time the federal government had put ""all hands on deck to support regional and Tribal efforts to restore wild salmon in the region."" (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Green New Deal Network)
The Washington State Potato Commission, Washington State Dairy Federation and National Grain and Feed Association also added statements of support for the DAMN Act on Wednesday.
""The stakes are concernedly high, as the economic harm of breaching the dams would ripple throughout the U.S. agricultural value chain by effectively shutting down a critical export corridor for grains and oilseeds,"" the National Grain and Feed Association said.
""Removal of the LSR locks could bankrupt thousands of producers as they attempt to change their freight distribution network from efficient river barges to far more costly – and environmentally damaging – long-haul truck or rail service.""

The legislation introduced Wednesday would also prevent the federal government from implementing the Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative, a proposal from tribes, environmental groups and the states of Oregon and Washington, which calls for a more explicit plan to remove the dams.
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Monday a legislative initiative to grant dual citizenship to the nation's diaspora for the first time.
The president made the remarks in a video address marking Unity Day, the state holiday marking the 1919 unification of Ukraine.

""It will allow all ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from around the world to have our citizenship. Of course, except for citizens of the aggressor country,"" he continued.
Zelenskyy noted the widespread diaspora of ethnic Ukrainians in all corners of the globe, honoring contributions to the defensive war against invading Russian forces from those who have historically been unable to hold citizenship in the country.
""Today, the unity of Ukrainians spans both hemispheres of the Earth. In every corner of which, on February 24, there were people declaring, 'I am Ukrainian.' Declaring it on all continents were our people live. Those who, with the outbreak of a full-scale war, regardless of their residence, birth, or passport, said in the affirmative, 'I am a Ukrainian.'""

According to Zelenskyy's announcement, the new legislation would allow Ukrainian diaspora to apply for and receive a passport — a direct departure from the nation's past citizenship policies.
""Everyone who has Ukrainian blood in their veins, and a free heart beating in their. Ukrainians by origin, who have long proven that they are Ukrainians in spirit. And after many years of waiting, they should finally become Ukrainians by passport at the legislative level.""
The landmark change in policy would require approval from the nation's parliament and authorization from the Constitutional Court of Ukraine.

Under normal circumstances, the process of amending the national constitution could take years.
It is unknown if Zelenskyy or the federal government intend to expedite the amendment process.

(Credit: Reuters)
Authorities in Denmark are working against the clock to stop a slow-moving landslide of contaminated soil from reaching a nearby water source as public officials and the company that operated the site argue over who should pay for the massive cleanup.
The 250-foot-tall heap of dirt at the Nordic Waste reprocessing plant south of the town of Randers in northwestern Denmark contains some 100 million cubic feet of soil contaminated with heavy metals and oil products. It is moving at a pace of up to 16 inches per hour toward a stream connected to the Baltic Sea via the Randers Fjord.
The landslide started Dec. 10. Nine days later, Nordic Waste gave up on getting it under control, leaving the task up to the Randers Municipality, which has been rerouting the stream by laying pipes allowing it to pass the site safely.

Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said Friday that authorities are working on extending those pipes and that a sheet pile wall is being constructed, along with several basins for the contaminated water.

Water from rain and melting snow are the biggest problems, Heunicke said. In the past week, western Denmark has seen huge amounts of snow and rain.
""It’s about separating the polluted water from the clean water,"" he told a news conference, adding that the work is ""enormously difficult.""
On Monday, a report by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, or GEUS, said the continuous deposit of soil on top of a sloping clay pit at Nordic Waste was the main cause for the landslide. GEUS added that there had been landslides in the region since 2021.
United Shipping and Trading Company, or USTC, which is behind Nordic Waste, earlier blamed the landslide on climatic conditions beyond its control. The area ""has been exposed to enormous amounts of rain, as 2023 has been the wettest year ever in Denmark. This has resulted in a natural disaster of a caliber never before seen in Denmark,"" it said.
CONTAMINATED BEACH WATER COULD MAKE SWIMMERS SICK, WARNS NEW POLLUTION REPORT: ‘SEVERAL TROUBLING TRENDS’
It is still unclear who will have to pay for the cleanup. Nordic Waste was declared bankrupt earlier this week after the Danish Environmental Protection Agency ordered it to provide security of more than $29.2 million to prevent an environmental disaster.
Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who visited the site Monday, said it would be unfair if Danish taxpayers had to pay.
Nina Østergaard Borris, Nordic Waste's CEO, said it would take up five years to restore the site, and it could potentially cost billions of kroner. She said the situation ""is far more serious than anyone could have imagined, and the task of saving the area is far greater than what Nordic Waste or USTC can handle.""
The case has started a debate about whether Nordic Waste has a moral responsibility to pay. The government has lashed out at Denmark’s sixth-richest man, Torben Østergaard-Nielsen, who is behind USTC, for not paying."

ACCE3CF3S0_27AI60NQ3JGKD6P,Memphis police chief under fire as crime rates reach records,By Claudia Kelly-Bazan Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 1:58pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/memphis-police-chief-under-fire-crime-rates-reach-records,"Fox News’ Jonathan Serrie reports on calls to oust the city’s top cop.
A Tennessee community is split on whether to oust its police chief.
Memphis City Council decided to table a vote on whether to reappoint the police chief amid record-breaking homicide rates and distrust in the city, in the wake of Tyre Nichols' death and a DOJ investigation into the police department.
Instead of a vote, the city council and newly elected mayor agreed to make CJ Davis the interim police chief to see what she could accomplish before determining her fate in a more permanent position.
City Council Chairman JB Smiley Jr. said he planned to pay close attention to whether Davis could repair relationships not only with the community, but also with rank-and-file police officers. In an interview with Fox News, he said, ""There is no such thing as success for Chief Davis without mending those relationships.""
Tuesday night's canceled vote came two weeks after a city council committee voted 6-7 against Davis' reappointment. The narrow vote reflected divisions within the community over her ability to lead amid soaring crime rates in Memphis.
MEMPHIS FATHER INFURIATED OVER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL'S ‘AFTER SCHOOL SATAN CLUB': THEY ‘INVITED THE DEVIL IN’
In 2023, the city recorded a record-breaking 398 homicides. In the 24 days so far in 2024, the city already has recorded 14 homicides, according to police data.

""Right now, we have a very fractured police department, and we have to do something to bridge the gaps that need to be bridged, but also build public trust,"" Smiley told Fox News. He went on to say, ""We have serious issues in the city of Memphis and we need a police chief who understands those issues, can speak to the people, and put policies and plans in place that will ultimately deter crime.""
DOJ LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO MEMPHIS LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLLOWING DEATH OF TYRE NICHOLS
Mayor Paul Young was sworn into office this month and has openly expressed his support for Davis. The previous mayor also expressed support.

During Tuesday's contentious city council meeting, a steep divide between city officials and community members was revealed. As Young said in a brief speech, ""We all agree that where we are right now is untenable,"" a community member shouted, ""398 homicides.""
A back-and-forth between the two led the mayor, a Democrat, to defend Davis by saying, ""I want all of us to understand it's not on her. It's on everybody.""
Young elaborated by speaking about a need to focus on preventing crime before it happens. ""Public safety is not just law enforcement, public safety, it's all the components. The police can only respond to the crime. We need to be intervening,"" he pleaded.
TYRE NICHOLS DEATH: LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
Smiley agreed to an extent when he said, ""We all understand that crime considers a myriad of things: socioeconomic status, you know, poverty, all of those things. But also, we have to acknowledge that police play a role in reducing crime.""
The city of Memphis was thrust into the national spotlight when five ex-officers were seen on video beating Tyre Nichols in January 2023. He died three days later. Since then, the ex-officers have been facing federal and state charges. One of them has taken a plea deal in the federal case.
FORMER MEMPHIS POLICE OFFICER IN TYRE NICHOLS CASE AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT
In yet another sign of the serious issues facing the police force in Memphis, the DOJ announced a pattern or practice investigation into the department in the summer of 2023.
So, what's the solution?
Smiley made clear that putting Davis in an interim position was not a second chance. He said it was simply the city council giving the mayor an opportunity, before a vote, to put his nominee forth and allow the nominee to serve and see what develops.
He emphasized, ""This is not kicking the can. I just believe that when [the city council] moves, we need to move as a body. What this 7-6 vote tells me is, we have not made up our mind.""
He predicted that in the next city council vote, eight or more members would align one way or the other.

Davis spoke at the city council meeting very briefly and said, ""My heart is here. My heart is with our officers in the Memphis Police Department and the community that we serve every day. I look forward to making progress in the city of Memphis.""
The chairman explained that in addition to distrust in the community, police morale has been low, the number of officers is steadily declining, and the city has not been recruiting or retaining officers. ""We just have a lot of work to do with the police and the city of Memphis,"" he admitted.

ACJ0LEKLI9_MKJU7MD69RP1L5W,Katie Couric tells Vice President Harris she's 'not in charge of the border',By Hanna Panreck Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 12:58pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/katie-couric-tells-vice-president-harris-shes-not-in-charge-border,"Vice President Harris sat down with Katie Couric for an interview published on Wednesday and Couric asked the vice president to address criticisms of the administration's handling of the border, despite not being ‘in charge’ of it.
Katie Couric sat down for an interview with Vice President Harris on Wednesday and told her that she is ""not in charge"" of the southern border.
""I want to talk to you about immigration, because I think nearly everyone agrees that the system is broken, and that we need comprehensive immigration reform. Early on, I know you were tasked with understanding the root causes of the immigration crisis, but you’re not in charge of the border, which I think is important to point out,"" Couric began.
Couric asked Harris about how she would address criticisms of the administration on the border crisis, adding, ""Sixty-eight percent of Americans disapprove of the way the Biden administration has handled the border.""
""There’s no question our immigration system is broken and it needs to be fixed. And as with any problem, leaders will participate — true leaders — in the solution. So I’m going take you back to about three years ago, I think the day after our inauguration, when Joe Biden came in as president and me as vice president. The first bill that we offered was a bill to fix the immigration system,"" Harris responded.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFIDENT AHEAD OF POTENTIAL TRUMP 2024 REMATCH: ‘WE’RE WINNING' NO MATTER WHO GOP NOMINEE IS
Couric noted that Democrats controlled both the Senate and the House at the time.
""This is, first of all, not a new issue. But sadly, it has become so deeply partisan and the subject of political gamesmanship, when in fact the solutions are at hand. And we offered a solution early on and invited bipartisan work to fix this,"" the vice president said, adding that the Biden administration proposed a $14 billion funding request that would aid its efforts in combating the ongoing crisis at the border.
Harris claimed the GOP wanted something to run on in November and said, ""We want to fix it and they want to run on it.""
Couric, who seemed to agree, said it was ""working.""

HIGH MIGRANT NUMBERS BREAK MULTIPLE RECORDS IN NEW BLOW TO BIDEN BORDER STRATEGY
Harris, who has made several recent media appearances, told Couric that she didn't think it was working.
""The situation is such that the system is broken and it needs to be fixed. And we have offered a solution and real leaders ought to lead on this, meaning not play politics with it, but work with us to fix the problem,"" she continued.
Harris declared the border was ""secure"" during an interview with former ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd in 2022.
""We're going to have two million people cross this border for the first time ever. You're confident this border's secure?"" Todd pushed back.
""We have a secure border in that that is a priority for any nation, including ours and our administration,"" Harris replied. ""But there are still a lot of problems that we are trying to fix, given the deterioration that happened over the last four years.""

White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, when pressed Tuesday about getting the go-ahead from the Supreme Court to take down razor wire that Texas had erected along the U.S.-Mexico border, argued that federal agents need ""access"" to process migrants.
During the daily press briefing, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy challenged Kirby, ""Why are you guys making it easier for people to enter the country illegally?""
""I don't believe we are. Why do you think we are?"" Kirby responded. Doocy explained, ""Well, you guys sued to cut razor wire that was put in place by Texas officials.""
Interjecting, Kirby said, ""So that the Border Patrol could actually do their jobs, but keep going.""
The exhange comes in reference to the divided Supreme Court on Monday allowing, for now, Border Patrol agents to resume cutting razor wire that Texas installed along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border that is at the center of an escalating standoff between the Biden administration and the state over immigration enforcement.
The 5-4 vote clears the way for Border Patrol agents to cut or clear out concertina wire that Texas has put along the banks of the Rio Grande to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally. The Justice Department argues that some migrants have been injured by the sharp wire and has argued the barrier impedes the U.S. government's ability to patrol the border, including coming to the aid of migrants in need of help. None of the justices provided any explanation for their vote in the one-page order, while the lawsuit over the wire continues.
SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH BIDEN IN TEXAS BORDER RAZOR WIRE CASE; BORDER PATROL UNION BLASTS DECISION
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had authorized the wire, one of a series of measures the three-term Republican has taken on the border in the name of curbing illegal crossings from Mexico. His spokesman said the absence of razor wire and other deterrents encourages migrants to risk unsafe crossings and makes the job of Texas border personnel more difficult.

""Well, you won in court. So now what? The Border Patrol union president is saying the Supreme Court's decision is going to undoubtedly more illegal immigration. Do you guys know better than the Border Patrol union?"" Doocy challenged Kirby on Tuesday.
""The Border Patrol needed access, and that's why we sued to get rid of that razor wire so that they could do their jobs,"" Kirby countered. ""And you know what would also help them do their jobs, Peter? More Border Patrol agents. There's an idea. And if you go back to the supplemental request that we put in, there's money in there for some 1,300 additional Border Patrol agents. We want to help them do their jobs. We want to give them more resources. And the answer we keep getting back from House Republicans is no, no, no.""
Asked if razor wire works to deter border crossings, Kirby retorted, ""Does razor wire work for what? Does it work for the Border Patrol to allow them to have the access they need to be able to better process people that are trying to get across the border? I don't think so. And that's why we asked for it to be removed.""
Doocy referred to how, just last month, U.S. border officials detected a record high of some 300,000 migrants stopped from entering the country illegally. Kirby responded by referring to Biden's supplemental package, as well as offering praise to the Mexican government.

""Please, look at the stuff we've put forward. The immigration reform legislation that the president put forward on day one, the work we're doing in the region. Just last week, we had Mexican officials here to talk about how together we have and will continue to try to stem the flow of migrants,"" Kirby said. ""You mentioned the numbers. No question. There's a lot of people trying to make that journey. But it's not just to the United States, it's to other countries in the world. In the region, we're seeing historic movement now, not since World War II have we seen this many people on the move in this hemisphere. And the Mexicans are really stepping up and trying to do more, more on their southern border to keep that flow going north lower.""
TEXAS AUTHORITIES DOUBLE DOWN WITH RAZOR WIRE IN EAGLE PASS AFTER BIDEN ADMIN 'CEASE AND DESIST' ORDER: VIDEO
""And we have seen in recent weeks some success at that,"" Kirby continued. ""The idea that we don't have a plan or strategy or not taking this seriously is just not borne out by the facts. And, you know, again… if the folks in the House Republicans are serious about border security and they claim they are, then they should act on the supplemental request. And, you know, let's negotiate this in good faith. The president has said he's willing to make compromises. He's willing to negotiate in good faith…. So let's have that discussion.""
The concertina wire stretches for roughly 30 miles near the border city of Eagle Pass, where earlier this month the Texas Military Department seized control of a city-owned park and began denying access to Border Patrol agents. Eagle Park has become one of the busiest spots on the southern border for migrants illegally crossing from Mexico.

Abbott has said Texas won’t allow Border Patrol agents into Shelby Park anymore, having expressed frustration over what he says are migrants illegally entering through Eagle Pass and then federal agents loading them onto buses. Abbott also has authorized installing floating barriers in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and allowed troopers to arrest and jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges. The administration also is challenging those actions in federal court.
In court papers, the Biden administration said the wire impedes Border Patrol agents from reaching migrants as they cross the river and that, in any case, federal immigration law trumps Texas’ own efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the country.

Texas officials have argued that federal agents cut the wire to help groups crossing illegally through the river before taking them in for processing.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor sided with the administration. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas voted with Texas.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's surprise trip to Jamaica this week sparked controversy in more ways than one.
The couple made a rare public appearance and walked the red carpet at the premiere of Paramount Pictures' new film, ""Bob Marley: One Love,"" where they were pictured with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness.
Holness previously expressed ""unresolved"" issues between his country and the monarchy when Prince William and Princess Kate visited Jamaica in 2022. Royal expert Kinsey Schofield, host of the ""To Di for Daily"" podcast, exclusively told Fox News Digital that Harry and Meghan's visit to Jamaica was anything but a redemption song.

The prime minister told Prince William and Princess Kate during a visit in 2022 that Jamaica intends to become fully independent. ""We are moving on,"" he said. ""We intend to ... fulfill our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country.""
PRINCE HARRY'S HONOR AT JOHN TRAVOLTA EVENT LABELED 'BIZARRE' BY EXPERTS
The former British colony would become only the second Caribbean island to cut off relations from the monarchy in recent years, with Barbados severing ties in November 2021. Britain ruled Jamaica for more than 300 years, most notably during the 18th century when the British government was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. While Jamaica gained independence in August 1962, it still remained with the British Commonwealth.

""I understand and agree with the criticism of the pair being photographed with anti-monarchy PM Andrew Holness, but in their defense, I think their real objective is making moves in Hollywood,"" Schofield said. ""I feel like they are wholly self-consumed. Completely oblivious.""
Schofield added that the Sussexes are ""clearly not worried about what it looks like"" to attend a red carpet event ""while the Princess of Wales and king are dealing with medical emergencies.""

""Sometimes I think they are given too much credit as diabolical when there have been repeated errors in judgment that point to two individuals that rarely assess the consequences of their actions.""
Last week, Kensington Palace announced that Princess Kate, who turned 42 this month, underwent a ""planned abdominal surgery"" at The London Clinic. The Princess of Wales also postponed all public duties until after Easter in April.

""The royal family can’t have been pleased to see Harry and Meghan cozying up to Andrew Holness, Jamaica’s prime minister and avid supporter of independence from the commonwealth,"" British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.
""It won’t have gone unnoticed that at this highly sensitive time for the royal family, with King Charles III about to undergo surgery and Kate recuperating. Harry and Meghan aren’t exactly being loyal by hobnobbing with anti-monarchists.""
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who stepped down from senior royal responsibilities in 2020, returned to the island together for the first time in seven years.

They had previously frolicked around Montego Bay in 2017 while attending his best friend, Tom Inskip's, wedding. One year later, Meghan and Harry married in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.
Markle has a small place in her heart for the tropical island. In 2011, she said ""I do"" to her first husband, Trevor Engelson, during a four-day destination wedding at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios.
Despite dating for nearly a decade, the former couple separated after two years of marriage and were granted a no-fault divorce in February 2014.
Royal biographer Andrew Morton alleged that Markle ghosted him and sent her rings back by registered mail. Other reports said the two grew apart as the former actress rose to fame, thanks to her role on ""Suits.""

AJ2FYW1ZCK_CPZGV2CVUC1AZ6V,"Space warfare: US, China, and Russia are gearing up for the next frontier of armed conflict",By Rebekah Koffler Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 8:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/space-warfare-us-china-and-russia-are-gearing-up-for-the-next-frontier-of-armed-conflict,"Arthel Neville welcomes former U.S. Defense Intelligence Officer Rebekah Koffler to discuss the massive global cyberattack that had impacted several federal agencies.
The next big war may be fought in space.
As the Pentagon is gearing up for a future celestial conflict, so are our chief adversaries, China and Russia. Here’s why ""Star Wars"" is no longer merely a topic of science fiction. The best way to avoid space warfare is to be ready for it.
On Dec. 28, Elon Musk’s Space X launched into space the Pentagon’s highly secretive X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, an unmanned reusable robotic spacecraft operated by the Air Force, in collaboration with Space Force. Most details about the Boeing X-37B’s payload and missions are top secret, and even its orbital regime is classified.
Former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson revealed in 2019, however, that X-37B can change its orbit ""when it’s close enough to the atmosphere."" She boasted that the spacecraft can catch our adversaries off guard because the maneuver takes place ""on the far side of the Earth from our adversaries,"" so they don’t know ""where it's going to come up next"" and ""that drives them nuts.""
During my service in the Defense Intelligence Agency, I specialized in foreign space doctrines and operations and participated in war games simulating a conflict in space. I can attest that China and Russia consider the X-37B a counter-space weapons platform and are obsessed with trying to gain insights into its capabilities. Both have space warfare programs, targeting their main perceived enemy, the United States of America.

It is no coincidence that two weeks prior to the X-37B’s launch, on Dec. 14, China sent up to the skies an enigmatic spaceplane of its own, ""Shenlong"" (Divine Dragon.) Four days after being launched, Beijing’s robotic spacecraft deployed six ""mysterious wingmen"" in Earth's orbit, some of which were transmitting signals, according to amateur spacecraft trackers. The U.S. Space Force's Chief of Space Operations, General Chance Saltzman, characterized China’s Shenlong as a ""powerful capability."" He cryptically described it as ""the ability to put something in orbit, do some things, and bring it home and take a look at the results,"" according to Air and Space Forces Magazine.
Russia has been building its space weapons arsenal for almost a quarter of a century. Moscow stood up its Space Forces on June 1, 2001, less than five months after a commission led by the then-Defense Secretary-designate Donald Rumsfeld issued a report which revealed that U.S. satellites were vulnerable to attacks and warned about a space Pearl Harbor in January of that year. Their primary mission has been to target U.S. satellites in a conflict that Russia believes is inevitable, because Moscow and Washington have been vying for control over the post-Soviet states, which Russia considers as part of its sphere of influence and strategic security perimeter.

In the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened Washington with space warfare, albeit subtly. On Nov. 15, 2021, three months prior to the attack on Feb. 24, 2022, as Russia pre-positioned more than 100,000 soldiers, tanks and heavy weaponry, the Russian Space Forces successfully conducted a test, in which a direct-ascent interceptor missile PL19 Nudol destroyed a nearly 40-year-old defunct Soviet spy satellite. This was a strategic message to the Biden administration to stay out of the conflict in what Russia views as its backyard.
TIME FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN TO FOLLOW 'THE GIPPER' AND INVOKE THE REAGAN DOCTRINE AGAINST IRAN
Russia’s robust counter-space arsenal, which includes jammers, lasers, anti-satellite missiles and other satellite killers and its war-fighting doctrine that envisions orchestrating a space Armageddon or nuclear Armageddon scenario in the U.S. homeland, is almost certainly the reason why President Biden announced in the very beginning of Russia’s war on Ukraine that he would not deploy armed forces into the theater to help the Ukrainians fight the Russians.

Chinese and Russian military strategists have observed U.S. war fighters’ tactics in conflict zones for nearly a quarter-century in Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. They learned that America’s superior space capability is also its Achilles’ heel because of the U.S. military’s near-total dependence on it.
Moreover, these adversaries have taken note that Americans are dependent on satellites for many aspects of our civilian lives -- global navigation, water management, power grid monitoring, weather forecasting, broadband access, and telecommunications for applications ranging from banking to education to telemedicine, among other things. Whether you are taking a trip from Washington, D.C., to New York or driving to the nearest 7-Eleven, you are reliant on GPS, a constellation of 31 satellites flown by the U.S. Space Force at an altitude of 12,550 miles.
This reliance makes the GPS and other U.S. space constellations enable missions in combat zones – from reconnaissance, missile warning, command and control, to synchronizing operations, pinpointing targets, and locating personnel – military targets. American space birds present attractive sitting ducks, according to General John Hyten, former head of U.S. Strategic Command which operates U.S. nuclear forces and weapons, who in 2017 called U.S. satellites ""big, fat, juicy targets."" China and Russia, who have designated space as a war-fighting domain, akin to ground, sea and air, have devised plans and tactics to cripple our satellites, in order to ""deafen and blind"" our forces.

Our military evidently is prepared for war on the next frontier, according to Brigadier General Jesse Morehouse at the U.S. Space Command. Morehouse told journalists last May that ""the United States of America is ready to fight tonight in space if we have to.""
The U.S. lags behind Russia and China when it comes to space warfare doctrine and capabilities, having established our Space Forces in 2019, 18 years after the Russians stood up theirs and also likely having been blindsided by China’s 2007 anti-satellite test. However, the X-37B, which probably combines an offensive capability to attack adversarial space birds and to reconstitute our own space constellation if degraded by foreign attacks, is a major technological breakthrough and milestone in our preparedness for war in space.
What Washington's decision-makers must remember, as they devise deterrence strategies to fight or prevent a conflict in space, is this. No offensive capability can deter an adversary unless you can credibly demonstrate your will to use it.

For instance, the United States possesses the capability to wipe out the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have disrupted global shipping traffic by turning the Red Sea into a battlefield. Similarly, with our cyber weapons arsenal, we can plunge Iran into darkness. Yet, President Biden waited months, only to launch pinprick strikes against the ragtag gang that has been humiliating our military and harassing civilian vessels. Consequently, the attacks continue.
As ""Star Wars"" is no longer a hypothetical form of conflict, given our near total reliance on space, Americans must decide whether our country should be led by someone who is gripped by fear of space Armageddon or a commander in chief who instills that kind of fear into our enemies.

An Edenton, North Carolina, man faces the charge of murder after he allegedly killed a woman, whose body was found inside the trunk of a vehicle that was towed off a private lot.
The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (NCSBI) said the body of a woman was found in the trunk of a vehicle owned by Jordan Isaiah Thomas in Beaufort County on Jan. 17.
The victim, the NCSBI said in a release, is believed to be a 19-year-old Elizabeth City State University student. A positive identification is pending from the medical examiner’s office, the NCSBI said, which will also determine the cause of death.
Investigators said the vehicle had been parked in the lot of a private company on U.S. Highway 264 in Washington, North Carolina.

The vehicle was towed to a local facility, where a body was ultimately found in the trunk by a tow truck company employee.
After an investigation, detectives determined Thomas left his vehicle in the private parking lot before stealing a truck from the same location.
The stolen truck was later found at a nearby hospital in Washington, North Carolina, where Thomas was also found and arrested.

NCSBI investigators said that they believe the victim was killed at a different location than where the vehicle was found, as evidence was taken from a residence in Edenton where Thomas had been living. Whether the murder occurred at the Edenton residence or elsewhere remains under investigation.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Former CBS News host Charles Osgood passed away at the age of 91 on Tuesday at his home in New Jersey, CBS News announced.
Osgood hosted ""CBS Sunday Morning"" for over 20 years and hosted a radio program called, ""The Osgood File.""
He spent 45 years at CBS and started as an anchor for the ""CBS Sunday Morning"" show in 1994. Osgood retired at 84 from the network in 2016. At the time, he told viewers it had been a ""great run.""

CHARLES OSGOOD TO LEAVE HOSTIN JOB AT ‘SUNDAY MORNING’ AFTER 22 YEARS
""For years now people — even friends and family — have been asking me why I keep doing this considering my age,"" Osgood said when he retired, according to the media outlet. ""It's just that it's been such a joy doing it! Who wouldn't want to be the one who gets to introduce these terrific storytellers and the producers and writers and others who put this wonderful show together.""
CBS News president Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews said Osgood was one of the ""legendary journalists who made CBS News what it is today.""
""His commitment to the craft, especially to the art of writing, left an indelible impression on the field. He was a mentor and friend to many. His impact will be felt on CBS News for decades to come,"" she added.
He hosted ""The Osgood File,"" for nearly 46 years, in which he would always sign off with the phrase, ""I'll see you on the radio.""

""To say there's no one like Charles Osgood is an understatement, Rand Morrison, CBS's ""Sunday Morning"" executive producer said, according to the outlet. ""He embodied the heart and soul of 'Sunday Morning.' His signature bow tie, his poetry… just his presence was special for the audience, and for those of us who worked with him. At the piano, Charlie put our lives to music. Truly, he was one of a kind – in every sense.""
Jane Pauley, who took over for Osgood as the host of ""Sunday Morning"" in 2016, also remembered the former host and said she tries to capture the ""elusive warmth"" and intelligence of Osgood's voice.
""He was one of the best broadcast stylists and one of the last. His style was so natural and unaffected it communicated his authenticity. He connected with people. Watching him  on TV, or listening on the radio, as I did for years, was to feel like you knew him, and he knew you. He brought a unique sensibility, curiosity and his trademark whimsy to 'Sunday Morning,' and it endures,"" she said.

AKIWM3WY17_FTS181EZIVMY8UZ,US and Iraq to discuss future military presence in coming weeks: Pentagon official,By Liz Friden Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 7:37pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/biden-admin-iraq-discuss-future-us-military-presence-coming-weeks-pentagon-official,"Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot provides details on the major strike on an Iraqi militia leader and the U.S.'s response to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea
Military and defense officials from the U.S. and Iraq are expected to continue talks on the future of U.S. military presence in Iraq in the coming weeks, a U.S. official tells Fox News. The Defense Department is expected to announce the resumed talks later this week, the official said.
The U.S. currently has about 2,500 troops in Iraq for the Defeat ISIS mission. These troops are stationed at several bases throughout the country and have come under more than 60 attacks from Iranian proxy groups in Iraq since October 17. The U.S. has carried out several strikes targeting these Iranian-proxy groups, including airstrikes on Tuesday, targeting two Kataib Hezbollah headquarters buildings and an intelligence facility, according to a U.S. defense official.
US CONDUCTS STRIKES ON IRAQ FACILITIES USED BY IRAN-BACKED MILITIA GROUP, DEFENSE SECRETARY AUSTIN SAYS

The strikes have put pressure on the government of Iraq to question the U.S. presence in the region. On January 4th, the U.S. killed a militia leader in Baghdad who helped carry out several of these attacks on U.S. forces. According to U.S. Central Command, the U.S. drone strike on January 4th targeted and killed Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al Jawari. He was a leader of Iranian-proxy group Harakat al Nujaba and was involved in planning and carrying out attacks against U.S. service members in Iraq.
This specific strike is in part what led the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mohammed Shia’ Al-Sudani to call for the U.S. to withdraw its troops from the country just a day later on January 5th.

""We are in the process of setting a date to begin a dialogue through a tripartite committee that was formed to determine arrangements to end this presence. This is a commitment which the government will not back down from and will not neglect any matter that completes national sovereignty over land, sky, and waters of our dear Iraq,"" Al-Sudani said.
Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters in a Defense Department briefing on January 4th shortly after the militia leader was killed by the U.S. strike, ""Our focus is going to continue to remain on the defeat ISIS mission. But again, we're not going to hesitate to protect our forces if they're threatened.""
IRAQI PRIME MINISTER DEFENDS US TROOP PRESENCE, SAYS IT'S NECESSARY FOR FIGHTING ISIS
The Pentagon has not received any requests to end its presence in the region, despite the words from the Iraqi prime minister, multiple defense officials tell Fox News.

When asked if the U.S. has been asked to withdraw its troops from Iraq, Ryder told reporters, ""I'm not aware of any plans. We continue to remain very focused on the Defeat ISIS mission under CJTF-OIR, as we advise and assist the Iraqis. And as you've heard us say many times before, we're there at the invitation of the government of Iraq.""
The upcoming talks between the U.S. and Iraq were planned in August, well before Hamas invaded Israel and the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq began. The talks could have a different outcome than what would have been expected back in August.

In August 2023, before the conflict in the Middle East started, the U.S. and Iraq agreed to start a ""Higher Military Commission"" or HMC for talks. According to a Defense Department press release from that time, ""The United States and the Republic of Iraq intend to consult on a future process, separate from the JSCD and inclusive of the Coalition, to determine how the Coalition's military mission will evolve on a timeline according to the following factors: the threat from ISIS, operational and environmental requirements, and ISF capability levels.""
The talks will be in the form of a working group with both defense and military officials from the Pentagon, the U.S. official said.

AKJND6G7CD_XU6YBZGSHT3F3FS,Georgia legislators approve bill defining antisemitism in state law,Associated Press,"Published January 26, 2024 9:11am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-legislators-approve-bill-defining-antisemitism-state-law,"Harvard law student Jonathan Frieden weighs in after a professor who previously signed a letter accusing Israel of wanting to ethically cleanse Gaza was picked for the university's antisemitism task force.
Georgia lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that would define antisemitism in state law, with Republicans uniting in support of Israel's war on Hamas and some Democrats splitting over fears of suppressing support for Palestinians.
""Today we can fight a pervasive and escalating threat in our state and fight it together,"" said Senate President Pro Tem John Kennedy, a Macon Republican who guided the bill to Senate passage, 44-6. The measure had stalled in a Senate committee in 2023.
The House later agreed to changes, voting 129-5 for passage. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said he would sign the bill, saying it ""builds on our commitment to protect Georgians from criminal acts, including those based on hate.""
ANTISEMITISM IS GETTING WORSE AS MORE 'SHOCKING' AND 'SCARY' INCIDENTS ARE EXPOSED, DC RESIDENTS SAY
Sponsors say adopting the definition put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance would help prosecutors and other officials identify hate crimes and illegal discrimination targeting Jewish people. Georgia has a hate crimes law that allows higher criminal penalties for crimes motivated by certain types of bias.
The definition, which is only referred to in the bill, describes antisemitism as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.""
Some lawmakers opposed the bill, saying they thought it would be used to censor free speech rights.

""The First Amendment guarantees our rights as citizens to criticize any government, foreign and domestic,"" said Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Lawrenceville Democrat. ""Does our Constitution not mean anything?""
But supporters say the definition will only come into play after someone has committed a crime.
""This legislation is not about stifling free speech,"" Kennedy said. ""Nor is it about the government stopping someone from simply sharing their views. It is about safeguarding the dignity and the safety of our Jewish friends and neighbors.""
In at least eight states nationwide, lawmakers are working on measures to define antisemitism, part of an upsurge of legislation motivated in part by the Israel-Hamas war. Arkansas passed such a law last year. New bills are pending this year in Indiana, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and South Dakota.
The measure grew only more fraught with the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanting ""Free Free Palestine!"" were dragged from a committee room by police Monday, prompting one arrest. That came after some Jewish residents of Georgia testified they had experienced a surge of bias incidents, including an antisemitic group that hung a Jewish person in effigy outside a Macon synagogue over the summer.
ATTEMPT BY GEORGIA ELECTIONS BOARD TO INVESTIGATE SECRETARY OF STATE SPARKS LEGAL DEBATE
Ghada Elnajjar, a Palestinian mother from the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, said she was concerned the bill could embolden those seeking to stifle criticism of Israel.
She was particularly worried about her sons, saying they have been posting social media messages criticizing Israel for civilian deaths in Gaza. The sons have also worn keffiyehs, the black and white checkered scarfs that symbolize Palestinian solidarity.
The bill ""might take a simple thing as wearing a keffiyeh or a social media post and take it a step further and criminalize it and jeopardize my boys’ future,"" she said.
State Rep. John Carson, a Marietta Republican who sponsored the bill, told the House the bill shows ""Georgia stands with our friends in the Jewish community."" Rep. El-Mahdi Holly, a Stockbridge Democrat and one of Georgia's handful of Muslim lawmakers, retorted, ""I wish that was true of Palestinians as well.""
Some opponents said Thursday that they didn't want to choose sides in the Israel-Hamas war.
""We can mourn the loss of both Israeli and Palestinian lives,"" said Sen. Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat. ""We can both condemn the unacceptable acts of antisemitism that are plaguing the Jewish community around our state and acknowledge that our citizens have the right to voice their dissent about the tremendous harm being visited upon Palestinian civilians.""
Some Democrats said that if Georgia moves to define antisemitism, then it should also define what prejudice against Muslims, African Americans or LGBTQ+ people looks like.

""If we’re going to define antisemitism in the law, then there a lot of other groups that experience racism, and they should also have definitions,"" said Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who didn't vote on the bill.
But other Democrats said they wanted to support Jewish constituents and allies, with some recalling the historic support of Jewish people in the struggle for Black civil rights.
""The Jewish community stood hand-in-hand with us,"" said Senate Minority Gloria Butler, a Stone Mountain Democrat. ""Today I return their favor and stand with them."""

FIRST ON FOX: Former President Donald Trump was endorsed by one of the nation's largest Catholic advocacy groups as the New Hampshire primary clock ticks closer to midnight.
Fox News Digital has learned that CatholicVote is throwing its hat behind Trump for president, giving the former president their endorsement.
Additionally, CatholicVote is encouraging approximately 137,000 Catholic voters in New Hampshire to vote for Trump during Tuesday's presidential primary.

CatholicVote president Brian Burch told Fox News Digital that the organization has ""remained neutral"" in the primary up until now, because they thought there were ""a number of viable and compelling candidates in the race.""
""But the number of candidates has dramatically winnowed over the last week, and we are now in a two-person race,"" Burch said. ""And we think at this point it is important that Catholics start to begin to rally around President Trump.""
""Not only would he be a far better choice over Nikki Haley, he is the choice that Americans need in November,"" Burch continued. ""And Catholics… will play a critical role in this election, and the fate of our Catholic way of life is really at stake in this election.""
Burch said the endorsement of Trump isn't ""some big gamble,"" saying that Americans ""watched him"" for four years and touting the former president's record of judicial appointments.
Burch also highlighted the ""kinds of people"" Trump ""surrounded himself with,"" as well as the former president's ""courage.""

""And I think we came to realize that, of all the virtues necessary [to be president], that courage is essential.

But what separated President Trump, I think, from a lot of leaders was his courage to do the right thing, no matter what the consequences might be.""
CatholicVote said it will be emailing and texting approximately 137,000 Catholic voters in New Hampshire to mobilize them behind Trump.
""ALERT: Catholics across New Hampshire are uniting behind Donald Trump! America's largest Catholic advocacy org just announced they have endorsed President Trump because he cares about people like us, and will lead the way once again,"" the text, obtained by Fox News Digital, reads.
""Don't let the media decide this election,"" it continues. ""President Trump needs your vote TODAY!""

Trump's endorsement by the Catholic advocacy group comes as he seeks a rematch with President Biden, who is Catholic. Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on the endorsement.
CatholicVote's endorsement of Trump comes hours before New Hampshire flexes its political muscle as the first-in-the-nation presidential primary election.
The GOP side of the race has whittled down to just two major candidates — Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley — after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign on Sunday.

The parents of a Texas teenage girl who was recently killed in a road-rage shooting in Houston have a message for her murderer.
The Houston Police Department's Homicide Division last week released a new sketch of the man wanted in 17-year-old Louise Jean Wilson's Dec. 10, 2023, shooting death in an effort to try and identify him.
""We're Christian people, and nobody's too far from redemption,"" Louise's father, Daniel Wilson, told Fox News Digital. ""And whoever did this we know isn't a Christian at the moment, but they could always be one.… We want something good to come from her death.""
Louise was shot while driving through Houston on I-45 around 1 a.m. to watch the sunrise with her friends in Galveston.

Houston homicide Detective Caleb Bowling said last month that the 17-year-old — who graduated high school in 2023 and was just a few classes shy of completing her associate's degree —  merged into the right lane and unintentionally cut off the suspect's vehicle. The suspect driver, described as a Black man in his 20s driving a black sedan, allegedly accelerated and ""overtook"" Wilson's vehicle on the driver's side before he began firing.

Louise has been hailed as a hero after she safely pulled off to the side of the road to save her friends' lives after being shot in the chest.
Daniel said people need to understand ""firing a gun into a car"" will ""kill someone.""
""If you think that shooting into a car is just going to scare somebody, it's not.""
""It's so much more serious than that,"" Daniel said. ""I don't know this person's mindset, but what they did to our daughter – shooting into a car, you have to know you're going to kill somebody.""

""This was intentional,"" Krista Wilson, Louise's mother, said.

Daniel said that based on what they know from the Houston PD's investigation, the suspect likely had a gun ready to fire in his car door or somewhere he could easily access it to shoot at other drivers. It's unclear exactly how many people were in the suspect's vehicle.

""Our plea is for anyone in the car to speak up,"" Daniel said. Krista added: ""Whether they were involved or not.""
Daniel is also pleading for Houston lawmakers to make improvements to the city's infrastructure, including cameras that can record on major roadways. The grieving father said during a press conference last week that ""this is not the country"" he and his family members ""fought to defend"" in the military.
""I served in the Army with multiple deployments, and this is what you see in third-world countries.""
Police are looking for any additional witnesses who may have seen the shooting unfold to come forward with more information. A $20,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the shooter's identity and arrest.

A National Rifle Association (NRA)-backed bill in Idaho that would allow public school teachers and staff to arm themselves on school grounds jumped its first legislative hurdle, advancing out of a House committee on Wednesday.
""NRA-backed HB 415 underscores our commitment to children's safety, empowering trained, responsible school employees to carry concealed firearms. This bill reflects our belief in protecting the vulnerable by securing schools,"" NRA Idaho Director Aoibheann Cline told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.
""Additionally, HB 415 ensures the privacy and strategic advantage of these defenders by keeping their permit details confidential and exempt from public records disclosures. It sends a clear message: we are dedicated to school safety and steadfast in defending the Second Amendment.""
Republicans on the House State Affairs Committee voted along party lines Wednesday to advance the bill, which will now head to the House floor.

State Rep. Edward Hill, a Republican, introduced House Bill 415 on Monday, which would allow teachers and other school staff to conceal carry on school grounds, and also protect the identities of those armed from public records requests.
""There’s a desperate need to secure our schools against people who want to harm our children,"" Hill told the Idaho Statesman earlier this month. ""We want to close that gap, those critical 3-5 minutes where all the carnage happens.""
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS AMERICA CONSIDER ARMING TEACHERS IN AFTERMATH OF NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTING
The bill would only allow Idaho school employees with ""enhanced"" concealed weapons permits to carry on school grounds. Enhanced permits are the more in-depth version of the state’s standard concealed carry license, requiring eligible residents 21 and older to complete eight hours of specified firearm training and a background check.

Under the bill, armed staff would have ""immediate control"" of their firearms, meaning the gun would be concealed somewhere on their person, and would have to inform the school’s principal they are carrying a concealed weapon and produce their enhanced concealed carry license.
IOWA SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ALLOW SOME TEACHERS TO CARRY GUNS ON CAMPUS
School leadership, however, would not need to tell the school board which staffers are armed. The school would need to keep a list of staffers armed on campus, along with their photos, to share with law enforcement.
The identities of armed teachers would additionally be exempt from public records and would protect teachers from civil or criminal liability for using their firearms during ""a lethal threat.""
""No school employee shall be held civilly or criminally liable for  deciding to engage or not to engage in an armed confrontation during a lethal threat to safety inside of a school or on school property,"" the bill reads.

Public comment on the bill was held Wednesday ahead of the committee vote, where some critics argued teachers did not request the legislation, and others said the presence of more guns during a violent situation could lead to additional carnage.

""As far as we can see, no educators are actually asking for this,"" Paul Stark, executive director of the Idaho Education Association, told the committee, according to the Idaho Education News reported. ""There has been some testimony this session about not trusting librarians with books, but this trusts librarians with a Glock.""
Cline told Fox News Digital that children deserve the ""strongest shield"" against tragedy, and that the legislation would provide that protection.

Nearly 100 pro-Palestinian protesters strode through the streets of Park City, Utah, chanting the controversial line of ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" on Sunday, according to reports.
Actress Melissa Barrera joined the pro-Palestinian protesters, blocking off main streets in the city, which is host to the annual Sundance Film Festival that brought in media masses to cover the event, Deadline reported.
Protesters encountered the media, as well as an intense police surveillance, as they marched down Park City’s Main Street in the snow.
The pro-Palestinian supporters criticized the Biden administration’s support of Israel in the wake of the Hamas terrorist attack against the Jewish state on Oct. 7, Deadline reported.

Barrera has been outspoken in her support of the Palestinian people, calling for a ceasefire in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas-run Gaza. Barrera was dropped by Spyglass Media from ""Scream VII"" in November over her pro-Palestinian support on social media; she shot down claims that she posted anything antisemitic, such as one post that suggested the media was under Israeli control.
""First and foremost I condemn antisemitism and Islamophobia,"" Barrera said in a statement shared on her social media following the backlash. ""I condemn hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people.""
Barrera told Deadline she was ""not doing any interviews, but you are welcome to take video of me"" at Sunday’s protest and recited with the crowd: ""In our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinians!""
Protesters also carried signs calling President Biden a ""butcher"" while screaming ""Genocide Joe, what do you say? How many kids did you kill today?""

B5HR6ACSKK_TFEL543JHEWW3R9,Court hands Trudeau embarrassing loss over Freedom Convoy crackdown: 'Not justified',By Peter Aitken Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 11:58am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/court-hands-trudeau-embarrassing-loss-freedom-convoy-crackdown-not-justified,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Canadian federal court judge has ruled Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s use of the Emergencies Act to crack down on the famous 2022 Freedom Convoy was ""not justified"" and a violation of rights.
""I have concluded that the decision to issue the proclamation does not bear the hallmarks of reasonableness – justification, transparency and intelligibility – and was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that were required to be taken into consideration,"" Federal Court Judge Richard Mosley said in his decision.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland defended the government’s actions, claiming they had invoked the act as an ""option of the last resort.""
""We acted to secure and protect Canada and to secure and protect the national interests,"" Freeland told reporters following the ruling, adding that ""these were not easy decisions.""
CANADA'S TRUDEAU SAYS SHOTS FIRED AS MONTREAL JEWISH SCHOOLS, CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY BRAWL ARE ‘UNACCEPTABLE’
The government has already announced its plan to appeal the ruling.
""Invoking the Emergencies Act is something that should be done very rarely, if ever,"" Paul Champ, a lawyer representing Ottawa residents and businesses in the class-action lawsuit against the government, told reporters.

""The Freedom Convoy trucks occupying the streets of downtown Ottawa, the way they made the lives of Ottawa residents and businesses and workers miserable – the court clearly conveys that,"" he added.
CANADA WILL LIMIT FOREIGN COLLEGE STUDENTS FOR 2 YEARS TO EASE HOUSING, HEALTHCARE COSTS
The protest in January 2022 initially targeted vaccine mandates enforced against cross-border truckers moving between the U.S. and Canada but soon grew into a broader anti-mandates demonstration.
Truckers and pedestrians occupied the downtown Ottawa area and Parliament Hill, leading to concerns of exacerbating the supply chain crisis plaguing the economy at the time.

Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act – the first use of the act since it passed in 1988 – as a means of allowing a powerful police crackdown on the protests and the forced removal of the vehicles blocking the streets. The act also allowed the Canadian government to freeze the bank accounts of those suspected of orchestrating and participating in the protests.
The act allows a public order emergency but only in response to ""an emergency that arises from threats to the security of Canada that are so serious as to be a national emergency,"" according to CBC. Mosley argued the use of the act did not meet these requirements.
WILDFIRE CONSPIRACY THEORIST WHO BLAMED GOVERNMENT FOR FIRES FOUND GUILTY OF STARTING 14
Mosley’s ruling runs counter a 2023 federal inquiry into the use of the act, which found the government had proven that while the invocation might prove ""drastic,"" it was not ""dictatorial,"" according to the BBC.

""Lawful protest descended into lawlessness, culminating in a national emergency,"" Justice Paul Rouleau, who led the inquiry, said in his report.

Trudeau insisted in November 2022 that he felt ""absolutely, absolutely serene and confident"" he made the right choice invoking the Emergencies Act.
Documents revealed during the inquiry found that U.S. officials had pressured the Canadian government to shut down the protests and remove the blockades so cross-border trade could resume. Freeland, in an email to her staff on Feb. 10, 2022, had stressed that American officials were ""very, very, very worried.""

B5ZWPEY7PP_4F9X8E99WRR37H8,Chaos and violence in South American country fuels massive rise in illegal migration to the US,By Kyra Colah Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 6:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/chaos-violence-south-american-country-fuels-massive-rise-illegal-migration-us,"Armed gunmen infiltrated the studio of TC Television in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Tuesday. Courtesy: Reuters
Escalating violence in a once peaceful Ecuador has sparked concerns of a significant rise in migration to the U.S. As the South American country has been rocked by blasts, prison takeovers and mafia activity, thousands of Ecuadorians feel like they have no option but to seek refuge elsewhere.
In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current uptick of disorder, many Ecuadorians have been fleeing ""the country of four worlds.""
According to the Migration Policy Institute, the most common destination for Ecuadorians is the United States, accounting for 41% of emigrants. The non-partisan think tank notes that the most recent exodus has been catalyzed by an escalation in domestic insecurity.
Tucked away between major cocaine-producing countries, Ecuador has been grappling with an alarming rise in gang activity. The increased presence of Mexican and Colombian cartels has rapidly destabilized the country. The situation escalated when more than a dozen armed men invaded a local television station’s live broadcast earlier this month. As simmering tensions have boiled over, Ecuador’s government has declared an all-out war on more than 20,000 criminals.

In an attempt to crack down on persistent gang disturbances, Ecuador has been in a state of emergency since Jan. 9. The 60-day emergency decree comes as the country is facing what President Daniel Noboa describes as an ""armed internal conflict.""
At the heart of Ecuador’s brimming mayhem is a notorious mob boss who remains elusive. Jose Adolfo Macias, also known as Fito, has been on Ecuador’s most wanted list ever since he escaped from prison over the first weekend of the year. Macias and his Los Choneros gang are considered responsible for a spike in bombings, kidnappings and slayings across the nation.
""The worsening violence in Ecuador in recent years has led to a rapid surge in Ecuadorian migration, and the deteriorating conditions will undoubtedly accelerate that trend,"" Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America program at the Wilson Center, told Fox News Digital.
U.S. Customs and Border Patrol have been grappling with a higher than usual influx of migrants coming from Ecuador over the past several months. In fiscal 2023, the agency encountered a record 117,487 Ecuadorians, marking a staggering 371% increase from 2022. Additionally, there was a 397% rise in the apprehensions of Ecuadorian family units from 2022 to 2023.

The unprecedented unrest not only continues to pose a formidable challenge to the country, but also sparks fears of overwhelming an already saturated southern U.S. border.
Over the past two weeks, authorities have managed to quell some of the chaos that has gripped Ecuador.
PRESIDENT BIDEN ADMITS US SOUTHERN BORDER IS NOT SECURE WHILE DEFENDING HIS POLICIES
Order has been restored to prisons after days of riots along with the successful release of more than 200 police staff and officers. Authorities have seized large amounts of contraband and narcotics from criminal entities.
Widespread security operations have led to roughly 2,000 arrests, including hundreds from 22 gangs designated as terrorist organizations. However, the turmoil continues despite the unequipped and inexperienced government’s best efforts.

This week, senior officials from the Biden administration gathered with President Noboa and other top Ecuadorian government figures. The meeting was arranged to demonstrate U.S. solidarity with Ecuador following a recent escalation in violence.
The United States is extending its support to the Ecuadorian government by pledging $1 million in critical security and emergency response equipment. The U.S. has also announced the deployment of personnel from both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to bolster security operations in Ecuador.

However, the international crisis coincides with a domestic challenge — an ongoing deadlock among U.S. lawmakers regarding border policy. When coupled with the escalating threat in Ecuador, the lack of agreement on the border could augment an already chaotic situation.
As migration north is only expected to grow, experts like Gedan draw attention to the need for a more robust response. Speaking to Fox News Digital, Gedan suggested ""the U.S. should encourage a serious response to Ecuador's security nightmare.""

Former President Donald Trump on Monday said the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, ""would not have existed"" if then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accepted his ""offer"" for security in the days leading up, and that the more than 100 files deleted by Democrats ""exonerated"" him ""completely.""
Trump was reacting to an exclusive Fox News Digital report revealing that the former House Select Committee on Jan. 6, led by Democrats, deleted 117 encrypted files from its probe just days before Republicans took over the majority of the House of Representatives.
HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES
""The whole Committee of Political Operatives, Thugs, and Misfits was a SCAM set up to injure and defeat your Favorite President, Donald J. Trump,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social, reacting to the revelations. ""They’ve deleted and destroyed almost everything, because it exonerated me completely, and was very bad for Crazy Nancy Pelosi and other Fascists and Communists.""

""It showed that Pelosi was in charge of Security at the Capitol, and she rejected my offer of 10,000 Soldiers or National Guard Troops prior to January 6th,"" Trump continued. ""Had she accepted, January 6th would not have existed!""
Trump has claimed since 2021 that days before the Capitol riot, he suggested deploying the National Guard to the Capitol due to intelligence the government was receiving regarding activities on Jan. 6.  Trump has said Pelosi had authority over the Capitol, and he suggested National Guard troops deploy ""three days in advance."" Trump said ""she turned it down.""
""The mayor of D.C. gave us a letter saying that she turns it down. OK, we have it. Nancy Pelosi also was asked, and she turned it down. The police commissioner of Capitol police …"" Trump said in an NBC interview last year. ""Wait, a minute,"" he pressed on, ""Capitol police said that he wanted it, and Nancy Pelosi wouldn't accept it. She’s responsible for Jan. 6.""
""Nancy Pelosi’s responsible, and the Jan. 6 Committee refused to interview her,"" he said.
Pelosi's office replied at the time, saying: ""As our office has said before, the former president’s allegations are completely made up,"" a representative for Pelosi told Fox News Digital.
""As numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed, Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination,"" the spokesperson added.

The House Administration Committee's Oversight Subcommittee is leading an investigation into Jan. 6, 2021, led by Chairman Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga. The panel is investigating the security failures on that day, as well as the ""actions"" of the former select committee investigating the Capitol riot.
Loudermilk last week told Fox News Digital his investigation had entered a ""new phase"" with renewed support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who has committed additional resources to the panel’s investigation.
Sources familiar with Loudermilk’s investigation told Fox News Digital that, per House rules, the former select committee, which was chaired by Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., was required to turn over all documents from its investigation to the new, GOP-led panel, after Republicans secured the majority of the House of Representatives following the 2022 midterm elections.
Sources told Fox News Digital that Thompson had told Loudermilk that the select committee would turn over four terabytes of archived data, but that the new committee only received approximately two terabytes of data.
HOUSE INVESTIGATION INTO 'WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6' ENTERING 'NEW PHASE' WITH SPEAKER JOHNSON SUPPORT
Fox News Digital has learned that Loudermilk’s committee hired a digital forensics team to scrape hard drives to determine what information they were not given.

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a letter Loudermilk sent to Thompson, requesting access to recovered digital files by his forensic team.
The forensics team, according to sources familiar with their search, determined that 117 files were both deleted and encrypted. Sources said those files were deleted on Jan. 1, 2023 – just days before Thompson’s team was required to transfer the data to the new committee.
Fox News Digital has learned the forensics team has recovered all 117 deleted and encrypted files. Now, Loudermilk is demanding answers and passwords to access the data.
""As you acknowledged in your July 7, 2023 letter, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (Select Committee) did not archive all Committee records as required by House Rules,"" Loudermilk wrote. ""You wrote that you sent specific transcribed interviews and depositions to the White House and Department of Homeland Security but did not archive them with the Clerk of the House.""
REP. LOUDERMILK BLASTS JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE FOR TARGETING HIM: 'THERE IS A WAR ON THE TRUTH IN THIS COUNTRY'
Loudermilk added that Thompson also ""claimed that you turned over 4-terabytes of digital files, but the hard drives archived by the Select Committee with the Clerk of the House contain less than 3- terabytes of data.""
Loudermilk explained that after a forensic analysis of the data and archived hard drives, he was able to recover ""numerous digital records from hard drives archived by the Select Committee.""
""One recovered file disclosed the identity of an individual whose testimony was not archived by the Select Committee,"" Loudermilk wrote. ""Further, we found that most of the recovered files are password-protected, preventing us from determining what they contain.""

Loudermilk asked that Thompson provide him ""a list of passwords for all password-protected files created by the Select Committee"" so that his committee can ""access these files and ensure they are properly archived.""
Meanwhile, Loudermilk also penned letters to White House general counsel and the general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, requesting ""unedited and unredacted transcripts"" of White House and DHS testimony to the former select committee.
Loudermilk's committee knows the transcripts of these interviews exist, but said they were not turned over by the Thompson-led committee.
Loudermilk demanded the White House and DHS comply with his request by Jan. 24.
""It’s obvious that Pelosi’s Select Committee went to great lengths to prevent Americans from seeing certain documents produced in their investigation. It also appears that Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney intended to obstruct our Subcommittee by failing to preserve critical information and videos as required by House rules,"" Loudermilk told Fox News Digital.
""The American people deserve to know the full truth, and Speaker Johnson has empowered me to use all tools necessary to recover these documents to get the truth, and I will.""

Johnson endorsed the investigation, telling Fox News Digital that ""the January 6 Committee was a partisan exercise determined to prove a political narrative regardless of the facts.""
""Rather than delivering transparency and focusing on security failures, the Committee obfuscated facts and hid evidence,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""I applaud Chairman Loudermilk and fully support the House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight's efforts to present clarity, not theater, to the American people about exactly what occurred that day.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Dutch court ruled Wednesday that authorities can use paintball guns to shoot at wolves in a popular national park to scare them after at least one of the animals began approaching human visitors.
The decision was a victory for the eastern province of Gelderland, that has sought to frighten the wild wolves using paintball guns. Wolves are protected in the Netherlands and can't be hunted.
A wildlife protection organization that opposes the plan said that it would appeal the ruling.
US NATIONAL PARKS SEE NEW REGULATIONS RESTRICTING TOURIST FLIGHTS
Two centuries after wolves were hunted to extinction in the Netherlands, the animals officially returned to the country in 2019 when a pair of the animals crossed the border from Germany and gave birth to three cubs on Dutch soil.

The European Commission announced last year that it's weighing whether to rein in protective measures for the animals amid farmers' concerns about their livestock.
Experts and environmental groups estimate that up to 19,000 wolves may be present in the 27 EU member countries, with populations of more than 1,000 thought to exist in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain.
The Central Netherlands District Court said in its ruling that one female wolf at the Hoge Veluwe National Park has been seen approaching walkers and cyclists, displaying what it called ""unnatural behavior.""
The park is a popular destination for hikers and bicycle riders and also is home to a world-renowned art gallery, the Kröller-Müller Museum. It also is home to animals including deer, mouflon sheep and wild boars. Those animals have been repeatedly attacked by wolves in recent years.
US NATIONAL PARK MAY SOON HAVE MASSIVE PIECE OF LAND AUCTIONED OFF
The park recently posted footage on Instagram that it said showed a confrontation between two packs of wolves — one inside the fenced-off park and another outside.
An expert who gave evidence to the court on behalf of the province said that the female wolf was ""becoming increasingly bolder,"" the court said in a statement.
""The expert concludes that this unnatural behavior poses a serious threat to public safety. The fact that the wolf seems to be less and less afraid of people does not mean that the animal can no longer become aggressive and bite,"" it added.
It wasn't immediately clear when authorities would begin using paintball guns to target wolves in the park."

A Florida suspect is accused of making a fake bomb threat and then telling authorities that he was inspired by a TikTok trend.
North Port resident Coty J. Clements, 28, was charged with making a false report about planting a bomb or weapon of mass destruction, according FOX 35 Orlando. The offense is a felony.
The Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that its deputies responded to a bomb threat at a Walmart location in Port Charlotte on January 12.
""The caller advised dispatch that there was a bomb inside the Neighborhood Walmart and then hung up the phone,"" the sheriff's office explained. ""When dispatch attempted to call back, the suspect picked up the phone and stated, ‘Tic Toc, Tic Toc’ and hung up again.""

""He also stated that he was able to see via his Bluetooth watch that 911 was attempting to call him,"" the sheriff's office said. ""He was then able to ping the location of his phone to the stall in which he had left it.""
Authorities then reviewed surveillance footage and identified Clements as the suspect.

B9V6D9IUYI_Q397XKNC54YZY0E,First lady Jill Biden invites Texas woman who sought illegal abortion to State of the Union address,By Chris Pandolfo Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 1:41pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-lady-jill-biden-invites-texas-woman-sought-illegal-abortion-state-union-address,"First Lady Jill Biden has invited Kate Cox, a Texas mother who unsuccessfully challenged her state's abortion ban, to be her guest at the State of the Union address in March.
A Texas mother who went to court to obtain an illegal abortion will attend the State of the Union address in March as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.
President Biden and the first lady spoke to Kate Cox on the phone Sunday as Biden seeks to make abortion rights a signature issue of his re-election effort. Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, made national headlines after she asked the Texas Supreme Court for permission to obtain an abortion when her unborn child was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She was denied and later left the state to abort her baby elsewhere.
The Bidens ""thanked [Cox] for her courage in sharing her story and speaking out about the impact of the extreme abortion ban in Texas,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday.
""The first lady invited Kate to join her as a guest at the State of the Union and Kate accepted,"" she said.
TEXAS SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST PREGNANT WOMAN HOURS AFTER SHE LEAVES STATE TO OBTAIN ABORTION

The Biden campaign put abortion in the spotlight this week with a ""Reproductive Freedom"" rally in Virginia to commemorate what would have been the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. The court overturned Roe in 2022, ending federal protections for abortion and permitting states to regulate the procedure as lawmakers see fit.
Since then, 14 states, including Texas, have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation.
Cox’s baby had a condition known as trisomy 18, which is when a baby has an extra copy of chromosome 18. The diagnosis has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth, and a low survival rate.
Cox's lawsuit against Texas, which cited doctors, argued that continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and her ability to have more children.
BIDEN CALLS TRUMP ‘MOST RESPONSIBLE’ FOR ‘STRIPPING AWAY’ ABORTION, VOWS TO VETO ANY NATIONWIDE BAN

Trisomy 18 occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500 diagnosed pregnancies, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. There is no live birth in about 70% of pregnancies involving the diagnosis that proceeds past 12 weeks gestational age, according to a legal filing that the two groups submitted to the court.
Texas' abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger, but not for fetal anomalies. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox had not shown that any of the complications in her pregnancy rose to the level of threatening her life.
The court battle and Cox's defeat have become a rallying cry for Democrats nationally, who say Republican-backed abortion restrictions deny women health care and take away their rights.
At his rally in Manassas, Virginia, on Tuesday, President Biden said former President Trump is ""most responsible"" for the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and blamed his predecessor (and likely general election opponent) for ""stripping away"" abortion rights.
BIDEN CALLS ON CONGRESS TO RESTORE ROE V. WADE ABORTION PROTECTIONS AS FEDERAL LAW: 'THIS IS NOT OVER'

The president said women are ""being turned away from our emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care, forced to go to court to plead to help to protect themselves, and the ability to often have children in the future.""
""The cruelty is astounding and it's a direct affront to a woman's dignity to be told by extreme politicians and judges to wait to get sicker and sicker before anything can happen, even to the point where, as you heard your life had been determined to be in danger, or the idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she'd been raped or the victim of incest,"" Biden said. ""It's outrageous.""
""Or the idea a woman receives competent medical advice that the fetus she's carrying won't live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future and she still can't get medical care,"" he continued in apparent reference to Cox's story. ""I think it's unconscionable that anyone thinks that this is where America is going in 2024.""
""Let there be no mistake: the person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,"" he said. ""Trump says he’s proud that he overturned Roe v. Wade.""
The White House said Biden will continue to share the stories of women who have been impacted by abortion restrictions since Roe v. Wade was undone.

BAK45FVPNW_XUGNRMKU5DZ4OXU,Trial begins for suspects in fatal shooting of Dutch crime reporter,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 9:38am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trial-begins-suspects-fatal-shooting-dutch-crime-reporter,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Suspects accused of involvement in the fatal 2021 shooting in Amsterdam of prominent Dutch investigative reporter Peter R. de Vries repeatedly refused to answer questions from judges and lawyers as their trial opened Tuesday.
Among the nine suspects is Delano G., who is accused of gunning down De Vries in broad daylight on July 6, 2021. Under Dutch privacy law, suspects are identified only by their first name and the first initial of their family name.
De Vries, a popular reporter and television presenter, died nine days later of his injuries, at age 64. His son and daughter were in court Tuesday to watch the proceedings.
DUTCH CRIME REPORTER DE VRIES DIES AFTER SHOOTING IN AMSTERDAM
The slaying sent shock waves through the Netherlands and triggered an outpouring of grief. Dutch King Willem-Alexander called it ""an attack on journalism, the cornerstone of our constitutional state and therefore also an attack on the rule of law.""

(AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File)
De Vries had been an adviser and confidant for a protected witness in the trial of the alleged leader and other members of a crime gang that police described as an ""oiled killing machine."" The brother and lawyer of the witness were also murdered. A verdict in that trial had been planned for next month, but further hearings will likely delay it. The key defendant is alleged gangster Ridouan Taghi, once one of the Netherlands' most-wanted fugitives until his 2019 arrest in Dubai.
The trial in De Vries shooting opened Tuesday in a packed, heavily guarded courtroom on the edge of Amsterdam, with armed police in body armor and ski masks patrolling the streets outside as cars carrying the suspects swept into the court's underground parking lot.
SUSPECT ACCUSED OF KILLING 7 IN ILLINOIS KILLED HIMSELF WHEN FOUND BY US MARSHALS IN TEXAS: POLICE
Some of the defendants denied any involvement in the assassination while others asserted their right to remain silent. One after another, they took an oath to tell the truth in court before refusing to answer questions. Judges played a security camera video taken about two weeks before the shooting showing a man who police say was the getaway driver trailing De Vries in the street where he was later shot.
The alleged shooter was arrested less than an hour after the attack, along with a Polish national identified as Kamil E. who was the alleged getaway driver. Prosecutors told judges at Amsterdam District Court that the weapon used to shoot De Vries was found in their car.
The two suspects went on trial in 2022 and prosecutors demanded life sentences. However, the court never delivered verdicts because prosecutors introduced new evidence late in the case, following a string of arrests. The pair are now on trial along with seven other suspects arrested in the weeks and months after the slaying, all accused of involvement in planning the shooting.
The trial is scheduled to run until the end of February. Verdicts will likely be announced weeks later."
BB8EL48DGO_ESJ3DS4OPP9X559,Plumber shocked as he finds over 20 pig bones underneath home's bathroom floor during routine visit,By Brittany Kasko Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 1:13pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/plumber-shocked-finds-20-pig-bones-underneath-home-bathroom-floor-routine-visit,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A plumber made a startling discovery while trying to fix a bathroom problem.
Jonathan Betts, 36, was working as a plumber in Devon, England, when he discovered over 20 bones within the floorboards of a home's restroom.
Betts was working on a routine bathroom fix in early January 2024, he told SWNS, when he realized he needed to dig down further into the soil beneath a 200-year-old home.
HOMEOWNERS UNEARTH ICE AGE-ERA SKELETON WHILE INSTALLING SWIMMING POOL IN LAS VEGAS PROPERTY
""After I removed the toilet and floor covering, I found that the subflooring below was massively rotten and discovered the joists had just been fitted onto soil,"" he said.
He continued, ""I made the customers aware, who have been on [vacation], that I will need to dig out the soil to try and find some solid ground to concrete in an ore formed intel.""
Betts found part of a jawbone, which sparked his interest in taking to the internet to see if the bones were from an animal.  (SWNS)
Betts said that as he began to dig further down, he started to notice bones within the soil — and said that finding a jawbone with teeth stressed him out.

""In the back of my mind, I knew it was an animal as the teeth didn’t look like ours, but I was still sketching out as I really did not want this job to be shut down,"" he told SWNS, the British news service.

Betts ultimately found another 20 bones, along with bottles and marble, before discovering the second part of the original jawbone.
The plumber said that the bones were from a pig in a TikTok video — which now has over 1.4 million views.

""Let’s just say it’s not every day you’re at work and find a pile of bones under a bathroom floor,"" he told SWNS.
Betts said he found over 20 bones while digging into the soil beneath a residential home while working on a bathroom project.   (SWNS)
Betts took photos of the jawbone remains and searched for similar images on Google before consulting with others to determine if the remains belonged to a pig.
The bones, however, were then placed back in the soil where they were found, after the homeowners asked him to do so.

""The bones have been placed back under the floor when we found out that back in the day, people buried them to ward off bad spirits,"" he said to SWNS.

BCHM0O98IW_OEB1D7FNQ77U1YC,"On this day in history, January 22, 1973, Supreme Court issues landmark Roe v. Wade decision",By Brittany Kasko Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 12:02am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-jan-22-1973-supreme-court-landmark-roe-wade-decision,"Fox News personalities look back on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case as it made its way to the Supreme Court.
On this day in history, Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade — claiming that the unduly and restrictive state regulation of abortion was unconstitutional, according to Britannica.
Abortion is arguably one of the most controversial issues in today’s society.
An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus, according to Merriam-Webster.
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JANUARY 21, 1977, PRESIDENT CARTER PARDONS VIETNAM WAR DRAFT DODGERS
The court case began three years earlier with a ""Jane Roe"" — a woman later revealed to be Norma McCorvey.
A waitress, McCorvey of Texas became pregnant in 1969 — and wanted to have an abortion.
Norma McCorvey, the ""Jane Roe"" in the 1973 Roe v. Wade court case, is shown sitting behind her desk with a sign displayed that says ""I Am Subject To Bursts Of Enthusiasm."" She was 22 and pregnant for the third time in 1969 when she fought for the right to have an abortion. She never had that abortion.  (Getty Images)
At the time, however, abortions in Texas were outlawed — except in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother’s life.
McCorvey was a resident of Dallas County.
She believed she had the right to terminate her pregnancy without government restriction, according to Britannica's entry about the case.
WHAT DOES OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE MEAN? SUPREME COURT DECISION'S IMPLICATIONS
She reportedly claimed she could not afford to travel to a jurisdiction outside Texas to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions.
District Attorney Henry Wade in Dallas County, Texas, claimed the state should be able to regulate when abortions were allowed.   (Getty Images)
So she sought federal action against Henry Wade, a district attorney in Dallas County, Texas, claiming the existing ruling prohibiting abortion violated her constitutional rights.
The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas found McCorvey’s argument to have merit, agreeing that the ruling violated her right to privacy.

But after the state appealed, McCorvey’s case made its way to the Supreme Court in 1970, according to Britannica.
The Supreme Court ultimately ruled 7-2 in her favor — agreeing in its landmark decision that state laws prohibiting abortion were unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment.
On Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court, chaired by Chief Justice Warren Burger (center, bottom row) and including William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan Jr., Potter Stewart, Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William Rehnquist, issued its landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The court ruled that the unduly restrictive state regulation of abortion was unconstitutional — and that the Constitution protected a woman's choice of an abortion without excessive government restriction. (AFP via Getty Images)
In a majority opinion written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, ""the Court held that a set of Texas statutes criminalizing abortion in most instances violated a woman’s constitutional right of privacy,"" according to Britannica, ""which it found to be implicit in the liberty guarantee of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.""
The 14th Amendment says that no state ""shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens in the United States,"" according to the U.S. Constitution.
PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST ELIZABETH JOHNSTON: 'WE REMEMBER ALL LIVES LOST THROUGH ABORTION'
The opinion said, in part, ""Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,"" as Britannica noted.
In one of the most interesting twists connected to the case, ""Jane Roe"" — Norma McCorvey — did not have the abortion she had pushed for after all.

She was 22, unmarried, unemployed and pregnant for the third time in 1969 when she fought for the right to have an abortion in Texas.
""Jane Roe"" became an evangelical Christian and joined the anti-abortion movement.
But by the time the Supreme Court rendered its decision establishing abortion rights in 1973, she had already given birth — and given up her baby girl for adoption.
After the court's ruling, McCorvey lived quietly for several years before revealing herself to be ""Jane Roe"" in the 1980s, the Associated Press reported.

Decades later, as the AP also reported, McCorvey underwent a conversion. She became an evangelical Christian and joined the anti-abortion movement.
A short time later, she underwent another religious conversion and became a Roman Catholic.
""I'm 100% pro-life. I don't believe in abortion even in an extreme situation. If the woman is impregnated by a rapist, it's still a child. You're not to act as your own God,"" she told the AP in 1998.
‘ROE BABY’ SHELLEY LYNN THORNTON SAYS SHE'S NOT GOING TO LET EITHER SIDE USE HER IN ABORTION DEBATE
McCorvey passed away at age 69 in 2017.
The 1973 Roe v. Wade decision stood for nearly 50 years — until June 24, 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned it, ultimately giving the states the power to allow, limit or ban the practice altogether.
SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK ABORTION DECISION
""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion.
""The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely — the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" the opinion continued.
""A culture of life is the best thing for our culture and our families.""
Today, abortion is banned or almost totally banned in a number of states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.
Many pro-life activists, however, believe there is still a great deal of work to be done.

Noelle Garnier, director of public policy and communications at National Religious Broadcasters, headquartered in Washington, D.C., told Fox News Digital just ahead of this year's March for Life that ""2022 was a landmark year for the pro-life movement in America, but we have much, much more work to do in the coming year.""

Said Garnier, ""We and our members stand firm in proclaiming that a culture of life is the best thing for our culture and our families, and we are proud to participate in this historic event.""
However, many others, including those on the pro-choice side of the issue, believe that abortion is ""a basic health care need for millions of women, girls and others who can become pregnant,"" as Amnesty International, headquartered in the U.K., notes on its website. The group says that ""worldwide, an estimated 1 in 4 pregnancies end in an abortion every year.""

It also says that ""access to safe and legal abortion services is far from guaranteed for those who may need abortion services."" It adds, ""Regardless of whether abortion is legal or not, people still require and regularly access abortion services.""

New York City police took action against sex trafficking on Thursday, targeting six establishments allegedly engaged in prostitution in Queens. Prostitution is against the law in New York.
NYPD officers were seen on video cracking down on one establishment at 95th Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, with NYC Mayor Eric Adams leading the way.

Bob Menendez gave an impassioned response on the Senate floor Tuesday in defense of his latest superseding indictment that alleges he was involved with federal bribes in exchange for various gifts and cash to benefit Qatar.
Attorneys for Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., allege in a court filing the FBI ""misled"" judges to obtain search warrants that led to hundreds of thousands of dollars, a luxury car and gold bars being seized from Menendez's home after agents ""ransacked"" it.
FBI agents ""broke down doors (even, in some cases, where the doors were unlocked) and tore apart closets, wardrobes, dressers and other storage locations,"" the lawyers wrote.
Additionally, FBI agents seized ""virtually anything of value,"" including almost half a million dollars in cash and 13 gold bars. Menendez's lawyers claimed prosecutors ""actively distorted the evidence"" that was revealed through ""exploratory rummaging.""

""To obtain several of these search warrants, the government actively distorted the evidence and withheld key exculpatory information, misleading well-meaning magistrate judges into granting warrants that should never have issued,"" Menendez's lawyers wrote.
Prosecutors conducted a thorough and lengthy investigation into Menendez, obtaining over 20 search warrants related to alleged co-conspirators.
""Nevertheless, none of the 'evidence' obtained from these search warrants of alleged co-conspirators remotely tied Senator Menendez to knowing involvement in any alleged bribery scheme,"" his lawyers wrote.
Most of the specific claims pertaining to allegations that prosecutors ""misled"" judges to obtain search warrants were redacted in the 34-page court filing.
According to the latest superseding indictment unsealed this month, Menendez is accused of accepting bribes and gifts in exchange for helping to benefit Qatar as part of a corruption scheme from 2021 through 2023, one year longer than originally thought, the Justice Department said.
Menendez is already facing federal charges for allegedly acting as a foreign agent and accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to benefit the Egyptian government through his power and influence as a senator.

The New Jersey Democrat has repeatedly asserted his innocence and claimed ""there is no evidence"" of the gifts and payments he allegedly received as a suspected foreign agent.
Menendez, along with his wife Nadine and three other New Jersey businessmen — Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes — were first charged in the federal bribery scheme Sept. 23. All have pleaded not guilty.

FBI and IRS criminal investigators allege Menendez and his wife accepted several gold bars and other gifts from Daibes, a New Jersey developer and former bank chairman accused of banking crimes.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Belarusian authorities on Tuesday arrested several dozen people in raids marking the latest in a relentless crackdown on dissent, a local human rights center said.
The Viasna center said that at least 64 people were detained across Belarus on charges of ""involvement in extremist groups"" and ""financing extremist activities,"" accusations that are routinely used to target dissenters.
Viasna said that some political prisoners who had been released after serving their sentences were among those arrested.

It said that some of those detained had cooperated with a humanitarian project providing food for political prisoners and others who have found themselves in a desperate situation amid official reprisals. On Tuesday, the authorities branded the project, INeedHelpBY, as extremist, a designation that could trigger seven-year prison sentences for those who cooperate with it.

According to Viasna, the detainees included Maryna Adamovich, the wife of opposition activist Mikola Statkevich, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence. The 76-year-old Barys Khamaida, a veteran human rights activist, was detained as well, the group said.
Belarusian authorities have cracked down on opponents of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko after huge protests triggered by the August 2020 election that gave him a sixth term in office. The balloting was viewed by the opposition and the West as fraudulent.
Protests swept the country for months, bringing hundreds of thousands into the streets. More than 35,000 people were arrested, thousands were beaten in police custody and hundreds of independent media outlets and nongovernmental organizations were shut down and outlawed.
More than 1,400 political prisoners remain behind bars, including leaders of opposition parties and renowned human rights advocate and 2022 Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski.
Belarusian opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 vote, denounced Tuesday's arrests, saying that ""the regime’s thugs have targeted former political prisoners and the families of those currently held.""

BPWSRZ5B8Q_21CV7ZH4S5WIZZL,"UN appeals for $7.9 billion to help millions of migrants flee climate change, conflict",By Michael Dorgan Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 2:22pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/un-appeals-7-9-billion-help-millions-people-migrate-combat-climate-change,"Senate Republican Whip John Thune said Tuesday he wants to suspend the Biden administration's catch and release policy at the southern border and replace it with detain and deport in the new border bill.
The United Nations has appealed for a whopping $7.9 billion to bolster its efforts to migrate people around the world who it says have been forced to leave their homes for various reasons, including climate change and conflict.
The plea was made by the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Geneva Monday to support its operations and help ""create a system that realizes migration’s promise as a force for good throughout the world.""
""The IOM Global Appeal seeks funding to save lives and protect people on the move, drive solutions to displacement and facilitate safe pathways for regular migration,"" a statement released by the IOM says. Those objectives form part of the IOM’s new five-year Global Strategic Plan.

The organization says that the nearly $8 billion would go toward serving nearly 140 million people, including internally displaced people and the local communities that host them. Crucially, it would also allow for an expansion of IOM’s development work, which helps prevent further displacement, the appeal states.
The IOM has called on governments, the private sector, individual donors and ""other partners"" to contribute to the fund, noting it’s the first time it has put out such an appeal.
Of the $7.9 billion, around $3.4 billion would go toward ""saving lives and protecting people on the move,"" and $1.6 billion would be spent on facilitating ""regular pathways for migration.""
It is unclear how exactly this would be spent, but the U.N. has been known to distribute cash debit cards to migrants and provide food, basic necessities and prescription drugs.
Around $2.7 billion would be allotted for ""solutions to displacement,"" including reducing the risks and impacts of climate change, the appeal states, while another $163 million would go toward ""transforming IOM to deliver services in a better, more effective way.""
Amy Pope, the director general of the IOM, said migration has reached unprecedented levels and that it benefits the world.

""The evidence is overwhelming that migration, when well managed, is a major contributor to global prosperity and progress,"" Pope said.
""We are at a critical moment in time, and we have designed this appeal to help deliver on that promise. We can and must do better.""
The appeal comes as countries around the world are facing hefty bills to house and feed migrants who cross their borders illegally.
WHO CHIEF SAYS 'DISEASE X' PREPARATION TREATY IN JEOPARDY, LOSS OF SOVEREIGNTY IS ‘FAKE NEWS’
For instance, a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) last year found that illegal immigration is now costing U.S. taxpayers $151 billion a year, marking a 30% increase in five years. The largest cost that FAIR identifies is K-12 education, which the group estimates costs $78 billion a year.
The U.S. government is already the U.N.’s biggest donor, contributing about $18.1 billion to the global body in 2022, a massive increase from its $12.5 billion allocation in 2021, according to the U.N.’s website.
The appeal states that there are an estimated 281 million ""international migrants"" who generate 9.4% of global GDP, although it does not show how it came to that figure.
""Migration is a cornerstone of global development and prosperity,"" the appeal states.

Many migrants make the often treacherous journeys to other countries to claim asylum, and the appeal argues that limiting regular migration pathways and protections leaves people vulnerable to violence, exploitation and danger.
For instance, the IOM estimated that at least 60,000 migrants died or disappeared on perilous journeys over the last nine years.
""The consequences of underfunded, piecemeal assistance come at a greater cost, not just in terms of money but in greater danger to migrants through irregular migration, trafficking and smuggling,"" the appeal states.
""Well-managed migration has the potential to advance development outcomes, contribute to climate change adaptation, and promote a safer and more peaceful, sustainable, prosperous and equitable future.""

ABC News and CNN canceled their Republican debates in New Hampshire after former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that she would not join another debate unless former President Trump agreed to participate. Only Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would have been left on stage since Trump said in August he would not participate in any debates, writing on Truth Social that the ""the public knows who I am.""
""I was disappointed,"" Anna, of New Hampshire, said of the canceled debates. ""If you run for office, I think you really need to get out there and say what you're actually gonna do and answer questions from the people.""
Debates have occurred in every presidential election since 1976, though some candidates have opted out in the past, including former President Nixon who didn't participate in 1968 and 1972. Former President Carter also opted out of the first two debates against former President Reagan during the 1980 presidential race.
""I'm always a fan of debates,"" Greg from New Hampshire said. ""I think it's important to get people in front of the camera answering tough questions.""

Texas officials are vowing to maintain strict border security measures after the Supreme Court ruled border patrol officials could cut razor wire designed to deter illegal crossings – a move applauded by the Biden administration.
Lt. Chris Olivarez of the Texas Department of Public Safety said the state, under Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, ""will maintain its current posture in deterring illegal border crossings by utilizing effective border security measures.""
Texas authorities place razor wire in Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, defying a Biden administration order to end the state's seizure of the area along the Rio Grande.  (Matt Finn)
This includes, Olivarez said, reinforced concertina wire and anti-climb barriers along the Rio Grande.
Olivarez’s tweet comes a day after a 5-4 vote from the Supreme Court, clearing the way for Border Patrol agents to cut or clear out concertina wire that Texas has put along the banks of the Rio Grande to deter migrants from entering the U.S. illegally while the Fifth Circuit still has yet to rule on the case's merits.
WHITE HOUSE PRESSED ON TAKING DOWN BORDER RAZOR WIRE, SAYS AGENTS NEED ‘ACCESS’ TO PROCESS MIGRANTS
The Biden administration argued that the nearly 30 miles of wire, installed near Eagle Pass, had ""prevented frontline personnel from performing vital federal functions and interfered with their ability to address urgent situations and enforce our laws.""
It dismissed the razor as ""political stunts"" that make it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs.
Border patrol agents cut razor wire along the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, TX on September 27, 2023. Border crossings through Eagle Pass continues to strain law enforcement as an unprecedented number of migrants enter the United States each day.  (Benjamin Lowy for Fox News Digital )
Olivarez said the logical concern ""should be why the Federal Government continues to hinder Texas’ ability to protect its border, all while allowing for the exploitation, dangerous, and inhumane methods of permitting illegal immigrants, including children, to illegally cross a dangerous river where many have lost their lives.""
WEALTHY CHICAGO SUBURB PROPOSES ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO SIGN UP TO HOUSE MIGRANTS
""Texas is the only state using every strategy and resource to protect its sovereignty, combat criminal activity, and discourage illegal immigration,"" he said.
Olivarez’s tweet got an endorsement from Gov. Abbott, who highlighted the message.
Earlier Tuesday, Gov. Abbott vowed that Texas ""will not back down from our efforts to secure the border in Biden’s absence.""
The Republican governor had authorized the wire, one of a series of aggressive measures the three-term Republican has taken on the border in the name of curbing illegal crossings from Mexico.
The concertina wire stretches for roughly 30 miles near the border city of Eagle Pass, where earlier this month the Texas Military Department seized control of a city-owned park and began denying access to Border Patrol agents.

Eagle Park has become one of the busiest spots on the southern U.S. border for migrants illegally crossing from Mexico. Abbott has said Texas won't allow Border Patrol agents into Shelby Park anymore, having expressed frustration over what he says are migrants illegally entering through Eagle Pass and then federal agents loading them onto buses.

Byrne Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 12:02am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/on-this-day-history-jan-25-1961-jfk-hosts-first-televised-presidential-press-conference,"New York Post columnist Miranda Devine reacts to President Biden releasing more JFK files, despite over 4,000 documents that remain redacted on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'
President John F. Kennedy introduced a new era of White House communications when he hosted the first live televised presidential press conference on this day in history, Jan. 25, 1961.
""The fact of the matter is that [at] the time when President Kennedy started televised press conferences, there were only three or four newspapers in the entire United States that carried a full transcript of a presidential press conference,"" Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre Salinger, told the JFK Presidential Library in an oral history of the 35th president.
""Therefore, what people read was a distillation … We thought that they should have the opportunity to see it in full.""
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JANUARY 24, 2003, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ESTABLISHED AS CABINET AGENCY
The president had been sworn into office just five days earlier.
The press conference was held at the new State Department auditorium in Washington, D.C. The Cold War hung heavily over the proceedings.
The new president made a series of three announcements, the first related to atomic test ban discussions in Geneva, Switzerland.

He then addressed relief efforts amid the ongoing civil war in the Congo, which became a proxy war between competing Soviet- and U.S.-backed factions.
Kennedy also announced that U.S. Air Force officers Capt. John R. McKone and Capt. Freeman ""Bruce"" Olmstead had been released by the Soviet Union after more than six months in captivity.
Four other airmen were killed when their RB-47 bomber was shot down by a Soviet fighter jet over disputed airspace in the Bering Sea on July 1, 1960 — just weeks after the more famous U2 incident of May 1960.
The Cold War hung heavily over the first televised presidential press conference.
The president then opened the floor for questions.
""Do you conceive of circumstances which might warrant the resumption of such things as the U2 flight?"" a reporter asked in the first media question posed to a president before a live TV audience.
(SEE the video below.)
""Flights of American aircraft penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union have been suspended since May 1960,"" Kennedy responded.

""I have ordered that they not be resumed,"" he also said.

""I’ve not heard officially of any proposal by Mr. Khrushchev to come to the United States,"" Kennedy said.
The immediacy of the event dramatically changed — or should have changed — the dynamic of the relationship between the seat of federal power and the press.
""In the period preceding the Kennedy presidency, the rules governing press conferences favored the president."" — White House Historical Association
Independent media, when performing their duties, are meant to represent the American people and serve as a check on the president's power.
""In the period preceding the Kennedy presidency, the rules governing press conferences favored the president,"" writes the White House Historical Association.
""The sessions were off-the-record events from Woodrow Wilson through Harry Truman. If the president said something he believed unwise, he could alter the quote.""
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1960, KENNEDY AND NIXON BATTLE IN FIRST TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
Woodrow Wilson held the first presidential news conference on March 15, 1913.
President Eisenhower held the first televised press conference on Jan. 19, 1955, using file footage.
""President John F. Kennedy was the first to use the medium of television to address the American people live without delay or editing,"" reports the United States Government Publishing Office.

The Kennedy-Nixon debates ""shifted how presidential campaigns were conducted, as the power of television took elections into Americans’ living rooms,"" the National Constitution Center points out.

A super PAC supporting former President Trump's 2024 White House run hauled in over $46 million in fundraising during the second half of last year.
Officials with Make America Great Again Inc. (MAGA Inc.) also confirmed to Fox News that they started the new year with more than $23 million in their coffers.
MAGA Inc.'s fundraising during the final six months of 2023 is a dramatic increase from the $13 million it brought in during the first half of last year.

MAGA Inc., which notes that it has spent $38.5 million running ads supporting Trump so far this election cycle, has been urging donors to contribute to the super PAC in advance of what's expected to be an onslaught of expenditures this year by President Biden's re-election effort and other Democratic groups.
""The general election has already started. President Trump has a clear path to win, but Democrats are spending more money and they are doing it earlier than ever before. MAGA Inc. is proud to be the organization entrusted to lead the outside effort to support President Trump and his America First movement into November,"" Taylor Budowich, the super PAC's CEO, told Fox News in a statement.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., weighs in on the 2024 race for the GOP nomination on 'Sunday Night In America.'
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., defended his decision to endorse former President Trump over Nikki Haley in the GOP primary after fielding harsh criticism from New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who implied Scott owed Haley his support instead.
""Tim Scott wouldn't have a job without Nikki Haley,"" Sununu told Fox News Friday. ""Nobody cares what Tim Scott thinks. If they did, he actually wouldn't have been driven out of this race three months ago.""
Haley appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012 as governor of South Carolina after the resignation of Sen. Jim DeMint.
Scott told ""Sunday Night in America with Trey Gowdy"" that the governor should think twice before commenting on someone else's career.
TIM SCOTT'S EXPECTED TRUMP ENDORSEMENT ROILS NH, AS SUNUNU CLAIMS SCOTT 'WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB' WITHOUT HALEY
""Well, it's simple. I heard Governor Sununu's comments as well. He was born on third base, your father was a governor and your brother was a U.S. senator, and you're going to give employment advice?"" he said.
""I ran against Strom Thurmond's son and won. The governor's namesake son, Caroll Campbell Jr., I ran against his son and won. So, getting to Congress was not just an easy path, but more importantly, Nikki did what was best for South Carolina.""
""I'm going to do what's best for America, and that's why I endorsed Donald Trump,"" he added.
Scott, who was an early contender in the presidential sweeps before suspending his campaign in November, joined Trump at a rally in Concord Friday night to announce his endorsement.
""It really came down to either sitting out or endorsing someone who could lead this nation to the highest level possible and that was simply Donald Trump,"" he said Sunday. ""Having an opportunity to work with him from 2017 to 2020, we produced the highest Opportunity Zones in the nation ever. Opportunity Zones, actually put more resources in the poorest communities across the country.""
""We cut taxes by $2.3 trillion. It was fantastic to work with the former president in such a way that we produced the kind of results that said to the American people: No matter where you live, no matter the color of your skin, no matter what coast you're on, no matter whether you're a blue state or red state, your life is going to be better because Donald Trump was president. I made the decision to endorse the president because it was the only option on the table to move America forward,"" Scott added.
While Scott's presidential campaign failed to ignite, he remains very popular with Republican primary voters and his endorsement has been heavily coveted by the remaining GOP candidates.

C04OKDK5CH_CGKR3YXAEQL2UVS,I had a job on the Keystone XL pipeline until Biden fired me to satisfy climate extremists,By Lynn 'Bugsy' Allen Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 5:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/job-keystone-xl-pipeline-until-biden-fired-satisfy-climate-extremists,"Former pipeline worker Bugsy Allen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how the Biden administration has weakened the U.S. energy sector.
Three years ago, Joe Biden fired me.
My coworkers and I didn’t even know the president had this power. We found out the hard way when he signed an executive order canceling the Keystone XL pipeline. For the 11,000 of us working on this project, it meant getting laid off. For me, it meant returning to my farm in Texas to raise my three boys without any more income.
I’ve heard people say a lot ""construction jobs are always temporary,"" and that’s true to a degree. In a healthy economy, good construction workers are lining up for their next job while still working full-time to finish their current one.
ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST
As a pipeline welder, I usually had years of guaranteed work ahead of me. President Joe Biden’s Keystone decision canceled all of that. No one was going to build a pipeline after the president made it clear where he stood.

But this isn’t just about me or my coworkers. This isn’t just about our own industry. Biden’s decision has affected every American. Prices on everything spiked: gas, groceries, electricity, you name it.
You don’t need an advanced economics degree to understand that when supply of energy is restricted, its prices go up. When energy is expensive, everything is expensive. And the first domino fell on the day we were fired.
Keystone is more than just a 3,000-mile-pipeline network stretching from Canada to the U.S. It is a symbol of a much bigger attack on our energy independence. According to the Biden logic, it’s wrong to build a pipeline with one of our strongest allies, but it’s fine to import oil and gas from hostile nations, like Venezuela.
No one explained why it’s preferable to fire American energy workers while allowing foreign countries to expand their energy workforce. Or why it combats climate change for us to be unemployed while Iran hires more oil and gas workers.
Some may say our firing wasn’t a surprise, and we should have been ready. After all, during the 2020 campaign, Biden made it clear he wanted to cancel the domestic energy industry. He even bragged about it. He told a young climate activist ""look at my eyes. I guarantee you. I guarantee you. We’re going to end fossil fuel.""
Like all his other orders and regulations punishing fossil fuels, canceling Keystone was just a campaign promise. I’m not surprised, but I wish the consequences would have convinced him to change course.
Look at what has happened since. The increased cost of living to America’s working families, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East made worse by America’s weakened energy industry, our emergency oil supplies sinking to dangerous lows.

It should make everyone in America nervous that Russia and Iran are stronger and richer now than they were when Biden took office, and all this is because of petty politics. If my job is a political pawn, then yours could be, too. If presidents are going to go after us for political reasons and ignore the damage to the national economy and our security, then we should all be worried.

This isn’t a pity party. Losing a job is something experienced by many people across industries. Many of us have found work in other sectors, and my 30 years of experience in this field have helped me to find jobs as an inspector on other sites.

America has weathered storms before, and we’ve come out on top, but I think we can all see that we’ve entered a new phase of politics where the president and his team wage a war on its citizens for political purposes. We’ll weather this one, but sadly come out poorer and weaker in the end.
Three years is a long time. No one can argue we’re better off now than we were. It may be too much to ask to go back to what worked, to stop the attacks on this vital industry and leave workers alone. My guess is, most Americans can agree this would be the best decision Biden could make if he really loves this nation that he is seeking to lead for another four years.

A New York City police sergeant who hurled a plastic cooler at a man fleeing officers on a motorcycle, causing a crash that killed the rider, was charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and assault.
Erik Duran pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday in the Bronx and made bail, which was set at $150,000. Dozens of police officers came to court in his support.
Duran, 37, was suspended shortly after the incident and later placed on modified duty.

Messages seeking comment were left with Duran’s union and his defense attorney.
Motorcyclist Eric Duprey, 30, was pronounced dead within minutes of being struck on a Bronx sidewalk last August. Police said Duprey had tried to flee on a friend’s motorcycle after he was caught selling drugs to an undercover police officer.
Duran had been standing on the sidewalk as part of the ""buy-and-bust"" operation carried out by the Bronx Narcotics Unit.

Surveillance video showed Duprey driving the motorcycle on a sidewalk toward a group of people, including the sergeant, who was not in uniform. As he approached, the video shows Duran pick up the red picnic cooler and throw it. Duprey is struck, loses control, and is tossed toward a tree as the motorcycle veers into the street. The bike smashes into a metal barricade before coming to rest against a parked car.
Duprey had three young children and worked as a delivery driver.
Duran, a 13-year veteran of the department, joined the Bronx Narcotics Unit in 2022. He has been recognized by the department dozens of times for what it deems excellent and meritorious police service, according to a police personnel database.
Duran’s disciplinary record includes a substantiated complaint in 2022 for abusing his authority during a stop, according to the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board.
Duran's next court date is April 18."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The East Coast of the United States is known for its miles of gorgeous beaches, but now something beneath the surface has been discovered that makes it even more of a jewel.
Thanks to 3D imagery, scientists have mapped the largest coral reef deep in the ocean, stretching hundreds of miles off the U.S. Atlantic coast.
The reef extends more than 300 miles from Florida to South Carolina, marking the total area nearly three times the size of Yellowstone National Park. Maps of the reef were recently published in the journal ""Geomatics"" by nonprofit Ocean Exploration Trust oceanographer Derek Sowers and other scientists, including several at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
""It's eye-opening — it's breathtaking in scale,"" said Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who was not involved in the study.

The reef was also found so far below the surface, ranging from 655 to 3,280 feet, that sunlight does not penetrate it. Coral that far down must filter food particles out of the water for energy, rather than rely on photosynthesis.
Coral reefs are important ecosystems as they protect coastlines from storms and erosion, the NOAA says on its website. They are also sources of food and new medicine.

""Over half a billion people depend on reefs for food, income, and protection,"" the agency states, estimating that the net economic value of the world's coral reefs is estimated to be nearly tens of billions of U.S. dollars annually.
People enjoy fishing, diving and snorkeling on and need reefs, which adds hundreds of millions of dollars to local business, the NOAA says.

Only about 75% of the world's ocean floor has been mapped in high-resolution, so scientists say that even larger reefs could be waiting to be discovered.

The brother of a Kansas City Chiefs fan who was found dead in a friend's backyard spoke out Thursday on the investigation, claiming there are still many lingering questions.
Ricky Johnson, 38; Clayton McGeeney, 36; and David Harrington, 37, were all found dead earlier this month outside their friend Jordan Willis' rental home after attending a Sunday watch party.
Willis claims to have had no idea the men were outside, and was only made aware of the bodies when police showed up days later. He claims to have slept for nearly 48 hours following the party, according to his attorney, while family members of the deceased fans tried to contact him and even showed up to his home.
But Johnson's brother, Jonathan Price, explained why he doesn't think Willis' story adds up during ""Fox & Friends,"" as investigators try to piece together what happened.
""There's way too many questions still needing to be answered, and nobody can answer those questions,"" Price told Ainsley Earhardt on Thursday. ""And honestly, except for Jordan … the fifth person, he was there, but he wasn't there after a certain time frame.""
FAMILY OF KANSAS CITY CHIEFS FAN FOUND DEAD OUTSIDE PAL'S HOUSE THINKS HE WAS DRUGGED
""That's just the stuff that's not adding up,"" he continued. ""If you have to change your story, then how do we know at any time where you're telling the truth? It doesn't make any sense.""
The three men were discovered dead outside a home on Northwest 83rd Terrace in Kansas City, pictured, two days after they had gathered there to watch the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Jordan Willis, who rented the property, has since moved out according to his attorney. (Google Maps)
A fifth man who was at the home on Jan. 7, although not named publicly, told FOX4 Kansas City that Willis and the three men were still awake when he left the home at Northwest 83rd Terrace that night. He stressed that he was not the last person to see the men alive.
His attorney, Andrew Talge, told the outlet that his client arrived at the residence to watch the Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers around 7 p.m., and he left at approximately midnight.
When his client left, Talge said, the other four men were awake watching ""Jeopardy.""
Willis' attorney, John Picerno, previously told Fox News Digital that the fifth person left his client's house first, then he said goodbye to the other men before falling asleep. But Picerno has been accused of inconsistencies since he said that his client fell asleep in the house while the four men were present, during an earlier interview with FOX4.
2 MISSOURI WOMEN FOUND DEAD IN SAME FIREFIGHTER'S HOME YEARS APART
He then said his client slept for nearly two days after the gathering while family members of the deceased men tried to contact him when they could not reach their loved ones.
Earhardt mentioned Willis is known to be an accomplished scientist.
""That part makes no sense to me,"" Price said. ""Especially when, it seems like you're a responsible individual, a responsible enough individual to… gain a PhD... in what seems like a very complicated science… If you're one of those type of people in order… to sleep all day on a Monday, which I assume was a work day, if you're working from home… I don't know how that is possible. I definitely wouldn't be able to do that.""
Ricky Johnson, left, was a ""responsible"" man who ""wasn't going to go outside and freeze to death,"" his parents told Fox News Digital.  (Norma Chester)
The fiancée of one victim eventually reportedly broke into the back door of the home when she couldn't reach her soon-to-husband. She allegedly found one of the bodies before calling police.
""She found someone on the back porch, she immediately called the police, and when the police showed up, that's when Jordan answered the door, as if he had no idea anything was going on,"" Price said.

""From there on… we haven't really gotten something we… can call the truth from him anyway,"" he continued.
Kansas City police officers are currently waiting for toxicology results as they continue to probe the tragedy. The case is not being investigated as possible homicide, and Willis has not been named as a suspect in the case.
Price expressed his devastation over the tragic, unexpected loss of his brother.
""I can't speak for all my family, but for myself, it's been very difficult,"" Price said. ""I don't think that I can ever fully heal until I find out what happens, and I'll never be fully healed. I admired my brother so much. I looked up to him.""

CBGWIA4WI4_DRLWDP6LTXNPXYW,MTG files complaint against 'secret boyfriend' of Georgia DA prosecuting Trump: 'Serious violations',By Joe Schoffstall Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 11:22am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mtg-files-complaint-against-secret-boyfriend-georgia-da-prosecuting-trump,"Fox News Trey Gowdy analyzes the investigation of the Georgia D.A. on The Story.
FIRST ON FOX: Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has set her sights on the ""secret boyfriend"" of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is prosecuting a case against President Trump and several of his allies over alleged 2020 election interference.
On Thursday morning, the firebrand conservative lawmaker filed a complaint with Georgia's ethics commission against Nathan Wade, an outside attorney whom Willis hired for the Trump case and allegedly engaged in an inappropriate romantic relationship with, alleging ""potential serious violations"" of state law over his purported failure to register and file lobbyist paperwork disclosing ""his solicitation"" of Willis and ""excessive gifts"" to the prosecutor.
""Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis stands credibly accused of using Fulton County and federal COVID funds to pay her unqualified, secret boyfriend Nathan Wade--who has never tried a felony case–$250 per hour to collude with the Biden White House counsel and help Fani Willis bring unprecedented RICO felony charges against President Trump and 18 co-defendants,"" Greene wrote in the complaint shared with Fox News Digital.
""Willis allegedly paid her secret boyfriend a significantly higher hourly rate than another one of her special prosecutors who actually has significant experience,"" she continued. ""And with the nearly $700,000 Wade has collected in government funds as one of Willis' special prosecutors, he has allegedly taken her on a luxury Caribbean cruise, a trip to Napa, and other lavish trips.""
GEORGIA SENATE REPUBLICANS CONSIDER SPECIAL PANEL TO INVESTIGATE FANI WILLIS MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS

In the complaint, Greene alleges ""serious violations of the Georgia Campaign Finance Act"" and said the ""public has a right to know who, or what, has influence over the officials employed by their tax dollars.""
""For that reason, the Act requires that lobbyists report their efforts to sway the discretion of lawmakers, administrators, and district attorneys in the discharge of their duties. Registration and disclosure requirements shine light on the infamously crooked aims of lobbyists and hold accountable corrupt public officials.""
Greene charges that Wade's law firm, Wade & Campbell, is a state vendor as defined by the Georgia Campaign Finance Act, and Wade is a lobbyist as defined by the Act and required to report as such before engaging in lobbying activities.
""On information and belief, Respondent Wade began lobbying Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on behalf of Wade & Campbell Law Firm in 2021,"" Greene wrote, adding Willis awarded no-bid state contracts to the firm and paid ""excessive rates"" to Wade for the work he performed.
Greene says Wade failed to register as a lobbyist and file monthly spending reports between 2021 and 2024. She also alleges that Wade made gifts to Willis that exceeded limits imposed on lobbyists and prohibited under the law.
She continued by saying Wade ""should be investigated for failure to register as a lobbyist, failure to file monthly lobbyist spending reports, failure to disclose gifts made to public officers, the making of excessive gifts to public officers and the making of prohibited gifts to public officers.""

""So no wonder Nathan Wade refused to disclose his solicitation of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, which blossomed into a sweetheart deal for his law firm as Willis appointed Wade to be a special prosecutor in a thoroughly corrupt case against President Donald Trump,"" Greene wrote.
""Had Wade done so as required by Georgia law, the public could and would have caught on to Willis' self-serving gambit to prosecute President Trump, win the adoration of the radical left, and finance an extravagant affair with Wade. For his part in this highly illicit scheme, Wade should be fully prosecuted under the Georgia Campaign Finance Act, ensuring true justice for Georgians.""
Greene demanded the commission to ""immediately impose"" a $10,000 late fee for each monthly report filed 45 or more days late.
Wade did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.

Court documents filed earlier this month say Willis hired Wade to prosecute former Trump in Georgia's election interference case. They also allege they benefited financially from the relationship through lavish vacations that the two went on using funds his firm received for working the case.
Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a hearing on the accusations for February 15.

CDL0MPKXE1_I033O963GWLUQJ1,Alabama hitman's nitrogen gas execution Thursday sparks controversy: What to know,By Chris Eberhart Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 4:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-hitmans-nitrogen-gas-execution-thursday-sparks-controversy-what-know,"Fox News correspondent Matt Finn reports the defense team is asking the state to share the evidence given to the grand jury that indicted Bryan Kohberger.
A death row inmate, who survived a botched lethal injection in 2022, will be the first person executed by nitrogen hypoxia, a controversial method that's untested and only authorized in three states.
One of those three states is Alabama, where Kenneth Eugene Smith, now 58, is scheduled to inhale the lethal gas for his role in a 1988 murder-for-hire plot that killed Elizabeth Sennett.
Execution by nitrogen hypoxia would cause death by forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen, which deprives him of oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions. That's the theory, anyway.
But the gas' effect on humans is only recorded in medical journals about accidental exposure that has killed industrial workers or in suicide attempts, which led to criticisms that Smith is essentially being used as a lab rat.
ALABAMA INMATE WHO SURVIVED BOTCHED EXECUTION FEARS HE ‘WILL FARE NO BETTER’ IN SECOND ATTEMPT
Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, is slated to be the first inmate to die by nitrogen hypoxia – his attorneys argue that he should not be a ""test subject"" of the untested, ""experimental"" method. (Alabama Department of Corrections via AP)
His lawyers said in court documents that their client is a ""test subject"" for what would be the first new method of execution since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Smith's request for a stay of the execution, saying ""The application for stay of execution of sentenced of death presented to Justice (Clarence) Thomas and by him referred to the Court is denied.""
The Alabama Attorney General's Office said this new method will ""cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes"" and claimed it's ""the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.""
ALABAMA DEATH ROW EXECUTION BY NITROGEN GAS COULD ‘AMOUNT TO TORTURE,' VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES: UN
But Smith's lawyers fought back, claiming it's ""inhumane,"" and that the mask the state will use is not airtight, which would allow oxygen to seep inside and prolong the execution or leave him in a vegetative state.
A doctor, who testified on Smith's behalf, said the low-oxygen environment could make Smith nauseous, and he could choke to death on his own vomit, The Associated Press reported.
ACLU Alabama argued against using nitrogen gas to execute death row inmate Kenneth Eugene Smith. (ACLU Alabama)
The state responded by saying the risk of vomiting was low, and Smith would be unconscious almost immediately.
The defense also argues a second execution attempt is unconstitutional after Smith was one of three Alabama death row inmates who survived a botched lethal injection in 2022.
ALABAMA JUDGE GREENLIGHTS HITMAN'S EXPERIMENTAL EXECUTION: ‘NOT GUARANTEED A PAINLESS DEATH’
""It is uncontroverted that ADOC (Alabama Department of Corrections) inflicted actual physical and psychological pain on Mr. Smith by repeatedly trying (and failing) to establish IV access through his arms, hands and by a central line as he was strapped to a gurney for hours,"" Smith’s lawyers said in court filings.
The 2022 attempt, which lasted over four hours, caused Smith ""severe physical pain and psychological torment, including posttraumatic stress disorder.""
""ADOC representatives jabbed Mr. Smith repeatedly in his arms and hands, ignoring his complaints that they were penetrating his muscles and causing severe pain, before then attempting to perform a central line procedure on him,"" the petition to the U.S. Supreme Court says.
READ DEFENSE'S SUPREME COURT PETITION
But five different courts – ranging from an Alabama circuit court to the state Supreme Court – have ruled against the defense's efforts to stop the execution or schedule a new hearing between May 2023 and mid-January.
Smith is set to be executed during a 30-hour window between 12 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday.
He was convicted of capital murder for his role in a 1988 murder-for-hire plot that killed Sennett so her husband could collect the insurance money. He and John Forrest Parker killed the preacher's wife for $1,000 apiece.
Sennett's husband killed himself a week after the murder. Parker was executed via lethal injection in 2010.
The United Nations said it is an ""untested method of execution which may subject him to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even torture"" in a Jan. 3 statement.
U.N. experts said there's no scientific evidence to prove Smith won't experience ""grave suffering,"" and implored U.S. officials at the state or federal level to halt the execution, pending review of the protocol.
POTENTIAL CULT CALLED ‘SOLDIERS OF CHRIST’ LIKELY BEAT WOMAN TO DEATH ‘TO EXORCISE DEMON SPIRIT’: EXPERT
""We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death,"" the U.N. experts said.
In the U.S., veterinarians won't use nitrogen hypoxia in euthanasia of most animals, except chickens, turkeys and pigs, according to the 2020 American Veterinary Medical Association's euthanasia guidelines.

It's ""unacceptable"" for most mammals because it creates an ""anoxic environment"" that ""is distressing.""
To achieve unconsciousness and death, there needs to be less than 2% of oxygen, which is difficult to achieve, according to the AVMA.
‘SLASHER’ LEFT THREE GIRLS FOR DEAD AND ELUDED COPS FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS
The ACLU Alabama piggybacked off the veterinarians' guidelines in its statement released last week.
""Veterinary scientists, who have carried out laboratory studies on animals, have even largely ruled nitrogen gas out as a euthanasia method due to ethical concerns,"" the ACLU said.
""Attempting to kill Mr. Smith, or any other person, by nitrogen gas is cruel and inhumane. Plans to do so should be abandoned for those reasons alone.""

The gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or ""five minutes following a flatline… whichever is long,"" according to Alabama state protocol.
Dr. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist who was one of four experts who filed the U.N. complaint, said this puts Smith at risk for seizures and choking to death on his own vomit, and any leak under the mask could prolong the execution.
PORTLAND CHILDREN JUMP FROM STOLEN CAR, ESCAPE KIDNAPPING SUSPECT WITH GOOD SAMARITAN'S HELP
""This is clearly inhumane,"" Jon Yorke, a human rights professor who was part of the U.N. complaint, wrote on the Oxford Human Rights Hub. ""However, proving this to the satisfaction of the U.S. capital judicial process is another matter.""
The courts follow the precedents set after the U.S. Supreme Court cases of Baze v. Rees in 2008, Glossip v. Gross in 2008 and Bucklew v. Precythe in 2018.
Snippet of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's reading of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Bucklew v. Precythe in 2019. (U.S. Supreme Court)
The cases essentially say the Eighth Amendment doesn't guarantee an inmate a painless death, and the burden of proof to show a certain method is inhumane was shifted from the state to the inmate.

""This is a perverse requirement,"" Yorke wrote. ""Under Baze, Glossip and Bucklew, Kenneth is effectively prevented from satisfying these standards as there is no applicable tested data on forced nitrogen gas inhalation on human subjects.""

- Trump testifies briefly in defamation trial against him
- Biden administration warned Iran before ISIS attack
- Influential Senate moderate refuses to back Trump
Top Republican governors from across the U.S. voiced their support for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as he defies President Biden in an effort to stem the flow of illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border as Democrats demand Biden federalize the Texas national guard.
Abbott is fighting multiple legal battles with the Biden administration, which has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass. Texas has also filed lawsuits against the administration, which cut razor wire set up by the state on the Rio Grande to prevent migrants from illegally crossing into Texas, as well as the establishment of buoys on the river.
""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now,"" Abbott said. ""President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""
Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, called on Biden to federalize the National Guard on Tuesday after it became clear Abbott wasn't backing down. When asked whether the White House was considering this, Jack Kirby said, ""We talked about this the other day. I don't have any decisions to speak to for the president. I don't have anything on that.""
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, North Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt have all declared that they stand with Texas and vowed to aid them in various ways.

Scott’s engagement came after his endorsement of Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Scott, who ended his own White House bid in November, became the third former Republican presidential candidate in the past week to endorse the former president for another term.
Later Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped his bid for the White House and endorsed Trump for president.
""We need a president who understands the American people are sick and tired of being sick and tired, we need,"" Scott said as the crowd responded: ""Donald Trump.""
Scott later told Fox News that ""it’s time for us to unite our party so that we make sure that the only target we’re talking about is firing Joe Biden.""

""Our country can’t take four more years. I’m not sure we could take ten more months,"" he said. ""The best way for us to get rid of Joe Biden as our president is to unite our party now behind Donald Trump.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, the Alabama convicted killer put to death Thursday night by nitrogen gas, was served a last meal hours before his execution, corrections officials said.
For his final meal, Smith was served steak with A.1. sauce, hash browns and eggs, the Alabama Department of Corrections said. Before that, he was served a breakfast meal that consisted of two biscuits, eggs, grape jelly, applesauce and orange juice at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore.
Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation. The method marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
In a final statement, Smith said: ""Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards. ... I’m leaving with love, peace and light.""
He made the ""I love you sign"" with his hands toward family members who were witnesses. ""Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,"" Smith said.

The execution followed a last-minute legal challenge from Smith's lawyers, who argued the state was making him the test subject for an experimental execution method that could violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
Smith was put to death for the 1988 murder-for-hire killing of Elizabeth Sennett. Prosecutors said he and another man were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance.
Smith's accomplice, John Forest Parker, was also convicted for the slaying and was executed in 2010.

Sennett, 45, was found dead March 18, 1988, in her home with eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner.
Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr., killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect.

CN15CA0RFU_U17NLLPZN6SXZKF,New Hampshire showdown: Why Trump is connecting with voters and Haley and DeSantis have not,By Howard Kurtz Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 3:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-hampshire-showdown-why-trump-connecting-voters-haley-desantis-have-not,"OutKick contributor Mary Katharine Ham and Fox News contributor Leslie Marshall join ‘MediaBuzz’ to discuss whether media outlets calling the Iowa caucus for Trump before the doors closed was the right move.
I could give you 30 different reasons why Ron DeSantis flamed out before today’s New Hampshire primary.
Plenty of media folks are delighting in kicking him when he’s down – worst campaign of all time and so on – and his relentlessly negative coverage, augmented by his own mishandling of the media, is a factor.
WHY DESANTIS CANCELING SUNDAY SHOWS (INCLUDING MINE) LED TO HIS QUITTING THE RACE
But it comes down to something more existential.
One exchange on my show, about Donald Trump, has stuck with me.

I was talking about both MSNBC and CNN dumping out of Trump’s Iowa victory speech, and the former president declaring this was so unfair that NBC and CNN (which does not have a federal license) should be taken off the air.
Now I agree with Trump on the substance–and so does new CNN boss Mark Thompson, who told his staff the network should have carried more of the speech, according to the New York Times–but not on the remedy. Networks shouldn’t be kicked off the air because a president doesn’t like the coverage.
I asked my liberal ""Media Buzz"" guest, Leslie Marshall, about Trump’s threat, and she said his supporters ""want to be entertained by him using nicknames for everyone,"" or in the case of mocking Nikki Haley’s Indian name, ""racial shading.""
BRET BAIER: WORDS BETWEEN TRUMP AND HALEY WILL LIKELY GET ‘UGLIER’
Trump, like him or loathe him, is an entertainer. He’s got that New York timing. He may ramble, but he puts on a show. What journalists hear as authoritarian language, dictator for one day, his loyalists view as shtick.
When Trump was indicted four times, media types called him a threat to democracy, but it boosted him in the polls.
For the record, Marshall said later that ""Ron DeSantis clearly does not have that likability factor.""
Now you can call the Florida governor a hard worker, a policy wonk, a committed conservative with a strong record in his state. But he’s a serious and sober guy, not particularly entertaining, and he doesn’t like talking about himself, for instance that he served in the military in Iraq.

One thing DeSantis and Haley, who is a very disciplined, stick-to-the script campaigner, is that neither has much of a sense of humor. Neither one is ""entertaining.""
Now the counter-argument here is that government is serious business, that this isn’t a vaudeville show and policies affect all Americans. But first you have to win an election, and making a connection with the voters has always been crucial, especially in the television age.
UNDECLARED NH VOTERS CAN ATTEND THE GOP OR DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY: SHANNON BREAM
Meanwhile, with Haley trailing Trump by double digits in most polls, the media are now focusing on whether the former president, at 77, is mentally confused. This is an obvious attempt to even the scales a bit with President Biden, who has long been known for gaffes and traces of a stutter but has at 81 clearly appeared more frail and sometimes mixed-up than three years ago.
So now there’s a concerted effort, especially on some MSNBC shows, to paint Trump as losing it as well.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images. Evangelicals for Trump photo by Scott McIntyre/For The Washington Post via Getty Images.

Past glitches – such as saying Obama when he meant Biden, saying Biden could be starting World War II – didn’t get much traction.
But when Trump, at some length, mentioned Nikki Haley’s name three times and then said she was responsible for security on Jan. 6 and turned down his offer of 10,000 soldiers, he was clearly talking about Nancy Pelosi. (She disputes that story, by the way.)
And that obvious misstatement gave Haley an opening to question his ""mental fitness,"" more sharply than in her standard riff about not wanting two 80-year-olds running for president.

This is the kind of aggressive attack that Haley should have been making long before the final weekend before the voting. She said yesterday that the entire ""media elite"" was urging her to back out.
Just when the primary finally gets entertaining, Haley, the last woman standing, is still trailing Trump by double digits in most polls – and this feels like too little too late.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on her continued support for Trump and her being considered as a possible VP pick.
An Arkansas judge on Monday dismissed Attorney General Tim Griffin's lawsuit that accused the Board of Corrections of violating the state Freedom of Information Act, part of an escalating dispute between the panel and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over who runs the prison system.
Griffin said he planned to appeal the two-page ruling from Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox tossing out the complaint stemming from the board's hiring of an outside attorney in the dispute.
ARKANSAS GOV SARAH SANDERS MAKES MAJOR ENDORSEMENT IN 2024 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE
The panel and Sanders have been feuding over the governor's push to add more temporary prison beds despite concerns raised by board members. The panel earlier this month voted to fire Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri, four weeks after suspending him from the job.
Sanders named Profiri to the job before she took office and he was confirmed by the board. The board ousted him after another judge blocked a law Sanders signed last year that took away the board's authority to hire and fire the corrections secretary.
An Arkansas judge has dismissed a lawsuit by the state's Attorney General against its Corrections Board.
An attorney for the panel said it was pleased with the decision.
""The board did not violate the FOIA, and there is no reason for the FOIA litigation to continue,"" Abtin Mehdizadegan said in a statement. ""We invite the attorney general to meet with the board to work through these differences directly, once and for all.""
In his decision, Fox said the AG's office had not complied with his earlier order to obtain special counsel for the board or to approve its outside attorney as special counsel."

I don’t mean to sound like a broken record.
But many political observers concede that Congress is broken. And it’s angling for a record in futility.
For nearly eight months, Congress has been stuck. Contemporary audiophiles using Spotify or Pandora can’t appreciate the frustration of buying ""Led Zeppelin IV"" at Camelot Music in the ‘80s, racing home, positioning the disc on the turntable – only to hear it skip.
I mean it’s one thing to tolerate the needle repeating on ""Four Sticks"" by Led Zeppelin. But on ""Stairway to Heaven"" or ""When the Levee Breaks""?
HOUSE GOP FOR SHUTDOWN AFTER CONSERVATIVES PROMISE REVENGE FOR BIPARTISAN SPENDING DEAL

The needle would simply jump on the vinyl to the outer groove. And the same riff, vocal, lyric or cymbal clash would repeat on an endless loop. If you were lucky, the needle might slide into the next sonic cavity after a few revolutions. The tune would get its groove back and the music continued, unabated.
But often, the needle dipped into that crevasse and never resurfaced, repeating the same bars of music.
Such is the case on Capitol Hill. Since last spring, the song remains the same.
Congress is stuck in a seemingly inescapable political trench. Lawmakers play the same chorus. The same guitar solo. The same refrain. Again and again.
However, there was one respite: The 22-day crisis over the House speakership in October.
But like that broken record, Congress skipped through arguments about keeping the government open, border security and assistance to Ukraine since last May.

That’s back when Congress approved a bill to lift the debt ceiling. Otherwise, Congress is on repeat.
The unremitting cycle on Capitol Hill is tedious. It attests to just how bogged down the 118th Congress is.
14 HOUSE DEMOCRATS JOIN REPUBLICANS TO REBUKE BIDEN OVER BORDER CRISIS
The warning signs came on the first day of Congress last year. The House voted ad nauseum to elect a speaker. It finally settled on Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. But the House ultimately decided to scratch McCarthy.
It’s been on reverb ever since.
Congress has now approved three stopgap spending bills since late September to avert potential government shutdowns. Then there was another Band-Aid in early November. Then an additional temporary bill last week. The next sets of deadlines are March 1 and March 8. Congress may be able to pass a few of the 12 annual spending bills by early March. But all 12 appropriations bills? The sides are still trying to settle the allocations for each sector of federal spending.
Nothing can move until congressional appropriators agree on how much they want to spend in each area. Otherwise, they just know the size of the overall spending pie, not the individual pieces.

Republicans may hold the majority in the House. But it’s Democrats who are are really in charge of passing legislation. Sure, Republicans can pass various ""messaging"" bills on their own about abortion and Biden administration policies they oppose. But the House only advances substantive legislation when nearly all Democrats are on board and various percentages of Republicans. That’s been true on the debt ceiling and government funding. Congress never deviated from that cycle.
Then there is the push for aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.
Bipartisan advocates for Ukraine really amped up their demand to assist with the war effort as winter loomed in Kyiv. Money was certainly destined for Taiwan. Then Oct. 7 happened. A push emerged to help Israel reload with weapons in its fight against Hamas. The border devolved deeper into a crisis. Border security discussions intensified in the fall. Some Republicans said they were willing to entertain the international assistance package requested by President Biden – especially money for Ukraine. But only if they marshaled a border security pact which they liked.

Talks between Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and James Lankford, R-Okla., escalated. There was even talk the Senate might try to vote on a border/immigration bill in mid-December. But negotiations lagged through the holidays. Picked up again. And the Senate still hasn’t produced an agreement.

The legislative algorithm never deviates. This isn’t even the pithy idiom of ""wash, rinse, repeat."" On Capitol Hill, lawmakers never made it to the shower stall. Any progress Congress would make on any of these subjects – even if it’s incremental – would be head and shoulders above what lawmakers achieved over the past eight months.
And so the congressional coda continues. Stuck in a parliamentary tape loop. It’s the opposite of The Beatles avant-garde ""Revolution 9."" That’s where the band assembled a noisy overdub of music and speech. The voice of a studio engineer fades up and repeats the phrase ""Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine"" at regular intervals. Play that section backwards and some believe the voice says ""turn me on, dead man."" That only intensified rumors that Paul McCartney unexpectedly died.
If there’s not a border deal soon, you might hear someone saying ""the border bill is dead. The border bill is dead."" It won’t matter whether you play it backwards or forwards. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other conservatives have already said as much for weeks – even though there’s no bill text to dismiss. In fact, criticism of the Senate negotiations by House conservatives of the border talks is also looped.
Maybe they never get a border agreement. Maybe they never get an accord on spending. Maybe Speaker Johnson punts yet again and does a fourth (!) temporary spending package to keep the government from closing in March.

The skip in the congressional record could be beyond repair.
Back with your turntable, you might find a speck of debris on the record, causing it to jump. You could fix this by simply cleaning the record with a microfiber cloth or even rubbing alcohol.
But other times, the record was just junk.
So, you’d take the damaged album back to the store. Maybe exchange it for something from Rush, Yes or The Who.
You’d hope that those records weren’t damaged, as well.
But after a while, people didn’t rely on vinyl records. Cassette tapes became the rage in the mid-80s. Compact discs soon leapfrogged cassettes. Most audio is now digital. Skips are a thing of the past.

D11BUETAH8_ZUJDZL0OF20EWQF,"US military is 'weak,' in danger of not being able to defend national interests: study",By Michael Lee Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 4:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-military-weak-danger-not-being-able-defend-national-interests-study,"Fox News congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie has more as the military struggles with enlistments entering the new year on ""Special Report.""
For the second consecutive year, a study has ranked the U.S. military as ""weak"" and warned that a lack of action could leave the armed forces incapable of defending vital American interests.
""The current U.S. military force is at significant risk of being unable to meet the demands of a single major regional conflict while also attending to various presence and engagement activities,"" reads the conclusion of the Heritage Foundation's 10th annual Index of Military Strength, which was released Wednesday.
The report paints a dire picture of the state of the U.S. military, with its current posture being rated at ""weak"" by the index for the second consecutive year, calling into question America's ability to meet security obligations and protect vital national interests around the globe.
The 664-page report addresses a wide range of issues, finding that almost no branch of the U.S. military is ready to face a major conflict. Those issues are most pronounced in the Air Force, which the index rated as ""very weak"" in 2023.
US PERSONNEL INJURED IN LATEST MILITANT BASE ATTACK IN IRAQ
The report rates each branch of service on its strength in capacity, capability and readiness, rating the branch power as either very weak, weak, marginal, strong or very strong. The Air Force rated as marginal in both capacity and capability while also rating weak for readiness. Overall, the report found that Air Force power currently rates as very weak, the lowest rating possible.

But the issues weren't just contained to the Air Force, with the Navy also coming in for ratings of very weak in capacity, marginal in capability and weak in readiness. That combined for an overall rating of weak, according to the index.
""For 10 years this index has monitored the U.S. Navy's slow decline while China's Navy has modernized and grown at a fast pace,"" Robert Greenway, the director of the Allison Center for National Security at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""Meanwhile, the Navy has had too little shipyard capacity to keep its fleet maintained, too few ships to pace the threats, and misguided leadership that has instigated a recruitment crisis. Advanced capabilities alone will not offset this, and action is needed to reverse the downward trends.""
The Navy's current power was rated as ""weak,"" according to the Heritage Foundation. (Heritage Foundation)
The Army didn't trend a lot better, the report found, coming in with weak capacity, marginal capability and very strong readiness, resulting in an overall rating of marginal, according to the index.
While the rating may seem better than the Air Force and Navy, problems loom on the horizon for the Army, including a shrinking force that Greenway called ""unsustainable"" in the long run.

""In just two years, the active-duty Army has shrunk from 485,000 to only 452,000 troops,"" Greenway said. ""This directly impacts both readiness and effectiveness as the Army is unable to fully man its formations. The recruitment shortfalls caused the Army to cut ‘end strength’ by 12,000 in [fiscal] 2023. This is unsustainable.""
The Army's power was rated as ""marginal,"" according to the Heritage Foundation. (Heritage Foundation)

The U.S. military's newest branch, the Space Force, had the same overall rating as the Army, coming in at marginal in all three categories and overall. Meanwhile, the Marine Corps recorded the only positive overall score in the index, rating as weak in capacity but strong in both capability and readiness, which resulted in an overall rating of strong.

A large chunk of the issue can be blamed on investment in the military, according to Heritage Foundation analyst for defense budgeting Wilson Beaver, who told Fox News Digital that U.S. spending on defense has continued to decline for ""decades.""
""As a percentage of GDP, defense spending has been in decline for decades. This while the military is being tasked by the president and the Congress to do just as much as it did when it was being funded at 6 to 10% of GDP,"" Beaver said.
Making matters worse is a recruiting crisis that has plagued the military in recent years, something Beaver argues has gone unaddressed by the current administration.
""The present recruiting crisis resulted in a shortfall of 41,000 in 2023 and is the worst in our nation’s history,"" Beaver said. ""If left unaddressed, it threatens the ability of the all-volunteer force to protect us. Rather than emphasizing merit and performance, President Biden and the senior leaders he has appointed choose to focus on the race and gender of candidates, attempting to use the military to promote their ideology.""

A White House National Security Council spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the U.S. has ""has the most powerful military in the world"" and that ""President Biden and his Administration are committed to ensuring the U.S. military remains capable of prevailing against any adversary.""
""President Biden and his administration are supporting our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Guardsmen, Marines, and Guardians in a multitude of ways: increasing military pay for a second year in a row, pursuing new economic opportunities for military families, expanding and modernizing the U.S. defense industrial base, and ensuring that U.S. forces have the capabilities they need to fight and win wars,"" the spokesperson said. ""The strongest, most professional, and most capable fighting force in the world requires support across the entirety of the U.S. Government. We again urge Congress to act quickly on the President’s supplemental funding request that will advance our national security and directly support and strengthen our military.""
When it comes to recruiting, the spokesperson added that the Defense Department is ""taking several steps to meet Americans where they are and talk about the value of service. They are best positioned to talk about their ongoing efforts.""
US FORCES STRIKE 2 HOUTHI ANTI-SHIP MISSILES, TWO DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAY
But the problem is not unique to just one administration, according to Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Dakota Wood, who told Fox News Digital the trend of a weakened U.S. military has been ongoing for years.
""Our people are great, but they are poorly served with old equipment, too little of it, and dangerously low levels of training … all of which are essential to protecting our country, the very reason [we] call upon them to serve,"" Wood said. ""And this isn’t a recent phenomenon; it is the result of years of bad defense policies, badly managed programs, and troubled funding across many years and a series of administrations. If our government is truly serious about the security of our country and in serving America in ways no one else can, it must get its act together in adequately funding defense, ensuring those tax dollars are wisely spent, and when it deploys our military, it is given missions that are achievable and are squarely in America’s interests.""

Those problems have extended to U.S. nuclear power, the report notes, which came in with an overall rating of marginal thanks to low marks in multiple categories.
""Our nuclear arsenal is rotting in place, and we are not moving with a sense of urgency to replace/modernize it,"" Robert Peters, a research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at Heritage’s Allison Center for National Security, told Fox News Digital.
U.S. military nuclear power was rated as ""marginal,"" according to the Heritage Foundation. (Heritage Foundation)
The military's weak rating comes at possibly the worst time in recent memory, with the U.S. facing multiple crises across the globe, including Russia's continued war against Ukraine, the fight against global terrorism, and increasingly hostile postures by Iran, North Korea and China.
According to the report, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and non-state actors such as terrorist organizations all pose a high threat to vital U.S. interests. The report rates China and Iran as aggressive threats, and Russia comes in at the highest rank of hostile. Meanwhile, both Russia and China are assessed as having ""formidable"" capabilities.
HOUTHIS STILL CONDUCTING ATTACKS BUT NEED TO ASK HOW MUCH OF CAPABILITY DO THEY WANT 'DEGRADED': PENTAGON
That threat is especially true when it comes to China's nuclear power, Peters said, telling Fox News Digital that the country is the ""fastest growing nuclear power on the planet.""
China and Russia both represent ""formidable"" threats to U.S. interests, according to the Heritage Foundation. (Heritage Foundation)
""We are now on year 14 of the U.S. nuclear modernization program. In that time we have built zero nuclear weapons,"" Peters said. ""According to the Government Accountability Office, we won’t be able to produce plutonium pits en masse before 2030. The newest nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal is 30 years old — some running on vacuum tubes and floppy disks.""
That sentiment was echoed by Jeff M. Smith, the director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, who told Fox News Digital that China is the top threat to American interests.

""China presents the United States with its most comprehensive and daunting national security challenge ... [Beijing] is challenging the U.S. and its allies at sea, in the air and in cyberspace,"" Smith said.
The new Heritage report, meanwhile, shows the U.S. may not be ready to meet that challenge.

""Unfortunately, the index also makes it clear that our military is woefully unprepared to tackle the growing threat from China and win the new Cold War. Major changes are needed, and they are needed now,"" Smith said.
Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a Pentagon spokesperson argued that the ""U.S. military is the strongest fighting force the world has ever known.""
""We have not reviewed the report and do not have a comment to provide on the index,"" the spokesperson said. ""Every day around the globe, the men and women of our Armed Forces safeguard vital U.S. national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting the American people.""
Meanwhile, an administration official took aim at the Heritage Foundation, arguing that the organization was at least partly responsible for holding up officer promotions amid multiple unfolding crises."
D3DPRHIERY_5UTDC11LH0QITC2,Republicans probe DHS Secretary Mayorkas over role in housing migrants on federal lands,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 4:30pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-probe-dhs-secretary-mayorkas-over-role-housing-migrants-federal-lands,"Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asks the Biden administration about top issues ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
FIRST ON FOX: House Republican leaders on the Natural Resources Committee are probing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) role in placing migrants on federal lands in New York.
In a letter sent Monday to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., who chairs the panel's oversight subcommittee, cited interviews they conducted with federal officials who confirmed DHS's involvement in the decision to house migrants at Gateway National Recreation Area's Floyd Bennett Field, managed by the National Park Service (NPS).
While DHS, according to the letter, intervened to ensure Floyd Bennett Field, in New York City's Brooklyn borough, would be leased to the local government for migrant housing, the land is managed by the Department of the Interior (DOI) and NPS. In one interview, a senior DOI official told congressional investigators that they ""did what DHS asked us to do"" when they moved forward with the plan last year.
""The Committee is deeply concerned with the Biden administration leasing NPS land for use as a migrant encampment, a use that is not only inconsistent with the National Park Service Organic Act, but publicly recognized as legally perilous by DOI,"" Westerman and Gosar wrote to Mayorkas.

""Moreover, the Committee is concerned with the role DHS played in the process, particularly as you described it in the letters to Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul and as described to Committee staff by DOI and NPS officials,"" the Republican lawmakers continued.
MAYOR'S OFFICE AVOIDS SAYING WHETHER IT BACKS NONCITIZENS VOTING AFTER WARNING MIGRANT CRISIS WILL DESTROY NYC
In August, Mayorkas sent letters to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, hitting back at the officials over their handling of the surge of migrants in New York City, Politico reported at the time. He further noted ""structural issues"" with New York's handling of the crisis and implored the city and state to accept a lease DOI sent for the temporary use of Floyd Bennett Field to house migrants.

Weeks later, on Sept. 15, DOI and the local parties executed the agreement to lease portions of Floyd Bennett Field's property. Officials then constructed temporary housing on land along the shore of Jamaica Bay.
However, the Republican leaders have pointed out that, prior to the decision to lease the property, Hochul noted the DOI had itself argued such an action would likely violate federal laws. The governor, who has called for federal assistance in dealing with her state's migrant influx, remarked one month prior that officials told her office ""they do not allow for use of shelter on any of their properties.""
REPUBLICANS FUME AT BIDEN FOR VACATIONING AS BORDER CROSSINGS EXPLODE: 'DERELICTION OF DUTY'
The Republicans have also probed how the White House Council on Environmental Quality appears to have allowed DOI to bypass the normal eco review process mandated under the National Environmental Policy Act. The 1969 law requires federal agencies to review the environmental impacts of projects and proposals on federal land before approval.

Meanwhile, the housing facility erected at Floyd Bennett Field has been heavily criticized by migrants as inhumane and, according to a Venezuelan mother of three interviewed by The City, ""like a hell."" Thousands of migrants at the encampment were evacuated earlier this month and sent to a New York City high school, forcing the school to cancel in-person classes.
The Natural Resources Committee's ongoing investigation comes as migrants continue to flood the southern border in record numbers and Republicans call for the Biden administration to make structural reforms to secure the border.

D4MGVGWBU1_UB47L4QKW0DP1NA,Washington state Democrats propose replacing term 'sex offender' to advance a 'person-first' approach,By Landon Mion Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 5:04am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-state-democrats-propose-replacing-term-sex-offender-advance-person-first-approach,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Democrats in the Washington state legislature have introduced a bill that would replace the term ""sex offender"" in an apparent attempt to avoid defining a sex offender by their crime.
House Bill 2177, if passed, would change the name of the Sex Offender Policy Board, or SOPB, to the Sex Offense Policy Board. The bill also adds a convicted sex offender to the board, as proponents argue the offender's ""lived experiences"" are ""invaluable.""
""One representative with lived experience with incarceration for a sex offense appointed by the chair of the sex offense policy board and approved by a majority vote of the board's voting membership"" would serve on the board, the bill states.
Board membership is not restricted to Level One sex offenders, who are least likely to recommit a sex offense, but rather, the bill allows Level Three, the most dangerous felons, to serve on the board, KTTH radio host Jason Rantz reported. The sex offender will serve alongside victims of sex crimes, who would be another new addition to the board.

The SOPB was created in 2008 to ""promote a coordinated and integrated response to sex offender management and create an entity to respond to issues that arise, such as integrating state and federal laws in a way that enhances the state's interest in protecting the community with an emphasis on public safety,"" according to its website.
State Rep. Tarra Simmons, a Democrat sponsoring the bill, called for a sex offender to serve on the board alongside sex offense victims and their advocates. Simmons served time for three felony convictions for possession of controlled substances and retail theft in 2011.
""I think that we all do better when we have a diverse legislature. That’s why I'm here,"" Simmons said at a House Community Safety, Justice, and Reentry hearing. ""And I'm proud to be here. I think I bring some lived experience that was missing from here. And while some people may have a stigma for people who have committed a sex offense, I think they have invaluable information to share that can really guide this board.""
SOPB chair Brad Meryhew spoke at the hearing in support of the proposal, saying he believes it brings to the board ""that sort of reality check that we always need in public policy.""
""And I welcome the opportunity to have those voices at the table and to do everything I can to facilitate their active participation in our process,"" he said.
Republican state Rep. Dan Griffey opposes the measure and questioned why the board would ""advocate"" for a sex offender.

During public testimony at the hearing, SOPB coordinator Whitney Hunt defended the legislation by arguing that the proposed change moves forward a ""person-first"" approach.
""This bill incorporates recommendations the board has previously indicated its support for regarding the use of person-first language,"" she said. ""This change aligns with best practices and research, and encompasses all the individuals involved and impacted by the sex offense management system, including victims.""
The apparent effort by Washington state Democrats to destigmatize sex offenders comes after other attempts to release them from prison.

In 2021, Democrats passed legislation to more easily distribute conditionally-released sexually violent predators across the state, including encouraging the predators to pursue a Less Restrictive Alternative, an outpatient treatment program in a community setting. State Sen. Christine Rolfes, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, said at the time that it is, in part, about letting ""people who are potentially dangerous, but not necessarily dangerous, back into communities where they can live safely and with their constitutional liberties protected.""
In 2022, the SOPB recommended the state end a rule prohibiting Less Restrictive Alternatives from being placed within 500 feet of a childcare facility. The board argued that ""there is no particular increase in risk associated with proximity to the location where individuals who have committed sexual offenses are housed."""

A federal jury in South Dakota has convicted two men on charges related to the 2022 kidnapping of an FBI employee.
The jury in Rapid City on Tuesday found 29-year-old Deyvin Morales and 25-year-old Juan Alvarez-Soto guilty of kidnapping, carjacking and other counts, the Rapid City Journal reported. Alvarez-Soto, who is from El Salvador, also was found guilty of unlawfully entering the U.S. after being deported.
Both men face sentencing April 12 and could get up to life in prison.

The men and a third suspect, 29-year-old Karla Lopez-Gutierrez, left Greeley, Colorado, on May 5, 2022, and were on a ""drug trafficking trip"" to South Dakota in a Ford Expedition, prosecutors said.

The Expedition was chased by a South Dakota trooper at one point before getting away. Nearly out of gas at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Morales told the others they needed to ""take over"" a new vehicle, Lopez-Gutierrez testified.
A short time later, the FBI employee was speeding in his Dodge Durango when he saw the Expedition and pulled over, believing it was a tribal officer. Prosecutors said the suspects took the Durango at gunpoint and forced the victim to go along.

When the group stopped to buy gas and zip ties at the town of Hermosa, South Dakota, about 22 miles from Red Shirt, the victim was able to escape.
Morales and Alvarez-Soto were arrested in Greeley, a week later. Lopez-Gutierrez was arrested in August 2022 in Loveland, Colorado. She pleaded guilty in August and is scheduled for sentencing Feb. 8.
Alvarez-Soto’s defense attorney, Alecia Fuller, cited ""a lot of doubt"" in the government's case. Fuller said there was no intent to harm the victim.
Jonathan McCoy, the attorney for Morales, said there was no proof that Morales was even present for the crime."
DHGVTX1Q0W_JOZBSTL38QTJYQT,Haley and Phillips outperform in New Hampshire but it's still a Trump vs. Biden horse race,By Liz Peek Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 11:37pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/haley-phillips-outperform-new-hampshire-trump-biden-horse-race,"Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume and former Trump senior counselor Kellyanne Conway provide voter analysis and examine factors driving ballot decision on 'Special Report.'
Dixville Notch went all in for Nikki Haley. Each of the town’s six citizens – the first to participate in New Hampshire’s GOP primary when its polling place opened at midnight -- voted for the former South Carolina governor.
That was not the only good news of the day for the lone remaining GOP challenger to former President Donald Trump. Haley lost the New Hampshire primary but she outperformed expectations and picked up some momentum going into upcoming primaries in Nevada and South Carolina. She proved she deserved to be in the race.
Nikki had jokingly encouraged New Hampshire voters to ""correct"" the outcome in Iowa, where she came in third, with 19.1% of the vote. Trump walked away with a resounding 51% of the vote in that state’s caucuses, and DeSantis won 21.2%. New Hampshire failed to do so, but they gave her a close second place behind Trump, allowing her to continue her campaign.
DONALD TRUMP WINS AGAIN, AS FORMER PRESIDENT QUICKLY BEATS NIKKI HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE GOP PRIMARY
Trump won with over 50% of the vote, as he did in Iowa. The two wins position Trump as the clear frontrunner in the race. His victory speech did not hit the gracious tone he struck in Iowa; he mocked Haley for sounding victorious, which she was not. As one analyst said, he would have done better to attack President Joe Biden as opposed to someone who has garnered a large following among moderate Republicans.
From the start, Haley has insisted she has always been underestimated. Her speech after the polls closed in the Granite state congratulated Trump, but also reiterated her arguments for being the better candidate.
She told supporters that ""New Hampshire is the first in the nation, but it’s not the last."" She also used the outcome of the race to remind voters that ""We keep moving up,"" and vowed that ""We are just getting started.""
Trump supporters derided Haley’s appeal to independents and even some Democrats, as well as her funding from ""establishment"" Republicans and those whom they scornfully describe as ""billionaire class"" donors. Haley turns all those criticisms around to claim she is the more electable candidate.
For the former South Carolina governor, the stakes in New Hampshire were huge. Because the Granite State hosts an open primary, which allows registered party members and so-called ""undeclared"" citizens to vote in both the Republican and Democrat nominating contests, Haley could appeal to both independents and moderates in her own party who were seeking an alternative to Trump.
TRUMP 'HONORED' BY NEW HAMPSHIRE WIN, SAYS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS 'VERY UNITED'
Chris Christie’s exit from the race ahead of the Iowa primary boosted her numbers, since those backing the former New Jersey governor mostly came aboard the Haley bandwagon. But then Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pulled out after the Iowa caucuses, stymieing Haley’s surge; the Sunshine state Republican quickly endorsed Trump and most of his supporters gravitated to the former president’s column.
Real Clear Politics polls going into the first-in-the-nation primary showed Trump beating Haley by 22 to 27 points; just before midnight on Tuesday night he was ahead by more than 11 points.
Trump’s lead in the polls widened after the Iowa caucuses as DeSantis got out of the race and maybe also because voters warmed to the possibility that the former president could actually win another four years in the Oval Office. Recent hypothetical match-ups between Trump and President Biden show the Republican challenger edging ahead both nationally and in several key swing states.
What seemed a long-shot comeback for Trump has suddenly become more credible.
Republicans in New Hampshire, as in Iowa, cited immigration and the economy as their top concerns. Those are meat and potato issues for Trump. With growing anger at President Biden for allowing eight million people to come across the border illegally, immigration is quickly emerging as the greatest weakness of the incumbent and the biggest potential winner for the former president.

Early Fox News voter analysis showed that about 77% of the people going to vote in the GOP primary were registered Republicans, while 10% were Democrats who changed their registration last fall to allow them to participate in the open primary, and 13% were independents. If those numbers hold, that was a disappointment for Haley; independents constitute 40% of all registered voters in New Hampshire and she needed those folks to turn out in much bigger numbers to pose any threat to Trump.
The contest differed from the Iowa caucuses in a couple of noteworthy ways. Only about 21% of voters were evangelicals in New Hampshire, compared to 46% in Iowa; some 49% described themselves as ""MAGA"" supporters, compared to 62% in Iowa. Both of those shifts should have boosted Haley’s chances, but they did not.
Trump supporters are pushing Haley to get out of the race. The next Republican presidential campaign contests are in Nevada with both a primary on Feb. 6, followed by a caucus on Feb. 8 ; South Carolina’s primary follows later in the month. Polls for that state, where Haley served as governor, show Trump ahead by 30 points on average. In the past week, the Palmetto State’s popular Sen. Tim Scott has endorsed the former president, along with Rep. Nancy Mace, boosting his chances even more.
If Haley cannot win her home state, or comes in a distant second, calls for her to exit and to bring the party together in fighting against another four years of Biden’s presidency will be deafening.
Democrats also held a primary on Tuesday in the Granite State, rebuffing Biden’s self-serving shuffling of his party’s contests in which he put South Carolina first – the state that arguably paved his path to the nomination in 2020.

Biden did not do well in New Hampshire in 2020; he was loathe to risk a repeat. In the end he had to rely on a write-in campaign to avoid embarrassment at the hands of Rep. Dean Phillips, a young first-term Minnesota congressman. Philips campaigned vigorously in New Hampshire, telling voters the truth -- that Biden is too old to serve another four years.
Phillips was a total unknown just a few weeks ago; by the time of the primary, he was polling at around 10%. He ended up winning over 20% of the vote; like Haley, he is well funded and will continue on.

FIRST ON FOX: Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake's campaign is pushing back on a claim by the now-former state GOP chair that he was ""set up"" by the conservative firebrand in a leaked audio recording allegedly containing what she says was an attempt to ""bribe"" her against running for Senate this year.
Arizona Republican Party Chair Jeff DeWit resigned with a lengthy resignation letter on Wednesday, one day after the audio recording was leaked and first reported on by the Daily Mail. In the letter, he claimed the recording was a ""deceptive tactic"" by Lake and accused her of being ""on a mission to destroy"" him.
""The tape speaks for itself: The Arizona GOP Chairman Jeff DeWit attempted to bribe Kari Lake. Thankfully, Kari is an extremely ethical person who rejected DeWit’s multiple attempts to offer her money and corporate board seats in exchange for Kari not running for public office,"" campaign senior advisers Caroline Wren and Garrett Ventry told Fox News Digital.

""She will be an incredible Senator for Arizonans. No one from the Kari Lake campaign threatened or blackmailed DeWit. It is unfortunate that Dewit hasn’t recognized how unethical his behavior was and still hasn’t apologized to Arizona Republicans. DeWit’s false claims are just par for the course. The Arizona GOP must be relieved to have his resignation. Now we can focus on getting ethical leadership and win big in 2024,"" they added.
Fox News has obtained the audio recording, but did not independently authenticate it. It appears to show DeWit asking Lake if there is ""any number"" that would entice her to ""take a pause for a couple of years."" However, Lake pushed back on the notion that she ""can be bought.""
""This is not about money, it's about our country,"" Lake said.
TIM SCOTT SETS CROWD ALIVE WITH ONE-LINER AFTER TRUMP SAYS HE ‘MUST REALLY HATE’ HALEY
In his resignation letter, DeWit acknowledged it was him in the recording and claimed Lake released a ""selectively edited audio recording"" of a more than 10-month-old private conversation between the two, and that it was ""taken out of context.""
""Contrary to the notion of me being an enemy of Lake’s, this conversation was recorded while I was actually employing Lake in my private company. In fact, for over a year and a half we had many conversations where I was looking out for her financial interests,"" DeWit wrote.
""Contrary to accusations of bribery, my discussions were transparent and intended to offer perspective, not coercion. Our relationship was based on friendship, and the conversation that is now being scrutinized was an open, unguarded exchange between friends in the living room of her house. I genuinely believed I was offering a helpful perspective to someone I considered a friend,"" he added.

Some Americans blasted Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker this week for touting another year of record-breaking weed sales in his state.
Pritzker wrote on X that Illinois had broken records in pot sales for the third year in a row on Sunday, celebrating his state's growing success in the cannabis industry since the drug's legalization in 2020.
But dozens of social media users slammed the governor on social media for bragging about increased drug use.
""For the third year in a row, Illinois had record-setting growth for adult-use cannabis sales,"" Pritzker wrote on X on Sunday. ""We’re building the most prosperous and accessible cannabis industry in the nation – taking steps to repair the damage of the past and creating real opportunity for all Illinoisans.""
The social media post garnered over 300,000 views and received hundreds of responses. A few X users said the governor should be more concerned about excessive drug use in his state's communities.

""What he is really saying is his state is such an unbearable hellscape that record numbers of people are retreating to weed for a temporary escape,"" one X user wrote. ""I don’t think I would be bragging about this.""
Another wrote: ""When pot, gambling and killing babies are your growth industries, you got problems.""

Pritzker signed a bill in June 2019 legalizing adult-use cannabis, but the law didn't go into effect until Jan. 1, 2020.
Since then, in-state residents' pot sales have boomed, increasing from $39 million in January 2020 to $117.9 million in December 2023, state data show.
""Most adults would feel shame with growing drug use in their communities,"" one user wrote.
Another X user wrote: ""The state of Illinois is a proud drug dealer. What kind of message is this for young people?""

Some X users raised concerns about the dangers of excessive marijuana use as legalization efforts have made the drug more readily available.
The high-THC level drug and its products have sometimes been linked to an increased risk of addiction and psychosis, a 2022 study published in Lancet Psychiatry found.
Marijuana users who have had at least one psychotic episode after using cannabis are also almost 50% more likely to develop schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, according to a 2017 study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The risk was even higher for teens and young adults.
More potent marijuana and increased use has contributed to higher rates of psychosis, particularly in young people, recent studies have shown.  (iStock)

As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott continues to tout the state’s right to self-defend itself from a migrant invasion, some Democratic lawmakers are calling on President Biden to take control of the state’s National Guard.
Abbott issued a lengthy statement Wednesday, saying the federal government broke the compact between the U.S. and the individual states.
""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now,"" Abbott said. ""President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""
Abbott is fighting multiple legal battles with the Biden administration, which has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass. Texas has also filed lawsuits against the administration, which cut razor wire set up by the state on the Rio Grande to prevent migrants from illegally crossing into Texas, as well as the establishment of buoys on the river.
ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS ‘RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE’ FROM MIGRANT ‘INVASION’ AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN

While Abbott issues statements about the Biden administration overstepping its authority, Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, is accusing the governor of taking a play out of former President Trump’s playbook.
""Greg Abbott has continued to use political stunts and inflammatory language to advance his own agenda, violating the Constitution and endangering both U.S. citizens and asylum seekers,"" Casar posted on X. ""Abbott is following the Donald Trump playbook: making immigration harder and more dangerous, so asylum seekers are pushed into the hands of cartels and the system remains broken.""
Casar continued with a string of posts, saying he agreed with Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who on Tuesday tweeted Biden should seize control of the Texas National Guard.
CRITICS BASH SCOTUS DECISION ALLOWING FEDS TO CUT RAZOR TEXAS INSTALLED TO STEM ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS
The Supreme Court this week found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas along the border. The state answered by publishing images of it strengthening physical barriers along Eagle Pass.
The administration has also sued over a recently-signed law that allows Texas state and local officials to arrest illegal immigrants. The administration has accused Texas of interfering with federal control over immigration and border security, and said it is putting both agents and migrants in danger.
""Governor Greg Abbott is using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border,"" Castro posted to X on Tuesday. ""If Abbott is defying yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, @POTUS needs to establish sole federal control of the Texas National Guard now.""
TEXAS AG PAXTON PROMISES ‘FIGHT IS NOT OVER’ AFTER SCOTUS RULE ON BIDEN ADMIN'S RAZOR WIRE CUTTING
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, who is running for governor in the state, also called out Abbott for ""using the Texas Guard to defy a Supreme Court ruling.""
""When Gov. Orval Eugene Faubus did this in 1957, [President] Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas Guard to ensure compliance with the law,"" O’Rourke tweeted. ""Biden must follow this example of bold, decisive leadership to end this crisis before it gets worse.""
DOJ RENEWS SCOTUS PUSH TO ACT AFTER TEXAS SEIZES BORDER AREAS, BLOCKS BORDER PATROL FROM ENTERING
Abbott is not alone, though, in his fight for his state’s right to bolster protection along the border between Mexico and Texas.
In fact, former Republican presidential candidate and current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state will continue assisting Texas.
""If the Constitution really made states powerless to defend themselves against an invasion, it wouldn’t have been ratified in the first place and Texas would have never joined the union when it did,"" DeSantis posted on X. ""TX is upholding the law while Biden is flouting it. FL will keep assisting…""
SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH BIDEN IN TEXAS BORDER WIRE CASE; BORDER PATROL UNION BLASTS THE DECISION
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, also a Republican, re-posted a video on X of the Texas National Guard marching.
""Oklahoma stands with Texas,"" Stitt wrote.
Abbott made many arguments in his statement on Wednesday, which are unlikely to dissuade the administration, which has cited Supreme Court precedent for federal control over the immigration and border authority.

The administration also claims it is following immigration law, while pointing to numbers of removals since May that outpace all of FY 2019.
Instead, the administration says it needs additional funding from Congress and comprehensive immigration reform to correct what it claims is a ""broken"" system.

DTN7X35QQH_R8VQ91XHCEKR2OI,Turkey’s parliament agrees to vote on Sweden’s NATO membership after prolonged debate,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 12:08pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkeys-parliament-agrees-vote-swedens-nato-membership-prolonged-debate,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Turkish legislators on Tuesday began debating a long-delayed bill to approve Sweden’s bid to join NATO, in a step that could remove a major hurdle for the previously nonaligned Nordic country’s entry into the military alliance.
Turkey, a NATO member, has been dragging its feet on ratifying Sweden’s accession for more than a year, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups it regards as security threats. It has been seeking concessions from Sweden, including a tougher stance toward Kurdish militants and members of a network that Ankara blames for a failed coup in 2016.
Turkey has also been angered by a series of demonstrations by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party in Sweden as well as Quran-burning protests that roiled Muslim countries.
HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT TURKEY'S DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SWEDEN'S BID TO JOIN NATO
Last month, parliament’s foreign affairs committee gave its consent to Sweden’s bid in the first stage of the legislative process, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent its accession protocol to lawmakers for approval.

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)
Erdogan’s ruling party and its nationalist allies command a majority in parliament and the protocol was expected to be approved in a vote later on Tuesday. It will come into effect after its publication in the country’s Official Gazette, which was expected to be swift.
Arguing in favor of Sweden’s membership last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Burak Akcapar cited steps Sweden had taken to meet Turkish demands, including lifting restrictions on defense industry sales and amending anti-terrorism laws.
Sweden has pledged deeper cooperation with Turkey on counterterrorism and to support Turkey’s ambition to revive its EU membership bid.
Turkey’s main opposition party also supports Sweden’s membership in the alliance but a center-right party indicated it would oppose it.
""Sweden's steps concerning its extradition of wanted criminals or the fight against terrorism have remained limited and insufficient,"" Musavat Dervisoglu, a legislator from Good Party told parliament.
Erdogan has linked ratification of Sweden’s NATO membership to the U.S. Congress’ approval of a Turkish request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and kits to modernize Turkey’s existing fleet. He has also urged Canada and other NATO allies to lift arms embargoes on Turkey.
TURKISH AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATE 8 BODIES THAT WASHED UP ON MEDITERRANEAN COAST, INCLUDING AT A RESORT
Sweden and Finland abandoned their traditional positions of military nonalignment to seek protection under NATO’s security umbrella, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming NATO’s 31st member, after Turkey’s parliament ratified the Nordic country’s bid.
Hungary has also stalled Sweden’s bid, alleging that Swedish politicians have told ""blatant lies"" about the condition of Hungary’s democracy. Hungary has said it would not be the last to approve accession, although it was not clear when the Hungarian parliament intends to hold a vote.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced Tuesday that he sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to discuss Sweden’s entry into NATO.
NATO requires the unanimous approval of all existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary were the only countries that have been holding out, frustrating other NATO allies who had been pressing for Sweden and Finland’s swift accession."

(The Image Direct for Fox News Digital)
Alec Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter on Friday in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of ""Rust"" in 2021, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.
It is the second time a grand jury has indicted Baldwin for Hutchins' death. Baldwin was originally charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter on Jan. 31, and the charges were later dropped in April.
""We look forward to our day in court,"" Baldwin's lawyers, Alex Spiro and Luke Nikas, told Fox News Digital Friday when the new charge was released.
In November, video was released from the ""Rust"" set which showed Baldwin telling crew members to move out of the way as he prepared to shoot his weapon.
Celebrity attorney, Christopher C. Melcher, partner at Walzer Melcher & Yoda, told Fox News Digital that the bombshell video may have been the catalyst for prosecutors to refile charges against Baldwin.

""The outtakes that were released in the fall were helpful and hurtful to his defense. It showed him directing a crew member to stand away from the direction that Alec was pointing his pistol,"" Melcher said. ""That establishes that Alec was acting safely at the moment when handling a firearm (which is good for him), but it also shows that he understood the rules of gun safety (which shows he acted without due regard for safety when he shot Halyna Hutchins and Joel Souza).""
Hutchins was killed on the New Mexico set of the Western film, and director Joel Souza was wounded by a bullet from a weapon Baldwin was holding while rehearsing a scene in a church on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin has denied he pulled the trigger of the gun that killed Hutchins.
""Actors are not expected to be gun experts, but Alec was handed a real firearm and pointed it at two people without checking himself to see if it was unloaded, or having the prop master do that for him. It is standard procedure to ensure that a firearm is unloaded when using it on the set,"" Melcher said.

""Alec would have followed that process hundreds of times in his career. But this time he took possession of the firearm, pointed it at two people and shot them. It would have taken seconds to determine there was a live round in the gun. The failure to use due care when handling a deadly weapon is not an accident, it is a crime.""

""The failure to use due care when handling a deadly weapon is not an accident, it is a crime.""
The video, released in November by NBC News, showed Baldwin on set days before Hutchins' death. He could be heard telling crew members to move out of the path of the gun.
""Now wait a second. I'm going to shoot right,"" Baldwin said. ""Do you mind going to the other side of the camera? I don't want to shoot toward you."" At another point, Baldwin seemed concerned for the safety of whoever is behind the camera, saying, ""I don't know why you're going up hills and all this other — you're going to break your f---ing neck.""

Kate Mangels, partner at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir LLP, told Fox News Digital that the prosecution may have a stronger case against Baldwin this time around due to new testing on the weapon, which Baldwin has strictly denied he ever fired.
""Baldwin’s attorneys can argue that a test on a reconstructed gun with new parts cannot be proof of what occurred with the original gun,"" Mangels said.
""They can also point to any inconsistencies between the two tests. In addition, evidence that Baldwin pulled the trigger is not dispositive of his guilt. The prosecution will still need to show evidence of his mental state and knowledge of the danger involved.""
Rither Alabre, former New York prosecutor and partner in the White Collar Defense & Investigations Practice Group at Blank Rome, told Fox News Digital, ""At the time they dismissed the charges, prosecutors made it clear that the dismissal did not absolve Baldwin of criminal culpability and the prosecutors reserved the right to refile charges.""

However, he noted how jurors would be less likely to err on Baldwin's side now. ""Most will see this as another celebrity trying to not take accountability for their actions, coupled with the fact that guns don't magically fire themselves, especially those that were in working order and the FBI validated – which is a big problem for him,"" Schiffer told Fox News Digital.
""There's certain people who feel like he's gone through hell. His reputation has been severely damaged. His film career has been decimated, so he's paid some price, but not in the eyes of the law.""

Despite ""Rust"" forever having a hold over Baldwin, Schiffer believes Alec's career could still possibly rise again.
""There is a currency that comes from massive attention even though it's a negative sentiment, and that attention over time, the memory dissipates as to the negative side,"" Schiffer said. ""What doesn't dissipate is the awareness factor of those individuals. As humans, people like, or are more interested in those we know, even if in the beginning it was a negative sentiment.

DVOEKQF9RD_CRY283CKDMPLTXV,Four important lessons from DeSantis' failed presidential campaign,By Colin Reed Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 1:44pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/important-lessons-desantis-failed-presidential-campaign,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspends his 2024 Presidential campaign after a disappointing Iowa performance and endorses former President Donald Trump. CREDIT: DeSantis Campaign
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley caught some grief earlier this month for declaring the GOP primary a two-person race after the Iowa caucuses. Turns out, she was proven right after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis bowed out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday.
The news caught some by surprise, but the evidence was hiding in plain sight. DeSantis had bounced back and forth between events in New Hampshire and South Carolina, hardly the sign of a candidate with confidence or a plan. His Sunday show appearances were canceled. Questions about his financial viability were swirling, a situation sure to be exacerbated by the single digit finish he was trending toward in the Granite State. DeSantis was at six percent in the Real Clear Politics average, far behind both Trump (47%) or Haley (33%).
After New Hampshire, the South Carolina primary was not until February 24 – an eternity for a campaign in its death rattle and whose political obituaries had been written in searing levels of detail.
HALEY RALLIES SUPPORTERS AGAINST TRUMP AFTER DESANTIS DROPS OUT: 'MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN'
There are lessons coming out of the DeSantis failure. Here are four of them.
It doesn’t matter how well financed the outside efforts are. By law, super PACs are independent entities. They cannot compensate or make up for the deficiencies of a candidate or the people around them. Never Back Down, the DeSantis affiliated PAC, started the 2024 effort with $269 million dollars. Their candidate leaves the race with 9 delegates. That math isn’t pretty.
The Florida Republican was one of the few GOP bright spots in the 2022 midterm elections. And that led to all kinds of expectations about his White House prospects.
FLORIDA GOV. RON DESANTIS DROPS OUT OF 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, ENDORSES TRUMP
No doubt, winning re-election in a landslide in Florida was an impressive accomplishment. So was attracting the support of voting blocs who have eluded Republicans in recent years, such as Latinos, who broke for DeSantis by 58%. With his COVID-19 policymaking looking better over time, DeSantis had a story to tell. His state’s population was growing by leaps and bounds.
Yet success at a state level does not always translate nationally. It didn’t help that from the jump, DeSantis took the brunt of the attacks from former President Donald Trump and his allies.

In Iowa, DeSantis traveled to all 99 counties and lost by 30 points. New Hampshire’s population of 1.3 million people (the majority of whom get their news from one media market) means voters expect to kick the tires on their candidates in personal interactions. It was not the best fit for a candidate like DeSantis, who has never been the most natural campaigner and whose own state has 10 media markets and more than 20 million residents.
DeSantis offered himself as a younger version of Trump without all the messy baggage. Primary voters stuck with the original, especially as President Joe Biden’s numbers plummeted and anyone with a pulse appeared on a glide path for the White House.
At 45-years-old and with three years left as the governor of the nation’s third-largest state, it’s unlikely we’ve heard the last of Ron DeSantis. His state is thriving and has become the epicenter of the conservative ecosystem. Time will pass, and he will have a chance for another political act. Like others vanquished foes falling in line with the former president, DeSantis’ quick endorsement of Trump was intended to start the healing process.
With DeSantis back in Florida on the eve of the first in the nation primary, Haley gets a clean shot at the former president, something that never materialized for his 2016 challengers.

Eight years ago, there were eight serious candidates competing in New Hampshire. With his committed core of voters and high floor of support, Trump has always reaped the rewards of a fractured field.
Now there are just two. Trump remains the frontrunner, but as we’ve seen before, the unexpected can happen when the voters have their say.

Thailand’s Constitutional Court ruled Wednesday that popular progressive politician Pita Limjaroenrat, who was blocked from becoming prime minister even though his party placed first in last year’s election, did not violate the election law and can retain his seat in Parliament.
Pita had been suspended from the legislature pending the court ruling on whether he violated the law by owning shares in a media company. He was the executor of his father's estate which included stock in ITV, a company that is the inactive operator of a defunct independent television station.
The court agreed with Pita's contention that ITV was not an operator of a media business.

By law, political candidates are prohibited from owning shares in any media company when they register to contest an election.

(AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)
Pita was forced to step down as leader of the progressive Move Forward Party when he was suspended from Parliament.
The party's election victory last year reflected a surprisingly strong mandate for change among Thai voters after nearly a decade of military-controlled government. But the party was denied power by members of the conservative unelected Senate.
The Senate, whose members were appointed by the military, joined the elected lower house in casting votes to choose a prime minister under a constitution that was adopted in 2017 under a military government. The Move Forward Party now heads the opposition in Parliament.
The nine-member panel of judges ruled 8-1 in Pita’s favor on Wednesday.
""ITV did not operate any newspapers or media businesses, therefore, the shareholding didn’t violate the Constitution's Article 98. According to the above reasoning, the accused member's parliamentary status isn’t suspended,"" the ruling said.
""I’m happy and will keep working as planned,"" Pita said after the verdict.
About 40 supporters who had gathered outside the court with signs and flowers cheered Pita as he walked out.
""There is justice for the people. At first, I didn't trust the court but now I see justice,"" said Jiraporn Bussawaket, 76.
Pita still faces another serious legal challenge this month.
On Jan. 31, he is to appear again in the Constitutional Court in another case in which he and his party are accused of attempting to overthrow Thailand’s system of government by proposing an amendment to a law that makes it illegal to defame Thailand’s royal family, an offense known as lese majeste.
THAILAND COURT SENTENCES POLITICAL ACTIVIST TO 50 YEARS IN PRISON FOR INSULTING MONARCHY
Critics say the law, which carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, is often abused as a political weapon.
The monarchy is considered by many people to be central to Thai identity, and conservative Thais insist that it must be protected.
While the complaint only calls on the party to stop promoting an amendment, its current leader, Chaithawat Tulathon, has said an unfavorable ruling could be used in future cases against the party that could lead to its dissolution. Move Forward’s predecessor, the Future Forward Party, was dissolved by a Constitutional Court ruling in 2020.
Move Forward’s supporters have criticized the cases as dirty tricks similar to ones that have long been used by the ruling conservative establishment to oust political rivals using the courts and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election Commission as legal weapons."

Hunter Biden’s business associate Rob Walker is set to appear for a closed-door transcribed interview at the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees on Friday morning to discuss his role in being an alleged ""vehicle"" for the Biden family to receive foreign funds.
Walker is set to appear at 10 a.m. on Capitol Hill after being subpoenaed by both House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan in November.
His testimony comes as part of the House impeachment inquiry against President Biden.

In notifying his attorney of his subpoena, Comer and Jordan explained that Walker set up his limited liability company, Robinson Walker LLC. The chairmen said it was ""used as a vehicle to receive foreign funds and send a percentage of the money to Biden family members.""
One example Comer and Jordan provided is when Joe Biden served as vice president, Robinson Walker LLC received millions of dollars from a company owned by Gabriel Popoviciu, a Romanian who was then the subject of a high-profile corruption prosecution in his home country.

""Following the receipt of this money, Robinson Walker sent over one million dollars to Biden family accounts, including those of Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden,"" Comer and Jordan wrote.
But Comer and Jordan flagged that those payments from Romania to Robinson Walker LLC started ""within approximately five weeks of then-Vice President Biden meeting with the President of Romania, where, according to the official readout, the issue of corruption was discussed.""

Comer and Jordan also note that Robinson Walker LLC received a payment of $3 million from State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company, in February 2017, less than two months after Biden left the Obama administration. Comer and Jordan said that in the three months following that payment, Robinson Walker LLC made ""incremental payments totaling over one million dollars to Biden family members and their companies, including Hallie Biden and entities associated with Hunter Biden and James Biden.""
According to an FBI FD-302 form detailing Walker's 2021 interview with Special Counsel David Weiss' team and obtained by the House Ways and Means Committee, Walker said the ""$3 million amount was more of a ‘thank you’ from CEFC.""
Walker said ""they talked of putting together a larger group and discussed acquiring office space.""
Fox News Digital in December 2020 reported that Hunter Biden, his CEFC associate, Gongwen Dong, and Joe Biden shared office space in Washington, D.C., in September 2017.
6 ADDITIONAL BIDEN FAMILY MEMBERS 'MAY HAVE BENEFITED' FROM HUNTER BUSINESS DEALINGS
Comer and Jordan have said that evidence collected by congressional investigators reveal that President Biden ""was at least aware of some of his family’s business ventures and sought to influence potential business deals that financially benefited his family.""
""Indeed, a Biden business associate, Devon Archer, testified how the Biden ""brand"" was used in retaining business, and that Joe Biden met with some of the foreign nationals who paid his family,"" Comer and Jordan wrote to Walker’s attorney.

Comer and Jordan said Walker may be able to provide evidence relevant to the impeachment inquiry, saying that Walker ""played a key role in the Biden family’s business dealings and the chain of complex financial transactions that was used to hide the foreign sources of the funds received by the Biden family.""
HOUSE OVERSIGHT SUBPOENAS HUNTER BIDEN, JAMES BIDEN, ROB WALKER FOR TESTIMONY AMID IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
They said Walker could provide information related to whether, among other things, Joe Biden, as vice president and/or president ""took any official action or effected any change in government policy because of money or other things of value provided to himself or his family, including whether concerns that Chinese sources may release additional evidence about their business relationships with the Biden family have had any impact on official acts performed by President Biden or U.S. foreign policy; abused his office of public trust by providing foreign interests with access to him and his office in exchange for payments to his family or him; or abused his office of public trust by knowingly participating in a scheme to enrich himself or his family by giving foreign interests the impression that they would receive access to him and his office in exchange for payments to his family or him.""

Meanwhile, a former Hunter Biden business associate told Fox News Digital that Walker is a ""good guy"" but just got ""tied up in the House of Biden dumpster fire.""
Walker’s transcribed interview is expected to take place a day after Hunter Biden’s business associate, Mervyn Yan, appeared for testimony and weeks before Hunter Biden appears for his deposition. Yan worked with Hunter in deals related to Chinese energy company CEFC.
Hunter Biden defied his subpoena to appear for a deposition on Dec. 13 and was at risk of being held in contempt of Congress.
His attorneys and the committees came to an agreement last week that the first son will appear for a closed-door deposition on Feb. 28.

Dean Phillips, D-Minn., tells ‘Cavuto Live’ that it is ‘nonsensical’ more Democrats are not running against Biden.
President Biden's campaign is increasingly concerned about Black voter turnout in the general election due to criticisms that the president hasn't done enough for their community, according to a new report.
Leaders in the Black community and political strategists told Politico they were concerned that Biden and Vice President Harris, while expected to do well in the South Carolina primary, have deeper problems with the critical voting bloc.
""I don’t think a good showing [in South Carolina] is a signal that Black people writ large or young Black people in particular have this overwhelming level of support for Joe Biden,"" Phillip Agnew, co-director of the group Black Men Build, told the outlet.

Agnew said that Black voters feel ""a deep, abiding lack of excitement"" for Biden's re-election campaign.
Former Michigan Democratic state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo said that Black voters do not believe that Biden has delivered on issues that matter to them, saying she did a recent survey of fellow Black community members.
""If this small inquiry is a sign of a much larger trend, then he’s in trouble,"" she told Politico.
""They feel he did what was necessary to secure the Black vote, but hasn’t delivered on Black issues,"" Gay-Dagnogo added, saying ""he brought in Kamala Harris and then basically locked her away for the last four years.""
The former state representative added the Biden campaign's heavy investment in South Carolina was not ""genuine engagement"" but ""house-is-on-fire engagement.""

""Some of that is the narrative in the media, some of that is the reality that it’s hard for people to see the impact of policy,"" Moore told Politico.
Biden's support among the Black community has shrunk in recent years, with Fox News polling indicating his approval slid 25% since 2021. He once stood at 87% approval, but that number declined to 62% in 2023.

EAO8L3UI64_WYCF4UWY19AZZRH,FDA approves first at-home sterile insemination kit to help with infertility: 'Gives me goosebumps',By Angelica Stabile Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:20pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/health/fda-approves-first-home-sterile-insemination-kit-help-infertility-goosebumps,"Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel explains to ‘Fox News Live’s’ Arthel Neville that this ‘doctor’s tool’ can help screen embryos, but cannot replace the doctor.
It's now possible for women to get pregnant via insemination in the comfort of their own homes.
The FDA recently approved the first-ever, at-home sterile insemination kit.
PherDal Fertility Science received clearance last month after various tests did not raise ""any new questions on the safety or effectiveness"" of the product, as stated in the FDA's approval letter.
STUDY SUGGESTS MEDITERRANEAN DIET COULD BOOST MALE FERTILITY
PherDal's creator and CEO, Dr. Jennifer Hintzsche of Dixon, Illinois, confirmed to Fox News Digital that there have been 34 babies born from the first 200 proof-of-concept kits that were released.
""Even saying that still gives me goosebumps,"" Hintzsche said in an interview.
Dr. Jennifer Hintszche is pictured with her husband, Ryan Westphal, and their two children, Lois and Zackary, in a 2019 portrait. (Brittany Moore )
The at-home kit is intended for users who are struggling to conceive or have chosen not to conceive naturally.
The kit includes three sterile, circular cups and three syringes, all packaged separately, for an independent-use option.
SOURCE OF SEVERE MORNING SICKNESS FOUND IN NEW STUDY, COULD ENABLE RELIEF DURING PREGNANCY
While other brands offer at-home insemination kits, PherDal is the only multi-patented, sterile, FDA-cleared at-home insemination device on the market, according to the company.
""Sterility matters because studies show that disruptions (dysbiosis) in the reproductive microbiome are linked directly to infertility,"" said Hintzsche.
The Hintszches are pictured with their daughter, Lois, on the left. Right, the PherDal syringe and circular sterile cup enable full access to samples. ""If you're paying $3,000 for a few milliliters of a sample, every drop counts,"" Hintzsche said. (Don Umland Photography/PherDal)
PherDal’s first batch of kits sold out in just 90 days, which is when Hintszche realized she might be ""on to something.""
""It really is a simple device, but there's so much science behind its effectiveness,"" she said.
Hintzsche said she assumed that after she married her husband in Oct. 2016, she would get pregnant, have multiple babies and live happily ever after ""behind a white picket fence.""
But after 14 months of unsuccessful conception efforts, she sought out a fertility specialist who ran some tests.
That’s when Hintzsche discovered that she had ""unexplained infertility,"" as the doctor said that ""everything looks normal"" and ""we don’t know what’s wrong.""
SPORTSCASTER ERIN ANDREWS TALKS MOTHERHOOD, FERTILITY CHALLENGES AND HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS
The doctor then handed Hintzsche an application for a $10,000 loan to begin IVF treatment.
As a biologist with a PhD, Hintzsche started digging into infertility research in search of an alternative to ""invasive"" treatments.
After marrying her husband in Oct. 2016, Hintzsche tried unsuccessfully for 14 months to get pregnant before seeking out a fertility specialist. (PherDal)
""Instead of going into the uterus, if you put [sperm] right at the opening of the cervix, and it was done [in a] sterile [manner] in the clinic, it had the same live birth rate [as IVF],"" she said. ""And I was like, ‘Why has no one ever offered me this?’""

Hintzsche got pregnant in Dec. 2017, after only two attempts with the kit.
Her daughter, Lois, was born on Sept. 11, 2018.
Motivated by that success, Hintzsche launched a new career with the goal of helping other people who were facing the same struggles.

""I think everyone deserves something they can try first, and it shouldn't take $10,000 just to [have the chance] to become a mother.""
Through feedback from PherDal customers, Hintzsche has fine-tuned her product to accommodate a variety of scenarios.

Many women report feeling ""shame"" when they face infertility, Hintzsche said — which is something PherDal aims to eliminate.
From other PherDal moms, Hintzsche has also heard that at-home insemination ""takes the pressure off"" couples who have gone to great lengths to conceive without success.
Many PherDal dads have reported that they’d rather not return to a clinic to provide a sample, since ""that’s not the way they envisioned growing a family,"" Hintszche said.

""It gives people this private, safe option that doesn’t [involve] any drugs,"" Hintzsche said. ""It’s not going to work for everyone … but for a lot of people, maybe the sperm just needs a little boost.""
It’s important for people to confirm with their doctor that it is healthy for them to become pregnant before attempting a method like PherDal, she added.
Dr. Remm Sabouni, a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist at Aspire Houston Fertility Institute, shared with Fox News Digital her appreciation for reproductive products that allow ""more choice while maintaining safety."" (She was not involved in PherDal's development.)
The expert noted that PherDal is potentially useful for members of the LGBTQIA+ community who would like to try at-home insemination.

It is also useful for patients who have undergone infertility evaluation and are seeking more natural options, she said, or for male partners who have erectile issues or who want to avoid intercourse as a means of producing sperm.
Sabouni did point out one ""major caveat"" of a product like PherDal, which is the challenge of understanding who qualifies as a good candidate for its use.
Dr. Hintzsche, pictured with her husband, named the product PherDal because she used her PhD to ""prove"" she was fertile, she said. (Dr. Jennifer Hintzsche)
The fertility expert cautioned about ""some pitfalls,"" including lack of fertility assessment and limited efficacy for certain medical conditions such as male factor infertility, tubal blockages or ovulatory disorders in women.
Sabouni also mentioned a lack of randomized controlled trials ""demonstrating the viability of this treatment"" — as well as the lack of medical supervision and the risk of misuse.

""While I recognize the potential benefits of such devices for at-home use, particularly for individuals and couples trying to conceive, I would strongly caution that they not be seen as a replacement for consulting with a fertility specialist,"" she said.
""If conception is not achieved after using these methods for a recommended period (typically a year for those under 35, and six months for women over 35 or with irregular periods), it is advisable to seek professional medical advice,"" the doctor added.
""I think everyone deserves something they can try first, and it shouldn't take $10,000 just to [have the chance] to become a mother,"" said the company's founder (not pictured). (iStock)
Customers do not need a prescription to purchase.
FDA clearance advises that consumers should only purchase the product for up to six months before seeking other options.
""It really is just an affordable and accessible way that people can try if they're struggling,"" Hintzsche said.

Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday the New Hampshire primary results are of ""great interest,"" but he has no news to report with regard to an endorsement for former President Trump.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday the New Hampshire primary results are of ""great interest"" but that he has no news to report with regard to an endorsement for former President Trump.
""I’ve stayed essentially out of it,"" McConnell told reporters after a GOP luncheon. ""But if I change my mind, I’ll let you know.""
McConnell's comments come after a growing number of Senate Republicans have thrown their support behind Trump in the 2024 presidential race ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. Several GOP lawmakers are also calling on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to drop out of the race so that the party can unite behind Trump as the Republican nominee.

""I don’t have any news to make today,"" McConnell said. ""We’re watching New Hampshire with great interest.""
Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., another Trump ally, said Tuesday that ""there's not a lot of love lost"" between Trump and McConnell without an endorsement.
""We all know that,"" Tuberville said. ""You hear the former president come after him, and the leader has not been very kind with his words.""
On Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential campaign in a video posted to X, subsequently endorsing Trump.

South Carolina Sens. Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham have also endorsed Trump, snubbing Haley despite her being the governor of the state from 2011 to 2017. Nearly a dozen other senators in the GOP have thrown their support behind Trump, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.
Last week, Trump secured a win in the Iowa caucuses during the first contest of the 2024 presidential election cycle.

EG7HCV5IBV_4MSK0SPR0CD3CH9,Florida House passes bill banning children under 16 from social media: 'Kids can't stay off the platforms',By Elizabeth Pritchett Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 2:19am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-house-passes-bill-banning-children-under-16-social-media,"Clinical psychologist Dr. Kevin Gilliland on the concerns with rising social media use among teenagers
The Florida House passed a bill Wednesday banning children under the age of 16 from creating accounts on social media platforms – even with parental approval – in efforts to keep children from growing up ""hooked"" on social media.
House Bill 1, which is sponsored by Republican Rep. Tyler Sirois, passed with a 106-13 bipartisan vote. Supporters argue that children are more exposed to bullying and sexual predators on social media, and use can lead to depression, suicide and addiction.
""They're taking advantage of kids growing up. That's their business model. And why do they do it? To keep them hooked ... with the dopamine hits that the platform gives our children with every autoplay, with every like, with every push notification,"" Sirois said toKids The Associated Press.
Though the bill doesn't explicitly name which platforms would be affected, it targets any social media platform that tracks user activity, allows users to upload material and interact with others, and uses addictive features. Apps used solely for private messaging between individuals would not be impacted.

Republican House Speaker Paul Renner said the bill should withstand constitutional scrutiny because it focuses on the addictive features of social media, not the content.
""It's a situation where kids can't stay off the platforms, and as a result of that, they have been trapped in an environment that harms their mental health,"" said Renner, who has made social media addiction and its impact on children one of his top priorities.
He continued on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday: ""We must address the harmful effects social media platforms have on the development and well-being of our kids. Florida has a compelling state interest and duty to protect our children, their mental health, and their childhood.""
The bill would force social media companies to shut down accounts believed to be used by minors and to cancel minors' accounts at their request or their parents. All information related to the account must also be deleted.
SENATORS LOOK TO BAN KIDS UNDER 13 FROM SOCIAL MEDIA IN BIPARTISAN BILL
Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner shared on the House floor some of the comments she received on X after referencing her deceased mother while announcing support for the bill, which included ""your mother sucks"" and ""your mom was stupid.""
""I'm 42-years old ... and comments like these were a gut punch to me, but I was able to navigate,"" she said. ""Imagine what our babies have to deal with when they have their friends in school doing the same cyberbullying to them.""
Opponents of the bill said it violates the First Amendment, takes away the benefits some children may get from social media, and said parents should determine if their children can be on social media.
Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani said she found comfort and support on social media when she was 13 after her mother died.
""I think the intention of those who have filed (the bill) is absolutely golden. We have a concern about the impact of social media on our young people,"" Eskamani said. ""I just find the solution that you propose too broad and casts a wide net with unintended consequences.""
Opponents of House Bill 1 argue that it not only violates the First Amendment, but takes away benefits children may receive from being on social media, such as the ability to ""gather information and learn about new opportunities."" (iStock)
Meta, which owns a handful of social media platforms, asked the House to consider requiring parental approval instead of banning the apps for children under 16. It also would like the issue to be addressed at the federal level to avoid a variety of state laws on the topic.

""Many teens today leverage the internet and apps to responsibly gather information and learn about new opportunities, including part-time jobs, higher education, civic or church gatherings, and military service,"" Meta representative Caulder Harvill-Childs wrote to the House Judiciary Committee. ""By banning teens under 16, Florida risks putting its young people at a disadvantage versus teens elsewhere.""
The bill now moves to the Senate.

Editor's Note: This article contains graphic depictions of animal torture.
A Pennsylvania woman has been charged with three counts of animal cruelty by ""torturing a chicken, a pigeon, a rabbit and frogs"" and other animals for attention on social media, according to a media report.
28-year-old Anigar Monsee, who lives in the township of Upper Darby, ran a YouTube account called ""Motheranddaughter"" which reportedly showed a ""scantily-clad woman torturing rabbits, chickens, frogs and pigeons by slowly disemboweling and otherwise mutilating the animals while still alive, and/or by severing the struggling and screaming animals’ necks with a dull knife over the course of several minutes,"" The Delaware County Daily Times reported Monday.
""The channel has over 20,000 subscribers and had been viewed over 1,800 times as of Monday,"" the outlet reported.

Most videos were extremely violent, with Monsee carving, maiming and killing animals on camera while she sang and did other actions to entertain viewers, the report said.
At times the videos had sexualized comments, The Delaware County Times wrote, and revealed an active online community with chat moderators and fans discussing requests.
But other videos were more personal in nature, including one posted in November that features the woman ""leading viewers on a tour through her new home during which a house number could be seen on the front door as well as identifying street markings from Marshal Road in Upper Darby.""
""On Friday detectives went to that apartment and interviewed Monsee who identified herself as the woman on the video."" Police confirmed the kitchen in the apartment was identical to the kitchen in one of her videos.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) reportedly tipped off local authorities after the organization received complaints about Monsee's violent YouTube channel.

Upper Darby Police Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt said the allegations of the case were disturbing.
""It’s just barbaric. It’s inhumane that someone could do that,"" Bernhardt said. ""She’s going to answer to all four of the incidents. Detectives looked into it and charged her. Hopefully it will send a message that this is cruelty.""
Bernhardt added that it was especially concerning that someone like Monsee was ""soliciting"" content like this and that people online are ""encouraging this.""
Monsee was later charged for all four incidents, the outlet revealed.
Monsee was arraigned on a $200,000 bail and is currently being held in Delaware County prison in advance of a Feb. 5 preliminary hearing.
PETA told Fox News Digital that it was ""relieved"" that Monsee was caught and punished for her crime of abusing animals.

""Hello, Virginia, and the real governor, Terry McAuliffe,"" Biden told a crowd in Virginia on Tuesday night in an event with Vice President Kamala Harris discussing abortion access.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk vowed Monday to keep supporting Ukraine against Russia's nearly 2-year-old invasion, announcing a new military aid package that includes a loan to buy larger weapons and a commitment to find ways to manufacture them together.
Meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, Tusk said they had reached ""an understanding"" to resolve through talks any differences between their countries over grain shipments and trucking. Those issues recently soured ties between the neighbors.
Ukraine’s allies have recently sought to reassure the country that they are committed to its long-term defense amid concerns that Western support could be flagging. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France’s new foreign minister also traveled to Kyiv in the new year.
POLAND'S PRIME MINISTER APPOINTS NEW HEADS OF STATE SECURITY
Tusk, who returned to power last month and is keen to show that a change in government won't alter its Ukraine policy, also met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal.

Kyiv was the first foreign capital he visited since becoming prime minister again, Tusk said. He returned to Polish politics after serving as president of the European Council — one of the European Union's top jobs.
He framed the war as a wider struggle between Europe and Russia that had repercussions beyond Ukraine, making it a priority for Poland.
""Today Ukraine is shouldering the security matters of the entire European continent, today Ukraine is paying the huge price of blood for the values that are fundamental to the free world,"" he said. ""Poland’s security is also at stake in this struggle.""
POLISH PRIME MINISTER TUSK SWORN IN, REPLACING CONSERVATIVE PARTY AFTER 8 YEARS
Zelenskyy described the talks as ""very productive"" and said Poland’s new military aid would include a loan allowing Ukraine to purchase big-ticket weapons. They also assessed opportunities for joint arms production, he said, in line with similar discussions with other allies.
Tusk's visit came a day after Moscow-installed officials in eastern Ukraine reported that Ukrainian shelling killed 27 people on the outskirts of Russian-occupied Donetsk. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it a ""monstrous terrorist act,"" and the Russia-backed local authorities declared a day of mourning.
The Ukrainian military, however, denied it had anything to do with the attack.
It was not immediately possible to verify either side's claims.
Located on NATO’s eastern flank, Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest allies. Warsaw has provided weapons and humanitarian aid, and opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.
But relations soured last year as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers angered Poles who said their livelihoods were under threat. Polish farmers and truckers blocked border crossings, causing backups and threatening the flow of some aid to Ukraine.
Polish farmers complained that imports of Ukrainian foods had caused prices to fall, hurting their incomes, while truckers said they were being undercut by their Ukrainian counterparts. The issue surfaced during the war as Ukrainian ports were blocked and food producers turned to road routes through Europe to get their products to market.
At one point, Poland and some other European nations banned Ukrainian grain imports because of the trade dispute.
Poland's farmers and trucks have ended the protests for now. Tusk has said Warsaw wants to help Ukraine economically but not at the expense of Polish businesses. He has previously suggested that Kyiv needs to better regulate its trucking industry.
Tusk was also scheduled to honor the country's fighters and attend observances of Ukraine's Day of Unity, which commemorates the merger in 1919 that brought together its eastern and western regions.
As part of the celebration, Zelenskyy signed a decree that, among other things, instructs the government to preserve the national identity of Ukrainians living in border regions that are now part of Russia, such as Belgorod, Kursk and Briansk. Some of those areas have recently been targeted by Kyiv’s forces.
The decree also aims to establish a center for investigating crimes against Ukrainians on those territories, including forced Russification, political persecutions, and deportations.
POLAND'S PRESIDENT AND NEW PRIME MINISTER REMAIN DIVIDED ON RULE OF LAW DESPITE TALKS
In other war-related developments, Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted all eight Shahed drones that Russia launched overnight over southern and central regions of Ukraine.
Debris from three drones shot down over the central Dnipropetrovsk region started a fire at an unidentified business but no casualties were reported.
Elsewhere, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi visited Kharkiv on the third day of his tour of the country. The second-largest city was among the targets of a Jan. 16 Russian missile attack that injured 17 civilians.
Later, Grandi visited children at a school that has relocated to the city’s subway system.
Meanwhile, major Ukrainian digital banking platform Monobank said it came under a massive denial-of-service attack by unidentified hackers. The attack was successfully repelled, the bank said, with no major consequences."

The Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince pleaded for the release of six nuns kidnapped last week and demanded that Haiti’s government crack down on gang violence, in a strongly worded letter released Monday.
The Archdiocese, along with the Haitian Conference of the Religious, said in the letter that Haitians are tired of the ""reign of terror"" imposed by armed groups and called on government officials to protect people and their property.
""On many occasions, the Church has denounced their silence, which is similar to an attitude of contempt for people’s suffering,"" the letter stated.
GANGS IN HAITI HAVE ATTACKED A COMMUNITY FOR DAYS AND RESIDENTS FEAR THE VIOLENCE COULD SPREAD
Religious leaders said they were distressed to witness that there has not been a serious response to what it called a scourge of kidnappings for more than two years. They said the ongoing violence has ""plunged the country into an increasingly confusing and chaotic situation"" as they called for the safe release of the kidnapped nuns without conditions.

The nuns and two other people were traveling aboard a bus in Port-au-Prince when they were kidnapped last Friday. No one has publicly claimed responsibility for the abduction.
6 NUNS KIDNAPPED IN GANG-DOMINATED HAITI
On Sunday, Pope Francis pleaded for their release. Speaking from a window of the Apostolic Palace to faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said he learned of the news of the kidnapping with sorrow: ""In asking fervently for their release, I pray for social harmony in the country, and I ask all to put stop to the violence, which causes so much suffering to that dear population.""
Gangs have been blamed for the kidnappings of nearly 2,500 people last year, a more than 80% increase compared with the previous year, according to U.N. statistics. Police remain overwhelmed and underfunded, with less than 10,000 active officers at a time in a country of more than 11 million people."
EMFNLN02SP_YPVILT70UAMO9PS,Newly appointed Republican environment committee chairman outlines climate goals,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 4:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newly-appointed-republican-environment-committee-chairman-outlines-climate-goals,"Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs tells ""Fox News Live"" that the world is at the beginning of a ""long Cold War"" with China and Russia.
EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., told Fox News Digital in his first interview since being appointed to chair a key environment subcommittee that he would use the position to combat climate change, an issue that has divided Republicans for years.
Carter — who House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., appointed to lead the panel's Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials Subcommittee — said climate change is a serious issue, pointing to rising sea levels in his coastal Georgia district. However, he argued that fossil fuels will be needed in the coming decades and the U.S. must onshore green energy supply chains.
""I think it's very important for conservatives to have a place at the table, a seat at the table,"" Carter told Fox News Digital. ""For instance, I went to COP28, and I'm glad I went. I won't kid you, there was a little bit of tribulation there at first because there are people in our party who are climate deniers — they don't believe in climate change.""
""Now, I don't believe that if we don't have this resolved by the day after tomorrow, we're all going to fry. But I do believe in climate change. vI believe that it's real. And I believe that it is impacted by man. And I believe it is cyclical and that we are going through one of those cycles,"" he continued. ""If we are just going to stick our head in the sand, we're going to miss the boat, we're not going to have an opportunity to be involved at all.""
WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED TO GRANT 'QUASI-REGULATORY AUTHORITY' TO FOREIGN GREEN GROUPS

In December, Carter, who also serves as a vice chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, traveled to COP28, the annual climate summit hosted by the United Nations. While U.S. representation at U.N. climate conferences has historically been dominated by Democrats and federal officials like President Biden's climate czar John Kerry, Carter said the event presented an important opportunity for conservatives to join the conversation.
For example, the Georgia Republican said COP28 created progress on advancing a pathway for future nuclear energy permitting, adding that Democrats acknowledged during the summit that they are beginning to favor an expansion of nuclear. During the summit, the Biden administration signed a pledge alongside more than 20 other nations to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050.
TOP HOUSE COMMITTEE PROBES JOHN KERRY'S COORDINATION WITH ECO GROUPS PUSHING COAL POWER SHUTDOWN
Among Carter's priorities leading the Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials Subcommittee will be to advance nuclear, a zero-carbon and dispatchable power source that faces a burdensome regulatory regime in America. Reforming nuclear regulations has long been a heated topic on Capitol Hill, but it has recently been pursued in bipartisan legislation.
In addition, Carter said another top priority of the subcommittee under his leadership will be clawing back green energy supply chains from China.

""We need to beat China. Let's face it, China is the OPEC of critical minerals. My district is one of the few districts in America that is mining critical minerals right now, and we need to do more of that,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""This attitude of ‘not in my backyard,’ we've got to get past that. We've got to have reliable supply chains.""
""The Biden administration's approach to this is dismal at best,"" Carter continued. ""It has not been good at all. They have really just turned a blind eye to the fact that we are too dependent on China and our adversaries for essential, critical minerals that we're going to have to have.""
EXPERTS RAISE ALARM AFTER BIDEN STRIKES AGREEMENT WITH CHINA TO SHUT DOWN FOSSIL FUELS
He said major green energy projects in the U.S., such as the $5 billion Rivian electric vehicle plant in his home state of Georgia, are reliant on pro-growth policies such as those in Georgia. He also noted a wide range of environmental regulations potentially blocking the U.S. from competing on producing and processing critical minerals required for green energy.

""We're not doing the processing here in America, they're doing it over in China. And they don't have regulations in China, they don't have an EPA in China. They just do whatever they have to do to get [it] done,"" he continued. ""Of course, we're more responsible than that and so are our allies. So, that's why we've got to take a balanced approach to this. But if we don't do processing here in America, then we're not going to be successful.""
In addition, Carter said fossil fuels shouldn't be demonized, adding that they will be vital to ensuring the U.S. can adopt green energy sources like solar and wind.

And he noted that U.S. carbon emissions have significantly declined in the past several years, thanks in large part to technological progress made by the fossil fuel industry.
""I believe in an all-of-the-above type energy strategy,"" Carter told Fox News Digital. ""Listen, I wish we could go to total solar and total wind and be done with it. But we can't, and it's naive of anyone to think that we can. But if we take an all-of-the-above type energy strategy, then I think we can achieve what everyone wants to achieve.""

The finding was announced in a report released last week from the American Cancer Society (ACS).
Titled ""Cancer Facts & Figures 2024,"" the report noted that at least 10 cancers are associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, liver cancer, anal cancer, lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.

HIV-infected people are also 10 times more likely to develop infection-related cancers compared to the general population, the report stated.

People with HIV are seeing longer life expectancy due to improved antiretroviral drugs, noted Nicole B. Saphier, M.D., a New York-based Fox News medical contributor — but this has also led to a higher risk of developing certain cancers.
COLORECTAL CANCER IS NOW LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH CANCER: NEW REPORT
""Decades ago, patients were dying from direct complications from HIV and cancers that developed because of a severely weakened immune system, such as lymphoma and Kaposi's Sarcoma,"" Saphier told Fox News Digital.
""Now, rates of those particular cancers have declined. However, deaths from other cancers have begun to increase, specifically cancers associated with other viruses like HPV.""
People with HIV are more vulnerable to cancer due to a compromised immune system, Saphier said.

Azra Borogovac, M.D., a hematologist at City of Hope Orange County in Irvine, California, noted that certain viruses can increase the risk of different types of cancers.
""As a hematologist who treats patients with blood cancers, I’ve seen that HIV-infected people are at increased risk for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"" she told Fox News Digital.
""In these individuals, lymphomas are typically more aggressive and are more likely to spread beyond the lymph nodes.""
HIV INFECTIONS HAVE DROPPED IN RECENT YEARS, CDC SAYS, BUT AGENCY CALLS FOR GREATER EQUITY
While HIV does not directly cause cancer, it affects the immune system in such a way that the person may become more susceptible to other infections that can lead to cancer, said Borogovac.
""When a virus invades the body, it can change the DNA of the cells in ways that make them more susceptible to becoming cancerous,"" she told Fox News Digital.
However, the outlook for both HIV and lymphoma have improved greatly over the years due to advances in research and treatment, the doctor pointed out.
Preventive screenings and vaccinations are key to curbing cancer rates among those with HIV, experts agree.
""The shift in mortality patterns underscores the importance of comprehensive health care strategies addressing both HIV management and cancer prevention in this population, including HPV vaccination and cancer screening,"" Saphier told Fox News Digital.

Borogovac said the best way to stop cancer is to prevent it in the first place.
""That starts with taking preventative measures to protect yourself from viruses such as HIV,"" she said.
NEW FDA BLOOD DONATION GUIDELINES EASE RESTRICTIONS FOR GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN
The virus spreads through bodily fluids, including blood, semen and breast milk.
To prevent transmission, it is recommended that people use contraceptives during sex, limit the number of sexual partners, get tested for HIV and avoid the use of drug needles, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
""While there is currently no vaccine that can protect against HIV, there are medications that help prevent it, including PEP and PrEP,"" said Borogovac.
""When a virus invades the body, it can change the DNA of the cells in ways that make them more susceptible to becoming cancerous.""
Overall, the impact of cancer on people who are HIV-positive is ""of great concern,"" the doctor said, noting that it reflects disparities in cancer care among at-risk groups.
""Many people with HIV face barriers to care — especially those who may not know they have HIV or do not have access to screenings and advanced treatments,"" Borogovac said.
Screening is critical to reducing risk, he noted, as individuals who are infected with HIV may not show physical symptoms for many years.

The CDC recommends that anyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once as part of their routine health care.
Despite the challenges that remain, Borogovac pointed out that there has been much progress in the treatment for the virus since the early days of the HIV epidemic.
""When a virus invades the body, it can change the DNA of the cells in ways that make them more susceptible to becoming cancerous,"" an oncologist told Fox News Digital. (iStock)
""Today, FDA-approved antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for everyone living with HIV,"" she said, noting that these therapies prevent approximately two-thirds of cancer in individuals with HIV.
""These breakthrough medicines help patients keep HIV under control and prevent transmission to others,"" Borogovac noted.

EMXI2AITWS_822XMZZHVNEJIY8,Hunter Biden's 'sugar brother' lawyer confirms he still holds stake in Chinese state-backed equity fund,"By Joe Schoffstall , Cameron Cawthorne Fox News","Published January 23, 2024 3:45pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-bidens-sugar-brother-lawyer-confirms-he-still-holds-stake-chinese-state-backed-equity-fund,"The Five co-hosts discuss the Hunter Biden investigation as hes to appear for closed door House depositions Feb. 28.
Kevin Morris, a lawyer and close friend of Hunter Biden, confirmed to lawmakers that he still holds a stake in a Chinese private equity firm that he took over from the president's son.
Morris, who has been dubbed Hunter's ""sugar brother"" for loaning him millions of dollars to pay off back taxes and other bills, told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees last week that he still holds a 10% stake in the Chinese private equity firm Bohai Harvest RST LLC (BHR). Morris initially acquired the shares after purchasing Skaneateles LLC, a company that Hunter had previously owned, in the fall of 2021 as pressure mounted for Hunter to divest.
In a transcript reviewed by Fox News Digital, Morris invoked attorney-client privilege when asked how ""it came up that he would purchase Skaneateles,"" but said he eyed BHR because he thought it would be a promising investment. However, during the interview, he claimed he couldn't recall ""exactly what [the investments] were,"" but said he remembers ""going through them"" and thought they were ""infrastructure"" related.
""I did the transaction because, you know, I evaluated it as a businessman, and I thought it was something that could be a very successful investment,"" Morris said. ""I — you know, but I did diligence on the assets. I knew what — I knew what Hunter paid for it in the beginning, and I saw, and I still see upside.""

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)
Morris, who stated he purchased Skaneateles for $157,000, was then pressed on only paying that amount for the 10% stake in the Chinese equity firm.
""Look, I am going to do the best I can, okay? Morris responded. ""I thought it ended up being 157 in cash. There was also a payment in there for — there was a $250,000 payment for a loan. I can't remember if that's part of that transaction, but if it is — that's what it does — and whatever the — I believe those two were combined for the purchase price.""
Morris said he has not received any payout from BHR since he purchased Skaneateles in 2021.
Before Morris took over the BHR shares, Hunter Biden continued owning a stake in the firm after his father pledged in October 2019 to keep his family free of foreign entanglements if he was elected president.
""No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,"" now-President Biden said at the time, despite Hunter reportedly living at the White House for an unknown amount of time and participating in official White House events, including state dinners and an official trip to Ireland. Other Biden family members have also visited the White House throughout his administration.
KEVIN MORRIS GAVE 'MASSIVE' FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO HUNTER BIDEN, RAISING CAMPAIGN FINANCE CONCERNS: COMER

During the 2020 campaign, now-White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, who was a spokesperson for the Biden campaign at the time, took a shot at the Trump campaign in April 2020, calling the campaign's communications director Tim Murtaugh a ""liar.""
""When it was announced that Hunter Biden would be quitting the board of a Chinese equity firm, lots of news outlets credulously reported it,"" Murtaugh tweeted, quote-tweeting a report about Hunter still being listed as a director and owning a 10% equity stake in BHR. ""Six months later, records indicate that Hunter has not, in fact, quit. Will the mainstream media be following up?""
Bates, who would later be implicated in the ""Russian disinformation"" narrative to discredit Hunter Biden's laptop, then responded to Murtaugh while quote-tweeting a Washington Post ""fact checker"" sharing a screenshot of a letter dated the same day as the tweet, which appeared to show BHR CEO Jonathan Li confirming to Hunter's lawyer that Hunter was no longer an ""unpaid director"" as of October 2019.
Fox News Digital reached out to the White House to inquire whether Bates was aware that Hunter still held his stake in BHR when he attacked the Trump campaign regarding Hunter's involvement with BHR, but he did not respond.

In late December 2020, Hunter still owned the shares in BHR less than a month before his father took office. In November 2021, Chris Clark, who was a lawyer for Hunter at the time, told The New York Times that Hunter ""no longer holds any interest, directly or indirectly, in either BHR or Skaneateles.""
The Washington Free Beacon reported in 2023 that Hunter's stake in the Chinese private equity firm had moved to Morris after he had purchased Skaneateles.
Hunter previously sat on the Chinese firm's board — whose financial backers include the Bank of China — before announcing in October 2019 that he would be stepping down over mounting scrutiny of his father's presidential bid.
In December 2013, Hunter traveled with his dad on an Asia trip, which included China as a stop, and introduced him to Li in the lobby of the hotel where the U.S. delegation was staying. A recent closed-door interview with Hunter's former business partner, Devon Archer, revealed that the elder Biden would have coffee with him too during the visit. Less than two weeks later, Hunter would enter into a joint-venture called BHR Partners, a Beijing-backed private equity firm controlled by Bank of China Limited.
Hunter initially invested $420,000 in BHR in October 2017 through Skaneateles. His interest in the company spiked to an estimated $894,000, according to a March 2019 email from his former business partner, Eric Schwerin.
Morris told lawmakers he did not know whether Hunter could buy back BHR in the future.
Following Morris' interview with lawmakers, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer released a statement expressing concern about the lawyer's financial support for his own client. Comer claimed that Morris' actions raised ethical concerns, noting the millions of dollars the lawyer had previously loaned to Hunter.

""Shortly after meeting Hunter Biden at a Joe Biden campaign event in 2019, Kevin Morris began paying Hunter Biden’s tax liability to insulate then-presidential candidate Joe Biden from political liability. Kevin Morris admitted he has ‘loaned’ the president’s son at least $5 million,"" Comer said. ""These ‘loans’ don’t have to be repaid until after the next presidential election and the ‘loans’ may ultimately be forgiven.""
""Since Kevin Morris has kept President Biden’s son financially afloat, he’s had access to the Biden White House and has spoken to President Biden,"" he added. ""This follows a familiar pattern where Hunter Biden’s associates have access to Joe Biden himself. As we continue more interviews this month and the next, we will continue to follow the facts to understand the full scope of President Biden and his family’s corruption.""
Morris said that while he did loan Hunter money, the two consulted counsel on the transactions and that he is ""confident"" Hunter will repay him. In addition, Morris denied ever believing the president or his administration would give him anything in return for the loans, saying his ""only goal"" was to help a friend and that there is no prohibition against that.

Yale Law School dean Heather Gerken is now reportedly one of the top candidates to take over as Yale's president despite a series of scandals, according to a recent report.
""She would be the worst choice out of all the current faculty,"" one student told the The Washington Free Beacon. ""Her handling of campus politics has been abysmal.""
The news comes after current Yale President Peter Salovey announced he would step down after the academic year.

Gerken has faced a series of controversies throughout her career, including when her chief of staff, Debra Kroszner, told Jewish students to seek counseling after Hamas' terror attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, the Free Beacon reported.
""I understand these are deeply challenging times,"" Kroszner wrote in an email to a Jewish student who had been ""personally targeted on a large listserv where some students were endorsing terrorism and blaming Israel for Hamas’s actions,"" per the outlet.
Gerken has also championed diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at Yale Law School.
""In July 2020, two months after the death of George Floyd, she sent out a school-wide email with the subject line, ‘Yale Law School’s Commitment to Anti-Racism,’"" according to the Beacon.
""We recognize that our colleagues of color, particularly our Black colleagues, have long done more than their share of the unrecognized work of citizenship in combating racism and racial oppression,"" Gerken wrote at the time.

The report continued: ""The email announced the creation of new centers on ‘health equity’ and ‘environmental justice’; pledged to appoint a diversity specialist to every office in the law school; committed to bringing a million books to prisons across the country and creating ‘opportunities for incarcerated people to interact with authors and the literary community'; [and] said that a course on critical race theory would be offered every year; and promised to ‘diversify the iconography of the Law School through portraits, photographs, and art.""
Gerken, however, has ""refused to display a painting of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas,"" one of the school's most famous alumni. Instead, a ""portrait of Justice Sonia Sotomayor adorns the law school’s largest classroom.""

EPV302Y0CQ_SC96FOWOLJ30WWG,"New Hampshire sent message, but it wasn't about Haley, Trump, Phillips or DeSantis",By David Marcus Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 3:09pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-hampshire-message-haley-trump-phillips-desantis,"New Hampshire Journal managing editor Michael Graham, Fox News’ Bill Melugin and Boston Globe opinion writer Carine Hajjar discuss immigration as the top issue for New Hampshire voters on ‘Fox News @ Night.’
I learned something Tuesday night as I came to realize that somehow, in the very strange place we call New Hampshire, anything can happen.
Nothing that I expected came to pass in the primary there, and like a loser at the racetrack tearing up tickets, I shook my head in stern consternation.
But something gave me pause because this column that you are reading was supposed to be a requiem for the New Hampshire primary, and it still might be, but, suddenly, I’m not so sure.
HALEY LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY AGAINST TRUMP, BUT FACES 'CHALLENGING ROAD' AHEAD IN GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
The Democrats may never vote first in New Hampshire again, and GOP primaries may not be enough to sustain its storied position, but even this down at the heel iteration of the event offered some important surprises.
As I outlined in earlier columns here, there was no juice this time in the Granite State, the circus did not come to town, this was the consensus of everyone I talked to, lifelong residents whose memories stretched to Truman and Muskie said so.
But for Republicans there were two possibilities, either Trump would knock Haley out with a blow out, or she would stay close and live to fight on.
The results from the voters were right down the middle, you’d need instant replay review to splice the difference between a big Trump win and a Haley moral victory.
There is a fluidity about the New Hampshire primary that courts surprises and game changers, in 1972 it was Ed Muskie’s emotional breakdown, in 2024 it was Ron DeSantis’ surprise move to drop out less than 72 hours before voting started.
FOX NEWS LEADS CABLE COVERAGE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY, CRUSHES CNN AND MSNBC'S COMBINED PRIMETIME VIEWERSHIP
That decision profoundly changed expectations, with DeSantis in, the conventional wisdom was that Haley needed to get within single digits of Trump, with the Florida governor out, and the two person race a reality, as Haley predicted, the 11 point deficit by which she lost punched her ticket to South Carolina.
That is what the New Hampshire Primary does and why it may have redeemed itself as the rightful first primary in the nation.
There was never a particularly good reason why New Hampshire should go first, the best is probably that it is small enough for residents to kick the candidates’ tires, but it's not the only small state.
And traditions do go by the wayside over time, but the potential loss of New Hampshire’s primary status feels like more than a loss of mere trappings, it feels like it would break a connection to our past.
CBS NEWS ANCHOR ADMITS NO ONE HE TALKED TO OUTSIDE NH GROCERY STORE IS 'FEELING GOOD ABOUT ECONOMY'
The New Hampshire primary creates beautiful weirdness like Vermin Supreme, who has been running for president here since 1992, wearing a rubber boot on his head with a platform of free ponies and time travel. He is a local legend.
He and many others are part of a unique fanfare and pageantry, one in which this year former Senator Scott Brown’s rock band headlined a political event, and all of it is in celebration of one very important and very American idea, the joy of voting.
The potential erasure of the New Hampshire primary would not be the only political norm we have lost of late.
Consider the likelihood that neither of the two candidates in the general election will have participated in a single primary debate, consider further the bizarre but real possibility that there will be no debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
RAMASWAMY: HALEY SHOULD DROP OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, AS OBSERVERS SAY SHE'S STILL ‘ALIVE AND KICKING’
Meanwhile, and in large part thanks to Covid, we no longer have election day, we have election weeks or months in which early voting is the norm, not the exception.
We can’t say we weren’t warned, this is all part of that new normal we were promised.
So here we are, the Democrats all but canceled the New Hampshire primary, there won’t be any debates, oh, and the presumptive GOP nominee is under 91 indictments and might be banned from the ballot in several states.
Also, nobody seems to want a rematch between Biden and Trump but somehow it is as inevitable as the sunrise.
The basic infrastructure and style of American presidential elections is transforming before our eyes.
All of this should make us consider comments last year from Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum in which he wondered whether we even still need elections.
""...since the next step could be to go into prescriptive mode, which means you do not even have to have elections anymore because you can already predict,"" Schwab asked an expert in AI adding, ""Because we know what the result will be. Can you imagine such a world?""

When Americans envision the end of elections, or the end of our democratic republic, we tend to imagine bold proclamations, or military coups, but what if that isn’t how it happens?
What if it is a slow erosion of tradition, of participation, what if the holy hijinx of American elections is replaced by a cold analytics, giving us the leadership we didn’t even know we wanted?
This is why we need the New Hampshire primary, debates, a celebratory election day, and to avoid any plans coming out of the WEF like the plague.
Andy Warhol said that in the future everyone will have 15 minutes of fame, New Hampshire says that every 4 years anybody can have 15 minutes to try to become president, and some of them do.

As one local put it to me, ""The spirit of the New Hampshire primary is stronger than the quality of the candidates in 2024."" I sincerely hope this is true because we continue to lose so many traditions in this post-COVID world, this awful new normal.
We need the New Hampshire primary, it is part of who we are, and once again, in 2024 the people of that great state showed why, this primary season is only moving on to South Carolina because they decided that it should.

EQBQLJ2031_PTALBOL1DQJT7M1,Here’s how you’re subsidizing left-wing advocacy in the Supreme Court,By May Mailman Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 5:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-how-youre-subsidizing-left-wing-advocacy-supreme-court,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists May Mailman and Nicole Neily discuss a California judge dismissing a parent's gender identity lawsuit.
It’s no secret the Left weaponizes the court system to create unpopular and dangerous policies they cannot pass democratically.
I faced this endlessly as an attorney in the Trump White House, where the Left used the courts to demand, among other things, an open border, an end to abundant and reliable energy, and the erasure of women, including women’s sports.
Today, as the director of Independent Women’s Law Center, a nonprofit that advocates in court for the continued existence of women’s spaces, my eyes are wide open to the cost of bringing and maintaining lawsuits.

So who’s funding the insanity?
You are.
SUPREME COURT APPEARS READY TO REEL IN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN LANDMARK CHALLENGE FROM EAST COAST FISHERMEN
America’s biggest law firms rake in billions of dollars from corporate clients and use the profits to make our world less free, less upwardly mobile, more dangerous, and more racially divided. Remember, lawyers are a liberal bunch, donating more than 80% to Democrats during the 2020 cycle.
Law firms goad their woke attorneys into working sweatshop hours for corporate clients by promising the opportunity for ""pro bono"" work (i.e. free or discounted work) for causes they care about: defunding the police, ending border security and pushing gender ideology.
In 2022, the top 200 law firms contributed more than 5.01 million pro bono hours. But law firms aren’t spending the hours you’d hope in local court representing individuals down on their luck.
To the contrary, prestigious law firms spent an overwhelming number of pro bono hours writing amicus briefs, at free or reduced rates, in the Supreme Court. Perhaps not surprisingly, new scholarly research demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of these briefs advocate high-priority progressive causes.
Professor Derek T. Muller canvassed amicus briefs filed in the Supreme Court between 2018 and 2021. Two-thirds of all pro bono amicus briefs filed by big law firms during this four-year period supported a liberal activist position.
TRUMP BELIEVES SCOTUS WILL ‘INTERVENE’ IN STATE BALLOTS CASE, ‘WILL NOT TAKE THE VOTE AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE’
The skew is even more pronounced in hot-button issues, like whether Catholics can participate in foster care, whether law-abiding Americans have the right to carry firearms, or whether a 1964 law protecting employees from sex discrimination covers transgenderism. Ninety-five percent of the briefs in those cases urged the justices to legislate from the bench policies that lack popular support, cook up constitutional ""rights"" never mentioned in our actual Constitution, and disregard the constitutional rights clearly listed.
Amicus briefs are only a snapshot of the well-financed, concerted effort by Big Law to advance the radical agenda. Big Law also devoted countless hours to litigation and advocacy on behalf of Leftist causes.
For example, in one recent case I worked on, Kansas had enacted a reasonable election integrity law prohibiting activist groups from pre-filling ballots, often riddled with errors, and mailing them to voters.
Simpson Thacher, one of the world’s largest law firms (making $2.15 billion annually) sprinted into Kansas to challenge the state’s democratically enacted law. Deploying almost 10 attorneys for a full-blown federal trial cost the firm 2,000 hours, and, assuming an average rate of $800 an hour, $1.6 million (and counting, because the case is ongoing).
Who funds Simpson Thacher? Their paying clients: Dell Technologies, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo to name a few.
JAN. 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024
And Simpson Thacher doesn’t even rank on Professor Muller’s offender list. Paul Weiss leads the pack, alongside WilmerHale, Covington, Latham & Watkins, Sidley Austin, Morrison & Foerster, and Ropes & Gray. Covington, for its part, brags that it stopped the Trump administration from determining how many illegal aliens reside in America, litigates to stop voter ID, and defends sanctuary cities.
These firms’ clients include Chevron, Oracle, Bristol Myers, Monsanto, Intel, Dow Chemical, Instacart, Bain Capital, and more pharmaceutical and Silicon Valley companies.
These companies (and countless lesser-known businesses) are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars, sometimes millions, in legal services, some of which goes to fund efforts to sue police departments out of existence and turn the cities in which these companies are located into sanctuary cities.
Sounds like a bad deal to me.
Most CEOs are not politically radical. Sure, they parrot leftist slogans and kneel before the ESG gods so their companies can continue to secure low-interest loans and do business with Biden’s cash cow agencies. But these individuals and their businesses thrive under precisely the opposite policies being pushed by Big Pro Bono.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Muller’s research should serve as a wake-up call to every company seeking to access free markets and eliminate red tape. And it should alarm CEOs who care about the democratic process and American ideals despised by the Left.
There are lots of law firms out there. Why reward the worst offenders and hire them? At the very least, there’s no need to pay full price.
If Leftist litigators want to turn America into California, they should at least sell clients on their plan. But so long as American companies ignore the ways in which their lawyers spend their money, the Left will continue to have unlimited resources to make policy inside the courts and outside the legislative process.

ESSZ0F8HZA_2UNZ134QN1JHC54,"Will AI ever outsmart humans? In some ways, it already has",By Michael Lee Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 2:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/will-ai-ever-outsmart-humans-in-some-ways-it-already-has,"FOX News’ Eben Brown reports on artificial intelligence becoming more common for students, both in and out of the classroom.
The rapid development of artificial intelligence has led some to fear dangerous scenarios where the technology is smarter than the humans who created it, but some experts believe AI has already reached that point in certain ways.
""If you define it as performing intellectual but repetitive and bounded problems, they already are smarter. The best chess players and GO players are machines. And soon we can train them to do all tasks like that. Examples include legal analysis, simple writing and creating pictures on demand,"" Phil Siegel, the founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation, told Fox News Digital.
Siegel's comments come after a new survey of nearly 2,000 AI experts found that opinions differed as to when the technology would be able to outsmart humans. To narrow down just how smart AI could be, respondents were given a list of human tasks ranging from writing a high school history essay to full automation of all human labor and tasked with predicting when AI might be up to the task.

For some tasks such as the high school history paper, the experts said the technology will already be capable of the feat within the next two years. But being able to replace all human labor is more distant, the survey found, with the majority of experts predicting that such a feat will not be achievable for AI this century.
""They can write short stories now, but they need lots more information about human nature to write a bestseller. They can write a movie, but maybe not a hit movie. They can write a scientific paper but can’t execute all the instructions to perform a complex atomic level experiment at a supercollider,"" Siegel said of current AI platforms.
""Maybe someday they can do those things as well, but we need lots of data to train them to do things like that well. Then there is maybe another level — training them to read human nature on the fly to do complex decision-making like running a company or a university. The level of training for humans is so complex and not well understood for those tasks that it could take a very, very long time and huge computation for them to be superior at those tasks.""
""It’s not a question of if AI will outsmart us but when. We simply cannot compete with the raw processing power.""
Samuel Mangold-Lenett, a staff editor at The Federalist, shares a similar sentiment, noting that some AI platforms can already carry out tasks that would be impossible for humans.
""AI is a relatively young field and products like ChatGPT can already do complex tasks and solve problems in a matter of seconds that would take humans months of complex thought and lifetimes of practice. So, in some ways, it already has outsmarted us,"" Mangold-Lenett told Fox News Digital. ""Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is something else that needs to be considered. Theoretically, AGI can surpass all the intellectual capabilities of man and can perform every economically important task. It may be better to ask whether AI is capable of attaining sentience and what this means for humanity.""
Some experts believe a world in which AI can outsmart its human creators is inevitable, opening up debate about how such technology will change society.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND US NUCLEAR WEAPONS DECISIONS: HOW BIG A ROLE?
""It’s not a question of if AI will outsmart us but when. We simply cannot compete with the raw processing power,"" Jon Schweppe, the policy director of the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. ""This is the appeal and the value [added] of AI — the ability for a computer to process data and produce output in a much more rapid and efficient way than if humans were doing the work. But this will obviously have incredible effects on society — some good and some bad — so it will be important for our lawmakers to guide the tech companies and help them to chart a responsible path forward.""
Some of those developments could be dangerous, warned Pioneer Development Group chief analytics officer Christopher Alexander, especially if the technology falls into the hands of less responsible actors.
""Our growing obsession with hypothetical Skynet situations has been derailing the serious policy conversations we need to have now about developing and deploying Al responsibly.""
""U.S. autonomous weapons systems, by policy design, are not allowed to kill human beings without a human approving, but consider this very plausible scenario: A defense contractor develops an AI that can control autonomous vehicles. The project is canceled, and the AI is incredibly effective but has some flaws. The Chinese, who have already stolen trillions of dollars of U.S. intellectual property over the past decade, steal the AI. The Chinese use the flawed AI in an autonomous drone and it runs [amok], killing innocent people and damaging property for two hours,"" Alexander told Fox News Digital. ""This won't end the world, but it is certainly possible.""
But Jake Denton, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center, told Fox News Digital some of the more extreme predictions about the dangers of AI have been exaggerated.

""At this stage, the fear of superintelligent Al bringing about some form of techno-dystopia feels misplaced. These sci-fi doomsday scenarios have become a major distraction from the real and pressing issues we face with Al policy today,"" Denton said. ""Our growing obsession with hypothetical Skynet situations has been derailing the serious policy conversations we need to have now about developing and deploying Al responsibly.""
Denton listed several ways AI can be developed responsibly, including transparency standards, open sourcing foundational models and policy safeguards.
""AI progress does not have to be catastrophic or dystopian. In fact, these technologies can greatly empower and enhance human productivity and performance across industries. Al does not necessarily have to replace human workers but can rather amplify their capabilities,"" Denton said. ""The path forward we should strive for is not Al displacing labor but rather augmenting it. We have an opportunity to uplift humanity through optimizing the interplay between human strengths and Al capabilities."""

Burgum praises 'sophisticated' New Hampshire voters who are 'going to send a message to the world',By Andrew Mark Miller Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 2:16pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gov-burgum-praises-sophisticated-new-hampshire-voters-who-are-going-send-a-message-world,"Burgum told Fox News Digital New Hampshire voters will send a ""message to the world"" on Tuesday night
LACONIA, New Hampshire — North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum spoke to Fox News Digital in New Hampshire Monday about why voters in the Granite State are so important to the political process of choosing a president.
""The thing that's great about New Hampshire voters is they're so sophisticated,"" Burgum said at a rally in support of former President Trump. ""I mean, it's not just that they're, you know, watching cable news. I mean, they're reading stories.
""They're on the ground. They understand the issues. They understand the differences, because everybody over the years has campaigned here in both parties. They're close to the big media markets like Boston. They see what's going on.""
Burgum said he and his wife Catherine have been traveling around New Hampshire to ""coffee shops, retail locations and town halls,"" and he has seen an impressive level of sophistication from residents ""young and old.""

""America needs to understand how seriously voters in the two places, Iowa and New Hampshire, take this process and when they send a signal. It's not because they got influenced by, you know, being barraged by mailers or TV ads,"" Burgum said. ""These are people that have met every candidate, and I respect that. I respect Iowa and New Hampshire voters so much, and I'm telling you, they're going to send a message to the world tomorrow.""

""What pundits say about picking cabinets and picking people to serve in the Trump administration, that's great fodder for news, but it's not even relevant,"" Burgum said. ""Our job right now as Republicans is to make sure that President Trump wins the nomination.""
Burgum explained that ""we've got to go win a big battle against Joe Biden and the Democrats in the fall.""

""That's where the focus for everybody should be and certainly for myself. I didn't run for president to become a cabinet official,"" Burgum said. ""I didn't run for president to become part of someone's administration. I spent my life in the private sector, and I've got 100 opportunities back in the private sector.""

Americans for Prosperity Action, the political wing of the influential and deep-pocketed fiscally conservative network founded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, admitted that GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley has a ""steeper road ahead"" facing former President Trump in South Carolina.
Reacting after Trump clinched his second straight victory in the New Hampshire primaries Tuesday, Americans for Prosperity Action Senior Advisor Emily Seidel said the results in New Hampshire ""show that Nikki Haley is closing the gap and that she is the clear alternative for voters who are ready to close the book on the toxic Biden-Trump political era.""
""This is still an uphill battle. Now all eyes turn to South Carolina, where she has a steeper road ahead,"" Seidel said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. ""For the past several months, we’ve been engaged in races for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and presidential levels to prevent a scenario where one party progressive rule comes to Washington, D.C. at a time when our country can least afford it. If Republicans nominate Donald Trump, we risk a repeat of the past three elections and the very real threat of full progressive control increases dramatically.""
Seidal went on to say of Trump, ""This is why Joe Biden and the Democrats want him to be the nominee. The stakes for our country simply couldn’t be higher.""

""Our teams will continue talking to South Carolina voters in support of Nikki Haley. We are laser focused on electing the candidates who can be the firewall preventing one party progressive rule of the federal government. We have three ways to win the Senate, the House, and the presidential primary. Through our multi-pronged effort we are prepared to get this done. I'm proud of our activists' ongoing efforts. Despite challenging conditions, their support shows that AFP Action consistently takes principled and tough action when our country needs it most.""
A conservative group with powerful grassroots outreach, Americans for Prosperity Action endorsed Haley in November and pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars to help push the GOP past Trump.
After knocking out most of the field with a commanding win in Iowa, Trump achieved another victory in New Hampshire, but Haley still vows to stay in the race. She is set to campaign in the U.S. Virgin Islands and in South Carolina on Wednesday as the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination moves beyond the first two voting states.

HALEY LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY AGAINST TRUMP, BUT FACES 'CHALLENGING ROAD' AHEAD IN GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
Trump flew back to Florida on Tuesday night after a strong performance in New Hampshire. It was his third straight New Hampshire primary victory, tying a record previously held by Richard Nixon, who won the event in 1960, 1968 and 1972. Trump is the first presidential candidate to win three consecutive New Hampshire primaries.
The next primary is scheduled for Feb. 3 in South Carolina on the Democratic side, while the South Carolina Republican primary is Feb. 24.
Despite Haley previously serving as South Carolina's governor, the current governor, a slew of statewide officials and four out of the six Republican U.S. House members from the Palmetto State are backing Trump, as well as both the state's U.S. senators, Sen. Lindsey Graham and former GOP presidential rival Sen. Tim Scott.

EZDEGI3JI6_6A9PQRYXIKR9XZ5,GA Senate launches committee to probe Trump prosecutor Fani Willis for 'improper' affair,By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 12:24pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ga-senate-launches-committee-probe-trump-prosecutor-fani-willis-improper-affair,"The 'Outnumbered' panel discussed the latest on the misconduct allegations targeting Fulton County DA Fani Willis after the unsealing of prosecutor Nathan Wade's divorce documents.
Georgia's GOP-controlled Senate on Friday voted to form a special committee to investigate Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis amid revelations she had an ‘improper’ affair with subordinate counsel.
The special committee would have subpoena power to investigate Willis over allegations she hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade for the case because of their alleged romantic relationship.
The Senate voted 30 in favor and 19 against the resolution.
Republican Sen. Greg Dolezal introduced the measure, saying that ""the multitude of accusations surrounding Ms. Willis, spanning from allegations of prosecutorial misconduct to questions about the use of public funds and accusations of an unprofessional relationship, underscores the urgency for a thorough and impartial examination.""

""We owe it to the public to ensure transparency, accountability and the preservation of the integrity of our justice system,"" he added.
According to court documents filed last month by Michael Roman, a co-defendant of former President Donald Trump, Willis, who brought election interference-related charges against Trump, has been having an ""improper"" affair with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she hired to help prosecute the 2024 GOP front-runner.
According to the court documents, Wade, who has no RICO and felony prosecution experience, billed taxpayers $654,000 since January 2022.
Roman’s filing alleges that Wade billed Fulton County for 24 hours of work on a single day in November 2021, shortly after being appointed as a special prosecutor, and that Willis financially benefited from her alleged lover’s padded taxpayer-funded salary by taking lavish vacations together on his dime.

Byrd is particularly critical of Willis for indicting Republicans ""who used their First Amendment rights to question the results of an election — something other Democrats have done in the past when they post important elections,"" Byrd said. Notable examples include Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams, according to Byrd.
Additionally, Byrd highlights a potential conflict of interest in Willis hiring a ""potential paramour"" in the case against Trump.

See the moment bystanders spotted the national bird!
A Montana felon previously convicted of killing eagles to sell their parts on the black market was sentenced to three years in federal prison on Wednesday for related gun violations.
U.S. District Judge Susan Watters in Billings sentenced Harvey Hugs, 60, after he pleaded guilty in September to being a felon in possession of firearms. Prosecutors said the Hardin, Montana, man used the guns to shoot federally protected eagles over more than a year and then sold the birds' parts to an informant for profit.
A 2021 search of Hugs' home and vehicles found eagle parts, two rifles and ammunition, according to court documents. Investigators recovered parts of 21 different eagles, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
'KILLING SPREE’: TWO MEN CHARGED WITH SLAYING BALD EAGLES, SELLING BODY PARTS FOR PROFIT
""While it is unknown how many eagles Hugs took by shooting or trapping, the location, type, and amount of evidence reflect his criminal enterprise was expansive and protracted,"" prosecutors wrote in recommending a prison sentence.

(Spenser Heaps/The Deseret News via AP, File)
Hugs was sentenced last June in Rapid City, South Dakota, to three years in federal prison after being convicted by a jury for trafficking golden eagle feathers, wings and tails in violation of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.
The two sentences will be served concurrently, according to court documents. Hugs public defender in the Montana case, attorney Edward Werner, did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages seeking comment.
Hugs has an extensive criminal record including convictions for involuntary manslaughter, obstruction of police and criminal trespassing. In 2012, he was sentenced in federal court in Montana to six months in custody for coordinating the illegal purchase of eagle feathers, tails and wings and two hawk tails, court documents show.
COLTS SAFETY'S FATHER IDENTIFIED AS MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY KILLED BALD EAGLE WITH RIFLE
His latest prison sentence comes weeks after two men were indicted in Montana over another alleged eagle-killing scheme that authorities said resulted in the deaths about 3,600 birds, including golden and bald eagles on and around the Flathead Indian Reservation.
One of the defendants in that case, Simon Paul, is being sought by authorities after he failed to show up for a January 8 initial court appearance, prompting a judge to issue an arrest warrant.
It’s illegal to possess, use, or sell eagles or their parts in the U.S., though there are exceptions for cultural institutions and Native Americans using them in religious ceremonies. Federal officials operate a clearinghouse that makes eagle feathers and other parts available to tribal members, authorized zoos and museums."

Gov. Josh Shapiro plans next month to propose steps toward fixing a higher education system in Pennsylvania that is among the worst in the nation in affordability, his administration said Friday.
The administration didn't release many specifics and said the Democratic governor would give more details in his Feb. 6 budget address.
By just about every measure there is, Pennsylvania is ranked at the bottom among states in the level of higher education aid, size of student debt and affordability of its colleges. Pennsylvania spends less per capita on higher education aid than any other state except New Hampshire, Shapiro's administration said.
PENNSYLVANIA POISED TO ALLOW LONGER SCHOOL DAYS, SHORTER WEEKS
This year's spending of about $2 billion on higher education is about the same as it was 15 years ago.

(AP Photo/Daniel Shanken)
In his budget, Shapiro will propose ""significant"" aid for state-owned universities, community colleges and their students, the administration said.
The 14 state-owned universities and 15 independent community colleges should be united under a governance system that improves coordination between the schools and limits the competition and duplication between them, the administration said.
After that, Shapiro wants to cut tuition and fees to more than $1,000 per semester for Pennsylvania students who attend a state-owned university and have a household income under the state median of about $70,000.
DEMOCRAT-BACKED REPORT CLAIMS PENNSYLVANIA OWES DISTRICTS $5B IN EDUCATION FUNDING
The administration could not immediately say how much money that would require, or where that amount of aid would place Pennsylvania in state rankings.
Eventually, the state would develop an aid formula rewarding higher education institutions for factors including growing enrollment and graduation rate, the administration said.
Schools would get incentives to recruit and support students to complete degrees and earn credentials in growing fields and fields with workforce shortages, the administration said.
The ideas sprang from a working group of college and university presidents that were assembled last year by the Shapiro administration."

The Democratic congresswoman appeared on the ""I’ve Had It"" podcast on Jan. 16 with hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie ""Pumps"" Sullivan where she discussed her views on President Biden and Trump and what happens when people identify too much with politicians.
Ocasio-Cortez said, ""Donald Trump is what you actually get when you want a politician to embody all of your hopes and dreams and caricature of yourselves. Donald Trump affirms insecure men’s idea of masculinity. They affirm insecure people’s idea of wealth-""
""Internalized misogyny,"" Welch interjected.

""Yeah. Insecure White folks’ idea of race,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued in the interview. ""Like, that’s what you get when you want your everything to come – all of your life, and identity-affirming things, to come from electoral politics, you get demagogues, people who symbolize these psychological things. Joe Biden doesn’t do that, and I think that’s actually a good thing, because…it’s — it’s more honest, I think, about where we are, whether we like it or not.""
She noted that while she disagrees with President Biden on several issues, such as his response to the war in Gaza, she is planning to look beyond that for the good of the country in the 2024 election.

""I don’t associate myself with what’s happening [in Gaza]. But at the end of the day, we have to acknowledge that we just can’t allow this fascist movement to grow in this country. And what I think is actually hopeful about our politics is that we can exist outside of electoral politics in organizing our communities and standing with our friends,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.
She continued, ""And, you know, if it’s coming down to this next election, for me personally, the decision to vote is not a difficult one for me, because, just because I’m voting for him doesn’t mean that he embodies everything about me.""
Though Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed Biden for a second term, the left-leaning No Excuses PAC, led by Ocasio-Cortez's former communications director Corbin Trent, published an ad earlier this month that encouraged him to drop out of the race.

Nikki Haley on Monday rejected the idea that she must win the New Hampshire presidential primary to continue her challenge to former President Donald Trump.
In an interview on NewsNation, the former South Carolina governor said that while the ""political class"" has declared Trump the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee, all her campaign needs to do is finish ""stronger"" than in Iowa on Tuesday night.
""We started at 2% in Iowa and ended at 20%. I need to be stronger in New Hampshire, then stronger in South Carolina,"" Haley told NewsNation anchor Leland Vittert on Monday. The former U.N. Ambassador said ""it's never been fair"" to say that her presidential campaign is make or break in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
""This is not a coronation. This is an election. And you go state by state. We’re going to take it one step at a time,"" Haley said.

Iowa Republicans resoundingly elected Trump to be the party's 2024 standard-bearer last week, handing him a convincing 30-point victory in the caucuses. The former president is hoping for a repeat performance in the Granite State, with strong momentum after second-place finisher Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.
At a campaign event Monday in Laconia, New Hampshire, Trump said that ""now we're down to two people. And I think one person will be gone probably tomorrow … now is the time for the Republican Party to come together.""

Haley argued Monday that Trump won ""only"" 1.5 percent of the total potential vote in Iowa, a state where over 3 million people live, and that his victory is not representative of the broader electorate.
Haley hopes that New Hampshire — where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have a tendency to reject the winner in Iowa — will show she is a better fit for the general election in November and showdown with President Biden, a Democrat.

""The one thing we have to remember is Donald Trump only won with one and a half percent of the vote in Iowa, 56,000 people voted for him out of the state of 3 million,"" Haley said. ""That’s not representative of the country. And you’ve got the political class saying, Oh, it’s him. It’s got to be him. No, this is not a coronation. This is an election.""
Haley said her campaign will take the primary ""one"" state ""at a time"" and that she is looking forward to campaigning on ""to my sweet state of South Carolina"" after the New Hampshire primary.

The former president made the remarks Thursday on his proprietary social media platform, Truth Social.
""While I greatly appreciate the Republican National Committee (RNC) wanting to make me their PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, and while they have far more votes than necessary to do it, I feel, for the sake of PARTY UNITY, that they should NOT go forward with this plan, but that I should do it the ‘Old Fashioned’ way, and finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX,"" Trump wrote.

Trump's statement pushes back on efforts led by a former aide of his campaign, David Bossie — an RNC committee member who has urged Republicans to rally around the former president despite the ongoing primary.
Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is facing growing calls for her to leave the 2024 presidential race as the RNC nearly considered a resolution to declare Trump the party's presumptive nominee.
The RNC was set to consider a resolution that, if approved, would have declared Trump to be the party's presumptive nominee for president in 2024. Fox News Digital obtained a copy of the resolution on Thursday, but it was later withdrawn.
TRUMP BENEFITS BY HALEY STAYING IN THE RACE, PUNDITS SAY: MEDIA WILL GO 'WALL-TO-WALL' ON INDICTMENTS ONCE HE WINS
In a statement, RNC spokesperson Keith Schipper said, ""Resolutions, such as this one, are brought forward by members of the RNC. Chairwoman McDaniel doesn’t offer resolutions. This will be taken up by the Resolutions Committee, and they will decide whether to send this resolution to be voted on by the 168 RNC members at our annual meeting next week.""

Haley's campaign told Fox News Digital it was up to the millions of Republican voters across the country to decide who the party's nominee will be, ""not a bunch of Washington insiders.""

Trump trounced his rivals with convincing wins in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary this month, and experts agree there is likely little hope for Haley — the only alternative to the former president remaining in the race — in the upcoming South Carolina primary despite it being her home state.

EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said he is ""very honored"" by his New Hampshire primary win Tuesday night, telling Fox News Digital that the Republican Party is ""very united"" behind his candidacy.
Trump won the first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday night, defeating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Trump also won the Iowa caucuses last week.
TRUMP DOMINATES AGAIN AS FORMER PRESIDENT EASILY BEATS NIKKI HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE GOP PRIMARY
During an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital shortly after the race was called, Trump said he was honored.
""I’m very honored by the result,"" Trump said.
Trump also said he is ""looking forward to going against the worst president in the history of our country.""

New Hampshire – where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary – was considered fertile ground for Haley. And Haley spent plenty of time and resources in the state, securing the influential endorsement of popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.
But Trump dominated for a second week in a row, cruising to victory in both critical early voting states.
When asked if he felt Haley would suspend her campaign, he said, ""I don’t know. She should.""
""She should because, otherwise, we have to keep wasting money instead of spending on Biden,"" Trump said. ""If she doesn’t drop out, we have to waste money instead of spending it on Biden, which is our focus.""

FHPXOV6DU3_FABS15DLNBVGIJM,"New Hampshire voters frustrated with Biden, DNC for skipping state: 'Won't give us the time of day'",By Bailee Hill Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 9:34am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-hampshire-voters-frustrated-biden-dnc-skipping-state-wont-give-us-time-day,"Former U.S. congressional candidate Matt Mowers joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Nikki Haley's case for New Hampshire primary voters and why some voters are irritated with Biden and the DNC.
New Hampshire voters are irritated with President Biden and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for dismissing the Granite State in the 2024 primary process, with some expressing anger that the president won't be on the ballot.
Biden and the DNC decided the Democratic Party is beginning the primary process with South Carolina instead of New Hampshire, prompting backlash from some voters who feel disregarded over the move. Others have advocated a write-in campaign to ensure there isn't an upset from either one of his primary challengers: Dean Phillips or Marianne Williamson.
But not all New Hampshire voters are on board with that proposal.
DEAN PHILLIPS CALLS BIDEN POSSIBLY ‘UNELECTABLE’ IN 2024 AFTER GOP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
""I'm kind of angry about it,"" one voter said. ""And some people have said, why should we write his name in when he won't even give us the time of day?""
""We're disappointed this year not to have the Democratic primary, and that's why we're doing this, because it's not meaningless like the DNC says,"" another voter said. ""It really is meaningful.""
""The Democratic National Committee has said that… the Democratic primary here is not relevant or real, and I think that's just nonsense,"" another voter said.
Rep. Dean Phillips, who is largely seen as a moderate Minnesota representative, launched his campaign to oust Biden back in October. He has invested millions of his own dollars to carry out what critics see as a longshot campaign, but some are worried with Biden not on the ballot, he could gain steam in the race.
Previously asked where he needs to finish in New Hampshire's primary, Phillips said, ""[W]e started at zero just 10 weeks ago. My name is not yet well known. And I think getting in the 20s would be an extraordinary accomplishment.""
WHY DEAN PHILLIPS IS SCOLDING FELLOW DEMOCRATS
That appears to be a lowering of expectations from a few weeks earlier, but the latest poll in the Granite State's Democrat primary indicates Phillips is far short of that goal. He stands at 10% in a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll conducted Jan. 16-19, a point ahead of bestselling author and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, who is making her second straight White House run.
Sixty-three percent of those questioned in the survey said they'd write in Biden's name.
Former New Hampshire congressional candidate Matt Mowers predicted Phillips would do better ""than expected"" in the race during ""Fox & Friends First,"" although cautioning the election would not be an upset for the incumbent president.
""It is going to be a closer-than-expected scare for Joe Biden,"" Mowers said on Tuesday.

Biden has faced ongoing concerns surrounding his age and mental acuity ahead of the 2024 presidential election as he battles historically low approval and dwindling support among key voting blocs nationwide.
Democrats have worried about Biden's chances to prevail against former President Trump, and some key left-wing operatives have even suggested he step aside to allow a different candidate the chance to prevail.
""I think he's [Dean Phillips] going to overperform what many folks were expecting,"" Mowers said. ""Recent polls show he might even be getting close to a third of the vote, or somewhere in the 20s. If he does that, it's certainly a message to Joe Biden about frustration from Democratic Party activists, and whether that's because of overall dissatisfaction with his administration or potentially because he decided to try to kill off the first in the nation primary here in New Hampshire.""

FOU2YP1QLJ_O5PW4XJGEANZXWG,Chicago Democrat urges officials to remove sanctuary city status as residents suffer: 'We are not happy',By Elizabeth Heckman Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 3:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/chicago-democrat-urges-officials-remove-sanctuary-city-status-residents-suffer-happy,"Cata Truss, a Democratic employee from Chicago, discusses why she is suing the city over its handling of the out-of-control migrant crisis.
A Chicago Democrat is calling for the city's sanctuary status to be removed as the migrant crisis continues to squeeze community resources.
Government employee Cata Truss told ""Fox News @ Night"" Democrat voters like her are growing increasingly frustrated with the party's handling of the issue.
""There is no moneys to take care of the migrants, nor is there moneys to take care of the people that are there. And so we have a mess on our hands,"" Truss said Wednesday.
CHICAGO FACES BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS OVER RESOURCES FOR MIGRANTS: 'THEY ARE JUST NOT LISTENING!'
Truss argued Windy City residents are upset over low income communities and schools being ""divested in"" while funds are used for the care of migrants instead.
""This is the sentiment from the city of Chicago: We would like to have our status as a sanctuary city removed,"" she said. ""We would also like to see a better plan in place.""
Truss said she tried to reach out to Democratic elected officials in the city to sit down with her and other members of the community to discuss the situation, but ""no one was willing"" to talk.
""If you are all not willing to sit down with us, if you're not willing to talk to us, why should we continue to support you?"" she said. ""A lot of us [Democrats] are jumping ship.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson defended his handling of the crisis, Wednesday.
""I know folks may question my style, but don't question my leadership,"" the Democrat said.
Truss said she could not understand the mayor's sentiment.
""He has to have regrets, because people have regrets. We are not happy with what is happening here.""
Truss added that she is also disappointed with President Biden for not using his executive authority to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from the southern border.
Chicago Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson.
Nearly 34,000 migrants have arrived in Chicago since beginning data collection, with over $156 million spent on housing and care since October 2022, according to the city.
While running for office last year, Johnson was in full support of migrants coming to the city, but has recently said the current influx is ""not sustainable"" and has sought further federal assistance.

FT1HZ9184G_L7WCIGW38M6SPUW,PETA calls for woman accused of torturing animals on YouTube to face federal charges: 'Horrific torture',By Jeffrey Clark Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 5:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/peta-calls-woman-accused-torturing-animals-youtube-face-federal-charges-horrific-torture,"Pennsylvania state police announce the capture of Danelo Cavalcante, who escaped prison and eluded law enforcement for 13 days.
Editor's Note: This article contains graphic depictions of animal torture.
After a Pennsylvania woman was charged with torturing animals on social media for attention, PETA told Fox News Digital that it is recommending pushing for federal charges as well.
Twenty-eight-year-old Anigar Monsee, who lives in the township of Upper Darby, ran a YouTube account called ""Motheranddaughter"" which reportedly showed a ""scantily-clad woman torturing rabbits, chickens, frogs and pigeons by slowly disemboweling and otherwise mutilating the animals while still alive, and/or by severing the struggling and screaming animals’ necks with a dull knife over the course of several minutes,"" The Delaware County Daily Times reported Monday.
""The channel has over 20,000 subscribers and had been viewed over 1,800 times as of Monday,"" the outlet reported.

A spokesperson for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) told Fox News Digital that the news of Monsee’s charges was a great relief.
""We’re relieved that local authorities jumped right on this and have filed state charges,"" PETA spokesperson Kristin Rickman said. ""We also included the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in our memo, so we're hopeful that federal charges can be filed under the PACT Act as well.""
The PACT Act, or the ""Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act,"" empowers the federal government to stop the creation and distribution of ""animal crush"" videos across state lines.
""It retains existing criminal offenses that prohibit knowingly creating or distributing an animal crush video using interstate commerce,"" according to the act’s description. ""The bill also adds a new provision to criminalize an intentional act of animal crushing. A violator is subject to criminal penalties—a fine, a prison term of up to seven years, or both.""

""The channel has over 20,000 subscribers and had been viewed over 1,800 times as of Monday,"" the outlet reported.  ((Photo Illustration by Florian Gaertner/Getty Images))
The act also ""provides additional exceptions for conduct, or a video of conduct, including conduct that is (1) medical or scientific research, (2) necessary to protect the life or property of a person, (3) performed as part of euthanizing an animal, or (4) unintentional.""
Rickman explained that ""animal crush"" is a type of ""sexual fetish"" online that is short for ""animal crushing.""
""Often,"" she said, ""we see instances where the individuals creating the videos are receiving a financial benefit"" from the abuse content.
Rickman said that PETA was ""very hopeful"" that federal officials will file charges under the PACT Act against Monsee.
The spokesperson said Monsee’s charges for animal abuse show how ""extensive"" a following that animal crush videos have online.
""Aside from the horrific torture imposed on each of these animals who are individuals just like us, feeling pain, feeling terror, not understanding why someone is inflicting that on them,"" Rickman said.
Some of the videos showed animals surviving for ""30 minutes or more"" before they ""finally succumbed to their injuries,"" she continued. ""If you imagine something like that happening to yourself, you can easily see how disturbed the brain of a person must be to engage in this activity and to solicit input and likes and views from other people for it.""

The man who allegedly shot and killed seven people in two homes in Illinois turned the gun on himself and ended his own life after a confrontation with law enforcement in Texas.
Romeo Nance, 23, was found by U.S. Marshals near Natalia, Texas, at about 8:30 p.m. Monday when he shot and killed himself with a handgun, according to the Joliet Police Department in Illinois. This comes after a search for Nance in response to the discovery of seven shooting victims earlier on Monday.
The identification of the victims and the manner of their deaths will be confirmed by the Will County Coroner's Office, Joliet Police said in a news release. The investigation remains active.
Joliet police officers responded to West Acres Road shortly after noon on Monday following a report from the Will County Sheriff’s Office that deputies discovered multiple dead bodies in two homes while conducting investigative work in response to a homicide that took place in their jurisdiction.

Deputies found evidence of a possible crime scene at a home at 2212 West Acres Road and entered the residence where they located five people who appeared to be dead from gunshot wounds.
Shortly afterward, deputies discovered another possible crime scene at 2225 West Acres Road and entered that home where deputies found two people who also appeared to be dead from gunshot wounds.
Joliet police were then called to the scene. It is believed Nance knew the victims and that they were relatives.

During the investigation, detectives quickly identified Nance as a suspect in the homicides on West Acres Road. He was also believed to be the gunman in two other shootings that happened on Sunday.
Shortly before 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, deputies were called to an apartment complex where they found a man bleeding from the head from an apparent gunshot wound. The victim, later identified as 28-year-old Toyosi Bakare, died from his injuries.
Bakare was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the U.S. for nearly three years.
Deputies said that about ten minutes before that fatal shooting, a 42-year-old man was shot in the leg and sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

A group of Jewish organizations in New York baked a 35-foot-long loaf of challah last week in the hope of setting a new world record.
Challah, a braided bread, is traditionally served on Shabbat and other Jewish holidays, the website My Jewish Learning notes.
The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), headquartered in New York City, along with the Orthodox Union teamed up to attempt to break the record for the longest challah, JFNA told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

JFNA is an organization that ""represents more than 400 independent Jewish communities,"" says its website; it raises and distributes over $2 billion each year to various charitable groups.
The undertaking was so large that it involved two bakeries in two states – plus an 18-wheeler truck, said JFNA.

Strauss Bakery in Brooklyn formed and braided the 200-plus pounds of dough on Thursday, Jan. 18, said the JFNA.
The unbaked loaf was then put onto a truck and taken to David's Cookies in New Jersey. That bakery has a ""tunnel oven"" that was able to bake the challah.
After it was baked, the challah was put back onto the truck and taken to Rodeph Shalom Day School, a school associated with Congregation Rodeph Sholom, a synagogue in New York City.
It was unveiled there on Friday, Jan. 19, as part of an All-Day Shabbat celebration at the school.

Moishe House ""provides vibrant Jewish community for young adults by supporting leaders in their 20s as they create meaningful home-based Jewish experiences for themselves and their peers,"" says the group's website.
The massive bread creation was done as part of ""North America's Shabbat of Love,"" an initiative that JFNA created.

""For Jewish people struggling to deal with the surge of a global surge of antisemitism and anti-Zionism, Shabbat brings a much-needed day of peace, a day of dignity and a day for reconnecting not just with family and friends, but with the entire Jewish people,"" said JFNA.

Another Democratic member of the House has announced plans to retire from office at the end of the year.
Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md., released a statement Friday saying he will leave office at the end of 2024.
Ruppersberger said he made the decision knowing ""now more than ever, Congress needs thoughtful, end-game representatives like me — members who care more about constituents and our country and less about cable news hits.""

""It is time to pass the torch to a younger generation of leaders and I am looking forward to spending more time with my family,"" the congressman said.
He joins nearly two dozen other Democrats who have decided not to seek re-election, along with 18 Republicans.

Ruppersberger's district is a solidly blue area and a Republican replacement would be unlikely.

However, keeping seats within the same party is only half the fight for many key districts going up for grabs in 2024.

Party leaders have expressed concern that resignations by long-standing members of the House could leave power vacuums to be filled by more radical partisans.
Rupperberger's statement on the importance of ""constituents"" over ""cable news hits"" reflects a growing sense of disconnect between the outgoing generation of lawmakers and younger would-be elected officials.
Many outgoing members of the House have announced their intentions to pursue a higher office, such as Maryland's outgoing Republican Rep. David Trone, who plans to run for the Senate.

G59GA3FU2D_179DYFFYKN4CYQN,Nikki Haley vows to stay in race against Trump regardless of New Hampshire result: 'I'm not going anywhere',By Elizabeth Heckman Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 10:56am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nikki-haley-vows-stay-race-trump-regardless-new-hampshire-result-going-anywhere,"Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley plans to remain in the race against Trump now that the primary is a two-person race.
Nikki Haley is confident in her chances to defeat former President Trump and become the Republican presidential nominee after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his campaign.
Haley joined ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the New Hampshire primary, vowing that a loss to Trump on Tuesday would not spell the end of her bid. Haley stressed that ""70% of Americans don't want a Trump-Biden rematch"" and the disapproval ratings for both candidates are ""through the roof.""
""We're going to finish this,"" said Haley, adding that she intends to go on to her home state of South Carolina and the Super Tuesday contests no matter what happens in New Hampshire.
RON DESANTIS ENDORSES DONALD TRUMP AS HE DROPS OUT OF THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
""I’m not going anywhere. Keep in mind, he got 50,000 votes in a state of 3 million [in Iowa]. Is that what we are going to say decides in the country? I know the elites say we all need to coalesce around him. This is not a coronation. This is a democracy. We are going to have a strong showing today in New Hampshire. We’re heading to South Carolina … and then we are on to Super Tuesday,"" she told hosts Brian Kilmeade, Ainsley Earhardt and Steve Doocy live in Bedford.
After DeSantis dropped out, Haley's campaign received a spike in donations, which she said were ""a million and a half dollars in small donations from all over the country.""
Now that the primary is between Haley and Trump, the former president said it is ""time for the Republican Party to come together,"" which Haley responded by saying, ""in his dreams.""
However, most polls indicate that Haley remains double digits behind Trump with hours to go until the polls open in New Hampshire.
Trump, who is running a third straight time for the White House, stands at 57% support in a Suffolk University, Boston Globe and NBC10 in Boston daily tracking poll released on Monday morning, with Haley at 38%. Both candidates received two-point bumps with the departure of DeSantis, who was a distant third in New Hampshire in the single digits.

Trump held a similar lead in a Monmouth University/Washington Post survey conducted Jan. 16-20. The former president stood at 52% support, with Haley at 34% and DeSantis at 8%.
Trump was also up by double-digits in a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll that was in the field from Jan. 16-19, with the former president at 50%, Haley at 39%, and DeSantis at 6%.
Trump scored a convincing victory in last Monday night's low-turnout Iowa caucuses, the first contest on the GOP presidential nominating calendar. He grabbed 51% of the vote, 30 points ahead of DeSantis and Haley.
Haley has said that she is not interested in being vice president.

One of the five children who were hospitalized in Cyprus after being rescued from a rickety boat carrying 60 Syrian migrants has died, officials said Thursday.
The migrants, who were rescued early Wednesday by Cyprus police, apparently ran out of food and water after the boat had engine trouble during a six-day voyage from Lebanon, officials said.
The child suffered a heart attack and couldn’t be revived, Health Services spokesperson Charalambos Charilaou told the Cypriot state broadcaster.
Charilaou said two other children, aged 3 and 5, remain in intensive care at a hospital in the Cypriot capital. Two other minors are also being treated at a hospital, but their condition isn’t as serious.

Two adults were also hospitalized, with leg fractures. The remaining Syrians were transferred to a migrant reception center on the capital’s outskirts.

Cyprus government spokesman Constantinos Letymbiotis expressed the country's collective shock at the little girl's death and wished for the speedy recovery of the other two girls in intensive care.
""There's a very dark aspect to the migration issue, horrible criminal people smuggling rings that take advantage of your fellow human beings,"" Letymbiotis said.
A Cyprus court on Thursday ordered a 47-year-old man into custody for eight days on suspicion of driving the boat and belonging to the smuggling ring that organized the trip. He also faces a manslaughter charge in connection with the girl's death.
The boat had departed Lebanon with insufficient fuel and lacking GPS or any other navigational aid, not even a compass, police said according to the state broadcaster.
Alerted by a passing ship, police found the migrants about 55 kilometers (35 miles) off the island nation’s southeastern tip.

Authorities said the boat left from Lebanon on Jan. 18. Lebanon’s coast is about 105 miles from Cyprus.
Mohammed Sablouh, a Lebanese lawyer who follows migrant issues in his country, said the migrants were in bad shape because they hadn’t eaten for days.
Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides urged Lebanon's government on Wednesday to take action to curb departures of migrants ""because we know that these are Syrians who come here from Lebanon.""
Although overall migrant arrivals in Cyprus have significantly declined, those coming by sea almost quadrupled from 937 in 2022 to 3,889 in 2023, with almost all being Syrian, according to official interior ministry numbers.
Cypriot Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou said Thursday he would again call on the European Union to re-evaluate the safety of certain parts of Syria so that the migrants can be repatriated. He would also urge the EU to form a unit composed of European police, Lebanese and Cypriot officials to patrol Lebanon's border."

Kevin Stitt outlines why state leaders are supporting Texas as the Lone State state’s battle with the Biden administration over the border crisis heats up.
Border Patrol has ""no plans"" to remove razor wire placed by Texas along the southern border, a senior Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official told Fox News on Friday, stressing a ""strong"" relationship with Texas despite an ongoing legal battle between the state and the administration.
Texas is currently locked in a multi-pronged legal fight with the federal government over the security of the Texas-Mexico border. The federal government has threatened legal action over Texas’ recent seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, while lawsuits are ongoing over the administration’s cutting of razor wire set up by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande. Texas has declared that it has a right to ""self-defense"" against what it says is a migrant ""invasion.""
On Monday, the Supreme Court found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas after a lower court had blocked such moves. Texas has continued to fortify the border, and has also indicated it will not comply with the administration’s demands for it to vacate the Shelby Park area.

""[President Biden's] actions have caused an unprecedented invasion that we must defend against,"" Abbott said on Thursday.
The Biden administration has said that Texas is interfering with the federal enforcement of immigration law.
""Enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility,"" a DHS spokesperson said this week. ""Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the State of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law.  We can enforce our laws and administer them safely, humanely, and in an orderly way.""
Dozens of Republican governors have backed Texas as the feud between the state and the feds escalates. But a senior CBP official told Fox that the relationship between Texas and Border Patrol officials on the ground is ""strong.""
""While this issue plays out in the courts, the relationship between Border Patrol, Texas DPS [Department of Public Safety], & TMD [Texas Military Dept.] remains strong,"" the official said. ""Our focus is and will always be the mission of protecting this country and its people. On the ground, we continue to work alongside these valuable partners in that endeavor.""
""Bottom line: Border Patrol has no plans to remove infrastructure (c-wire) placed by Texas along the border. Our posture remains the same. If we need to access an area for emergency response, we will do so. When that happens, we will coordinate with Texas DPS & TMD""

""TX NG and rank-and-file BP agents work together and respect each other's jobs. Period. If TX NG members have LAWFUL orders, then they have to carry out those orders,"" the National Border Patrol Council said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""Rank-and-file BP agents appreciate and respect what TX has been doing to defend their state in the midst of this catastrophe that the Biden Admin has unleashed on America,"" the statement said. ""We want to be perfectly clear, there is no fight between rank-and-file BP agents and the TX NG, Gov. Abott, or TX DPS. It may make flashy headlines, but it simply isn't true.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Kentucky gun shop that sold an AR-15 to a man who used it to kill five co-workers and wrote in his journal the gun was ""so easy"" to buy is facing a lawsuit filed Monday from survivors and families of the victims.
The civil suit filed in Louisville alleges River City Firearms should have been more suspicious of the sale and noticed red flags when Connor Sturgeon bought the gun six days before the April 10 shooting. Sturgeon walked into Old National Bank and opened fire on co-workers who were having a morning meeting, killing five and injuring several others. A responding police officer was also shot.
Sturgeon, 25, struggled with mental illness and wrote in a journal he was ""very sick,"" according to an extensive Louisville police report on the shootings released in November.
LOUISVILLE BANK SHOOTER WANTED TO MASSACRE 'UPPER-CLASS WHITE PEOPLE' TO HIGHLIGHT LAX GUN LAWS: JOURNAL
River City Firearms is a federally licensed dealer, which means sellers there are ""trained to spot individuals who ... may have nefarious intentions,"" according to the lawsuit. Patrons inside the store said Sturgeon had little knowledge of firearms and appeared embarrassed during the purchase, the lawsuit said. The shop has a ""legal duty"" to withhold a sale from a buyer who it can reasonably tell might be a danger to others, the suit said.

The owners of the store should know that AR-15-style weapons like the one Sturgeon bought ""have become the go-to weapon for young men intent on causing mass destruction,"" according to the lawsuit, which was first reported by the Courier Journal.
Sturgeon bought a Radical Firearms RF-15, 120 rounds and four magazine cartridges for $762. He wrote in his journal the process took about 45 minutes.
""Seriously, I knew it would be doable but this is ridiculous,"" he wrote.
River City Firearms did not immediately respond to an email message sent to the store Monday. A phone call to the store was not answered Monday evening.
Sturgeon fired more than 40 rounds over the course of about eight minutes, according to the Louisville police report. Investigators said he did not appear to have a firm understanding of how to operate the weapon. Sturgeon was fatally shot by a responding Louisville police officer just minutes after the shooting began.
The families of two of the deceased victims — Joshua Barrick and James Tutt — are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, along with three shooting survivors.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tells 'Hannity' the Supreme Court ruling is a setback for border security.
Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is calling on Lone Star State officials to ignore a recent Supreme Court order that cleared the way for federal officials to cut down razor wire placed along the border on Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s orders.
""They have a duty under the Constitution… and every other norm of leadership of any sovereign state, to protect your citizens, period, full stop. There is no exception to that,"" Roy told Fox News Digital on Tuesday. ""And if the Supreme Court wants to ignore that truth, which a slim majority did, Texas still had the duty, Texas leaders still have the duty, to defend their people.""
""It's like, if someone's breaking into your house, and the court says, 'Oh, sorry. You can't defend yourself.' What do you tell the court? You tell the court to go to hell, you defend yourself and then figure it out later.""

Roy said earlier on X, ""This opinion is unconscionable and Texas should ignore it on behalf of the [Border Patrol] agents who will be put in a worse position by the opinion and the Biden administration’s policies.""
The Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision on Monday allowing Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents to resume destruction of barbed wire placed by Texas officials along the Rio Grande to deter migrants from trying to cross into the U.S. illegally.
The one-page order, which did not offer any explanation, is a win for the Biden administration amid an ongoing standoff with Texas over how to handle the border crisis. The administration said the wire endangered lives and impeded federal officials in performing their duties.

When asked about the lack of an explanation, Roy targeted the two conservative justices who voted with the court's three liberals.
""I mean, I don't know. You gotta go talk to John Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett. There's no excuse for it,"" Roy told Fox News Digital.
National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd argued the decision would encourage more illegal immigration.
""Agents support what Texas was trying to accomplish in the absence of true border security policies from this administration,"" he said.

Byrne Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/meet-american-who-served-model-huck-finn-kindly-young-heathen-tom-blankenship,"""Unwashed, insufficiently fed,"" Thomas Blankenship of Hannibal, Missouri, boasted a big heart and magnetic personality. He inspired childhood chum Mark Twain to create one of America's most endearing fictional figures.
""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" enjoys acclaim as the ""Great American Novel,"" its title character a uniquely beloved figure in our national heritage.
Author Mark Twain's riverfront Missouri boy was poor in manners and material wealth, but rich in spirit and charisma.
Huckleberry Finn ""is part of the tapestry of not just American culture but American education,"" said Matthew Seybold, scholar-in-residence at the Center for Mark Twain Studies (www.marktwainstudies.com) at Elmira College in Elmira, New York.
He also told Fox News Digital in an interview, ""It is inescapably and irrepressibly American in all its beauty and horror.""
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO CREATED THE CHAIRLIFT, JAMES CURRAN, RAILROAD ENGINEER LIFTED SKIING TO NEW HEIGHTS
Huck Finn, however, was more than just a fictional figure forged from the imagination of a great writer and wit. Huckleberry was a real-life, hardscrabble, all-American boy.
His name was Tom Blankenship.

He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, nestled against the Missisippi River on the edge of the American frontier in the 1830s.
He was raised in a dysfunctional family with shiftless, and apparently unemployable, alcoholic parents.
Blankenship was a charismatic and popular child. He impressed the starstruck younger boy and future author, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, when the two met at an unknown time.
Blankenship ""was ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed,"" Clemens wrote in 1906 under his better-known pen name in the ""The Autobiography of Mark Twain.""
Blankenship ""was ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed. But he had as good a heart as ever any boy had."" - Mark Twain
""But he had as good a heart as ever any boy had.""
Blankenship apparently possessed an almost naive confidence, magnetic charm, rebellious spirit and an innate moral compass that defied and exceeded that of the civil society that shunned him.
The fictional Finn was painted with a complexity similar to the kindhearted, foul-mouthed Hannibal urchin.

""In 'Huckleberry Finn' I have drawn Tom Blankenship exactly as he was,"" wrote Twain.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO WROTE ‘BEN-HUR: A TALE OF CHRIST’: UNION GENERAL LEW WALLACE
He also drew Huck Finn as a prism through which the United States might see its undeniable greatness and confront its human flaws — the challenge issued not by president but by pauper, giving ""Huckleberry Finn"" the power of biblical allegory.
""Huck was underfed, unwashed, unschooled, unchurched, and a master at swearing,"" Twain scholar George Hendrick of the University of Illinois wrote in 2018.
""As was Tom Blankenship.""
Thomas Blankenship was born around 1831, presumably in Missouri, listed as 19 years old in the 1850 Census. He was the second of eight children born to Woodson and Mahala Onstot Blankenship, both of them likely illiterate.

The Blankenships were ""undoubtedly considered ‘White trash' by their neighbors,"" according to Hendrick.
""The parents paupers and drunkards; the girls charged with prostitution,"" wrote Twain, adding that Tom was ""a kindly young heathen.""
The family reportedly arrived in Hannibal in 1839 and lived in ""a miserable house of bark, under a tree,"" according to Twain biographer Albert Bigelow Paine, and later moved to a ""ramshackled quarters,"" said Hendrick.
The Blankenships were ""undoubtedly considered ‘White trash' by their neighbors.""
The Clemens family also moved to Hannibal in 1839, when the future celebrity author was four years old, Blankenship about 8.
Twain was apparently in awe of the older boy, a celebrity in the tiny riverfront town.
Blankenship's ""liberties were totally unrestricted. He was the only really independent person – boy or man – in the community, and by consequence, he was tranquilly and continuously happy, and was envied by all the rest of us,"" Twain later wrote.

Blankenship was a rebellious but charismatic outcast, who appeared to possess natural confidence.
The real-life Huckleberry Finn was apparently the coolest kid in Hannibal.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED SLICED BREAD: OTTO ROHWEDDER, HARD-LUCK HAWKEYE
The other kids loved him; the parents despised him.
""We liked him; we enjoyed his society,"" Twain wrote. ""As his society was forbidden us by our parents, the prohibition trebled and quadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his society than of any other boy's.""
Tom Blankenship’s alter-ego first gained national prominence as the sidekick in ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" published in 1876.
Twain introduced Huckleberry as ""the pariah of the village"" and described him nearly the same way he would later remember his boyhood bud Blankenship.

""Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town,"" Twain wrote in ""Tom Sawyer.""
""Because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad — and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him.""
""Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad.""
The seminal storyline of ""Huckleberry Finn"" was his relationship with the slave Jim.
Their meeting on Jackson Island is based on a real-life event, when Tom Blankenship's older brother, Benson, discovered and protected a runaway slave on a deserted island in the Mississippi River.
""Bence was supposed to know better,"" said Seybold. ""He also could have enriched himself if he had turned him in with a $50 reward.""

It was an act of ""nobility,' the Twain scholar added, that ""this very poor guy could have made money by turning in this enslaved man to whom he had no loyalty, but instead bore the weight of it once it was discovered.""
The event spoke to an innate moral decency in the Blankenship family that was otherwise indecent by every visible measure.
It's one of the reasons Twain made Huck Finn his most admirable character, even more admirable than his own fictional alter-ego, Tom Sawyer,
""Twain as a child certainly admired Tom,"" said Seybold. ""And that admiration was passed onto Huckleberry Finn.""
Thomas Blankenship died on an unknown date. His was a life lived largely in obscurity, defying the fame of his literary alter-ego.
""I heard, four years ago, that [Blankenship] was Justice of the Peace in a remote village in Montana and was a good citizen and greatly respected,"" Twain wrote.

That version of his life has since been disputed by scholars, and by notes found in later versions of Twain’s autobiography.
Evidence exists of a life lived in hunger and petty crime, fulfilling the prophecy of his poor and rebellious boyhood existence.
""All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called ‘Huckleberry Finn’ …. It’s the best book we’ve had."" — Ernest Hemingway
The Hannibal Daily Messenger reported ""wholesale thieving"" in the Bay neighborhood in its June 12, 1861, edition.
The heist included ""two valuable horses … a large lot of bacon, a 6-gallon jar of butter … a washtub full of clothes … a large quantity of sugar and 10 gallons of molasses … [and a] chicken house robbed.""
Tom Blankenship was Mark Twain's boyhood pal and the real-life inspiration for Huckleberry Finn. The Hannibal (Missouri) Daily Messenger reported on ""widespread thieving"" on June 12, 1861 — blaming Blankenship, who would have been about 30 years old. (Center for Mark Twain Studies)
The paper fingered the culprit and accused him of serial thievery.
""Tom Blankenship must have concluded to make another descent and effectually clean out the Bay; or at least the surplus products of its inhabitants.""
His life was filled with other reports of petty crime before his life vanished from public record.

Blankenship was a living embodiment of the complexity and dichotomy of the American story, of the human species itself, of Huckleberry Finn.
He remains a paradox in death. Blankenship was born an urchin and died in anonymity; yet the beloved Huckleberry Finn forever floats down the Mississippi River and the American cultural narrative, his friend Jim by his side.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that authorities in Greece violated the privacy rights of a group of women who were arrested and publicly identified in 2012 as HIV-positive prostitutes who allegedly endangered public health.
The case was brought to the Strasbourg, France-based court by 11 Greek women, 10 of whom had been arrested and charged with intentionally attempting to inflict serious bodily harm by allegedly having unprotected sex with customers.
The 11th woman was mistakenly identified as a sex worker instead of her sister. Five of the case’s original petitioners have since died.
CANCER IS NOW LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG HIV-POSITIVE PEOPLE, REPORT SAYS: ‘OF GREAT CONCERN’
The court found that Greek authorities had violated the privacy of two women by forcibly subjecting them to blood tests, and of four of the women by publishing their personal details. It awarded a total of 70,000 euros ($76,000) in damages.
""The information disseminated concerned the applicants’ HIV-positive status, disclosure of which was likely to dramatically affect their private and family life, as well as social and employment situation, since its nature was such as to expose them to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism,"" the court said in a news release about the ruling.

The prosecutor who ordered the publication of the women’s personal information ""had not examined … whether other measures, capable of ensuring a lesser degree of exposure for the applicants, could have been taken,"" it added.
In the run-up to Greece's 2012 elections, the country's health minister at the time, Andreas Loverdos, championed a crackdown on unlicensed brothels following a spike in reported HIV cases. He had warned of an increase in the incidence of customers having unprotected sex with prostitutes for an additional fee.
Prostitution is legal in Greece, with regular health checks for sex workers required.
As part of the crackdown, women were rounded up from illegal brothels and streets and forced to undergo HIV testing at police stations. Criminal charges were filed against more than 30 women, with authorities publishing the personal details, photos and HIV status of most of them, along with the accusation that they had deliberately endangered their clients by having sex without condoms.

Homeless people in California were found living in caves along the Tuolumne River before they were cleared out by the Modesto Police Department and volunteers over the weekend.
Volunteers with Operation 9-2-99 and the Tuolumne River Trust worked with police to clear them out, removing some 7,600 pounds of garbage from the area, authorities said.
""This particular area has been plagued by vagrancy and illegal camps, which have raised concerns due to the fact that these camps were actually caves dug into the riverbanks,"" the Modesto Police Department said in a statement.
The cleared debris filled two truckloads and a trailer, police added.

Ahead of the cleanup, individuals residing in the caves and nearby homeless camps were told about the operation and informed of services to assist them, the department said.
The caves were about 20 feet below street level, and some were fully furnished, indicating that vagrants had been living there for some time. Items found inside included bedding, belongings, food, items on a makeshift mantel, drugs and weapons, local news station KOVR reported.
""We had a hard time figuring out how they got so much stuff down in there, considering how hard it was to get it up the hill and out,"" Operation 2-9-99 coordinator Chris Guptill told KOVR.
Guptill was one of many volunteers who participated in the cleanup. He said his group found eight caves in total, and this was not the first time they were occupied.

""We really don't have a known solution on how to deal with it,"" Guptill told KOVR.
Tracy Rojas, a Modesto resident who lives near the caves, said it is dangerous for people to take up residence underground.
""If one of these were to collapse, it would be devastating,"" she told KOVR. ""This whole thing would come down and go into the water.""
Homelessness is a growing crisis in California.

The city of Los Angeles, about 300 miles south of Modesto, recently began recruiting up to 6,000 volunteers to count homeless people.
The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority-led street tally helps the county government’s efforts to tackle a homeless crisis, which has crippled the city with tens of thousands of people living on the streets, living in cars, tents and makeshift street shelters. These temporary homes have proliferated on sidewalks, in parks and other community areas.
The so-called ""point-in-time"" count aims to estimate how many people are homeless and what financial or medical services they may require for potential mental health conditions or from drug addiction.
This count comes as California residents have grown increasingly frustrated over lawmakers’ failure to deter the surging homeless population. Since 2015, homelessness has increased by 70% in Los Angeles County and 80% in the city.

In 2023, officials reported more than 75,500 people were homeless on any given night in LA County, a 9% rise from a year earlier, and about 46,200 within the city of Los Angeles.
""Homelessness is an emergency, and it will take all of us working together to confront this emergency,"" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement, calling the count ""an important tool to confront the homelessness crisis.""

Authorities suspected it was a suicide, but her family has questioned the conclusion in a wrongful death lawsuit. (Holland family)
FIRST ON FOX: Experts who have reviewed the medical examiner's report on the suicide of a St. Louis-area woman found dead in her fiancé's home say the circumstances look suspicious and warrant further investigation.
Creve Coeur police in Missouri have said Grace Holland, 35, shot herself in the head in the home of her boyfriend, a local firefighter named Robert Daus, on the morning of July 22, 2020. A review of the case by county police also concluded her death was a suicide.
Police have not charged Daus with a crime, but the case is receiving renewed attention after a second girlfriend was found dead in his home, 39-year-old Dr. Sarah Sweeney.

Creve Coeur Police Chief Jeffrey Hartman stood by his department's investigation when contacted Wednesday and said county police had reviewed the case and came to the same conclusion: suicide. He also urged against speculation in the case as the autopsy in Sweeney's death is not yet available.
St. Louis County Police were asked to review Holland's death and also considered it a suicide, Sgt. Tracy Panus, the department's public information officer, told Fox News Digital Wednesday. Their findings were sent to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office for final review, she said, and the case remains ""active"" until that step is completed.
The medical examiner's report, obtained by Fox News Digital, contained several red flags, according to longtime homicide investigators who looked at the document.
It states she killed herself with a point-blank gunshot to the head and had been depressed after enduring a second miscarriage.
Read Grace Holland's autopsy report:
The bullet entered through her left temple and tracked rightward and ""slightly backward"" from her left temple before coming to a stop near the back of her skull, according to the autopsy report. First responders found the gun, a .380-caliber Glock 42, near her right hand.
""I would consider it suspicious in nature just on the facts alone. And there are a lot of questions, especially now that you have a second case there.""
Her family is suing Daus in a wrongful death lawsuit and says she was right-handed and that the gunshot to the left side of the head strikes them as suspicious, as does the alleged disappearance of her $20,000 engagement ring.
""This is all suspicious,"" longtime Miami-Dade County homicide detective Pat Diaz told Fox News Digital after reading the medical examiner's report. ""The left temple when you're right-handed is a telltale sign there's something wrong.""
LISTEN to the Missouri 911 call in the death of Grace Holland:
He pointed to how her hands were found across her abdomen.
""Your hands fall to the ground,"" he said. ""I'd want to know if they did gunshot residue on her hands and then his, if they did lab work for that.""
The autopsy suggests the gun misfired once before the fatal shot, then jammed, Diaz said.
""Left side, backward – angle is weird,"" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He also wanted to know more about the position of her hands when she was found.

""Photos would be key in this,"" he said.
County health officials told Fox News Digital that the images would not be released as public records.

Holland's family also alleges that text messages between her and Daus are indicative of an abusive relationship. Excerpts in the lawsuit show the couple arguing and Daus repeatedly telling her he wanted to call things off. Holland also had four daughters from a prior relationship.
Sweeney's unexpected death on Jan. 13 is the focus of a ""sudden death"" investigation by the Frontenac Police Department, Cpl. Tim Duda told Fox News Digital. Her autopsy and toxicology reports are expected to be completed within the next three to five weeks.

Frontenac police said they found Sweeney dead at 6:39 a.m. on Jan. 13. She had ""no apparent signs of trauma,"" the department said in a statement.
Her mother, Teresa Sweeney Light, told Fox News Digital the doctor was also diagnosed with mast cell activation syndrome. The condition can be life-threatening, but she said her daughter had it under control with medication and carried an EpiPen.
Anyone with information on Holland's death can contact St. Louis County Police at 314-615-5400. The investigation into Sweeney's death is being handled by the Frontenac Police Department at 314-373-6509.

""If the investigation rules she [died] as a result of a homicide, her death should be fully investigated as such, and I pray the person responsible is held accountable,"" Hartman said. ""I would also expect increased scrutiny on the Creve Coeur case as a result. However, we have not received the ruling on the cause of death for Sarah yet.""

""Star Wars"" actress Daisy Ridley reacted to the online backlash from some fans over the newest film's director, during an interview on NBC's TODAY on Thursday.
Ridley, who played ""Rey"" in the blockbuster franchise, was asked about how filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was targeted by online critics after she was picked to helm its latest film, ""New Jedi Order.""
""There are some of the —I'd say, extreme Star Wars fans— who've made this a conversation on the internet about how they don't want a female director,"" co-host Dylan Dreyer began. She called this ""bizarre"" since female producers and directors have been involved in various aspects of the franchise.
The Star Wars actress said she believed accusations some fans were sexist were overblown.
NEW ‘STAR WARS’ DIRECTOR SAYS ‘IT’S ABOUT TIME' A WOMAN SHAPES THE FRANCHISE
Award-winning director and journalist Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy spoke on a CNN interview about how the time has come for a woman to shape the story of the Star Wars universe. (CNN)
""I think my take is things get blown out of proportion,"" the actress responded. ""And the interactions I've ever had with people have been nothing but wonderful and supportive.""
""And honestly the day we announced that I was coming back at [2023 Star Wars Celebration] last year, you cannot imagine the joy and goodwill in that room. I've only ever been embraced. And I think we're going to make a great film,"" Ridley continued.
Some critics have complained the new Star Wars film's director is a ""woke activist"" due to some of her past comments.
Resurfaced comments Obaid-Chinoy made about her feminism and activism went viral recently after she was announced as the ""New Jedi Order"" director.

A clip of the director telling a crowd last year that her ""body of work... has been guided by my activism"" and ""every single piece of work I've made has a piece of activism in them,"" circulated online earlier this month.
Comments she made in 2015 about wanting to ""make men uncomfortable"" with her films also drew online backlash. The filmmaker and journalist was referring to ""her award-winning films about honor killings and acid attacks against women in her home country of Pakistan,"" according to Forbes.
She also drew criticism for her reaction to being chosen as the first woman and person of color to direct a Star Wars film.
""I’m very thrilled about the project because I think what we’re about to create is something very special,"" Obaid-Chinoy said to CNN. ""We’re in 2024 now, and I think it’s about time that we had a woman come forward to shape the story in a galaxy far, far away.""

The child also was suffering from Rickets, a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin D. She died at a hospital after an ambulance was called to the parent’s home on a report of a child not breathing.
The girl’s parents told police they never took her to a doctor because of their religious beliefs.
Snow-Ingram ""allowed her daughter to physically waste away because of her neglect and mistreatment,"" Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said. ""This was a child who stood no chance of surviving in the hands of her own parents.""
Snow-Ingram got prison terms of 20 and 17 years with the sentences to be served consecutively.

FIRST ON FOX: A Republican lawmaker on the House Homeland Security Committee is introducing legislation to defund sanctuary cities, as he takes aim at liberal mayors and governors who he says are hypocritically demanding taxpayer money to help them with the effects of the migrant crisis.
The ""No Funding for Sanctuary Cities Act"" is being introduced by Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, and would amend federal law so that any jurisdiction that blocks federal immigration enforcement would be ineligible for a range of federal law enforcement grants and any other grant administered by the Department of Homeland Security or Department of Justice.
It would also require the DHS secretary to report to Congress how many states and localities are not complying with federal immigration enforcement. It says that any funds that are withdrawn from sanctuary jurisdictions can be diverted to those that are in compliance.

Sanctuary jurisdictions limit or forbid compliance with federal immigration enforcement. Specifically, they prevent the honoring of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers, which request that illegal immigrants in custody be transferred to ICE so they can be deported.

Such jurisdictions also typically present themselves as welcoming to immigrants, including those in the country illegally. But the bill comes as the effects of the three-year migrant crisis at the southern border is having significant effects across the country, including in sanctuary cities like New York City and Chicago.
Subcommittee Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas, blamed ""soft-on-crime policies"" for the problematic trend in a statement announcing the hearing. (Getty Images)
The mayors of those cities have called for more federal assistance, including $5 billion in aid to help them shelter and care for migrants -- including a national decompression strategy to move some of them elsewhere. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has warned that the crisis could ""destroy"" the city, while Chicago has resorted to sheltering migrants at airports.

Republicans, including in Texas where Gov. Greg Abbott has been busing migrants to sanctuary cities, have accused those cities of being hypocritical now that they are receiving the migrants they claim to welcome.
""It is the height of hypocrisy that liberal mayors and governors who intentionally flout federal law by declaring themselves 'sanctuaries' from immigration laws are now begging the federal government for money to manage President Biden's border crisis,"" Pfluger said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""This bill is simple: any state or locality that prevents the enforcement of immigration laws will not receive a cent from federal taxpayers,"" he said.

GODMEX4R5T_050RHALFCFZOOKV,GREG GUTFELD: Biden White House determined to let as many illegal aliens into the United States as possible,By Greg Gutfeld Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 11:54pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-biden-white-house-illegal-aliens-united-states,"'Gutfeld!' panelists discuss the power struggle between federal agents and the Texas National Guard over razor wire along the southern border.
Happy Thursday, everybody. Calm down, calm down, calm down. I understand. All right, is the White House out of order, stopping Texas from defending its border? As you may have noticed, the White House is determined to let as many illegal aliens into the United States as possible. With migrant mobs as big as the crowds of Gutfeld fans at Eastern State Correctional.
VIDEO: Greg. Greg. Greg. Greg. Greg. Greg. Greg. Greg.
Stop it! All right, all right, all right. Grandpa Joe even told them to surge to the border like it was a new slogan for Taco Bell.
JOE BIDEN 2019: I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border all those people who are seeking asylum. They deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
GOVERNOR PLEDGES TO SHOP RAZOR WIRE TO TEXAS IF BIDEN STOPS ABBOTT
Ay Caramba! Did they ever listen to him? He's been waving in illegal immigrants like they're kids with freshly washed hair, but doesn't Joe know this invasion exhausts America's resources the way he exhausts the White House plumbing? After all, it wasn't too long ago when then-Senator Joe Biden spoke against sanctuary cities. Here's Joe in 2007, when he could still exit a stage without two guide dogs and a Sherpa. Roll it.
QUESTION: Would you allow these cities to ignore the federal law regarding the reporting of illegal immigrants and in fact provide sanctuary to these immigrants?
JOE BIDEN 2007: The reason that cities ignore the federal law is the fact that there is no funding at the federal level to provide for the kind of enforcement at the federal level you need.
QUESTION: Yes or no. Would you allow the cities to ignore the federal law?
JOE BIDEN 2007: No.
Hmhm. Of course, that was well before Joe became a spokesman for Life Alert. Since then, Joe's learned to ignore a lot of things like the border crisis, his extra grandchild, and the stain spreading on the front of his pants. But it's not a battle between Americans and migrants, or Republicans and Democrats. It's a fight between a bloated, power hungry federal government and the states that get screwed bearing the costs. But a few governors are fighting back.
BORDER BATTLE LINES: DEMS CALL ON BIDEN TO SEIZE CONTROL OF TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD, AS GOP ALLIES BACK ABBOTT
Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have been doing a great job of sending illegal aliens from border states to states whose policies have Americans fleeing to, well, Texas and Florida. Dems keep touting their sanctuary cities, right? They can't shut up about how caring they are. Turns out, though, there's only so many landscapers and illegal nannies the elites can employ before they realize: Hey, these people want to stick around.
So now all they do is whine about the overflowing migrants. They're like bartenders at last call. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. I guess when the sanctuary is at their doorstep, they're not so selfless, are they? But I like to think of it as reverse socialism. Lefties demand to share other people's resources, now it's time for them to share the pain. Martha's Vineyard saw a few dozen migrants and a few days later shipped them all out faster than Amazon Prime.
And now Abbott is fighting for his right to defend his state from this ongoing invasion at the southern border. In a statement from yesterday, Abbott said, ""The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states. The Executive Branch of the U.S. has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws, on the books right now. President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them. The result is that he has smashed records for illegal immigration."" Yeah, that was a lot of words.
Abbott has invoked Article I, Section Ten, Clause Three, exactly what you said, Kat, of the Constitution arguing that the U.S. is being invaded and his state has the right to act on it and now, not only is Biden ignoring the law, he's sending feds to take down the razor wire set up along the border, which is like the cops protecting you by removing your windows and painting help yourselves on the garage door.
TRUMP URGES STATES TO SURGE NATIONAL GUARD TO TEXAS AS ABBOTT STANDOFF WITH BIDEN ACCELERATES
Earlier this week, the Supreme Court ruled that Biden could do that, but Abbott vows to put the wire back up as fast as the feds can take it down. Because, as legal scholars note, Abbott isn't defying the ruling since the court didn't order Texas to do or not to do anything. And yet, bozos like Beto O'Rourke called this a violation of law, but with his track record, the only contest he hasn't lost yet is Miss Black America 2024. Of course, Dems are terrified that illegal aliens will hurt themselves trying to get through the wire, but if it was left up to the Dems, they would replace the wire with silly string. Sorry, you **** ****, you don't keep out invaders by lining the border with silk sheets and cocoa butter and it's incredibly easy to avoid razor wire. I've avoided razor wire every day of my life. You know, I've never walked past an auto repair shop and thought: If I can climb through that barbed wire, I can play with that friendly pit bull. It's always a pit bull. You see, these barriers and deterrents are meant to protect the border. That's what the border means, dummy. It's a line separating two areas. And you're not supposed to cross that line without permission. Every country has them, and there are all sorts of laws about it. Think of those rubber things you put down at the supermarket checkout that separates your Wonder Bread and mayo from the guy behind you with rice, beans and pig knuckles. It clears up immediately what is yours and what is mine. They're what keeps one area distinct from another.
If you don't think that's important, then listen to Democrats bitch about cultural appropriation. Yeah. They say: You all can come over here to sleep in our schools and airports, but you better not wear a sombrero on Cinco de Mayo. That's a barrier, but that's the great thing about being a Democrat. You only need to enforce the stuff you like. Case in point, Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro is telling Biden to take control of the Texas National Guard, hoping to replace don't mess with Texas with bend over for Biden. And now some are calling for Texas to secede from the U.S. and they have the experience. Texas was its own country back in the 1800s when it was founded by ZZ Top. So are we on the brink of another civil war or will Grandpa Joe just take a pill and a nap and forget he ever abdicated his oath of office in the first place? One thing's for sure. This ain't just about Texas, once illegal aliens get into the country, they can go just about anywhere they want. Do states have rights or is the president a king? When you're a Democrat? It all depends on who's in power.

TOM SHILLUE AS BIDEN: Oh, no. No, look, look, I agree with that guy Joaquin. He was good in that movie, The Joker, by the way. You know, I went to school with the real Joker and I beat him in arm wrestling. It's a true story. Not a joke, but there's not going to be a TEXIT. I mean, I got so much of Mexico, north of the border at this point. They're going to call it Texico. It's like Mexico, but with oil wells, black gold, Texas tea.

A California woman was rescued Tuesday after spending about 15 hours stranded on top of her overturned car that was partially submerged in rushing water on a flooded remote road, officials said.
The woman had tried to the other side of a flooded road in the 7000 block of Del Valle Road in Livermore at around 7:30 p.m. Monday night, the Alameda County Fire Department said. She underestimated how deep the water was and her car was swept away.
The rapid water overturned the vehicle, forcing the woman to swim into the cold waters and climb on top of the car. Officials told KTVU FOX 2 that the woman lost her cell phone and could not call for help.
""During that time that her vehicle overturned in the water, she lost phone and all other important items not to mention it was a bad coverage area anyway,"" Battalion Chief Kent Carlin said.

MANCHESTER, N.H. – Voters in New Hampshire shared who they'd like to see as former President Trump's running mate for the 2024 election.
""It has to be someone younger, a lot younger,"" Kate from Maine told Fox News. ""He’s old. [President] Biden’s old. The number two is really important in this election.""

Biden, 81, is the oldest sitting president to serve, while Trump, 77, previously held the record.
""It really doesn’t matter to me, but as long as it's somebody who supports the main person, then that's most important,"" Irene from Massachusetts said of Trump's potential running mate.

But Michael, from Arkansas, said the future president needs ""the Lord God"" at his side.
""Our president is gonna need our Lord God by him,"" Michael said. ""He's gonna have another battle on his hands trying to fix our country. It's so far gone.""
Some voters were more decisive about their would-be vice presidents. One New Hampshire voter, Diane, hopes Trump will choose his rival candidate, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
""I think she would balance [Trump],"" Diane said. ""She would offset his craziness.""

But Trump made it sound unlikely that his former ambassador to the United Nations would be his running mate.

During a Fox News town hall in Des Moines, Iowa, earlier this month, Trump said he knew who he was going to choose. The shortlist includes South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, among others, FOX Business reported.
But some voters just hoped for anyone but Trump to get elected.
""I have no idea,"" Brian, of New Hampshire, said. ""God help us if he gets in.""

GRBW7QBKC3_DGYPWX1DTF321YD,"Advice from a Boomer: Hey, Gen Z, here's how you get a job (and keep it)",By Dan Gainor Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 5:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/advice-boomer-gen-z-get-job-keep-it,"Ramsey Solutions host Ken Coleman says employers will need to coach young workers more than in previous years.
Work is a four-letter word. OK, not for everyone. But members of Gen Z are getting a bad reputation when it comes to employment. It looks like it’s time for Boomers to step in and help out again. As much as Gen Z hates it.
A new survey from Intelligent.com reads like an indictment of younger workers. There were lots of bad numbers, but here are two to really notice: ""38% of employers avoid hiring recent college graduates in favor of older employees"" and ""58% say recent college graduates are unprepared for the workforce.""
When nearly 40% of employers are avoiding your entire demographic group, that’s a problem. But that’s the result of a survey of ""800 U.S. managers, directors, and executives who are involved in hiring."" Welcome to the era of TikTok ruining careers – not just for those who post insipid job comments, but those who post are causing collateral damage across an entire generation.
HOW GEN Z AND MILLENNIALS WANT TO WORK IN 2024: 'LAZY GIRL JOBS,' 'BARE MINIMUM MONDAYS' — AND LESS
Gen Z members (I’m told they don’t like the term ""Zoomers"") fall in the age range of 11 to 26, so only a small number of them have hit the workforce. So far, the work world is hitting back … hard. Turns out, what younger people call ""adulting"" and we used to call growing up, well it’s tough.
Yeah, we know. It always has been, for every generation.
A Reddit thread from 2022 was headlined, ""Holy sh--. Adulting is hard."" It has nearly 28,000 up votes and more than 3,000 comments. Other similar threads were almost as popular – like ""Adulting sucks"" and ""Can't handle adulting.""
BOOMERS WERE RIGHT! 5 THINGS ABOUT ADULTING NO ONE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
I won’t try to address all of the problems of life here. So let’s just focus on work. Because if you don’t have a job, all the other problems get much worse – bills, healthcare, dating, renting and even owning pets. Turns out your dog Max expects to get fed. And, if you have kids, they will insist on food, as well. Kids are funny that way.
Much of the problem stems from the bad advice Gen Z is getting and a lot of it comes from the Chinese spy app TikTok. Workers are being told to quit without giving two weeks’ notice, which will likely come back and bite you. And they complain about low pay or are encouraged to take so-called ""lazy girl jobs"" that the Guardian described as ""jobs that are undemanding but well enough paid, with little personal passion involved.""
Even the U.S. Army is facing a ""TikTok mutiny"" because Gen Z recruits aren’t happy with either food or pay. Apparently, some recruits never saw a war movie or Googled ‘Army life.""
FORGET ‘QUIET QUITTING,’ NOW THERE'S ‘RAGE APPLYING’ — HERE'S WHY THE LATEST WORKPLACE TREND MATTERS SO MUCH
Some new workers are whining about working 9-5, like they are Dolly Parton fans. ""How am I supposed to fit my whole life into a 9-to-5 work schedule?"" recent grad Piper Hansen asked. She referred to a viral video where another Gen Z-er complained: ""I want to shower, eat my dinner and go to sleep. I don't have time or energy to cook my dinner either. Like, I don't have energy to work out, like that's out the window. Like, I'm so upset.""
One recruiter found a Gen Z intern who wanted to work just five hours a day and expected a lot of money to do it. InFeedo’s Sameera Khan explained on X back in July, ""I was interviewing a GenZ intern today and he says he is looking for work life balance with not more than 5 hours of work."" He added, ""Also, wants 40-50k stipend. God bless the future of work.""
Unfortunately for Gen Z, perception soon becomes reality. Stories like these became commonplace. ""Silence of the Lambs"" star Jodie Foster publicly complained that Gen Zers in Hollywood can be ""really annoying"" in ""the workplace."" (Movie fan note: Foster is also stunning with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen in the amazing Spike Lee movie ""Inside Man."")
IS GEN Z UNPREPARED FOR THE WORKFORCE? EXPERTS WEIGH IN
Foster then targeted two of the ongoing criticisms of the younger set – laziness and poor grammar. ""They’re like, ‘Nah, I’m not feeling it today, I’m gonna come in at 10.30am.’ Or, like, in emails, I’ll tell them this is all grammatically incorrect, did you not check your spelling? And they’re like, ‘Why would I do that, isn’t that kind of limiting?’""
Yes, laziness and illiteracy are a bit ""limiting.""
Even ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar has hopped on the anti-Gen Z train. During a discussion of the generation’s financial complaints, Behar responded, ""There's a million job openings in this country, get a job!"" Behar said.
Now, let me remind everyone, Gen Z isn’t the first generation to have a bad reputation. It was the Boomers' who spawned the hippies with their guidebook by Timothy Leary, ""Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out."" Then there were the stoners in the 1980s (Think ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and Jeff Spicoli."") And they were followed by slackers from the 1990s and early 2000s, including my favorites Jay and Silent Bob.
In the real world, they all grew up and embraced work. Admittedly, none of them were coddled, indoctrinated and then isolated by a global pandemic. So maybe we need to cut Gen Z a little slack and also understand not every complaint they make is a bad one.

Work-life balance, for example. That concept was unheard of by Boomers – much to our personal detriment. All the stats about declining families, lower church attendance and divorce might not be so bad if Boomers had focused a bit more on life outside the office.
And money is something most of us are struggling with. Government might tell you it has good news for the economy, but government doesn’t pay your rent or mortgage and doesn’t go food shopping for you. (Unless you are an illegal alien.) And those prices have all spiked thanks to Bidenomics.
Thankfully, not everyone is giving up on the next generation. MegaMeeting gave HR professionals some tips about how to interview why to hire so-called the younger generation. Some are quite good. It mentioned, they ""are digital natives,"" ""learn fast"" and are ""independent."" All very helpful, especially for new employees.
Two of the positives it listed might not work for every employer: they ""are passionate activists"" and ""care about company ethics and culture."" Those are great if they agree with you. Not so much if they don’t.

Ultimately, employers will need to adapt some to Gen Z, but the new work generation will have to adapt more to employers. Because they still have lots of options on which candidates to hire.
This has been Adulting, the graduate-level course. Here endeth the lesson.

At least nine people have died in a mountainous region of China on Monday following a landslide that buried 47 people in more than a dozen homes, reports say.
Video and images are now emerging of first responders combing through debris in the village of Liangshui in southwestern China in hopes of finding survivors.
The rescue operation is being hindered by snow, icy roads and freezing temperatures that are forecast to persist for at least the next three days, according to The Associated Press.
The disaster struck just before 6 a.m. By that evening, state broadcaster CCTV put the death toll at nine. About 500 people were evacuated from the area, while the Zhenxiong county publicity department says victims are buried in about 18 homes.

""I was asleep, but my brother knocked on the door and woke me up. They said there was a landslide and the bed was shaking, so they rushed upstairs and woke us up,"" the 35-year-old said.
Luo added that she had been unable to contact her sister and aunt, who lived closer to the site of the landslide.

GTJBR3OEZG_93AN6LR2WKY6C1G,Trump urges states to surge National Guard to Texas as Abbott standoff with Biden accelerates,By Adam Shaw Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 5:58pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-urges-states-surge-national-guard-texas-abbott-standoff-with-biden-accelerates,"The Story panelists David Asman and Robert Wolf react to the bombshell proposed draft resolution the RNC is considering.
Former President Donald Trump on Thursday gave his backing to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott amid the latter’s feud with the Biden administration over border security — urging states to send their National Guards to the border and promising to work ""hand in hand"" with the state to combat the ""invasion"" if he is inaugurated again in January 2025.
In posts to Truth Social, Trump backed Abbott and accused President Biden of ""fighting to tie the hands"" of the Republican governor ""so that the Invasion continues unchecked.""
A feud that has been bubbling for months between Texas and the administration exploded in recent weeks after Texas seized the Shelby Park area of Eagle Pass and blocked Border Patrol from entering — sparking protests and threats of legal action from the administration.
SPEAKER JOHNSON SAYS HOUSE ‘WILL DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER’ TO BACK TEXAS OVER BORDER FEUD
The Supreme Court this week found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas along the border, after a lower court had blocked the administration from doing so.

The two sides have been feuding since 2021 when the migrant crisis escalated and Texas launched Operation Lone Star to surge resources to the border. The administration recently sued over an anti-illegal immigration law that allows state and local law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants. It has also sued over the state’s setting up of buoys in the Rio Grande. The administration says immigration enforcement is up to the federal government and Texas is interfering.
ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS ‘RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE’ FROM MIGRANT 'INVASION AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN
""Whether it is leaving migrants on the side of the road in the dead of winter, installing razor wire to make Border Patrol’s job more dangerous, promoting extreme and unconstitutional laws like S.B. 4, or his latest actions in Eagle Pass, Governor Abbott has repeatedly proven that he is not interested in solutions and only seeks to politicize the border,"" a recent White House statement said.
""The President has been clear that we need adequate resources and policy changes, and that our immigration system is broken. That is why on his first day in office he presented Congress with a comprehensive immigration reform plan, and that is why he is working to find a bipartisan agreement with Congress that includes funding and meaningful reforms,"" it added.
Abbott this week cited a ""right to self-defense"" and noted he has already declared an ""invasion"" to invoke the authority, which he calls ""the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary.""
Trump said that Abbott must be given ‘full support"" and encouraged ""all willing states to deploy their guards to Texas to prevent the entry of illegals and to remove them back across the border.""
TEXAS AG PAXTON PROMISES ‘FIGHT IS NOT OVER’ AFTER SCOTUS RULE ON BIDEN ADMIN'S RAZOR WIRE CUTTING
""When I am President, on Day One, instead of fighting Texas, I will work hand in hand with Governor Abbott and other Border States to Stop the Invasion, Seal the Border, and Rapidly Begin the Largest Domestic Deportation Operation in History,"" he said.
""Those Biden has let in should not get comfortable because they will be going home,"" Trump said.

Abbott has also picked up the support of more than two dozen Republican states who have publicly expressed their support for the state. Meanwhile, some Democrats have urged the Biden administration to seize control of the National Guard.

GWB9IISEDU_5N5PENBWH6G01TY,'Scrappy' Ukraine's victories over Russian Navy provide little celebrated but vital success,By Peter Aitken Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 4:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/scrappy-ukraines-victories-russian-navy-provide-little-celebrated-vital-success,"Poland’s President Andrzej Duda joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ to discuss the country’s increased defense funding to stop Russia’s wrath.
Ukraine’s forces have racked up notable success against Russia’s fearsome Black Sea fleet, leading to increased grain exports despite pessimistic expectations from allies.
""Ukrainians have certainly proven themselves as scrappy throughout this conflict,"" Rebekah Koffler, a strategic military intelligence analyst and the author of ""Putin's Playbook,"" told Fox News Digital.
""Even now, when many analysts have given up on Ukraine's ability to win against a much more powerful military and economy — Russia — Kyiv continues to make a tremendous effort to stay in the fight rather than negotiate with the aggressor,"" Koffler said. ""If the Ukrainians can maintain the sea corridor and sustain the same decent level of grain exports as it did in December, it will improve the chances of the nation’s survival, albeit not victory, against Russia's onslaught.""
Western attention has largely focused on the results of Ukraine’s much-touted and discussed counteroffensive, which failed to produce the gains many had anticipated. Instead, Ukraine has quietly worked on securing relatively safe exports through the Black Sea, ensuring grain shipments continue during wartime.

The United Nations brokered a deal in July 2022 to ensure that the ""breadbasket of Europe,"" responsible for 30% of the global grain supply, would continue to ship vital grains despite a Russian blockade.
The deal collapsed one year later, and Russia started hitting grain silos, leaving many in fear of a food shortage crisis. However, as it had throughout the conflict, Ukraine refused to simply fold to Moscow's pressure and worked tirelessly to create alternative means of shipment.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the efforts in several speeches during his foreign state visits in the final months of 2023, claiming the Russian fleet ""is no longer capable of operating in the western part of the Black Sea and is gradually retreating from Crimea.""
RUSSIAN MISSILE FOUND MARKED WITH KOREAN CHARACTER, SUGGESTING NORTH KOREAN ORIGIN: REPORT
""This is a historic achievement,"" Zelenskyy said as he tried to raise spirits and support for the continued Ukrainian effort in the face of fatigue as the war lurches toward a third year with no clear end in sight.
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in December wrote an analysis of the impressive gains Ukraine has made in a largely unnoticed battle, saying Ukraine had ""changed Russian naval operating patterns, causing the Black Sea Fleet (BSF) to move some ships away from its main base in Sevastopol, Crimea, and hampering the BSF’s ability to interfere with maritime trade"" in the region.
Russia launched a second day of ""massive"" strikes against Ukrainian grain storage areas. (Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure/Ukraine's State Emergency Services via Facebook )
The strikes, launched at the end of the summer of 2023 and through the autumn, ""successfully facilitated the use of Ukraine’s Black Sea grain corridor,"" ISW analysts wrote. The analysis stressed that the resistance had ""hindered"" the Russian fleet’s ""ability to operate aggressively in the western part of the Black Sea.""
Ukraine has managed to export over 5.6 million metric tons of grain and other products through the new corridor, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink tweeted in November. But Ukrainian Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said exports had hit nearly double that number per month before the war.
Oleksiy Goncharenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, said the number had hit 7 million tons by early December, providing a ""very welcome boost"" to the economy, The Hill reported. Goncharenko compared the Black Sea progress to the highly-praised counteroffensive in late 2022.
RUSSIAN TRANSPORT PLANE CRASHES NEAR UKRAINE WITH MORE THAN 60 UKRAINIAN PRISONERS OF WAR ABOARD
""In addition to forcing Putin’s fleet to retreat, Ukraine’s attacks on Russian-occupied Crimea have also significantly weakened the logistical networks that are essential for the resupply of the Russian army in southern Ukraine,"" Goncharenko wrote for the Atlantic Council.

Part of the success came from Britain and France’s decision to supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles and SCALP cruise missiles that ""dramatically enhanced Ukraine’s ability to strike targets in Crimea.""
Ukraine also utilized naval drones, produced domestically, which Kyiv demonstrated in successful attacks on a Russian warship and oil tanker near Novorossiysk, which serves as a major hub for Russian energy exports.
The Atlantic Council, in a separate analysis, argued that much of the wartime fatigue among Western allies rests with a lack of progress in the ground conflict, where Ukraine has failed to change the deadlock throughout much of 2023.

Instead, the council suggests paying attention to gains made in the Black Sea, where, ""despite having no warships of its own, Ukraine managed to force Putin’s fleet to retreat from Crimea and succeeded in breaking the Russian naval blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports.""
""This remarkable Ukrainian progress may now offer a blueprint for a more general victory over Russia,"" Peter Dickinson, chief Editor of Business Ukraine Magazine for the Eurasia Center, wrote.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre doubled down on President Biden's admission that the U.S. border is not secure on Monday.
Jean-Pierre nevertheless dodged when asked why Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has repeatedly testified to Congress that the border is in fact secure. The White House described the border as a ""broken"" system that needs further funding.
""On Friday, President Biden said that he does not believe the border is secure, which is different from what Secretary Mayorkas has testified multiple times on the Hill. Why do they have two different views of the security of the border?"" a reporter asked.
""The president has been really clear that we need to move on the border,"" Jean-Pierre responded. ""Him saying that we need to deal with border security, as we, as Mayorkas, as we all have here been doing at the White House, I think shows that we have an issue at the border and we need to deal with it, and we have to act now. There's an urgent need.""
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT POPULATION SOARS UNDER BIDEN: GOVERNMENT DATA
""Mayorkas, who is tasked with making sure those resources are applied – If he is saying something different than the president about whether it's secure or not. I guess I have a hard time understanding why there is a disconnect here,"" the reporter pressed.

""Look, the president has repeatedly said the immigration system is broken,"" Jean-Pierre responded, going on to point to immigration proposals he put forward over the past three years.

Biden's administration has sought to downplay record-high levels of illegal immigration seen in the late months of 2023. As many as 10,000 migrants were arrested daily at the southwest U.S. border in December, but the White House sought to pass it off as a seasonal surge.
There were 242,418 migrant encounters at the southern border in November – the highest November on record and the third-highest month ever.

GWS2PILTUN_GGO2AXCFCFX09DN,"School choice revolution helps homeschoolers, too","By Corey DeAngelis , Jason Bedrick Fox News","Published January 26, 2024 8:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/school-choice-revolution-helps-homeschoolers,"Marking the kickoff of 'National School Choice Week,' senior fellow at the American Federation for Children Corey DeAngelis joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the National Education Association launching an anti-school choice campaign.
A school choice revolution is sweeping the nation. Ten states have passed universal education choice initiatives in the last two years. In addition to private school tuition, most of these new programs allow families to use their children’s taxpayer-funded education dollars to cover certain homeschool expenses.
The loudest and most influential pushback against school choice comes from Democratic politicians in the pocket of the teachers unions, who want to protect their monopoly over education. However, others have voiced the opposite concern that school choice could increase government regulation of private education.
The concern that ""with government shekels come government shackles"" is understandable, but misplaced. Shackles can be imposed even without subsidies, and states that have education choice policies tend to respect homeschooling autonomy more than those that don’t.
SCHOOL CHOICE SCHOLARSHIPS SEE SOARING POPULARITY AFTER COVID LEARNING LOSS
The government can already regulate private education without providing any funding. It has happened historically and still happens today. Oregon went as far as outlawing private education altogether in 1922 at the behest of the Ku Klux Klan, which sought to shut down Catholic schools. Thankfully, in 1925, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that bigoted law, famously ruling that ""the child is not the mere creature of the State.""
The nationwide school choice revolution doesn't necessarily bring added regulation. The states that support education choice aren't the ones that also support added control. (iStock)
Yet funding need not come with burdensome regulations. States without school choice policies — including Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island — are among the worst states when it comes to burdensome regulations for homeschool families according to the Home School Legal Defense Association. Meanwhile, states like Iowa, Indiana and Oklahoma respect the autonomy of homeschool families and have universal or nearly universal education choice policies.
States with more school choice generally have more freedom to homeschool. In fact, last year, Ohio lawmakers passed both universal school choice and a reduction in homeschool regulation.
Education choice policies shift the locus of control over education from politicians and bureaucrats to families. When a government-run school fails to meet a child’s individual learning needs or is pushing values that run contrary to her family’s values, choice policies give that family an immediate escape hatch.

Empowering families with education choice also reduces the likelihood of harmful government regulation. As more families benefit from private and home education, the coalition willing to fight for the autonomy of private education will also grow.
The school choice coalition has been careful to support legislation that includes language preserving the autonomy of private education providers. For example, Arizona’s education savings account (ESA) statute states that a school ""shall not be required to alter its creed, practices, admissions policy or curriculum"" as a condition of accepting ESA students. Arizona enacted ESAs more than a decade ago and there have been no encroachments on the freedoms of private schools or homeschoolers.
Nearly every state constitution requires the state legislature to subsidize education to grant every child access to schooling. The question is only whether that subsidy will be in the form of government-run schools to which students are assigned, or directly to families who have the freedom to choose where and how their children are educated.

School choice is always voluntary. No school choice policy has ever forced a family or a school to participate. All families and schools can weigh the costs and benefits and make their own decisions.
Let’s not make the perfect the enemy of the good. As economist Thomas Sowell often reminded us, ""there are no solutions, only tradeoffs."" School choice isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s the most viable option we have today. America’s education system would be much better off if every family had access to the learning environments that worked best for their children.

Senate Republicans face a ""quandary"" with regard to linking a potential border security measure with Ukraine in the national security supplemental package, fueled by confusion about Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's comments in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday night.
Some GOP lawmakers reportedly interpreted McConnell's assessment of current border negotiations as stepping back from securing an agreement and bowing to Trump's demands to refuse a border deal with Democrats. But on Thursday, other lawmakers told reporters that McConnell was ""laying out the quandary.""
""I think he was just kind of laying out the quandary we're in,"" said Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., ""and laying out kind of what the field looks like. And so we got to see the text before we do anything else.""
Lead Republican negotiator Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., agreed with Ricketts.

Lankford added that Trump is not involved in the negotiations and that he doesn't agree with putting off dealing with the crisis at the border for the sake of keeping it a prime election issue for conservatives to tout against Biden.
""I don't doubt that he wants a perfect deal,"" Lankford said of Trump. ""So do I on it. But we've got to be able to figure out how to be able to do something right now to get as much done as we can possibly get done.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters Thursday that he doesn't think improving conditions at the border ""changes the 2024 outcome.""
""Presidentially, I think, it is what we're expected to do,"" Graham said. ""So, I think the best thing for the Republican Party to do right now is try to work with Democrats where you can to make the country safer and stronger.""
According to Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a ""faction"" of Republicans want to hold off on addressing the border, which has become a key election issue especially for GOP voters.
""I know there's a faction that thinks it's better to do nothing on the border for political gain, but I still think there is a big group of Republicans that wants to help solve the problem at the border,"" Murphy said.
Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., said he doesn't think splitting up Ukraine and border security should be ""taken off the table"" in an election year.

""I don't believe we should take this off the table,"" Young said of splitting the issues up. ""Certainly not to clear the way for a clean, campaign, debate season. Let's get something consequential done for the American people. That's how you instill trust in government in your elected representatives, rather than paying fealty to short-term considerations.""
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, however, believes the potential border deal would fail to stop the flow of migrants crossing the border. He told Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that ""it's a terrible deal.""
""There's a lot of the D.C. establishment that wants this deal, but it's designed not to solve the problem,"" he said. ""I'm telling my colleagues: Do not do any deal that fails to secure the border. We got to fix the problem or give up on it.""
A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been trying to secure a deal for months with White House officials to unlock $60 billion of aid to assist Ukraine's war with Russia that's included in the national security supplemental bill. The Department of Defense has already depleted its available funds earmarked for Ukraine without needing approval from Congress.
The Biden administration is seeking over $100 billion in funding, including $14 billion for the border. But Republicans have demanded limits on migrant releases into the interior, including the use of parole, and negotiators have been attempting to find a compromise.

Multiple sources familiar with a portion of the proposal told Fox News Digital this week that a part of the deal would tighten the language of the initial credible fear standard for asylum screenings. One source said that those briefing lawmakers had predicted it could lead to the majority of migrants going through the screenings being removed.
While the provisions of the bill are still fluid, negotiators have said they are hoping to have a bill text soon — indicating that the provisions, while fluid, are close to being finalized. GOP lawmakers are growing restless to see the bill text, with some arguing the ""secret"" negotiations will sidestep conservatives and produce a heavier immigration policy win for Democrats.

But even if the Senate passes the supplemental, it will be dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled House. GOP lawmakers in the lower chamber want nothing short of H.R. 2, which the House passed last year and includes Trump administration-era border policies like ""Remain in Mexico"" and construction of a border wall.
It's unclear when the border deal will be reached or when the supplemental package will be brought to the floor for a vote. Senators are expected to recess on Feb. 9.

The two Arkansas inmates who are on the run Wednesday following their escape from a jail in Pine Bluff broke out of the facility after making a hole in the shower area, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office says.
Maj. John Bean told Fox News Digital that investigators are ""running down leads"" and ""checking out known addresses, friends, [and] family"" of Noah Roush and Jatonia Bryant, but have so far not been able to track them down.
""They were able to get out through the shower area by making a hole through the ceiling and then once making their way through that hole, they made a hole in the roof of our facility and got out through there,"" Bean said, describing how Roush and Bryant – who was being detained on a murder charge – vanished from the Dub Brassell Adult Detention Center earlier this week.
""I would encourage them to turn themselves in as soon as possible,"" Bean added.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Local governments in Ohio can no longer regulate tobacco in their communities after the Republican Legislature overrode on Wednesday GOP Gov. Mike DeWine's veto of a budget measure that puts regulation instead in the hands of the state.
The measure, vetoed in 2022 before reappearing in the state budget, says regulating tobacco and alternative nicotine products should be up to the state, not municipalities. It also prevents communities from voting to restrict things like flavored e-cigarettes and sales of flavored vaping products.
OHIO BANS 'GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE' FOR MINORS, RESTRICTS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES DESPITE GOP GOVERNOR VETO
The new law will take effect in roughly 90 days, though it's not yet clear how that could affect local governments that have any stricter tobacco rules in place.
Local governments will no longer be able to restrict tobacco products in OH.
Lawmakers passed the 2022 legislation days after Ohio's capital city, Columbus, cleared its bans on the sale of flavored tobacco and menthol tobacco products, which would have been enacted in early 2024. Toledo and Beckley have similar bans.
Anti-tobacco advocates, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and DeWine himself harshly criticized the override as a win for the tobacco industry, saying it enables addiction in children as tobacco and vaping products made with fruit or candy flavors becomes more popular and accessible to kids.
Opponents of the measure also say it violates Ohio's home rule provision, which allows local governments to create their own ordinances as long as they do not interfere with the state's revised code.
Those against the measure have also expressed fear that it will wipe out other local tobacco restrictions entirely. Leo Almeida, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, told The Associated Press that, as written, the law is too broad.
""Taking local control away from the people who are trying to improve public health is a big mistake,"" Almeida said.
Senate President Matt Huffman said Wednesday that legislators have carefully reviewed the language with the Legislative Service Commission, a nonpartisan agency that drafts bills for the General Assembly, and don't believe it impacts all possible tobacco restrictions local governments could pass.
Proponents of the measure tout it as a way to maintain uniformity for tobacco laws and eliminate confusion for Ohioans. They argue the state should have control rather than communities because restrictions on the products would affect state income as a whole.

DeWine has maintained that the best way to ensure uniformity in these laws would be a statewide ban on flavored tobacco.
At least two states, California and Massachusetts, have passed statewide bans on selling all flavored tobacco products."

Former President Trump announced donors to his presidential primary opponent will be ""barred"" from the ""Make American Great Again"" community.
In a lengthy Truth Social diatribe against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who the former president called a ""birdbrain,"" Trump promised to reject any attempts by her donors to switch to his camp.
""Nikki ‘Birdbrain’ Haley is very bad for the Republican Party and, indeed, our Country. Her False Statements, Derogatory Comments, and Humiliating Public Loss, is demeaning to True American Patriots,"" the former president wrote. ""Her anger should be aimed at her Third Rate Political Consultants and, more importantly, Crooked Joe Biden and those that are destroying our Country - NOT THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SAVE IT.""

In the post, Trump reflected on past election experiences in which donors to opposing candidates would consolidate around him as campaigns came to an end.
Objecting to portions of the Republican Party's opposition to his re-election campaign, the former president swore not to take money from Haley's donors in the future.
""When I ran for Office and won, I noticed that the losing Candidate’s 'Donors' would immediately come to me, and want to 'help out.' This is standard in Politics, but no longer with me,"" Trump continued.

He concluded, ""Anybody that makes a 'Contribution' to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don’t want them, and will not accept them, because we Put America First, and ALWAYS WILL!""
Trump also accused Haley, whom he appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in 2017, of being weak on the world stage.
""I knew Nikki well, she was average at best, is not the one to take on World Leaders, and she never did. That was up to me, and that is why they respected the United States,"" Trump continued.

Haley projected optimism as the former South Carolina governor began campaigning in her home state Thursday.
Nevertheless, Haley appears to have few allies in the upper echelon of the South Carolina GOP and the Republican Party, with both of her state's senators endorsing Trump and RNC head Ronna McDaniel all but declaring Trump the victor in the 2024 primary.
Rep. Nancy Mace also congratulated Haley on a well-run campaign but endorsed Trump earlier this week.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The dictator of North Korea made a rare acknowledgment of the poor living conditions in his country at a government meeting this week.
Supreme leader Kim Jong Un said in a Thursday speech to the Workers' Party of Korea that the disparity in quality of life between the countryside and cities must be addressed.
""Today, failure to satisfactorily provide the people in local areas with basic living necessities including condiments, foodstuff and consumption goods has arisen as a serious political issue that our Party and government can never sidestep,"" the dictator said to the assembly, according to Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Kim urged any government official who sat idly by while the quality of life deteriorated to ""admit without saying a word or an excuse"" that they were incapable of carrying out the Workers' Party of Korea agenda.
The supreme leader spoke in a series of winding, verbose statements while lamenting the treatment of poor rural communities.
He told the Workers' Party members, ""As we are now in the course of effecting a great change for the project of developing the countryside, which was already raised, through a grand struggle, fully aware of the importance and urgency of the building of a new socialist ideal rural construction in the light of the demand of the turning phase for ushering in a period of socialist comprehensive development, it is easier said than done to undertake and strictly carry out the overall development of regional industry, another front and another great revolutionary stage,"" Kim said, according to KCNA.

The address to the party was a rare moment of internal honesty for the regime, which is normally predisposed to championing questionable claims of good governance and social well-being.
North Korea remains one of the poorest countries in the world due to economic mismanagement and widespread international sanctions on its trade.
""North Korea had concentrated its resources in Pyongyang to secure support for the regime among its core population. But resources have become more scarce amid continued sanctions,"" a South Korean Unification Ministry official said, according to Yonhap News Agency.

North Korea has ostensibly made a clean break from South Korea in recent weeks, announcing an end to any campaigns even superficially seeking reunification.
Kim's regime cited continued military exercises near the country's borders and pressure applied in response to North Korean nuclear-capable drone tests as the reason for the break.

- Democrats hold an ""unsanctioned"" primary – with Biden appearing only as a write-in candidate
- Pelosi, AOC accused of ‘disdain for law’ for social media use
Former President Trump and Nikki Haley are the last two Republicans campaigning for the GOP nomination for president in 2024.
Trump's early results are strong, and the Fox News Decision desk projects that the former president will handily win the most delegates in the state.
The stakes are high for Haley. If she comes in with a strong showing, she could stay in the race for more state primaries in the coming weeks. But Trump's impressive, record-breaking showing in Iowa may cast some doubt about whether Haley has a path to the nomination.
Biden also took a victory in New Hampshire — but an empty one. A dispute between New Hampshire and the DNC made it an ""unsanctioned"" primary. Still, Biden will take the most votes through a write-in campaign. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips, however, could be in the double digits – an embarrassment for the incumbent president.

A Texas state senator wants to reopen the impeachment case against state Attorney General Ken Paxton.
State Sen. Drew Springer, a Republican from Muenster, urged his colleagues in the Texas Senate to take a second look at impeachment charges against Paxton after the attorney general said he would not contest allegations in a whistleblower lawsuit.
""He cannot admit guilt while claiming innocence,"" Springer wrote on X. ""I urge the Lt. Gov & my Senate colleagues to consider reopening Paxton's impeachment. Paxton has not only admitted to violating the articles of impeachment, but he is exposing Texas taxpayers to a settlement of WELL OVER $3.3M. Texans deserve the truth!""
Paxton was acquitted in September of all impeachment articles filed against him for corruption and unfitness for office. He had faced accusations that he misused his political power to help real estate developer Nate Paul — allegations that stemmed from a lawsuit filed by four former employees who reported him to the FBI.

The whistleblowers — Blake Brickman, Ryan Vassar, Mark Penley and David Maxwell — claimed that they were unjustly terminated for reporting Paxton.
Springer voted for Paxton's acquittal on 16 impeachment charges at trial in September. However, he now says that ""recent developments have made me question whether AG Paxton and his legal team misled the Senate.""

What happened? Last week, the Office of the Attorney General said in a court filing it could ""obtain a verdict in this case in its favor,"" but instead moved to settle the lawsuit to ""stop the self-aggrandizing political weaponization of our State’s courts by rogue employees who have what seems to be a monomaniacal goal to undermine the will of the voters,"" FOX 7 Austin reported.
""Doing so precludes further unwarranted expense to the people of the State of Texas as well as the disruption to the State’s principal law enforcement arm — the time and personnel of which are more appropriately dedicated to the business of the State of Texas and not the personal, political agenda of four rogue, former employees,"" the filing states.

In the filing, Paxton stated, ""OAG hereby elects not to contest any issue of fact in this case, as to the claim or damages.""
Springer argues this amounts to an admission of guilt that should be reviewed by the legislature.

""While AG Paxton claims this decision is not an admission of guilt, the fact of the matter is it is an admission of guilt. He can't accept the whistleblower's claims against him while touting that he's innocent against those very claims,"" Springer said.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was executed in Alabama on Thursday night with nitrogen gas, a controversial method that causes oxygen deprivation that has been criticized as inhumane, following a failed last-minute legal battle.
Smith, a convicted murderer, was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. local time at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore.
Prior to Smith's death sentence being carried out, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the second time in as many days that the state could proceed with using nitrogen hypoxia to execute Smith, refusing to block the nation’s first execution by a new method since 1982.
Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Jackson dissented.
ALABAMA DEATH ROW INMATE SERVED SIMPLE LAST MEAL HOURS BEFORE NOVEL EXECUTION IN MURDER-FOR-HIRE KILLING

""Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""The world is watching.""
For his last meal, Smith was served steak, hash browns and eggs, the Alabama Department of Corrections said. He was visited by his wife, his son, two friends and his attorney.
The execution garnered international attention because of its method, which causes the person inhaling the nitrogen gas through a mask to die from a lack of oxygen.
Smith's lawyers argued Alabama was trying to make him the ""test subject"" for an untried execution method after he survived the state's previous attempt to put him to death by lethal injection.
""There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person,"" Smith’s attorneys wrote.
The defense also argued a second execution attempt is unconstitutional after Smith was one of three Alabama death row inmates who survived a botched lethal injection in 2022.

The 2022 attempt, which lasted over four hours, caused Smith ""severe physical pain and psychological torment, including posttraumatic stress disorder,"" his lawyers said.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Smith's initial request for a stay.
""The application for stay of execution of sentenced of death presented to Justice (Clarence) Thomas and by him referred to the Court is denied,"" SCOTUS said.
In a statement before he was put to death, Smith and his minister, Rev. Dr. Jeff Hood, said: ""The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse. Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other.""

Smith was put to death for his role in a 1988 murder-for-hire plot that killed Elizabeth Sennett. He and John Forrest Parker killed the preacher's wife for $1,000 apiece.
Sennett's husband killed himself a week after the murder.
Parker was executed via lethal injection in 2010.

As she told Fox News in 2020, she and her first husband split because ""he always viewed my job as a hobby. And there came a time where I resented that.""
She noted that her father was initially disappointed but ""eventually he came around. He saw how unhappy I was.""
""And it was the right thing because I moved to the city. Within a relatively short time, I met Jerry Shiendlin. So, it was a frightening time but a fun time.""
Judy met Jerry, then a defense attorney, at a bar.

""I just finished trying a murder case as a defense lawyer,"" he told the Los Angeles Times in 1999. ""There was a reporter from the New York Post there at the bar, and I was speaking to him about the case. Judy came walking in and put her finger in my face and said, 'And who is this?' I said, 'Lady, get your finger out of my face.' We've been together ever since.""
In Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue’s book, ""What Makes a Marriage Last: 40 Celebrated Couples Share with Us the Secrets to a Happy Life,"" per People, Sheindlin revealed that Jerry had been hesitant about a second marriage.
""I actually had to drag him to the altar. ... He had no intention of divorcing his wife, even though they had been separated for three or four years. After we were together for about a year, I said, 'I want to see your divorce in the newspaper or don't bother calling again,'"" she recalled.
""I said, 'I'm not going to do that,'"" Jerry added. ""So, she whipped out a calendar and said, 'Pick a date. Now.'""

The couple was married for 13 years before they hit a major bump in the road.
In 1990, Judy's father died, and as she struggled with the grieving process, she didn’t feel supported by Jerry.
""I said, 'I've been taking care of you for 12 years, now it's your turn to take care of me.' And he was totally unaccustomed to that role,"" she said in ""What Makes a Marriage Last,"" per E! News. ""I wasn't asking for anything unreasonable, and he wasn't being unreasonable saying that he really didn't know how to do that. He was 55 and had lived a certain way all his life. He couldn't even conceptualize taking over that role. He just couldn't.""
According to E!, Sheindlin issued an ultimatum.

""She said to me, 'If you can't maneuver this, I'm going to divorce you,'"" Jerry recalled. ""And I said, 'Oh, yeah? I dare you.' And the next day I got divorce papers. The next day. So, that was the end of that.""
The divorce only lasted a year as the couple genuinely missed each other.
""I missed her presence the very first week that we were separated,"" Jerry said. ""It was the first time in years that we didn't get to see each other every single day. It was such a strange experience.""
Jerry recalled they were walking together in Manhattan after leaving family court, and he said to her, ""'This is silly. I'm uncomfortable being with you all the time and not being married to you. Let's get married again.' She said, 'Well, how are we going to do that?' I said, 'The clerk's office is right up the street. We can go in and get a license.'""
JUDGE JUDY SUGGESTS PRINCE HARRY IS LIKE A 'SELFISH, SPOILED, UNGRATEFUL' GRANDCHILD
Judy Sheindlin said another key to their long-lasting marriage is ""physical attraction."" (Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic)
They remarried in 1991 and have stayed strong, emotionally and physically, ever since.
In a 2021 People interview, Sheindlin admitted that being ""fit"" is a key aspect of their happy marriage.
""We’re both very surface people when it comes to that,"" she said at the time. ""You know, if you fall instantaneously for somebody, that means there’s a physical attraction. And people age. People, they change. You can either do it gracefully or you can say, ‘I give up.’""
""And I, for myself, I said, ‘I choose to not give up. I choose to stay fit,’"" she explained. ""So, don’t even think about anything but staying, looking as good as you can possibly look at this stage in your life.""

Sheindlin shared more advice in ""What Makes a Marriage Last,"" per E! News, about recognizing the feeling of knowing someone is going to be the one.
""I'd tell them they had to have that intangible feeling of looking across the room and saying, 'I've got to have me one of those,’"" she said.
Sheindlin continued, ""My father once told me that the first time he saw my mother was at a dance at the Jewish center when she was just 18. She was so pretty. My father was with his best friend, and he looked at him and said, 'You see that pretty girl over there? I'm going to knock that halo off of her head.' And he did. But he loved her from the first minute he looked at her. He saw her, and he said, 'I've got to have it.'""
""That's how I felt when I saw Jerry. I said, 'I have to have that forever.'"""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Nearly 30,000 cars were taken from their owners in Chicago last year, yet police efforts to catch the bandits reached record lows, one nonprofit says.
The number of vehicle thefts reported last year is the highest in 23 years, according to the Illinois Policy Institute. Not only did the arrest rate for car theft fall to 2.6%, but data collected through the Chicago Data Portal showed that it was the lowest level since the city started tracking crime online in 2001.
The Chicago Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the 29,063 motor vehicle thefts reported in 2023 amount to a 26% increase, Illinois Policy Institute states. The nonprofit says the number is more than triple what was reported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
""During 2023, CPD worked alongside community partners from across the city to reduce violence and build trust throughout our neighborhoods,"" Larry Snelling, who took over as the 64th police superintendent in September, said in a ""2023 in Review"" press release from earlier this month. ""As we head into the new year, we will continue our efforts to build stronger bonds amongst our residents, support the victims of crime and protect all Chicagoans.""

HDP9N8LK7W_HDU7G3BKCEQ0Q9T,South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace endorses Trump over Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 10:16am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-carolina-republican-nancy-mace-endorses-trump-over-haley-new-hampshire-primary,"Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on her continued support for Trump and her being considered as a possible VP pick.
Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., on Monday joined the list of South Carolina Republicans backing former President Trump over Nikki Haley ahead of the New Hampshire primaries.
Mace, who notably ruffled feathers in the House GOP as one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker last year, told The Associated Press that she was backing Trump over Haley, who lives in her congressional district and supported her in 2022 against a Trump-backed challenger.
""I don’t see eye to eye perfectly with any candidate. And until now I’ve stayed out of it,"" Mace told the AP. ""But the time has come to unite behind our nominee.""
Mace later confirmed to Fox News Digital that she endorsed Trump in the 2024 race.
""Today I’m endorsing Donald J. Trump for President. I don’t see eye to eye perfectly with any candidate. And until now I’ve stayed out of it. But the time has come to unite behind our nominee,"" Mace said in an emailed statement Monday. ""To be honest, it’s been a complete sh** show since he left the White House. Our country needs to reverse all the damage Joe Biden has done. By every barometer our lives and our nation were better under President Trump. The economy was booming, our border was locked down and our nation and her allies were safer because our adversaries feared him. Donald Trump’s record in his first term should tell every American how vital it is he be returned to office.""
Mace had stayed out of the 2024 Republican primary as two fellow South Carolinians – Haley, the former governor, and Sen. Tim Scott – entered the race last year. Scott, who ended his own 2024 bid in November and was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012, endorsed Trump over Haley on Friday in a rousing call-and-response speech in New Hampshire.
REP. NANCY MACE'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF CONSIDERING SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RUN AGAINST HER: REPORT
On Saturday, Trump was joined on stage at another New Hampshire rally by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and other senior statewide officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker, as well as U.S. Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry.

Haley, appearing on Fox News Monday morning, touted that she won South Carolina twice and expected a strong showing in the upcoming primaries in the Palmetto State.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ departure from the race on Sunday leaves Haley as the main GOP candidate remaining to challenge Trump.
New Hampshire votes on Tuesday, but South Carolina's primary is in a month, and the state's Republican leadership has largely already lined up behind Trump. Mace's endorsement means that Trump has secured four of the state's six Republican U.S. House members. Rep. Ralph Norman is backing Haley and Rep. Jeff Duncan is saying he’s not endorsing before the primary.
Just two years ago, Mace and Haley were aligned in a congressional primary that tested Trump's heft in South Carolina, where his own 2016 presidential primary win helped cement his nomination. After the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol, Mace, who had just been sworn in as a freshman lawmaker, went on TV to criticize Trump for his role in the day’s events, saying the president’s accomplishments in office ""were wiped out in just a few short hours.""

SC CONGRESSMAN TOUTS NIKKI HALEY'S 'YOUTH,' HITS TRUMP'S AGE AFTER PELOSI JAN. 6 MIX-UP
Trump responded by calling Mace ""an absolutely terrible candidate"" and soliciting ""any interest from good and SMART America First Republican Patriots"" to run against a list of sitting House Republicans, including Mace, whom he endorsed for her first run in 2020 and who worked for his 2016 campaign.
When Katie Arrington, who unsuccessfully sought the seat in 2018, launched her 2022 bid against Mace, she had Trump’s ""Complete and Total Endorsement."" During a pre-primary rally in South Carolina, Trump called Mace ""crazy"" and ""a terrible person.""
Haley, meanwhile, stumped with Mace, as she had in 2020, helping raise money and appearing in a television ad on her behalf, calling her a ""fighter.""

But the two reportedly haven't spoken since last year, when Mace's name was floated as a possible running mate for Trump, should he win the GOP nomination.
On Monday, Mace said she felt Trump was the better option this year.

Remains recovered from the central Indiana estate of a presumed serial killer have been identified as those of a man reported missing in 1993, a coroner said Thursday.
The remains recovered in 1996 at the Fox Hollow Farm estate of Herbert Baumeister were found to match Manuel Resendez, who was 34 when he disappeared, Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison said.
Resendez was identified through a family reference sample provided in early 2023, Jellison said.
POLICE ID 2 DNA PROFILES ON PROPERTY OF LONG-DECEASED IN BUSINESSMAN, SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER
Approximately 10,000 charred bones and bone fragments have been found at Baumeister’s 18-acre estate in Westfield, about 16 miles miles north of Indianapolis, Jellison has said.
The identification was made by Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison, who confirmed that the recovered remains matched Manuel Resendez.
Baumeister was 49 when he killed himself in Canada in July 1996 as investigators sought to question him about the remains discovered at Fox Hollow Farm.
HUMAN REMAINS FOUND IN INDIANA IN 1996 IDENTIFIED AS 9TH PRESUMED VICTIM OF MURDER SUSPECT
Investigators believed Baumeister, a married father of three who frequented gay bars, lured men to his home and killed them. By 1999, authorities had linked him to the disappearance of at least 16 men since 1980, including several whose bodies were found dumped in shallow streams in rural central Indiana and western Ohio.
Jellison announced a renewed effort in 2022 to identify the charred bones and fragments by asking relatives of young men who vanished between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s to submit DNA samples. He said investigators believe the bones and fragments could represent the remains of at least 25 people."

(Credit: Houses of the Oireachtas, June 13, 2023)
X owner Elon Musk has vowed to fund legal challenges to Ireland’s proposed hate speech legislation calling the controversial bill ""a massive attack on freedom of expression.""
The bill aims to tackle both incitement to hatred and hate speech and is being touted by the Irish government as a way to update existing laws in the age of the internet. Ireland’s current hate speech laws date back to 1989 but critics say the law would stifle free speech.
Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutionist,"" said that free speech is the bedrock of democracy.
""You have to be able to speak your mind within the context of the law: without that you don’t have a real democracy,"" Musk told Irish media outlet Gript.
""We will also fund the legal fees of Irish citizens who want to challenge the bill, so we'll make sure that if there is an attempt to suppress the voice of the Irish people that we do our absolute best to defend the people of Ireland and their ability to speak their mind.""

IRISH POLITICIAN BOASTS HATE SPEECH BILL WILL ‘RESTRICT FREEDOM’ TO PROTECT TRANS PEOPLE FROM ‘DISCOMFORT’
The legislation, the Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences bill, has already passed through the Dáil, Ireland's lower chamber, but it has stalled in the Senate, the upper chamber. However, Helen McEntee, the Irish minister for justice, has insisted it would be progressed this year.
The bill intends to criminalize communication or behavior that ""incites violence or hatred against a group or individual because they are associated with a protected characteristic.""
Protected characteristics listed in the bill include national or ethnic origin, as well as ""transgender and a gender other than those of male and female.""
According to many online users, the legislation was kept intentionally vague and suggests people could be jailed for having certain memes saved to their phones or for merely being found in possession of books or videos deemed politically offensive.

ELON MUSK SAYS HE SUPPORTS A BORDER WALL AND THAT MIGRANTS MUST HAVE A 'SHRED OF EVIDENCE' TO RECEIVE ASYLUM
Nate Hochman, a staff writer for National Review, said the bill represents, ""arguably the most radical legislation of its kind we've seen in the West.""
Musk said that X has standing in Ireland given its European headquarters is located in Dublin. Musk’s group of investors bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022 and took the company private.
""We have a big office in Ireland, a big presence in Ireland so we obviously have standing,"" the Tesla and Space X CEO said.
""This thing we should be concerned about is if the Irish Parliament passes a bill that defines hate speech as whatever they think hate speech is, people should be extremely concerned about that,"" Musk said.
""You’re just at the mercy of the ruling party and whatever bureaucrats they put in place and they can just define something that really is not hate speech as hate speech just because they don’t like it.""

White attackers turned a lush, high desert oasis in eastern Nevada, with its bubbling springs and a rare stand of Rocky Mountain junipers, into killing fields. They massacred hundreds of Native people there in the 1800s — a horrific history once retold in hushed tones behind closed doors.
That was until tribal members reluctantly found themselves defending the valley’s historical significance in state hearings. In the 2000s, they shared their painful past with authorities weighing whether to divert substantial amounts of groundwater that feeds the valley their relatives have long considered sacred.
Bahsahwahbee — Shoshoni for ""Sacred Water Valley"" — is where the spirits of their dead live on in the trees growing among the open graves, the final resting place of ancestors who remained where they were slain.
NEWLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD IN PENNSYLVANIA RECLAIMS INDIGENOUS MASCOT, REJECTS CANCEL CULTURE
Now they want to tell their story on their own terms. The Ely Shoshone, Duckwater Shoshone, and the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation — a coalition representing about 1,500 enrolled tribal members — are lobbying the federal government to designate nearly 40 square miles as Bahsahwahbee National Monument.
""The goal is to commemorate what happened there to protect the memory of that place,"" said Warren Graham, the Duckwater Shoshone chairman.
This lush section of the valley was visited by Shoshone and Goshute people, who were all related and called themselves ""Newe,"" for centuries, serving as a sacred site for healing and celebration. It was desecrated at least three times. In the mid-1800s, federal soldiers carried out two massacres at Bahsahwahbee in retaliation for attacks on settlers and their property.
Delaine Spilsbury, an Ely Shoshone elder, stands in Bahsahwahbee, a site in eastern Nevada that is sacred to members of the Ely Shoshone, Duckwater Shoshone and the Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, who collectively refer to themselves as ""Newe,"" on Nov. 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)
During the final massacre in 1897, two girls were away on a walk during the fall harvest. Upon return, they found vigilantes killing their family and friends.
One of those girls was Laurene Mamie Swallow, grandmother to 86-year-old Delaine Spilsbury, an Ely Shoshone elder who has worked for years on federal recognition of the sacred site.
""The people that were killed here were left here,"" said Spilsbury, sitting at dusk in a camp chair nestled among the trees. ""Their spirits, their bodies are in those trees. And so we darn sure are going to protect those people.""
For more than a century, the history of the massacres was recounted on a need-to-know basis. Charlene Pete’s mother closed the doors and drew the blinds the day she told her children about the violence against their Goshute ancestors — trained from her days at a boarding school to believe she’d face punishment for recalling her heritage.
""That’s the first time I’d ever seen my mom emotional like that,"" Pete said, recounting a wailing sound she later learned was customary for mourning. It was one of the few traditions her mother recalled from a time before the government forced her to attend a boarding school established to assimilate Native American children into white society.
When Las Vegas, which nearly doubled its population from 1990 to 2000, pursued a pipeline in the early 2000s to divert groundwater from the Bahsahwahbee area and pump it 300 miles to the burgeoning desert city, tribal members felt compelled to speak up.
""It came to a point where we had to start talking to save it,"" said Ely Shoshone elder Alvin Marques. He testified in a multi-decade legal battle alongside ranchers, local officials and environmental groups who all opposed the project by the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
TRIBAL LEADERS ASK WASHINGTON STATE LAWMAKERS FOR FUNDING TO COMBAT OPIOID CRISIS
College of Southern Nevada biology professor David Charlet said the trees likely wouldn’t last more than a half-century with a depleted water table.
""It can take cold, but it can’t take the heat and lack of water during the summer,"" Charlet said of the rare stand of trees.
Rocky Mountain junipers — known locally as swamp cedars for the springs they rely on to survive hot summers — are usually found thousands of feet higher on mountains. Birds likely dispersed their seeds, and they thrived because of the valley’s shallow springs that fed the soil, according to Charlet.
Ultimately, the Nevada Division of Water Resources denied the Southern Nevada Water Authority’s applications to pump water based on the protection of the cultural resource, said state engineer Adam Sullivan, who worked for the department during the ruling and later was appointed to lead it.
Protecting water for sacred trees is not something the agency had previously done, Sullivan said. In permitting projects, ""we look broadly at what is in the public interest, and that has evolved.""
The water agency appealed to a state district court, but was rebuffed and withdrew its permit requests in 2020.
Even if the land becomes a national monument, the water beneath Bahsahwahbee would remain under the state’s jurisdiction. Today, there are no major water permit applications in the valley, and any future applications to extract significant amounts of water would face high scrutiny, Sullivan said.
But the land and its heritage would be managed by the National Park Service, whose mission it is to preserve them, explained Neal Desai of the National Parks Conservation Association.
The designation would send a message that ""we have decided as a country that this place is absolutely essential and we will commit to doing our best to ensure that this place, this story, the reasons that it’s important, that it will be preserved and interpreted for the benefit of future generations,"" he said.
Bahsahwahbee is already listed on the National Register of Historic Places — a mostly symbolic title. It remains under the Bureau of Land Management, whose focus is in managing public land for multiple users. In becoming a monument, the land would transfer to the National Park Service, which would work alongside tribes to preserve the place and its history.
Tribal members involved in the monument effort say having enough water for the sacred trees is important, but the designation is really an opportunity to tell their story on their terms.
""They don’t teach about what happened to the Native American people in history enough,"" said Graham.
The Southern Nevada Water Authority supports a monument designation that allows for the continuation of existing ranching and agricultural activities, said Bronson Mack, water authority spokesman. The agency maintains a working ranch in the valley with limited water rights to support the operation.
As a national monument, its story would join the ranks of other painful American memories elevated on the national stage, including Japanese internment camps, sites associated with lynching of African Americans, and places where other massacres of Native people occurred.
It would also join Avi Kwa Ame, a stretch of biologically rich mountains and valleys in southern Nevada, and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni, an expanse of canyons, plateaus and streams in northern Arizona — both sacred to Native people in those areas. They are two of five national monuments President Joe Biden created in 2023, using his authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906.
The designation has broad support from the three tribes as well as the Nevada Legislature and the state’s U.S. senators, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, both Democrats who have lobbied Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on the issue. Cortez Masto’s office said the senator expects to soon introduce a bill in Congress to designate the monument.

A monument would be an important step toward reconciliation after more than 150 years, explained Monte Sanford, the tribes’ monument campaign director.
""There has never been an effort by the United States government to reconcile and recognize what happened to the Newe people at Bahsahwahbee,"" he said.
Looking at the trees grown from the same soil where her ancestors died, Spilsbury said she hopes the monument would help people heal, no matter who they are. She knows locals in nearby Ely whose ancestors were involved in the vigilante killing her grandmother witnessed.
""I know that if they could go and say, this is where we made amends with these folks, that it would be just as important to them as it is to me,"" she said. ""Or maybe more."""
HGGA0ODR6D_JA8YXHY2NWA6ZOE,Nikki Haley says 'unhinged' Trump had to back off pressuring RNC to declare him 2024 nominee,By David Rutz Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 11:59am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nikki-haley-unhinged-trump-back-off-pressuring-rnc-declare-2024-nominee,"Presidential candidate Nikki Haley joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the RNC backtracking on a presumptive nominee proposal, the upcoming South Carolina primary and a major donor's call for her to drop out of the race.
Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said Friday that a ""totally unhinged"" former President Trump was forced to back off pressuring the RNC to name him the presumptive nominee because the push-back was so dramatic.
The RNC was set to consider a resolution this week that would have declared Trump to be the party's presumptive nominee for president, if approved. However, Trump said Thursday on Truth Social that he did not want the process to go that way and rather it be settled at the ballot box.
This came on the heels of RNC chair Ronna McDaniel saying Haley should drop out and the party should unite around Trump to defeat President Biden in November.
Haley said she told McDaniel how ""disappointed"" she was in that stance and accused Trump of throwing a tantrum in his victory speech after Tuesday night's New Hampshire primary. She also took exception to his threat to ban her donors from the Make America Great Again movement.

""Think about that,"" she said. ""That's a president who's supposed to serve every person in America, and you're deciding that you're going to have a club, and actually ban people from being in and out of your club. And then he goes and encourages the members of the RNC and tries to push them into saying that he's the nominee in the race. I mean, they got so much push-back that he had to backtrack. He's totally unhinged.""
After ""America's Newsroom"" host Dana Perino noted Trump had spoken out against such a resolution, Haley said it was ""his people"" that pushed it forward.
""I know how much he's pushed on Ronna,"" Haley said. ""Ronna has made that very clear that he was pushing her to stop debates all this time, and so he pushes them to do things, and I think they got some major blowback, and that's why he had to walk it back. I mean, look, you can't bully your way through this process.""
The resolution was first floated and then withdrawn by a former aide of Trump's campaign, RNC committee member David Bossie.
The once-crowded 2024 GOP field has whittled down to just Trump and Haley after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out on Sunday, but the former president is in clear command after scoring decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire. Haley is facing daunting polling in upcoming states, but she hasn't signaled she's going anywhere.

Asked to respond to megadonor Andy Sabin also urging Haley this week to quit the race, saying he'd be the first to write her a check in 2028, Haley said she didn't listen to donors.
""We have a country to save, and I think we've got a lot of solutions, and we don't need to talk about how you push through an election,"" she said. ""We need to talk about what you're going to do for the American people, because right now the country is in disarray.""
""America's Newsroom"" co-host Bill Hemmer pressed Haley on the numbers that showed Trump winning a vast majority of Republicans in New Hampshire, while Haley's strength was with moderates and independents that won't be voting in other GOP primary states.
""When do you start winning Republicans?"" Hemmer asked.
""I will win Republicans,"" she said. ""But guess who else I win? I win moderates and I win independents, which he does not. That is why he lost in 2018. That's why he lost in 2020. That's why he lost in 2022, and that's why in every poll you see he loses to Joe Biden and I win.""
Haley has polled strongly against Biden in head-to-head hypotheticals, but Trump has finished ahead of Biden in surveys as well.

HIPVUDZ429_IME28HKQ3R4BDR4,"Suspect in robbery of NYC 'Bling Bishop' during livestreamed sermon shot, killed by US Marshals: reports",By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 2:22pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-robbery-nyc-bling-bishop-during-livestreamed-sermon-shot-killed-us-marshals-reports,"Whitehead reportedly believed was a threat to his family, released by police about two hours later.
The third suspect who remained at large in the 2022 armed robbery of embattled Brooklyn ""bling bishop"" Lamor Whitehead during a livestreamed New York City church service has reportedly been shot and killed by U.S. Marshals attempting to bring him into custody in New Jersey this week.
The New York City Police Department in June identified Shamar Leggette as the third suspect accused of holding Whitehead, his wife and their infant daughter at gunpoint during a livestreamed sermon at the ""Church"" in Brooklyn on July 24, 2022, before the trio of masked bandits made off with more than $1 million-worth of jewelry.
In September, the DOJ announced the arrests of the two other suspects, 23-year-olds Juwan Anderson and Say-Quan Pollack, both from Brooklyn, but Leggette still remained at large.
Leggette, 41, has since been shot and killed by U.S. Marshals attempting to bring him into custody in New Jersey, according to the New York Post, citing law enforcement sources.

Sources also told WNBC that Leggette was killed, adding that U.S. Marshals had come to arrest him at the MHO Inn and Suites on U.S.-1 in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey.
A woman who was with him surrendered to authorities, but Leggette then came outside during negotiations with federal agents and began opening fire toward deputy marshals. The marshals then returned fire, killing Leggette, according to the senior law enforcement sources who spoke with WNBC.
The New Jersey State Attorney General's Office is reportedly investigating the shooting.
The NJ OAG told Fox News Digital in an email on Thursday that their office was not yet identifying the people involved but provided a press release about a shooting at the same hotel.
""The Attorney General’s Office is investigating a fatal police-involved shooting that occurred on Wednesday, January 24, 2024, at a South Brunswick, New Jersey, motel. A man sustained fatal injuries after exchanging gunfire with officers. His identity is not being released at this time,"" the press release said.
According to the preliminary information, members of the U.S. Marshals Service NY/NJ Regional Task Force, assisting the New York office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, arrived at the motel on Route 1 South in Monmouth Junction at approximately 2:05 p.m. to execute an arrest warrant for a suspect in several felony offenses.
At approximately 2:47 p.m. on Wednesday, the individual to be arrested exchanged gunfire with officers, the attorney general's office said. The individual was pronounced deceased at approximately 4:29 p.m. Authorities recovered two firearms near the decedent. No officers were hit during the shooting.
Fox News Digital also reached out to the U.S. Marshal's Service for comment Thursday but did not immediately hear back.

Leggette is also listed third on New York’s ""most wanted"" list on unrelated attempted murder, robbery and criminal use of a firearm charges for allegedly robbing a woman from behind of a $7,000 bank deposit during her employment.
Whitehead is facing federal fraud, extortion and false statements charges himself, after the Justice Department alleged through an indictment in December 2022 that the ""bling bishop"" defrauded his parishioners out of tens of thousands of dollars of their retirement savings in an attempt to finance his own New Jersey mansion.
The bishop was also arrested in September 2022 for allegedly grabbing a woman during another livestreamed sermon.

Leggette reportedly served two previous stints in state prison and was out on parole at the time of the robbery on Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries in Canarsie, where the three armed suspects were caught on video making off with the bishop’s $75,000 Rolex watch, a $75,000 Cavalier watch, and a $25,000 ruby and diamond ring, among other valuables.
Donning a Gucci suit, Whitehead went on Instagram live Wednesday night to address reports of Leggette’s death, according to the Post.
Leggette ""was the guy that put the gun in my wife’s face and put the gun in my eight-month-old daughter’s face,"" according to Whitehead, ""So this is the guy that was at large and he came and put the gun to my head and ripped my clergy collar off and ripped my chains off and he was just brutal.""

The Chinese government accused the United States of causing ""trouble and provocation"" in a statement on Thursday after the U.S. Navy sailed a warship through the sensitive Taiwan Strait.
""U.S. warships and planes have caused trouble and provocation on China's doorstep, and carried out large-scale, high-frequency activities in waters and airspace around China,"" Chinese Defence Ministry spokesperson Colonel Wu Qian told reporters at a monthly briefing.
The comment came after USS John Finn sailed through a corridor in the Taiwan Strait for the first time since Taiwan hosted its presidential election. The U.S. Navy defended the action, saying the destroyer’s path was ""beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state.""
""John Finn's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle,"" U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement. ""No member of the international community should be intimidated or coerced into giving up their rights and freedoms. The United States military flies, sails and operates anywhere international law allows.""

The Defence Ministry spokesperson said China will ""continue to organize relevant military operations"" in and around the Taiwan Strait.
China officially claims Taiwan, which is democratically governed and operates autonomously, as within its sovereignty. The U.S. and most other countries recognize this so-called ""One China"" policy and formally agree Taiwan is a part of China.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn't get into discussing former President Donald Trump's ""cognitive disorders"" on Tuesday before briefly confusing President Biden with the former president.
MSNBC's Rachel Maddow asked Pelosi about Trump's attempt to attack the former speaker over the response to Jan. 6, but appeared to confuse Pelosi with GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley. ""We’ve heard what Nikki Haley thought about that, that confusion, that mistake by Donald Trump. But I don’t know what you thought about it, and I’m curious,"" Maddow said.
Pelosi said she wouldn't spend too much time on Trump's ""cognitive disorders"" before having a brief slip-up herself.
""Well, let me just say, I’m not going to spend too much time on Donald Trump’s cognitive disorders,"" she said. ""He tried to say that Nikki Haley did not allow the National Guard to come, but it was Nancy Pelosi. It was nobody. It was Joe — it was Donald Trump. He knows, and you know, that Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, and I begged for hours for the National Guard to come.""

TRUMP SAYS NIKKI HALEY ‘PROBABLY’ NOT HIS CHOICE FOR VICE PRESIDENT
""He knows that we don’t have the authority to bring the national guard, the president does. Sad to say to the District of Columbia, because every other state, the governor has that power. So, I’m more concerned about what he was trying to accuse her of, and again, his many misrepresentations. But don’t spend so much time on him. We don’t agonize about him,"" Pelosi said.
While speaking to a crowd in New Hampshire on Friday, Trump appeared to confuse Haley and Pelosi.
Trump said that Haley, his former ambassador to the United Nations, had been responsible for the collapse of Capitol Hill security during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Trump has previously blamed Pelosi for turning down National Guard support before the riot.
""You know, by the way, they never report the crowd on January 6, you know, Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they — did you know they destroyed all the information and all of the evidence. Everything. Deleted and destroyed all of it, all of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard. So whatever they want, they turned it down. They don't want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people,"" Trump said.

Pelosi also praised Biden and Vice President Harris' ticket and campaign team as they prepare for the election year.
""When he lies, I mean, he’s a constant liar. But when he lies, sometimes, you have to listen to him,"" she said, turning back to Trump. ""For example, he lied and said, 'ObamaCare sucks.' I mean, to use his kind of language, ‘ObamaCare sucks.’ Listen to when he says that. Of course, it doesn’t. The Afforable Care Act cures.""
The former House speaker said Trump didn't have ""best interests"" at heart.
""So, let’s get on with it. Let’s forget about him and his dysfunction, and understand that we have to get out our vote. We have to mobilize on the ground,"" she added.

Haley congratulated him on the win, but said that the race was ""far from over.""

""Kathryn and I are eternally grateful to the citizens of North Dakota for twice giving us this opportunity to serve the state we love so much.""
Speculation has swirled over Burgum's future after former President Trump praised his ex-rival last week, promising him an ""important"" role in a potential Republican administration.

During a Fox News town hall earlier this month, Trump first teased that he already knew who he would choose as his vice presidential running mate but would not announce the decision yet.

Before becoming governor, Burgum was primarily known as a businessman who led Great Plains Software, which Microsoft acquired for over $1 billion in 2001. Burgum stayed on as an executive with Microsoft until 2007. He has led other companies in real estate development and venture capital.

A murder conviction against the adopted daughter of former President George W. Bush’s Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte was tossed by an appeals court in Maryland on Tuesday because of material the jury in the trial should not have been exposed to, according to reports.
Washington, D.C. radio station WTOP reported that three judges from the Appellate Court of Maryland issued their opinion on the conviction of Sophia Negroponte, sending the case to a lower court because jury members heard portions of an interrogation video in which detectives questioned Negroponte’s credibility.
Jury members also heard testimony from an expert witness presented by the prosecution who questioned Negroponte’s credibility as well.

In January 2023, then 30-year-old Negroponte was convicted of second-degree murder in the 2020 death of 24-year-old Yousuf Rasmussen. She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
Negroponte and Rasmussen attended the same Washington high school and had been drinking with another person on the night of the February 2020 stabbing. They argued twice that night, prosecutors said.
At one point, when Rasmussen returned to the home to get his phone, Negroponte stabbed him multiple times, including one blow that severed his jugular, authorities said. Negroponte, then 27, was found inside the home covered in blood and lying on top of Rasmussen yelling, ""I'm sorry,"" according to charging documents previously obtained by Fox News Digital.

She allegedly confessed to the killing to investigators. Defense lawyers argued their client was so intoxicated at the time that she could not have formed specific intent.
Her attorney argued during the appeal that jury members should not have seen some statements made while being questioned by detectives, calling into question Negroponte’s accounting of the events.
The court agreed that detectives' comments that it was ""odd"" Negroponte could not remember portions of the evening, should have been excluded from the trial.

The court noted that detectives did not necessarily engage in improper questioning, but there was some questioning that the jury should not have been exposed to.
The appeals court also found problems with one of the prosecution's experts, a forensic psychiatrist, who claimed Negroponte's recollection of the events was unreliable.
The expert said during testimony that ""you have to take what she says with a grain of salt because she has an incentive to embellish or diminish the amount of alcohol she used because she's in that situation.""
The appeals court opined that testimony provided by the expert presented by the prosecution was inadmissible because Negroponte's credibility was at the ""core of this case.""

HY147KATPW_W7TZ8KF7VB3B0U2,Harvard's new antisemitism task force co-chair faces criticism over anti-Israel letter,By Kendall Tietz Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 11:22am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harvards-new-antisemitism-task-force-co-chair-faces-criticism-anti-israel-letter,"Harvard University graduate student Shabbos Kestenbaum joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why he filed suit against the school and what he hopes to gain from the legal proceedings.
The co-chair of the newly formed task force on antisemitism at Harvard University is facing backlash for signing a letter that was critical of Israel, describing the Jewish state as ""a regime of apartheid"" over its treatment of Palestinians.
Interim president Alan Garber announced two new ""presidential task forces"" on Friday that are aimed at combating antisemitism and Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias, and the choice for co-chair of the antisemitism task force, Derek J. Penslar, a professor of Jewish history at Harvard, has prompted widespread criticism.
Penslar, along with over 2,800 academics, clergy members and other public figures, signed an open letter written by the group Academics4Peace in August, before the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, that stated the Israeli government aimed to ""ethnically cleanse all territories under Israeli rule of their Palestinian population,"" stating ""Palestinians live under a regime of apartheid.""

Former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers and hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate, who have both been publicly critical of Harvard in recent months, expressed opposition to Penslar serving in the new role.
""@Harvard continues on the path to darkness,"" Ackman posted to X following the announcement of Penslar's promotion.
Summers said Sunday that he has ""lost confidence in the determination and ability of the Harvard Corporation and Harvard leadership to maintain Harvard as a place where Jews and Israelis can flourish.""
Given Penslar's record, Summers said ""he is unsuited to leading a task force whose function is to combat what is seen by many as a serious antisemitism problem at Harvard.""
In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Harvard spokesperson insisted, ""Professor Derek Penslar is a renowned scholar of modern Jewish and Israeli history who is highly regarded as a leading authority in his field. He is widely respected across the Harvard community as someone who approaches his research and teaching with open-mindedness and respect for conflicting points of view and approaching difficult issues with care and reason.""
The spokesperson added, ""He is deeply committed to tackling antisemitism and improving the experience of Jewish students at Harvard.""
In a separate statement, Penslar noted, ""I am honored to be part of the Harvard community and am dedicated to the education and well-being of our students. I see in the Task Force on antisemitism an important opportunity to determine the nature and extent of antisemitism and more subtle forms of social exclusion that affect Jewish students at Harvard. Only with this information in hand can Harvard implement effective policies that will improve Jewish student life on campus.""
Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt wrote on X that the move by Harvard was a lesson ""in how NOT to combat antisemitism.""
1619 PROJECT FOUNDER NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES CONDEMNS ATTACKS AGAINST HARVARD PRESIDENT: 'HOW RACISM WORKS'
Academics4Peace published another letter in December calling for an ""immediate and lasting ceasefire"" that included a hostage-prisoner exchange and urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, which Penslar did not sign.
Harvard organized the task force after it was harshly criticized for its response to antisemitism on campus following the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that left at least 1,200 Israelis dead.
Former university president Claudine Gay resigned earlier this month after she offered vague answers at a Congressional hearing on antisemitism where she was repeatedly asked about whether calls for genocide against Jewish people on campus qualifies as a violation of Harvard’s rules against bullying and harassment. She was later hit with multiple accusations of plagiarism throughout her academic career.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire veteran has admitted to faking his need for a wheelchair for 20 years to claim more than $660,000 in benefits he was not entitled to.
Christopher Stultz, 49, of Antrim, pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court on Thursday to one count of making false statements. He faces a maximum prison term of five years when he's sentenced May 6.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office said that beginning in 2003, Stultz claimed he could no longer use his feet, causing the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to rate him as 100% disabled and increase his monthly benefits. He was also given money to buy and adapt special cars.

Prosecutors said Stultz was ""surveilled on multiple occasions"" walking normally. In 2021, he used a wheelchair while inside a VA medical center in Boston, but after leaving, he stood up and lifted the wheelchair into his car, and then drove to a mall and walked around various stores, prosecutors said. They said he did a similar thing after leaving a Manchester VA medical center the following year.

Greg Abbott on the ongoing fight with the federal government and says Texas has the right to protect its border
House Speaker Mike Johnson says the Republican-controlled House ""will do everything in its power"" to support Texas over its ongoing feud with the Biden administration over border security -- after the Lone Star State said it has a ""right to self-defense.""
""I stand with Governor Abbott. The House will do everything in its power to back him up,"" he said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The next step: holding [DHS] Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas accountable.""
Abbott on Tuesday declared the state has a right to ""self-defense"" from a migrant ""invasion"" as it faces significant pushback over its border security policies from the Biden administration.
ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS ‘RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE’ FROM MIGRANT ‘INVASION’ AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN

The Supreme Court this week found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas along the border. Texas this week published images of it strengthening physical barriers along Eagle Pass in response.
There is a separate threat of a lawsuit related to the seizure of Shelby Park along Eagle Pass by Texas authorities. Meanwhile, the administration has sued over the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande River by Texas, and the recently signed law that allows Texas state and local officials to arrest illegal immigrants. The administration has accused Texas of interfering with federal control over immigration and border security, and has said it is putting agents and migrants in danger.
Abbott, however, cited constitutional language that demands the federal government ""protect each [State] against invasion"" and the right of states to protect their own borders.
Abbott argues that ""the failure of the Biden administration"" to fulfill those duties triggers a clause in Article 1 that ""reserves to this State the right of self-defense."" He notes he has already declared an ""invasion"" to invoke the authority, which he calls ""the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary.""
The administration has said that the federal government is in control of immigration enforcement and has defended its record -- pointing to removals since May that outpaced the entirety of FY 2019. Instead, it says it needs more funding from Congress and comprehensive immigration reform to fix what it says is a ""broken"" system.
TEXAS AG PAXTON PROMISES ‘FIGHT IS NOT OVER’ AFTER SCOTUS RULE ON BIDEN ADMIN'S RAZOR WIRE CUTTING
""Whether it is leaving migrants on the side of the road in the dead of winter, installing razor wire to make Border Patrol’s job more dangerous, promoting extreme and unconstitutional laws like S.B. 4, or his latest actions in Eagle Pass, Governor Abbott has repeatedly proven that he is not interested in solutions and only seeks to politicize the border,"" a recent White House statement said.
However, a number of governors have come to Texas’ side, with at least 14 Republican-led states, including Florida, Louisiana, Alabama and Tennessee expressing support for the governor’s position.
Some Democrats, however, have urged tougher action against Texas from the Biden administration.
""Greg Abbott has continued to use political stunts and inflammatory language to advance his own agenda, violating the Constitution and endangering both U.S. citizens and asylum seekers,"" Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, posted on X. ""Abbott is following the Donald Trump playbook: making immigration harder and more dangerous, so asylum seekers are pushed into the hands of cartels and the system remains broken.""
Casar continued with a string of posts, saying he agreed with Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who on Tuesday tweeted Biden should seize control of the Texas National Guard.

(Credit: U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Northwest)
Two children – ages 9 and 11 – escaped from a stolen car and flagged down a passerby who helped police capture the suspected car thief, police in Portland, Oregon, said.
Their dad left the car idling with his children inside during a quick stop to a Portland business on Monday, when a woman – later identified as Iosha Dashae Millage, 33 – jumped into the driver's seat and took off, according to police.
""The father attempted to stop the theft, but the woman accelerated away from the scene with the two children in the back of the vehicle,"" Portland police said in a statement. ""The father suffered minor injuries to his hand.""
About 10 minutes into the harrowing ride, the two children jumped out of the back seat while they were held up at a red light and grabbed someone's attention. Millage kept driving.

The good Samaritan called 911 and stayed with the kids until responding officers arrived, who made sure they did not suffer any injuries and reunited them with their dad.
That was shortly before 3 p.m. Monday.

Not long after the initial 911 call, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office spotted the stolen car on Interstate 5 in North Portland.
The alleged car thief ignored the lights and sirens and orders to pullover, which sparked a chase along the highway that led into Washington.

Several nearby law enforcement agencies joined the pursuit and pinned the suspected car thief less than 10 miles after crossing state lines near the Northeast 134th Street exit in Vancouver, Washington.
Millage was arrested and charged with attempt to elude, reckless driving, driving with a suspended or revoke license and fugitive from justice.
The fugitive from justice charge is the result of an arrest warrant being granted for second-degree kidnapping, first-degree robbery and attempt to elude in connection with the incident in the Portland area.

Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron is holding companies accountable for caving to what he sees as ""far-left ideology.""
Cameron has been appointed as the new CEO of the ""1792 Exchange,"" a nonprofit that seeks to ""preserve freedom"" by putting pressure on companies that prioritize political agendas over profit.
""I'm exceedingly excited to be the new CEO of 1792 Exchange, where we essentially want to make sure we get businesses back to the business of business. We want to make sure that the companies are, at the end of the day, producing a product. They're not pushing an agenda,"" he told Fox News Digital.
""We're committed to making sure that the values of the men, women and children all across this country are reflected in the businesses that we see across our nation,"" Cameron continued.

Dismantling ESG investments is at the forefront of the conservative group's mission. Environmental, Social and Corporate governance or ""ESG,"" are non-financial investment goals which Republican critics have called ""liberal activism masquerading as corporate responsibility.""
""Stifling investments in oil and gas,"" fighting climate change, promoting gun control and abortion access are some of the types of ESG goals corporations are guided to pursue, lawmakers say.
Cameron believes these corporate guidelines are anti-American and contrary to what most Americans want their money going toward.
""ESG at the end of the day is something that I think a lot of far left advocates have been pushing to change the fabric of this nation. And it really goes against what our founding was based upon. And it goes against what the working men and women of this country believe in,"" he remarked.

""Michael Jordan said famously in the 90s that Republicans buy shoes [too],"" Cameron continued. ""Organizations or businesses shouldn't give in to far-left ideology that places an agenda over products. At the end of the day, folks at home, they just want to make sure that their product works effectively, that it's of good quality. They don't want an agenda pushed on that as well. And so that's what 1792 is about, is about making sure that we get back to the basics at our businesses,"" he added.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ""DEI"" metrics also guide a majority of large companies. Airplane manufacturing company Boeing, which allegedly prioritized DEI hiring in recent years, found itself in the news recently after a door on one of the models operated by Alaska Airlines blew off mid-flight.
In an X post last week, billionaire Elon Musk asked if customers wanted to fly in an airplane made by a company that prioritizes DEI hiring over safety management.
Cameron said it was important to look at the data before dispensing judgment' in this case. However, he said DEI advocates have pushed many companies to ""sacrifice the idea of merit"" and instead judge people ""based on the color of their skin.""

Ron DeSantis suspending his bid for the nomination and why she would be poised to win in a head-to-head against President Biden.
Nikki Haley acknowledged in a new interview that she lacks a voter base but doesn't view it as a drawback as she tries to pull off an upset in the New Hampshire Republican primary.
As she barnstorms the Granite State in hopes of pulling off a surprise win over former President Trump on Tuesday, Haley was asked what her base looks like.
""I don’t have a base,"" Haley told The Free Press' Joe Nocera. ""I don’t just want a certain type of person. I want everybody. That’s the only way we’re going to heal our country."" She added, ""That’s my whole thing. I know they’re saying, you know, ‘She’s getting independents to vote for her.’ ""
""You have to want everybody,"" Haley went on. ""It doesn’t change who I am. It doesn’t change the solutions I think we need going forward. But it does mean that I’m going to treat everybody with respect. I’m going to let them know what I’m about, what I want to do, and how I want to do it. I’m not going to push people away. I’m going to bring people in. That’s what I did in South Carolina. You’re supposed to work on lifting up everybody, not just a select few.""
HALEY REVEALS PITCH TO DESANTIS VOTERS, PLEDGES SHE'LL 'ABSOLUTELY' MOVE ON TO SOUTH CAROLINA AFTER NH PRIMARY

Haley is now in a two-person race with Trump for the 2024 nomination after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out on Sunday. DeSantis swiftly endorsed Trump, and the former president has scored a slew of other high-profile Republican backers in recent days after his lopsided victory in the Iowa caucuses.
Haley seemed pleased to get the race to a one-on-one matchup with Trump after the large field finally whittled down to the pair over the past year.
""Can you hear that sound?"" she asked a large crowd in New Hampshire over the weekend after DeSantis quit, according to the New York Times. ""That’s the sound of a two-person race.""
Haley trails Trump in New Hampshire but has polled more strongly there than she ever did in Iowa – she finished third last week – and could do well with moderate and independent voters that wouldn't support Trump.
But the math looks more ominous going forward, even in her home state of South Carolina, where Trump holds a commanding polling advantage and recently won the endorsement of Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., whom Haley first appointed to the position in 2013.

The Trump campaign has stepped up attacks on Haley, who served in his administration as Ambassador to the United Nations, saying she's loved by Democrats, globalists and Wall Street, and also referred to her by her given first name, Nimarata.
Haley said Sunday Trump was in mental decline and has played up her age compared to the party frontrunners, Trump and President Biden, who are 77 and 81 respectively.
""Don't be surprised. If you have somebody that's 80 in office. Their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature,"" Haley said on CBS. ""If you look at Joe Biden, he's very different than he was two years ago. Are we really going to go into a situation where we have wars around the world, and we're trying to prevent war, and we're gonna have someone who we can or can't be sure is gonna get confused?""

The body of a man missing for weeks has been found stuffed inside the chimney of the Georgia house he was renting.
Bibb County sheriff's deputies tell local news outlets that the body of Anthony Rumplik, 43, who had been missing since late December was found Friday, wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in the chimney of a house in Macon.
Rumplik's roommate said he noticed a ladder leaning up against the house on Friday, climbed the ladder and saw a blanket in the chimney.
BODY FOUND IN RURAL GEORGIA DUMPSTER IDENTIFIED AFTER 35 YEARS
The condition of the body indicates Rumplik had been dead several weeks, Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones said.
Rumplik's roommate noticed a ladder against the house, climbed up, and saw the blanket in the chimney.
Rumplik's family from Ohio had recently visited Macon to search for him. His sister Marlo Rumplik said she last heard from Anthony Rumplik on Dec. 28. She said Rumplik ended up in Macon after his motorcycle broke down there on a trip to Florida last year.
Rumplik's Macon landlord had reported him missing after finding the door to his rental house open and concluding it was suspicious.

At the time of the search, Marlo Rumplik had criticized the sheriff's department for not doing enough to look for her brother, saying they regarded him as ""just another drug addict.""
Marlo Rumplik said her brother was schizophrenic and suffered from kidney failure. She said he had been homeless for a time in Macon and repeatedly hospitalized."

Gen. Keith Kellogg (ret.) joins ""Fox News Live"" and calls for the U.S. to take out Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp officials in response to the continuing missile attacks against U.S. troops.
JERUSALEM — The Biden administration is lost in the Middle East and in Central Asia because of its misguided policy toward its enemies, ranging from Iran’s regime to the Taliban to Hezbollah, according to experts contacted by Fox News Digital.
The Islamic Republic of Iran launched drone and missile attacks into Iraq, Syria and Pakistan in less than 24 hours starting on Tuesday. The regime’s open warfare follows its military aid to Hamas ahead of the organization’s massacre of 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel, including more than 30 Americans.
The heightened pro-war feeling was on display last Tuesday in the capital city of Tehran, where the clerical regime blanketed a building with a banner that warned its enemies in Hebrew and Farsi to ""Prepare your coffins."" Pro-Iran regime activists gathered in front of the banner to show fealty to the Islamic Republic.
OUTRAGE AS IRAN PRESIDENT PREPARES TO ADDRESS UN: 'WANTS TO KILL AMERICAN CITIZENS'

The Islamic Republic’s foreign policy has long been animated by the country’s late revolutionary anti-Western founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who famously declared, ""All of Islam is politics.""
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, has announced that ""Death to America will happen. In the new order I am talking about, America will no longer have any important role.""
The other pillar of Iran’s foreign policy is, according to Khamenei, ""Death to Israel.""
The rapid spread of Khomeini-style radical Islamism across the Middle East, including aiding the Lebanese-based terrorist movement Hezbollah, is just one window onto the courtyard of a deficient Biden foreign policy, according to experts.

Walid Phares, a Lebanese-American academic expert on the Mideast, told Fox News Digital ""The Biden administration resumed the Obama Mideast policies entirely, but with further recklessness, yielding a domino effects worldwide and particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. The removal of the Houthis from U.S. terror lists in February 2021 signaled that Washington was making concessions to Iran at the expense of the Arab coalition and to the advantage of Iran. In August, the apocalyptic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the transfer of power and weapons to the Taliban, broke the backbone of U.S. anti-Jihadist strategy. It also messaged the anti-American forces that the U.S. are hurdling towards a global retreat.""
A U.S. State Department spokesperson countered by telling Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Secretary Blinken and the Department have focused on promoting both stability and regional integration in the Middle East since the beginning of the administration and especially since the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out on October 7. The Secretary has made four trips to the region since October 7 – during which period, the United States has helped negotiate temporary humanitarian pauses in Gaza, secure the release of 110 hostages, and promote the delivery of critical humanitarian aid to Gaza.""

The spokesperson added, ""Our most critical and enduring interest in Afghanistan is to ensure that it never again becomes a safe haven for those who wish to harm the United States or our allies.""
""We closely watch the Taliban’s treatment of the people of Afghanistan. As we have said – in public and in private with Taliban representatives – their relationship with the international community depends entirely on their actions. Ultimately the United States wants to see Afghanistan at peace with itself and its neighbors, and able to stand on its own two feet,"" the State Department spokesperson stated.
According to Phares, who served as an adviser to President Trump, ""The Biden administration made dangerous choices regarding U.S. traditional friends and allies, especially by pressuring Israel to delay any action against Iran’s aggressive behavior in the region, and also pressures on Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, regarding their containment of the Houthis in Yemen, leading to a lionization of the Ansarallah, hence encouraging them to hold the maritime line in the Red Sea hostage.""

Ansarallah, which is generally known as the Houthis, was relisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. on Wednesday. Biden, to the wonderment of many counter-terrorism experts, delisted the Houthi movement as a terrorist entity at the start of his term in 2021. ""Allah is Greater. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse on the Jews. Victory to Islam"" is the slogan of the Houthis.
One foreign policy expert presented a more mixed analysis of Biden’s role on the international stage. Fox News Digital asked Michael E. O'Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in foreign policy at the Washington D.C.-based Brookings Institution, about the White House’s foreign policy strategy and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.
Sullivan penned an essay for Foreign Affairs just prior to Oct. 7 in which he boasted, ""The war in Yemen is in its 19th month of truce, for now the Iranian attacks against U.S. forces have stopped, our presence in Iraq is stable, I emphasize for now because all of that can change and the Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.""
O'Hanlon told Fox News Digital, ""The Afghanistan withdrawal was a mistake. Jake’s article was mistaken. But I see no other major evidence of a lack of vigilance or resolve.""

Jason Brodsky, the policy director of the U.S.-based United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), told Fox News Digital that he views the Biden administration's marriage to rekindling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal, as the first flawed departure point of the White House.
Biden wishes to inject more than $100 billion into Iran’s coffers as part of a revived JCPOA deal, according to one think tank estimate, in exchange for Tehran pledging to impose temporary restrictions on its nuclear weapons program.
""I think the Biden administration’s Iran policy has repeatedly failed. The effort to revive the JCPOA collapsed, and then its informal de-escalatory understandings with Tehran to keep the Iran file off the president’s desk before the 2024 presidential election collapsed. This is because the administration’s strategy is premised on faulty and outdated assumptions about the Islamic Republic. It also does not understand the Iranian leadership’s psychology. Ignoring Iran and avoiding Iran does not work,"" he said.

Brodsky added, ""The Biden administration’s public messaging has also been extremely weak. The constant pleas that the U.S. does not seek conflict with Iran makes an impression in Tehran: That the American government is more fearful of the Islamic Republic than the Islamic Republic is of the American government. That only emboldens the supreme leader to escalate. President Biden is seen as a predictable and non-threatening adversary for the supreme leader. That’s a dangerous perception. If the U.S. government wants to deter Iran, it can’t focus solely on its expendable proxies. It has to strike strategic targets that hold value for the Iranian leadership in order to restore deterrence and deescalate.""
Phares concurred with Brodsky about the principal role that Iran’s regime plays in fomenting regional volatility.
""The Iran regime is the central source of terror and destabilization in the region, followed by the metastasizing Islamist forces that are now taking advantage of the militant organized migrations in the Mediterranean and across the Rio Grande, both facilitated by radical lobbies, constitute today the global threat against Western democracies, in addition to the Ukraine War and Western divisions,"" said Phares.
Iran’s rapidly advancing program to weaponize a nuclear warhead remains foremost in the thinking of countries affected by Tehran’s desire to obliterate them.

American physicist and nuclear weapons expert David Albright warned on Jan. 8 that ""Given short warning times and few prospects of a nuclear deal, the United States and its allies have little choice other than focusing on a strategy to deter Iran from deciding to build nuclear weapons in the first place.""

Albright's report recommended that ""Iran needs to be made fully aware via concrete demonstrations that building nuclear weapons will trigger quick, drastic actions by the international community, including military strikes. U.S. military cooperation with Israel aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear capabilities should be bolstered, ensuring Israel can decisively strike Iran’s nuclear sites on short notice if there are signs that Iran is moving to build nuclear weapons, including the ability of delivering a second strike if Iran reconstitutes those activities.""

When asked about the Iranian threat, a State Department spokesperson referred Fox News Digital to a comment made by spokesperson Matt Miller on Nov. 14: ""When it comes to holding Iran accountable for its destabilizing activities, I would remind you that we have imposed more than 400 sanctions on Iran since the outset of this administration. In the past few weeks, we have taken a number of actions to ensure deterrence and … the Pentagon has conducted strikes against Iranian-backed militias. And we will continue to hold … Iran accountable for its destabilizing behavior in a number of manners.""

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tells 'Hannity' the Supreme Court ruling is a setback for border security.
Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Monday the GOP primary is essentially over, whether former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wins New Hampshire or not.
Cruz, who lasted the third-longest in the 2016 GOP presidential sweeps, said he recently endorsed Donald Trump because the Iowa caucuses results were ""overwhelming"" and he is the Republican candidate with the most united groundswell of support.
On ""Hannity,"" host Sean Hannity noted Cruz's experience in 2016 – when he dropped out just prior to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, essentially giving Trump the nomination. Cruz suggested the former president has the same type of unwavering base he did back then.
""I think this race is over,"" he said. ""He won 98 out of 99 [Iowa] counties. That is overwhelming. That is a powerful outcome.""

New Hampshire is a rare state where independents are permitted to vote in partisan primaries, which Trump claimed to a crowd Monday in Laconia, N.H., was the fault of Gov. Chris Sununu, who he called a ""weak governor.""
Sununu notably endorsed Haley, and took a verbal swipe at Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., for spurning his fellow South Carolinian.
""Look, Haley is close to Trump in New Hampshire. It's possible that Haley will be close,"" Cruz said.
TED CRUZ ENDORSES TRUMP, CALLS FOR UNIFIED FRONT AGAINST BIDEN'S ‘CULTURAL MARXIST’ AGENDA
""It's even possible that she wins in New Hampshire, particularly because New Hampshire allows independents to vote in the primary.""
He noted how about a third of the electorate in the Granite State are independents who can pick their primary.
President Biden is not on the ballot in New Hampshire after the DNC mooted the day's results after officials refused to yield to the national party's shift of South Carolina's primary to first in the nation status.
Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and author Marianne Williamson remain on the ballot, while Biden supporters have organized a write-in campaign.

Cruz characterized the message from independents hoping to vote for Haley as ""we don't like Nikki Haley, but we hate Donald Trump.""
""Whether she [wins] or not, frankly, doesn't matter, because after that it goes to South Carolina. I think Nikki Haley will stick around 'til South Carolina, and she is going to lose her home state by double digits,"" he said. ""And after that is Super Tuesday, where she's down by huge margins everywhere.""
Instead, Cruz said, the party should unify behind Trump and take on Biden and his ""trainwreck"" of an administration.

IC2DL55BXT_8HJ1ZCSWG5NT5T7,Dozens of Senate Republicans warn Biden's latest war on energy empowers America's enemies,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 9:58am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dozens-senate-republicans-warn-bidens-latest-war-energy-empowers-americas-enemies,"Price Futures Group senior analyst Phil Flynn and Copenhagen Consensus Center President Bjorn Lomborg on the concerns with bans on natural gas for costs and reliability.
FIRST ON FOX: A group of two dozen Senate Republicans are taking aim at President Biden after the White House announced it paused several proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects over climate concerns.
The lawmakers, led by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said the administration's actions — unveiled Friday in a joint announcement by White House and Department of Energy (DOE) officials — will empower Russia and Iran while harming U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. Advocates of LNG exports say the projects are vital to help American allies meet energy demand as nations look to wean off Russian natural gas supplies.
""American LNG exports have enhanced our geopolitical influence and international energy security across the board since 2016,"" the Republicans wrote in a letter to President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. ""In addition to Europe, U.S. LNG has a significant impact on energy security in Asia. Japan and South Korea have been the top two destinations for importing U.S. LNG. Taiwan also imports U.S. LNG, and India is rapidly increasing its imports as well.""
""Limiting U.S. LNG exports does not have any impact on the world’s demand for natural gas,"" the letter continued. ""Instead, countries including Russia and Iran will simply produce more energy that is subject to less stringent environmental regulations. As a result, limiting American LNG exports in the name of stopping climate change could do just the opposite and add to global emissions.""
BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS

On Friday morning, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The move represents a major victory for climate activists who have loudly called for such a move in recent weeks, even threatening to hold civil disobedience protests in Washington, D.C., over the issue.
In a statement Friday, the president said the pause on LNG permitting was a part of his sweeping climate agenda, saying the action ""sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time."" He also took aim at ""MAGA Republicans"" for willfully denying the ""urgency of the climate crisis.""
ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST
While it is unclear which proposed projects the action will affect, a senior administration official said at least two have a larger capacity and two have a smaller capacity. Another official added that the pause implemented Friday will only impact projects that have gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) lengthy approval process and are ripe for DOE approval.
According to federal data updated this week, there are 11 projects that have been green-lit by FERC but are not yet under construction. An additional four projects are pending before FERC and two are in the pre-filing stage. Those six projects wouldn't be impacted by the pause since they are not before DOE yet, but they would be impacted if approved by FERC.

""We strongly urge you to stop this shortsighted effort,"" Cassidy and the other Republicans concluded in their letter Friday. ""As the President of the United States and as the Secretary of Energy, you should be championing – not undermining – American LNG exports and the environmental, economic, and national security benefits to the United States and our allies.""
In addition to Republicans and U.S. fossil fuel industry associations, international energy interests such as Eurogas, the Asia Natural Gas & Energy Association and German state-owned energy company Securing Energy for Europe have argued American natural gas is vital for energy security abroad.
BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION
In the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Biden traveled to Europe and struck a deal with the European Union, vowing to send more U.S. LNG to the bloc. At the time, the White House pledged to ""maintain its regulatory environment,"" a statement that appears to have been contravened with Friday's actions.

But LNG export terminals have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who argue they would create harmful pollution and contribute to global warming. The issue has led to activists posting videos on social media which, over the last two months, have generated tens of millions of views.

""President Biden and Secretary Granholm’s bold step today continues this administration’s historic efforts to meet the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and confront the climate crisis head on,"" Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous said Friday.
""This decision is a major win for communities and advocates that have long spoken out about the dangers of LNG, and makes it clear that the Biden administration is listening to the calls to break America’s reliance on dirty fossil fuels and secure a livable future for us all.""

A California woman who fell into a pot-fueled psychosis after getting high on drugs and stabbed her boyfriend 108 times before slicing her own neck as police tried to stop her will not serve any prison time, a judge has ruled.
Jurors found Bryn Spejcher, a 32-year-old from Ventura County, guilty in December of involuntary manslaughter after she stabbed her boyfriend Chad O'Melia 108 times while high on cannabis.
The stabbing took place overnight between May 27 and 28 in 2018, at O'Melia's apartment in Thousand Oaks, according to prosecutors.

""Both took several hits from a bong loaded with marijuana,"" the Ventura County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. ""Spejcher had an adverse reaction to the marijuana and suffered from what experts call ‘cannabis-induced psychotic disorder.’""
The state's mental health expert reportedly determined that as a result she was ""unconscious"" while she stabbed O'Melia dozens of times. She also stabbed her dog and turned the knife on herself when police arrived.

""In the early morning hours of May 28, 2018, law enforcement arrived at the apartment to find Mr. O’Melia in a pool of blood and Spejcher screaming hysterically with a knife still in her hands,"" according to District Attorney Erik Nasarenko's office.
""Before law enforcement could disarm her, Spejcher plunged the knife into her own neck,"" prosecutors said in a statement after her conviction. ""Officers used a taser and several baton blows before they were able to finally disarm Spejcher.""

The Thousand Oaks Acorn, a local newspaper, reported in the fall that initial murder charges against Spejcher were downgraded to involuntary manslaughter over protests from O'Melia's family due to the presence of ""cannabis-induced psychotic disorder.""
Court records show the change came days before the start of her trial.

""The case should be tried for what it is, murder,"" the victim's father, Sean O'Melia, reportedly wrote in a letter to county leaders. ""It’s not some accident.""
The reduced charges also prompted protests outside the courthouse, where demonstrators carried signs supporting O'Melia's family and demanding a serious punishment from Judge David Worley during Tuesday's hearing.
The court ultimately handed down a sentence of two years on probation and 100 hours of community service.

NEW YORK CITY – Three of the four defendants charged in connection with the fatal overdose death of 1-year-old Nicholas Dominici at his Bronx, New York, day care last fall appeared in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday for a pre-trial hearing.
Renny Antonio Parra Paredes slouched in his chair, wearing a tan prison uniform with his hands cuffed and ankles shackled, as his attorney argued for a bail application. The attorney, John Francis Kaley, said his client was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.
Eight of Parra Paredes' family members stood up, willing to sign a bond of any amount if he was released. Kaley also proposed home confinement, electronic monitoring, and Parra Paredes' release to his mother, which Judge Jed Rakoff joked would be ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

COLORADO FATHER CONVICTED OF CHILD ABUSE AFTER HIS TODDLER INGESTS FENTANYL AND DIES
The government argued that Parra Paredes represented a danger to the community because he was mixing and packaging drugs for at least six months before he was arrested. They said he even made himself sick from the drugs on numerous occasions. They also said the tragedy at the day care would not have stopped him.
The government said Parra Paredes, the father of children in the Dominican Republic, was a flight risk, and that the only reason he didn’t initially flee was because he was unaware officials were looking for him.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Denver police officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to wounding six bystanders in a crowd while firing at an armed man as bars let out, a shooting that still haunts the victims.
Brandon Ramos, 30, did not speak in court except to acknowledge that he understood his rights in pleading guilty to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, in the 2022 shooting. The conviction makes him ineligible to serve as a police officer, prosecutors said, but the Denver Police Department said Ramos remains on unpaid administrative leave as it conducts a review of the shooting.
Ramos was sentenced to 18 months of probation but can ask to have that shortened under the terms of a plea deal reached with prosecutors.
NYC POLICE SERGEANT CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER AFTER HURLING COOLER AT FLEEING MOTORCYCLIST
Ramos was working in a gun violence prevention team in Denver's Lower Downtown neighborhood, near an MLB stadium, bars and restaurants, when he and two other officers, who were not charged, shot at Jordan Waddy after he pulled a gun from his pocket.
The other officers were standing in front of Waddy when he pulled out the gun and there was only a brick wall and a bar behind him. The grand jury found the other officers feared for their lives and were legally justified in shooting at Waddy. But it found that Ramos, who shot Waddy from the side, was not in danger because Waddy did not turn and face him and Ramos disregarded the risk of shooting Waddy posed to the crowd of people behind Waddy.
Angelica Rey, a teacher who was celebrating a work promotion, was shot in the leg and could not stand as she watched her blood flow into the street. Because of her injuries she lost her job but later was hired back to work fewer hours, she said in a statement read in court by Zach McCabe of the district attorney's office.

Bailey Alexander suffered her own trauma from being shot, seeing her boyfriend covered in her blood. But Alexander, who avoids going out downtown, also told Bland about the agony of her mother getting a call in the middle of the night that her daughter had been shot and rushing to get to the hospital in Denver from a town three hours away.
Yekalo Weldehiwet, whose fiance was right in front of him when he was shot, said their separate traumas from the shooting made it hard for them to connect.
""The world doesn't feel as familiar or safe as it used to be,"" he told Bland.
After the hearing, Willis Small IV, who was struck in the foot by a bullet that he said hit two other people first, said he was not completely satisfied with Ramos' sentence but glad that he was being held accountable for what happened.
Judge Nikea Bland acknowledged both the ways the shooting had changed the lives of the victims forever and also the impact that not being able to work as a police officer again will have on Ramos, wishing him well in his ""new path.""
After Ramos was indicted, the city's then-mayor, Michael Hancock, questioned the grand jury's decision to charge him. The police union said it would do everything it could to defend Ramos and said the whole situation could have been avoided if Waddy had stopped and shown empty hands to the officers.
In a statement, District Attorney Beth McCann also put blame on Waddy, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit possession of a weapon by a previous offender. He has not yet been sentenced.
""Of course, none of this would have happened had Jordan Waddy not been carrying an illegal weapon and, for that reason, I am pleased that Mr. Waddy has pleaded guilty to a felony charge and will be held accountable for his role in the events of that night,"" she said.
Ramos' attorney, Lara Marks Baker, said Ramos came from a family committed to public service and that he had wanted to be a police officer since he was a child. He was motivated by wanting to keep people safe and had to make a split-second decision about what to do with Waddy, she said.

President Biden easily won the New Hampshire Democratic primary, carrying the traditional first-in-the-nation primary by 39 points over Rep. Dean Phillips. Biden’s comfortable win was more notable because his name did not actually appear on the primary ballot, forcing his supporters to write him in as their preference.
The election was technically an ""unsanctioned"" primary, as it was held despite the Democratic National Committee’s insistence that South Carolina hold the first Democratic primary this year.
New Hampshire Democrats went ahead anyway, following a state law requiring the nominating contest be the first in a given calendar year. As a result, the DNC announced no delegates would be awarded based on the New Hampshire results.
Biden’s team announced in late October he would not participate, meaning he would not be on the ballot and instead be a ""write-in"" candidate only. Phillips campaigned heavily in the Granite State but was unable to make significant inroads.

The results of the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of more than 900 New Hampshire Democratic primary voters, show the contours of a resounding win for the incumbent. At the same time, the data suggest some areas of division within Biden’s coalition.
Biden won every major demographic group by double digits. He was particularly strong among voters over age 65, those with college degrees and women. The race was somewhat closer among men.
Biden won voters over age 45 by 52 points but was noticeably weaker among younger voters.
The president had strong support from across the center and left of the political spectrum, getting a similar share of the vote from political moderates (62%), those who described themselves as ""somewhat liberal"" (64%) and ""very liberal"" voters (58%).
Three quarters of primary voters approved of the job Biden is doing as president.
CLICK HERE FOR RESULTS FROM THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
His job ratings on the economy (80% approve, 19% disapprove) and student debt (73% approve, 25% disapprove) were particularly positive. Primary voters gave him much less glowing reviews on immigration and his handling of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Despite their frustrations on these two issues, more than half (55%) said they would be satisfied with Biden as the eventual Democratic nominee – just 13% would be dissatisfied enough that they would not support him in November.
By contrast, 53% of Republican primary voters would be satisfied with Donald Trump as their nominee, with 35% dissatisfied enough not to vote for him. Fewer Republicans (39%) would be satisfied with Nikki Haley, with 32% unhappy enough not to back her in the fall.
Even if they would be satisfied with Biden as the nominee, Democratic primary voters had clear concerns about his age.
Nearly half felt he is too old to serve another term as president, including more than a quarter (27%) of his supporters in the primary.
Almost all (83%) of those who thought he is not too old backed the president, while Phillips held a small advantage (+3 points) among those who felt Biden is too old for another term.

One thing primary voters could agree on: abortion. Almost all (94%) felt abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
Nearly 6 in 10 said it was important the New Hampshire primary be the first in the nation, but the dispute with the DNC did not sink Biden, as he won by wide margins among those who felt it was important to be first (+28 points) and those who disagreed (+53 points).

Britain should train and equip its citizens to be ready to fight a war with Russia, the head of the army said, as Sweden has warned its citizens to brace for possible conflict with Moscow.
Gen. Sir Patrick Sanders, the outgoing Chief of the General Staff, warned that an increase in reserve forces alone ""would not be enough"" to fight a land war with Russia, the BBC reported. He said increasing the number of soldiers for a potential conflict would need to be a ""whole-of-nation undertaking.""
Sanders spoke of the need for the United Kingdom to maintain its military and cited the threat faced by other nations closer to Russia as Moscow continues its war with Ukraine.

""Our friends in eastern and northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilization,"" he said during a speech at the International Armoured Vehicles conference in London. ""As the chairman of the NATO military committee warned just last week, and as the Swedish government has done...taking preparatory steps to enable placing our societies on a war footing when needed are now not merely desirable but essential.""
The British army should expand its size to 120,000 within three years from the current 74,000, he said. However, that isn't enough, Sanders said, adding that Britain must train and equip a ""citizen army.""
""We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare - and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking,"" he said. ""Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.
""But we've been here before, and workforce alone does not create capability,"" he added.

The threat of Russia has NATO countries bracing for possible conflict as the war in Ukraine escalates. As Sweden nears NATO membership, supplies are flying off the shelves as some of its citizens remain concerned over how Russia will respond.
""For a nation for whom peace has been a pleasant companion for almost 210 years, the idea that it is an immoveable constant is conveniently close at hand,"" Swedish Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said at Folk och Försvars, or ""Society and Defense,"" annual national conference in Sälen on Sunday.
""But taking comfort in this conclusion has become more dangerous than it has been for a very long time,"" he said, according to a government transcript. ""Many have said it before me, but let me do so in an official capacity, more plainly and with naked clarity: There could be war in Sweden.""

Officials announced Monday that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded nearly $1.06 billion in federal funding to replace the aging John A. Blatnik Bridge between Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin.
""This is big news for Minnesota. This investment will make it possible for Minnesota and Wisconsin to rebuild a critical connection between our states that will foster regional economic growth, strengthen our national supply chains, and improve the safety and reliability of our transportation network,"" Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. ""This is a project that will serve hundreds of communities between our states.""
Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said in the statement released by Walz's office that this is ""a transformational opportunity"" for both states in bringing a key piece of infrastructure into the 21st century.
NEW BRIDGE CONNECTING DETROIT TO CANADA DELAYED UNTIL FALL 2025
""A new Blatnik Bridge means safer vehicle travel and better support for the billions of dollars in freight moving across the bridge each year,"" Evers said.
The bridge is an important freight and commercial connection between the Duluth-Superior Twin Ports and serves more than 33,000 vehicles per day, according to the statement. It is jointly owned and managed by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.
For more than 60 years, the bridge has linked Duluth and Superior via Interstate 535 and US 53.

It is also one of the largest marine links for U.S. trade with Canada — the top trade partner of Wisconsin, Minnesota and the United States — the statement said. The bridge replacement project will improve safety and accommodate oversize and overweight loads.
The total cost for rebuilding the bridge is estimated to be $1.8 billion, according to the statement. Each state committed $400 million toward the project last year. Design work for the project, which will determine specifications and the shape the final project, is expected to begin this year. Once a final design is selected, construction could begin as early as next year."

The tunnel, beneath the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, had extensive facilities, including bathrooms. Israel says it destroyed the tunnel after completing its investigation.
""The tunnel was located in the heart of a civilian area in Khan Yunis, and the entrance to it was located in the residence of a Hamas terrorist. According to intelligence estimates, millions of shekels were invested in the construction of the tunnel,"" the IDF said.
Shekels are worth just over one fourth of a U.S. dollar.

""As part of the examination of the tunnel, a central chamber where hostages were held and five barred prison cells were discovered. In addition, the soldiers located findings that indicated that hostages had been held there, intelligence and weapons belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization,"" the IDF added.

Opponents of former President Trump have failed in their attempt to keep the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination off the primary ballot in Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission on Monday dismissed the challenge against Trump, stating that its panel found that it did not have jurisdiction over the matter, Boston 25 News reported.
Republican Party of Massachusetts Chair Amy Carnevale praised the dismissal of what she called an ""ill-conceived effort"" to weaken American democracy.
""I applaud this decision to allow actual voters to choose their nominee,"" Carnevale posted on X. ""(Imagine that!) The ill-conceived effort by career plaintiff lawyers would have undercut our system of democracy. The decision of who MA should choose as the nominee will now rely squarely w/ voters.""

Massachusetts is one of more than a dozen other states to have challenged Trump's eligibility to appear on election ballots for the primary or general elections after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.
The challenges rely on the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits anyone from holding office who previously has taken an oath to defend the Constitution and then later ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against the country or given ""aid or comfort"" to its enemies.
In December, the Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Trump from appearing on the state's ballots in 2024.
MAINE OFFICIAL APPEALS HER REMOVAL OF TRUMP FROM VOTING BALLOTS TO STATE'S TOP COURT
Trump appealed the ruling, and now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide on the matter.
The former president also appealed a ruling by Maine’s secretary of state barring him from the state’s primary ballot.

Maine’s Supreme Judicial Court said it will not consider the matter until the high court issues its own decision in the related case out of Colorado.

Prince William is putting his family first during an ""extraordinary"" time within the British royal family.
Kensington Palace recently announced that Princess Kate (Middleton), who turned 42 this month, underwent ""planned abdominal surgery"" at The London Clinic. The Princess of Wales is postponing all public duties until after Easter.Moments after the announcement, Buckingham Palace revealed that King Charles III was seeking treatment for an enlarged prostate. They noted that the 75-year-old’s public engagements ""will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.""
PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE MAKE RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE 1 WEEK AFTER ROYAL FAMILY STRICKEN WITH MEDICAL ISSUES

Daily Mail reporter Robert Hardman told Fox News Digital that William, 41, is prioritizing his wife’s health, supporting her as he raises their three young children: Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5. According to reports, the heir to the British throne has cleared his calendar to be by his wife’s side.

""I think from the start, he’s been protective of her,"" Hardman said. ""It’s the same way that [his younger brother] Prince Harry is so protective of Meghan Markle. Both of them have this sense that they have brought upon their wives a degree of attention and stress and all sorts of issues.""Hardman has written a new book, ""The Making of a King: King Charles III and the Modern Monarchy,"" which explores the king’s reign and the pivotal events that led to his coronation in May. He also detailed how the king’s eldest son is preparing for his future role with the Princess of Wales by his side.

""[William] feels a sense of responsibility [to protect Kate],"" he said. ""And right from the start, William has been absolutely adamant about family security, family privacy. It informs [everything he does]. It’s why they choose particular schools for their children. … They are very concerned that their children have as normal and as a private life as any other child. That’s the overarching thing.""
""I say this in my book, William regards raising the next monarch as one of his most important jobs,"" said Hardman. ""People keep saying, ‘What sort of king will William be one day?’ Well, what’s going through William’s [mind] is what sort of king is George going to be?""
Hardman said palace insiders told him that William is determined to give his eldest son a normal upbringing behind palace doors but also wants him to embrace his future role as king.

""He’s thinking, ‘It’s … down to me,’"" said Hardman. ""’I don’t want to scare him off. I want to make him feel that this is a privilege and an honor and something you can enjoy, not a burden you run away from.’""
While duty comes first for the couple, the Prince and Princess of Wales are more concerned about being doting parents to their children.
""They’re a really strong couple,"" Hardman said. ""They’re absolutely central to the entire royal [family]. When you look at the working royal family now, it’s pretty small. People talk about a slimmed-down monarchy. It is pretty slim. It can’t get much slimmer. And it’s quite old. The two young stars – and we say young stars – I mean, William is in his 40s now, but he’s still the young face of the monarchy. We’re not going to see their kids coming into mainstream public duties for at least another 10 years.""

""William loves the regular kind of family life,"" Hardman continued. ""That’s another thing I discovered. Yes, of course, he’s heir to the throne. He’s got access to all these castles, art and everything. But in a way, he’s happiest at home with his wife and kids doing the same thing other families do – kicking a ball around, going bike riding, swimming, these things. He’s a hands-on dad, and [Kate’s] a hands-on mom.""
""I think they’re a great team,"" Hardman added.
As Middleton continues to recover, William will manage the children alongside their longtime nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, People magazine reported. According to the outlet, William will continue to do school pickups and drop-offs. A close family friend told the outlet that the couple doesn’t have ""a huge private staff"" and William is ""really hands-on.""

""He doesn’t want any mistakes made with the next generation,"" said the pal. ""He wants to give [his children] a proper upbringing and lots of love. That is foremost in his mind.""
With family on his mind, there’s no time to dwell on royal rifts, Hardman said. It’s believed that William still has an estranged relationship with his younger brother, Prince Harry.
In 2020, Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back as senior royals and moved to California. At the time, they alleged palace officials were insensitive to Markle’s mental health struggles as she attempted to navigate royal life. The couple also said the duchess faced racist attitudes from the U.K. press, which contributed to their decision to leave the country.

Following their departure, the couple aired their complaints about life as royals. In 2021, they sat down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview that was viewed by 50 million people globally. After releasing a six-part docuseries on Netflix in 2022, Harry’s memoir, ""Spare,"" hit bookshelves in 2023, quickly becoming a bestseller.
""[William] was very sad that it came to this,"" Hardman said. ""He adored his brother. I’m sure those bonds are thicker than water. But … you talk to those around him, and he’s just very sad about the whole thing. But rather like his father, he knows there’s no point in getting worked up about something you’ve got no control over.""
""Harry and Meghan … decided they were going to leave the country, they were going to pursue this new life,"" Hardman said. ""Really, there was nothing he could do about it. So, he just accepts it and gets on with it.""

In ""Spare,"" Harry alleged that in 2019 William attacked him during a ferocious argument about the Duchess of Sussex at Kensington Palace. The palace didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.
""It was very hurtful for William, who’s intensely private,"" said Hardman. ""[But] what really hurt William is the fact that Harry … could be regaling the entire world with stories of two little boys and childhood moments that were so precious to William. Those two went through an extraordinary, difficult and tragic childhood. And it’s the fact that Harry was prepared to put this out there in the public domain. I think that’s the real source of silence.""
According to reports, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex sent get-well wishes to both the king and Princess of Wales following their health challenges. A spokesperson for the couple didn’t immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

IO4TRY6S65_VHGZTVBWUZ2ZK73,120 Republicans join effort opposing Biden's 'de facto EV mandate',By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 4:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/120-republicans-join-effort-opposing-bidens-de-facto-ev-mandate,"Hertz unloads one-third of its EV fleet.
FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of 77 House and 43 Senate Republicans is calling on the Biden administration to scrap proposed fuel economy regulations that they and energy industry groups have characterized as a de facto electric vehicle (EV) mandate.
The 120 GOP lawmakers — led by Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich. — penned a letter late Tuesday to the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), warning that its corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards proposed in July would raise costs, restrict consumer choice, harm businesses and degrade both U.S. energy and national security.
""We strongly urge NHTSA to withdraw its misguided proposal, go back to the drawing board and reissue new CAFE standards that comply with the law, rather than ones that seek to pick winners and losers in the free market and remake our country’s economy,"" they wrote to NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman.
""Nowhere in law did Congress authorize NHTSA to set fuel economy standards that effectively mandate EVs while at the same time force the internal combustion engine out of the market,"" the letter continued. ""In fact, federal statute expressly prohibits NHTSA from considering the fuel economy of EVs when determining maximum feasible CAFE standards for passenger cars and trucks.""
17 RETIRED MILITARY OFFICIALS RAISE ALARM ON BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH

The letter added that, despite a clear statutory limitation prohibiting NHTSA from factoring the fuel economy of EVs into its CAFE standard regulations, the Biden administration accounted for EVs in its ""regulatory baseline"" and factored that baseline into its determination of the maximum achievable CAFE standards. The proposal, therefore, effectively requires the mass production of EVs, they said.
The Republicans argued the NHTSA should set market-driven standards that promote competition among various technologies, not standards that ""limit availability of and access to vehicle and fuel options."" They also noted that EV production has a sizable carbon footprint, a fact not factored into the administration's rulemaking.
MORE THAN 3,000 AUTO DEALERS SIGN LETTER OPPOSING BIDEN'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE
""NHTSA’s out-of-touch de facto EV mandate ignores the reality that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and the fact there is a lack of consumer demand for EVs,"" the Republicans' letter added.
""The low consumer demand for EVs can likely be attributed to the various unappealing aspects of these vehicles, including the typically higher sticker prices and insurance premiums, shorter average driving ranges, lower resale value, inadequate battery technologies for severe cold weather and lack of operational charging infrastructure, particularly for drivers in rural areas,"" they wrote. ""EVs are not a practical option for most Americans.""
President Biden previously set a goal of ensuring 50% of car purchases in the U.S. are electric by 2030. Roughly 8% of new car purchases in the nation are EVs, but those sales are dominated by individuals with an annual income of more than $100,000 and who own more than one car. (Getty Images)
NHTSA's proposed CAFE standards, which the Biden administration argued would help combat climate change and save Americans money, require passenger cars and light trucks to improve fuel efficiency by 2% and 4%, respectively, beginning in 2027. Under the rules, pickup trucks and work vans must boost fuel efficiency 10% every year starting in 2030.
By 2032, the agency said, average U.S. fleet fuel economy could reach 58 miles per gallon. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the estimated average fuel economy for model year 2022 cars was 26.4 miles per gallon, meaning the proposed standards would mandate automakers to more than double fuel efficiency in less than a decade or face substantial penalties.
VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'
In a comment letter submitted to NHTSA late last year, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents several major automakers, said companies will pay more than $14 billion in non-compliance penalties under the proposal, impacting one in every two light trucks in 2027-2032 and one in every three passenger cars in 2027-2029.
Overall, car prices are expected to increase by thousands of dollars as a result, simultaneously driving up the average age of vehicles on our roads and forcing consumers to choose EVs.

Additionally, the Republicans warned the NHTSA's proposal would benefit China while harming U.S. national security interests, noting that Chinese industry largely dominates EV supply chains. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), for example, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries, a key component of EVs, worldwide.
China also boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key parts of EV batteries. And more than 50% of lithium, cobalt and graphite processing and refining capacity — which is vital for EV batteries — is located in China, the IEA data showed.
HOUSE JOINS SENATE, STRIKES DOWN BIDEN EV CHARGER RULE PROTECTING CHINESE COMPANIES
""NHTSA’s proposed CAFE standards are just the latest attempt by the Biden administration to implement a de facto EV mandate,"" Walberg told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""These standards will limit consumer choice, increase costs and make us reliant on adversaries like China.
""Instead of again pursuing unaffordable central planning, the Biden administration should let innovation and consumers lead us into the future,"" the Michigan Republican continued. ""Whatever that future looks like, it should not be mandated by bureaucrats in Washington.""
Walberg and fellow Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., introduced the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales (CARS) Act last year, which would block regulations proposed in April by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) significantly increasing tailpipe emissions standards for gas-powered cars. The House passed that legislation in December, but a companion bill introduced by Crapo has yet to receive a floor vote.

Republicans and energy industry groups have argued that, together, the EPA proposal and the NHTSA regulations targeted in the lawmakers' letter Tuesday are designed to push EVs on Americans. An estimated 8% of total vehicle sales were EVs in the third quarter of 2023, according to a Cox Automotive analysis.
""NHTSA’s proposal, combined with EPA’s proposed tailpipe emissions standards, would result in a de facto ban on the sale of new vehicles using gasoline and other liquid fuels,"" said American Petroleum Institute Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer Amanda Eversole.
""These rules will hurt consumers through potentially higher costs, fewer options and increased reliance on unstable foreign supply chains,"" Eversole added. ""We welcome the efforts of senators Crapo and Cruz, along with those of Representative Walberg, to protect American consumers’ access to all affordable and reliable vehicle options.""
MAINE FORCED TO DELAY VOTE ON EV MANDATE AMID WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES
In addition to the American Petroleum Institute, the nation's largest fossil fuel lobby group, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) has argued against regulations aimed at increasing EV sales.

""The Biden administration is overseeing a whole-of-government campaign to effectively ban new gas, diesel and flex fuel vehicles,"" AFPM President and CEO Chet Thompson said in a statement. ""This agenda is bad for American families, bad for our economy and indefensible from a national security perspective.
""AFPM supports efforts to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation and improve vehicle performance and efficiency for consumers,"" he continued. ""And unlike the Biden administration’s CAFE proposal, we believe successful, consumer-first policies must encourage real competition among all technologies and powertrains, including American-made, American-grown fuels.""

Thompson also echoed Republicans, arguing that NHTSA and EPA lack congressional authorization to ""regulate internal combustion engine vehicles out of the market.""
NHTSA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ahead of a rally before Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire, Fox News joined former President Trump on board his plane for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the GOP front-runner's campaign.
""I think we're going to be in very good shape,"" Trump told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Brian Kilmeade on Trump Force One in Portsmouth.
""We had a great, a great time in Iowa. We broke every record in the book, and there were beautiful and fantastic people. And here [in New Hampshire], we have fantastic people.

While making his final push to voters in the Granite State, Trump gave viewers an exclusive look inside the plane on the tarmac, showing Kilmeade cream-colored seats, a large flat-screen TV, a living room and a separate workspace.
""I'm a worker, right? I'm not a pleasure guy. I'm a worker guy, and it's a tremendous plane for that. It's got great speed, and all that energy gets us to where we're going on time,"" he said.
Trump said the enthusiasm for his candidacy is at an all-time high, and he's chalking it up to President Biden's job performance.
""I will say we had tremendous enthusiasm for one and two [2016 and 2020]. Far more for this one than I've ever seen before. You have to see the crowds we're getting. We have never seen enthusiasm like this,"" he said.

The Pennsylvania State Police is working to recover access to online records of how it handled evidence, state officials said, blaming the loss of the records on a mistake during routine server maintenance
The same mistake also affected the State Employees Retirement System, which said online users temporarily lost access to a member services system this month.
State officials downplayed the effect on the agencies.

The Patriot-News of Harrisburg/Pennlive.com first reported the matter.
Lost were records contained in a pair of applications that the state police use to manage evidence submissions and log evidence into police labs for testing, officials said.
The Office of Administration said the physical evidence remains secure and was never endangered. The state police said the agency has recovered some of the records and is operating on a temporary system to track and receive evidence.
County prosecutors were notified of the missing records nearly two weeks ago.

Dauphin County's district attorney, Fran Chardo, told The Patriot-News of Harrisburg/Pennlive.com that his office keeps paper records of the data it stores on the state’s server. Cumberland County’s district attorney, Sean McCormick, said the county has its own forensic lab.
The retirement system said no pension data has been lost, although the agency earlier this month notified account users that it could not provide access to an online system that provides members with an up-to-date, albeit unofficial, snapshot of their benefit data.
Agency staff brought that service back online Jan. 16, although users had to verify their identity and create a new four-digit personal identification number, the agency said.
Users also lost pension calculations they had saved in their online member services account while some smaller agencies were told to re-enter any partially entered or unposted batches of personnel and payroll data, the agency said."

A Dutch court convicted Monday a former high-ranking member of a pro-Syrian government militia of illegal detention and complicity in torture, sentencing him to 12 years in prison.
The defendant, identified only as Mustafa A. in line with Dutch privacy laws, was found guilty in the 2013 arrest and inhumane treatment of a civilian while serving in the pro-Damascus Liwa al-Quds militia.
The 35-year-old was tried in The Hague District Court based on universal jurisdiction, a legal principle that allows suspects to be prosecuted for international offenses such as war crimes even if they are committed in another country.
NETHERLANDS IMMIGRATION DISPUTE CREATES RIFT AMONG POLITICAL PARTIES
The court called the militia a criminal organization whose members ""were guilty of war crimes such as looting and violence against civilians and unlawful deprivation of liberty of civilians.""
A Dutch court has convicted a former high-ranking member of a pro-Syrian government militia of illegal detention and complicity in torture, sentencing him to 12 years in prison.
A. was specifically convicted of illegal detention and complicity in the torture of a Palestinian man who was dragged out of his home at a refugee camp near the city of Aleppo and handed to the Syrian Air Force Intelligence Service, whose members subjected him to repeated torture, the court said.
He was acquitted in the arrest and torture of a second Palestinian man the same night because the court said it could not establish his personal involvement.
The defendant was granted asylum in the Netherlands in 2020 and was arrested after judicial authorities received tips that he had been a member of the Liwa al-Quds militia.

At an earlier hearing, A. denied the charges and said he was in the militia only to fight terrorists and defend his family and people. During his trial, he repeatedly declined to answer questions.
The Netherlands has arrested several suspects from Syria for alleged atrocities in their country's civil war. The Netherlands and Canada also have jointly accused Damascus of a years-long campaign of ""institutionalized"" torture against Syrians in a case filed at the Hague-based International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court.
The Netherlands is not alone in seeking justice for crimes in Syria.

A Colorado doctor was killed in an avalanche on Monday while snowboarding in the backcountry, becoming the state’s first recorded avalanche victim this season, according to officials.
Peter Harrelson, a 67-year-old doctor and longtime resident of Ophir, had set out around noon on a backcountry trip in the Waterfall Creek area south of his hometown near Telluride, the San Miguel County Sheriff’s Office said.
Authorities were alerted around 7:40 p.m. that Harrelson had not yet returned from his trip in the San Miguel Mountains and launched a search and rescue operation for the overdue doctor.
Harrelson’s friends and family followed his tracks that night but were unable to find him, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center (CAIC) said in a preliminary report.

IY4PLVIHZS_6TDEJ1L1TBI738V,North Korea demolishes monument symbolizing potential unification with South: report,By Michael Dorgan Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 4:15pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-demolishes-monument-symbolizing-potential-unification-south-report,"White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced a new multi-year military exercise plan involving the U.S., Japan and South Korea in response to provocations from China and North Korea.
A massive arched monument that stood in North Korea for more than 20 years and symbolized the goal of reconciliation with South Korea has been demolished weeks after Kim Jong Un ordered it to be destroyed, according to a report by NK News, an online outlet that monitors North Korea.
The concrete straddled monument, known as the ""Arch of Reunification,"" opened in 2001 to commemorate Korean reunification proposals put forward by former leader and dictator Kim Il Sung. At 100 feet high and 300 feet wide, it towered over the multi-laned Reunification Highway leading from Pyongyang to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and consisted of two Korean women in traditional dress holding an emblem of the entire Korean Peninsula, symbolizing the North and the South.
But satellite imagery of Pyongyang on Tuesday showed that the monument had been destroyed. It is unclear when or how it was brought down, and it was last seen standing in an image taken on Jan. 19, NK News reports.

NORTH KOREA CLAIMS IT TESTED NUCLEAR-CAPABLE UNDERWATER DRONE CAPABLE OF DESTROYING NAVAL VESSELS AND PORTS
Reuters and Fox News could not independently confirm that the monument, known officially as the ""Monument to the Three-Point Charter for National Reunification,"" had been demolished. The three charters were self-reliance, peace and national cooperation, according to South Korean government records.
Kim called the monument an ""eyesore"" in a speech at the Supreme People's Assembly on Jan. 15, where he ordered that the constitution be amended to say the South was a ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy,"" official media said.
He ordered it be ""completely removed… to completely eliminate such concepts as ‘reunification,’ ‘reconciliation’ and ‘fellow countrymen’ from the national history of our Republic,"" NK News reports.
The move indicates a further deterioration of relations between the two countries.
Kim also asked authorities to block all channels of north-south communication along the border, including physically and completely cutting off the railway tracks ""to an irretrievable level,"" the publication reports.

Tensions have spiked on the Korean peninsula following intensifying military maneuvers by South Korea and the U.S. in response to weapons testing by the North, which said it was readying for a ""nuclear war"" with its enemies.
Asked if North Korea appeared to be changing its posture on conflict with the South, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday, ""We're watching this very, very closely.""
""I would just tell you that we remain confident that the defensive posture that we're maintaining on the peninsula is appropriate to the risk,"" he added.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who took office in 2022, has taken a hard line against the North, calling for immediate and tough responses to North Korea's military actions that have raised tensions on the Korean peninsula.
North Korea claims it has produced nuclear-capable underwater drones designed to destroy naval vessels. It has also been escalating missile tests and threats, with South Korea calling on the U.N. Security Council to address the situation.
North Korea has vowed to ""wipe out"" South Korea if attacked by the South and U.S. forces. Late last year, the North declared as no longer valid a key agreement signed with the South in 2018 aimed at de-escalating military tensions.

A South Side Chicago activist, who launched a state representative bid in hopes of curbing the repercussions of the Windy City's sanctuary status, said on Wednesday that city leaders need to understand ""illegal"" means ""illegal.""
Chicago Against Violence founder Andre Smith told Fox News the burgeoning migrant crisis in the city is not the fault of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott – as city leaders have claimed – but Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson.
""Seeing our homeless on the [streets] and crime is at an all-time high, you know you can't make ‘illegal’ ‘legal’ no matter… how you do it,"" Smith said.
Johnson however, said recently his office has ""responded to this humanitarian mission with the full force of government,"" before calling Abbott ""reckless"" for sending buses ""all over the state of Illinois.""

Smith said he has launched a Democratic primary bid for the Illinois State House, where he will be challenging Rep. Kimberly du Buclet according to local reports.
Smith also recounted being arrested last year after he and two other men protested in front of a defunct school that officials began sending migrants to for sheltering purposes.
""In the community that I was born in, which is called Woodlawn in the city of Chicago, I did get arrested. I heard that they were bringing the migrants in on a CTA bus that was paid for by taxpayers' money... So I stood in front of the bus, and I refused for the illegal migrants to get into the Wadsworth School,"" he said.
""A lot of schools closed because of lack of funding. And how do you think those children feel now that they're driving past and walking past the schools that they were rejected from that now, migrants are living in?"" Smith asked.
‘NOT ONE DOLLAR TO UKRAINE’ UNTIL BORDER SECURED, GOP REP DEMANDS
Smith said the United States is a nation of laws, and therefore every person in the country should be held to the same legal standard, arguing that migrants are not.
He said that dubbing a municipality a ""sanctuary city"" should not moot legal standards.
Smith said if he is elected to office he will pursue a recall of Johnson, who defeated fellow left-wing Mayor Lori Lightfoot last year.
He added that Chicago's sanctuary status should be put up for a popular referendum by the city's voters.
However, Smith also praised a suburban city's councilman for remarks that ""America Reports"" host Sandra Smith reported were initially misconstrued.
Naperville Councilman Josh McBroom proposed city staff commence a sign-up sheet for residents his affluent Democratic leaning community who might choose to voluntarily open their homes to migrants.

Initially, McBroom was reportedly criticized on the political right, until the comments were clarified as instead a challenge to people in Naperville with pro-sanctuary or pro-migrant yard signs and slogans.
Smith said McBroom is therefore the rare Illinois public official who understands the migrant crisis and the negative effects it has had on communities.

A new Defense Department inspector general report reveals that a little-known in-house pharmacy at the White House erroneously dolled out prescription medications to staff and wasted $750,000 in taxpayer money.
One former pharmacy staff member told investigators that a doctor once asked if the staffer could ""hook up"" someone with a controlled substance ""as a parting gift for leaving the White House.""
The report, according to an article in Stat News, revealed that the pharmacy office dispensed controlled medications like Ambien and Provigil without verifying the patient’s identity.
Stat reported that in an office in the White House there was a sign that read ""Pharmacy,"" but the people in charge of it insisted it wasn’t actually one.

The investigation, which was published this month, was conducted by the Department of Defense’s independent Office of the Inspector General as the White House pharmacy is run by the White House Military Office and its associated medical unit.
The probe was prompted by internal complaints the DOD received in 2018 about a senior military medical officer, who is not named, engaging in ""improper medical practices."" It covers only activity in the office through early 2020 under the Trump administration, but investigators interviewed staffers who also worked there under former President Obama, according to Stat.

According to the report, the ""pharmacy"" let people grab over-the-counter medicines from open bins.
It also found that a larger affiliate of the office inappropriately covered care for a whole host of personnel who weren’t eligible, costing more than $750,000 in wasted taxpayer funds in just three years. Stat notes that even that number is ""fuzzy"" because so many records were poorly kept and even handwritten.

""If this had been a traditional pharmacy, they certainly would have been cited by their state board of pharmacy,"" Douglas Hoey, CEO of the National Community Pharmacists Association, told the outlet.

The incident is under investigation.
A truck driver who fatally struck a Massachusetts police officer and a utility employee, pulled a knife on another officer, stole his cruiser and crashed has an ""unbroken chain"" of crimes going back to 1996, a prosecutor said at a detention hearing Thursday.
A judge ordered that Peter Simon, 54, of Woodsville, New Hampshire, continue to be held without bail as he awaits trial on charges stemming from the Dec. 6 crashes in Waltham that killed Waltham police Officer Paul Tracey, 58, and a 36-year-old National Grid worker identified as Roderick Jackson, of Cambridge.
Simon's next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 29. His lawyer, Lynda Dantas, said some of the charges on his record were dismissed and mentioned there are ""significant mental health issues here,"" without specifying them.

Simon has a ""complete mental health network"" in New Hampshire and an apartment, said Dantas, who asked for home confinement, including an electronic monitoring device. She asked that he be allowed to leave for medical treatment only.

Simon has a record of driving away from New Hampshire authorities, prosecutors said.
In 2009, he led police on a chase through multiple parking lots in Keene and drove at about 100 mph into a passenger bus, which ""created an explosion of debris"" and caused the truck to catch fire. He fled the truck and was arrested in a restaurant.
In 2016, police responding to a call about an assault at a Franklin home pursued a van that Simon drove into a fence, authorities said.
MASSACHUSETTS OFFICER INJURED IN SHOOTOUT WITH BARRICADED SUSPECT
Simon is now accused of multiple charges, including two counts of manslaughter, armed robbery, assault and leaving the scene of an accident. He appeared in court Thursday to be arraigned on several additional charges, including negligent operation of a motor vehicle and failing to stop for a police officer. Not guilty pleas have been entered on his behalf for all charges.
In New Hampshire, Simon has served time in both the state corrections department secure psychiatric unit and in the state prison on charges including reckless conduct and assault."

The 'Outnumbered' panelists also discuss their reaction to the vote as the war between Israel and Hamas continues.
JERUSALEM – The head of the Israeli army unit, tasked with coordinating the massive international humanitarian aid operation for millions of Gazan civilians caught in the midst of a raging war in their tiny enclave, rejected recent claims that the territory was on the brink of starvation or facing the imminent threat of infectious and noxious diseases.
Col. Moshe Tetro, head of the Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA) for Gaza, a division of the military body that in peace times facilitates entry permits for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians civilians and laborers and oversees Palestinian imports and exports to Israel and beyond, told Fox News Digital that while he was familiar with reports claiming the territory was on the brink of starvation, at the moment, ""there are no restrictions on food going into Gaza.""
Speaking on Friday for the first time in nearly a month, President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu discussed the ongoing situation in Gaza. According to a readout of the call provided by the White House, ""The President and the Prime Minister reviewed the situation in Gaza and the shift to targeted operations that will enable the flow of increasing amounts of humanitarian assistance while keeping the military pressure on Hamas and its leaders.""

Tetro, whose team of soldiers works around the clock to ensure that hundreds of aid trucks, drinking water and fuel enter the Palestinian enclave daily – and work to facilitate the hazardous journey through the Strip – said it was essential to look at the data. Before the war, he said, only 70 trucks of food entered Gaza each day. He said that number has now more than doubled to 220 trucks of food entering daily over the past week.
""If you open Telegram and other social media pages, take a look at the marketplace in Rafah last Friday – you will see that while many things are missing, there is no shortage of food,"" he said, referring to Gaza’s southernmost town where hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians have sought shelter from the fighting.
""I recommend to anyone writing about this to base their words on the facts and not on the basis of political agendas,"" Tetro said.

""Our figures come from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA,)"" said a spokesperson for the State Department. The spokesperson also noted that Blinken met with the U.N. Secretary General in Davos and spoke with the ""U.N.’s newly appointed Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag underscoring the importance of strengthening the humanitarian assistance coordination mechanism in Gaza and facilitating assistance to the northern part of the Gaza Strip.""
Last week the heads of the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and the World Health Organization issued a joint press release calling on Israel to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip as ""the entire population of Gaza – roughly 2.2 million people – are in crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity.""

""Virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat,"" said the statement, citing the latest Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification report. The report has warned of famine if current conditions in Gaza persist.

""People in Gaza risk dying of hunger just miles from trucks filled with food. Every hour lost puts countless lives at risk. We can keep famine at bay but only if we can deliver sufficient supplies and have safe access to everyone in need, wherever they are,"" WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain said in the statement, which made an urgent appeal for Israel to open additional crossing points, as well as its nearby port in Ashdod, so more aid being sent from around the world could be received.
Currently, most of the aid – mainly from Arab and Muslim countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey – arrives at the smaller Egyptian port of al-Arish in northern Sinai. From there, it is transported to two stations on the border with Israel, where soldiers from Tetro’s unit check the shipments for weapons and ammunition that may be smuggled to Hamas terrorists inside the Strip.
Following a thorough security inspection, the trucks, which include food, medicine, and essential supplies such as blankets and tents, enter Gaza either through the Kerem Shalom Crossing from Israel or at the Rafah Crossing from Egypt. International aid agencies and local Palestinian organizations then distribute the goods among the needy across the war-stricken territory. Israel has also agreed to aid shipments of flour to its port in Ashdod.

A spokesperson for Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, the military body that oversees the CLA Gaza, pointed out that Israel had already opened an additional checkpoint and another aid entry point at the Kerem Shalom crossing and increased its inspection capabilities in recent weeks.
""We are checking more trucks than the U.N. is able to accommodate in Gaza,"" the spokesperson said.

According to the latest figures published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) – based on information from the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza – more than 1.9 million people, or nearly 85% of the Strip’s population, are internally displaced. The majority of those seeking refuge are sheltering in facilities run by UNRWA, the U.N. agency responsible for Palestinian refugees, OCHA said.
At a recent meeting of the U.N. Security Council, Martin Griffiths, the U.N.’s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, called the situation in Gaza ""horrific,"" highlighting what he said were ""the appalling conditions on the ground.""
""Shelters are overflowing, and food and water running out, and the risk of famine is growing by the day,"" he said. ""The health system is in a state of collapse: women are unable to give birth safely; children cannot get vaccinated; the sick and injured cannot get treatment; and infectious diseases are on the rise.""
Last week, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres echoed the same sentiments saying, ""the long shadow of starvation is stalking the people of Gaza – along with disease, malnutrition and other health threats.""

At the Coordination and Liaison Administration for Gaza unit headquarters, where Israeli soldiers monitor news and social media reports coming out of Gaza 24 hours a day, speak to their local contacts on the ground and coordinate humanitarian aid efforts with international organizations, including the U.N., Col. Tetro said that he was not surprised by such comments.
""We know these agencies systematically lie and use false narratives, but we are in close contact with international and Palestinian officials in order to assess the civil situation in the Gaza Strip,"" he said, reiterating that there is no shortage of food or water inside Gaza.

Tetro also refuted claims that infectious diseases were on the rise. If that’s true, he said, ""then why do those diseases not exist? None of the data we have, including that from the international agencies, has identified any outbreaks of diseases.""
""I’m not saying the situation in Gaza is pleasant,"" said Tetro, who recently authorized additional vaccines for hospitals in case of potential outbreaks. ""But there is a great distance between the truth and the lies and propaganda that sadly, the international community and also the media promotes, repeating the narrative of a barbaric terror organization without even checking the facts.""
On Monday, COGAT announced that the 10,000th aid truck had arrived in Gaza since the start of the war with Hamas. The statement noted that ""close to 99% of the coordinated trucks were approved for entry.""

Vice President Harris defended the independence of the Biden administration's Department of Justice on Monday and said, ""that line has never been crossed.""
CNN's Laura Coates asked Harris about Donald Trump's ""election interference"" accusations against the administration as he faced four criminal indictments. Harris argued that Americans care about the rule of law,
""But what about the accusation that it is Biden's DOJ that is overseeing any of the charges against him?"" Coates asked.
""Well, listen, everyone who is paying close attention understand that there is a clear and nonnegotiable division in terms of the separation between our administration and what the Department of Justice does, in terms of its investigations, in terms of its prosecutions.

Harris also responded to a question about state efforts to remove Trump from the ballot, such as in Maine. ""Are you leaving it up to the courts or to the voters?"" Coates asked.
""Those cases are all being litigated. I will watch as they go through their process,"" Harris said.
KAMALA HARRIS CONFIDENT AHEAD OF POTENTIAL TRUMP 2024 REMATCH: ‘WE’RE WINNING' NO MATTER WHO GOP NOMINEE IS
Harris has made several media appearances recently, including two interviews with ABC News in January.
She expressed confidence in the Biden-Harris ticket during an interview with ABC's Mary Bruce ahead of the Iowa caucuses.
""Well, let me just tell you this. No matter who the Republican nominee is, we're winning. We're winning,"" she said. The vice president said the ticket beat Trump in 2020 and would ""beat him again"" in 2024, should he be the nominee.

However, Harris, during an interview on ""The View,"" said she was ""scared as heck"" about possibly losing to Trump in 2024.
She also said President Biden and herself needed to earn their re-election.
""We have to earn the re-elect, and we have to communicate what we have achieved,"" she said. ""And that is going to be one of our big challenges. We've done a lot of good work, we have to let people know who brung it to them.""

J235EYP0QC_53LED2ULD03DPLA,RNC Chair McDaniel tells Fox News 'we need to unite' around Trump,By Paul Steinhauser Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 11:52am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-chair-mcdaniel-tells-fox-news-we-need-unite-around-trump,"RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel reacts to former President Trump's win in the 2024 New Hampshire GOP primary.
MANCHESTER, N.H. - Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has stayed neutral since the very start of the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race.
While McDaniel and the national party committee are still not taking sides in the 2024 battle between former President Trump and former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the RNC chairwoman appears to be sending a signal.
""I’m looking at the math and the path going forward, and I don’t see it for Nikki Haley,"" McDaniel told anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in a Fox News Channel interview late on Tuesday night.
HALEY LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY, BUT FACES A ‘CHALLENGING’ ROAD AHEAD

""I think she’s run a great campaign, but I do think there is a message that’s coming out from the voters, which is very clear,"" McDaniel emphasized.
She urged that ""we need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is going to be Donald Trump, and we need to make sure we beat Joe Biden.""

McDaniel's comments didn't appear to be sitting well with some national party committee members.
""The RNC has to be neutral,"" one committee member who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely told Fox News.
""We have a one-on-one competitive race. Is there a favorite? Well, sure there is. But it's a competitive race. Two states have gone. We're a long way from anybody having 1,215 delegates to wrap this thing up,"" the RNC member said. ""So for her to hint that Nikki needs to get of the race is beyond obnoxious and it's certainly not neutral.""
The nomination race and whether to coalesce around Trump will be a topic of conversation as all 167 RNC committee members and top staff huddle starting a week from Wednesday at their annual winter meeting, which this year is being held in Las Vegas, Nevada.
TRUMP TOPS HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT DOESN'T DELIVER KNOCKOUT BLOW
McDaniel was interviewed hours after the former president won a second straight double-digit victory, but he did not land a knockout blow in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, as his last remaining major rival in the GOP nomination race vowed to keep on fighting.
""This isn’t the RNC speaking, this isn’t the establishment speaking, this is voters speaking,"" McDaniel said.

When asked by MacCallum if she was suggesting that Haley needed to suspend her campaign, McDaniel would only say that Haley and her team needed to ""reflect"" about the upcoming contests in Nevada and South Carolina and to consider ""what's the most important thing going forward.""
In a speech to supporters Tuesday night in New Hampshire after Trump's primary victory was quickly projected, Haley said, ""You’ve all heard the chatter among the political class. They’re falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not last in the nation. This race is far from over.""
Haley now heads back to her home state, which holds the next major contest in the Republican nominating calendar on Feb. 24.
A rally Wednesday night in Charleston, South Carolina, is the first in a series scheduled over the coming days. Additionally, the campaign launched a new $4 million ad blitz in South Carolina on Wednesday.
Trump, in an interview with Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman, argued that it was time for Haley to suspend her campaign so he could begin targeting President Biden in what is expected to be a general election rematch.

""She should because, otherwise, we have to keep wasting money instead of spending on Biden,"" the former president emphasized. ""If she doesn’t drop out, we have to waste money instead of spending it on Biden, which is our focus.""
Trump's victory in New Hampshire came eight days after he captured a majority of the vote and crushed the competition in Iowa's low-turnout Republican presidential caucuses. It came two days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign, making the race a two-candidate contest between Trump and Haley.
New Hampshire – where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary – was considered fertile ground for Haley. She spent plenty of time and resources in the state, and secured the influential endorsement of popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.
Pundits viewed New Hampshire's primary as Haley's best and possibly last chance to slow down or derail the former president's march toward renomination.
The former president's nearly 12-point margin over Haley was below what most of the final public opinion surveys conducted ahead of the primary had suggested.
Sununu pushed back against McDaniel in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview on Wednesday morning.
""With all due respect to Ronna McDaniel, to say that we're just going to call it after two states, 40 states to go, the head of the Republican Party saying, we don't want to hear from the all the other Republicans in the nation because it's getting too close, that's nonsense,"" the New Hampshire governor emphasized. ""You got to let the voters decide, not a bunch of political elites out of D.C.""
And Haley campaign communications director Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement to Fox News that ""we don’t do coronations in this country. We do elections. The political elites can back Donald Trump, but Nikki Haley will continue to fight for the nearly 50% of Republican primary voters and the 70% of all Americans who don’t want a Biden-Trump rematch.""

A Republican source said there did not appear to be any conversations between the RNC and Haley's campaign.
McDaniel, in a Fox News Digital interview on Monday, highlighted the benefits of the GOP nomination race coming to an early conclusion.
""Obviously, it’s helpful from an organizational standpoint, from a fundraising standpoint,"" McDaniel said. ""The Democrats have the White House. They’re using the power of Joe Biden having the White House to raise a huge amount of money and the sooner we can merge our operations and be focused on him and not on each other is always good for the party.""

Amy Robach choked up describing the ""pressure"" she has felt in her relationship with T.J. Holmes after the couple lost their morning show jobs early last year.
During Tuesday's episode of their eponymous podcast, ""Amy and T.J.,"" Robach and Holmes candidly explained that their relationship was going through a rough patch.
""You and I aren't okay right now,"" Holmes said at the beginning of the episode, titled ""Things Ain't Right."" ""I said, you know what, let's set up and do a podcast.""

""I've talked a lot about living my truth and so this is part of it. I am fine having these conversations because there isn't a couple out there who doesn't,"" she said during the episode. ""And so, yes, I don't, and I know you don't, want to put on some false narrative that somehow we're the perfect couple, and we found our true love and that means we never fight, we always get along, and things are rosy and great. No, they're not.""
Their friendship evolved in June ""when they were in London together filming the Queen's Diamond Jubilee for ABC and staff were buzzing about the intimacy between them,"" Daily Mail reported.
News of Holmes and Robach's affair broke in November 2022, stunning viewers as they were both married to their respective spouses for 12 years, from whom they have both since divorced.
They were fired from their co-hosting roles at ""GMA3,"" a midday extension of the network’s flagship show ""Good Morning America,"" in January 2023.
""We've known each other for a decade now, pretty much, and we know each other really, really well... like I'm learning things about you every day as we're, we've always worked together, but working with this type of pressure over our head is a whole other thing. That pressure is a lot,"" she said.

""I don't feel the pressure from the public to stay with you,"" she explained. ""I know you well enough and I've spent enough time with you and I knew how I felt and love sometimes is a choice when it's hard. It's not just a feeling. Lust is a feeling, but love is a choice, I believe, and I have chosen to love you, so I don't feel pressure from the public to be with you. I would be devastated just personally because I want to be with you and I chose you.""
""But, I feel the pressure of our careers that I believe were unfairly taken from us, and I really want to be able to do what I love, and I want to be able to do it with you, so that's more the pressure I feel,"" she added, getting emotional.
Robach said she also felt ""extremely disconnected"" from Holmes, adding that he had been ""emotionally removed"" despite the fact that she is ""someone who does want and needs physical touch, words of affirmation and communication.""

J3B3Z1YAN2_LSX8Y2YRKULDG2O,Alabama faces scrutiny as it prepares for first-ever execution by nitrogen gas,Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 9:09am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-faces-scrutiny-prepares-first-ever-execution-nitrogen-gas,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Alabama is preparing to use a new method of execution: nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, who survived the state’s previous attempt to put him to death by lethal injection in 2022, is scheduled to be put to death Thursday by nitrogen hypoxia. If carried out, it would the first new method of execution since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
The state maintains that nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness quickly but critics have likened the never-used method of execution to human experimentation.
ALABAMA DEATH ROW EXECUTION BY NITROGEN GAS COULD 'AMOUNT TO TORTURE,' VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES, UN SAYS
Nitrogen hypoxia execution would cause death by forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen, depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.
Alabama's lethal injection chamber at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore is seen on Oct. 7, 2002. Kenneth Smith, 58, is scheduled to be executed Jan. 25, 2024, at a south Alabama prison by nitrogen gas, a method that has never been used to put a person to death. (AP Photo/File)
No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state — along with Oklahoma and Mississippi — to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find.
Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, makes up 78% of the air inhaled by humans and is harmless when breathed with proper levels of oxygen.
The theory behind nitrogen hypoxia is that changing the composition of the air to 100% nitrogen will cause Smith to lose consciousness and then die from lack of oxygen.
Much of what is recorded in medical journals about death from nitrogen exposure comes from industrial accidents — where nitrogen leaks or mix-ups have killed workers — and suicide attempts.
After Smith is strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber, the state said in a court filing that it will place a ""NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator"" — a type of mask typically used in industrial settings to deliver life-preserving oxygen — over Smith's face.
The warden will then read the death warrant and ask Smith if he has any last words before activating ""the nitrogen hypoxia system"" from another room. The nitrogen gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or ""five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,"" according to the state protocol.
The state heavily redacted sections of the protocol related to the storage and testing of the gas system.
The Alabama attorney general’s office told a federal judge that the nitrogen gas will ""cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes.""
Smith's attorneys say the state is seeking to make him the ""test subject"" for a novel execution method.
They have argued that the mask the state plans to use is not air tight and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, possibly leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council earlier this month cautioned that, in their view, the execution method would violate the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia can be an acceptable method of euthanasia under certain conditions for pigs but not for other mammals because it creates an ""anoxic environment that is distressing for some species.""
Not exactly. Some states previously used hydrogen cyanide gas, a lethal gas, for executions. The last prisoner to be executed in a U.S. gas chamber was Walter LaGrand, the second of two German brothers sentenced to death for killing a bank manager in 1982 in southern Arizona. It took LaGrand 18 minutes to die in 1999.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect insurance money.
Alabama attempted to execute Smith in 2022 by lethal injection. He was strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber being prepared for lethal injection, but the state called off the lethal injection when execution team members had difficulty connecting the second of two required intravenous lines to Smith's veins. Smith was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours, according to his lawyers, as he waited to see if the execution would go forward.
The question of whether the execution can proceed will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Friday in Smith’s request to block the execution. After the court rules, either side could appeal.
Smith has argued that the state’s proposed procedures violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He has also argued that Alabama violated his due process rights by scheduling the execution when he has pending appeals and that the face mask will interfere with is ability to pray.
ALABAMA CONVICT TURNS TO APPEALS COURT IN BID TO BLOCK FIRST-EVER NITROGEN GAS EXECUTION
In a separate case, Smith is arguing it would violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment for the state to make a second attempt to execute him after he already survived one execution attempt. Lawyers for Smith on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to consider that question.
Lethal injection is the most commonly used execution method in the United States, but death penalty states have struggled at times to obtain the needed drugs or encountered other problems in connecting intravenous lines.
If the Alabama execution goes forward, other states may seek to start to using nitrogen gas.
If the execution is blocked by the court or botched, it could halt or slow the pursuit of nitrogen gas as an alternative execution method."

A Winter Haven, Florida woman is the second suspect to be arrested in connection to the murder of 20-year-old Sierra Hernandez, after human remains were found in a pile of burned objects.
FOX 13 in Tampa Bay reported that 44-year-old Daphne Fernandez appeared in court on Wednesday and faces charges of attempted felony murder, abuse of a body, kidnapping and accessory after the fact.
Her appearance came one day after Polk County Sheriff’s Office detectives arrested 26-year-old Enrique Martinez, who is a suspect in the murder of Hernandez as well as Edil Rodriguez, who was murdered at a homeless camp on Nov. 8, 2023.
Martinez had been on the run for two months, but on Tuesday he was spotted wandering on a sidewalk near Cooley Road and SR 540 in Winter Haven, according to Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.
FLORIDA SUSPECT IN MURDERS OF MISSING WOMAN, MAN AT HOMELESS CAMP CAPTURED AFTER MONTHS ON THE RUN
(The Polk County Sheriff's Office arrested 44-year-old Daphne Fernandez in connection to the death of a 20-year-old missing woman, after a pile of burned items in Fernandez's backyard contained human remains.)
""He was pretty good at avoiding us for a period of time, but our deputies and detectives, who are the very best, never gave up,"" Judd said.
The station reported that court documents show that on Jan. 14, Rita Thomas, Hernandez’s mother, reported her daughter had been missing for several days.
An investigation discovered that a witness said he saw Fernandez at her home in Winter Haven on Jan. 10 with Martinez, who was already wanted for the first-degree murder of Rodriguez.

The witness told investigators Martinez and Fernandez were standing in her son’s room where he saw someone else, believed to be Hernandez, with her wrists and hands bound, and being held against her will.
When the witness intervened and asked what Fernandez and Martinez were doing, the latter charged at the witness, who ran from the home.
On Jan. 15, Fernandez was spotted driving Hernandez’s Ford Crown Victoria in the Lakeland, Florida area, and was pulled over by a Polk County Sheriff’s Office deputy.

She was ultimately arrested for driving on a suspended license.
The sheriff’s office obtained a search warrant at Fernandez’s home four days after her arrest, and while executing the search, investigators allegedly found Hernandez’s medical paperwork from Jan. 8.
Investigators also alleged they found a large pile of burned items in the backyard of the home, which included human remains.
Upon further investigation, detectives claim Fernandez lied about why she was in possession of Hernandez’s vehicle, assisted in concealing the 20-year-old’s murder and provided aid to Martinez to avoid being arrested.

JA5KQJ34LX_INMRWJPOR8O1LQB,‘Focus on merit’: Oregon county axes diversity office that cost nearly $1 million a year,By Hannah Ray Lambert Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 5:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/focus-merit-oregon-county-axes-diversity-office-cost-nearly-1-million-year,"An Oregon county is dismantling its diversity, equity and inclusion office, choosing to focus on ""diversity of ideas"" instead, Clackamas County Commissioner Ben West said.
Officials in an Oregon county are dismantling their nearly $830,000 a year diversity, equity and inclusion office, despite outcry from those who oppose rolling back social justice initiatives.
""[We] believed that it was really important to focus on merit, fairness and equality, not to racialize the workplace and the county,"" Clackamas County Commissioner Ben West told Fox News. ""We didn't want that in our county any longer.""
The Clackamas County Board of Commissioners began discussions about dissolving their equity office last spring. On Feb. 5, the office will officially be dismantled, with two of its three employee positions being assigned to other departments. (iStock)
UNIVERSITY QUIETLY DROPS FACULTY DEI REQUIREMENTS IN FREE SPEECH 'VICTORY,' CIVIL RIGHTS ORG SAYS
Clackamas County's equity efforts began in 2004 with a volunteer advisory council. Then in 2020, as racial justice protests swept the nation — and raged for more than 100 consecutive nights in nearby Portland — the county created a three-person Equity and Inclusion Office.
County Commissioner Mark Shull proposed defunding the office last spring, calling it an ""unnecessary expense"" that ""only foments friction.""
This month, the county's administrator sent a memo to employees announcing the office would dissolve as of Feb. 5. Its two full-time positions are being transferred to other departments. One position will focus on the county's compliance with federal and state civil rights laws, while the other will support ""community engagement and communications efforts that are accessible and inclusive for all populations,"" according to the email, which was shared with Fox News.

'LET THIS SERVE AS A WARNING': ANARCHISTS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR BURNING CAR OUTSIDE CITY LEADER'S HOME
Reaction has been mixed. Last August, residents both in favor of and in opposition to cutting the DEI department packed a county commissioners meeting. Some taunted West as he tried to speak, according to local news reports.
At least five Clackamas County mayors previously signed onto an open letter urging the commissioners to expand equity and inclusion efforts, not cut them. More than 700 other community members, business owners, organizations and politicians also signed the letter.
""This is not about a budget, it’s not about a financial crisis — it’s about racism, sexism and all the things that this country is trying to overcome,"" Emmett Wheatfall, a former Clackamas County diversity manager, told The Oregonian last year. Wheatfall retired in 2019, before the county established its new equity office.

Clackamas County is one of three counties that make up the Portland metro area. While its residents lean Democratic, they have favored Republican gubernatorial candidates in the past several elections.
West — who was a plaintiff in the case that made gay marriage legal in Oregon and has a Black son — said the move demonstrates the county's commitment to a ""diversity of ideas"" rather than identity politics.
""We value you regardless of your immutable traits,"" West said. ""Those are not the things that make you unique and special to Clackamas County. It's that individual spark inside you that does, that makes you a person.""

The DEI field saw a surge in popularity during the political unrest following George Floyd's killing in 2020. Numerous universities, companies and government offices have rolled back their diversity initiatives in recent months.

The heartbroken family of an 85-year-old woman who was dragged into a pond and killed by a deadly alligator is suing the retirement village where the horrific incident took place, claiming the owners knew the gator was living in the water and failed to remove it.
Gloria Serge was near a retention pond behind her house in Fort Pierce, Florida, on Feb. 20, 2023, when the 10-foot-long beast crawled out of the water and first tried to attack her dog, according to chilling CCTV footage.
The surveillance footage shows the reptile swimming in a direct path toward Serge’s dog before it rises out of the water and scampers up the embankment in pursuit of the animal. The octogenarian was taken to the ground with the alligator biting her feet, and then she was dragged into the water.

Bill Serge, the victim’s son, announced the lawsuit against Spanish Lakes Fairways at a news conference with his attorneys on Friday.

""I never could have imagined the agonizing way that my mother spent the last moments of her life. No child should have to bury their mom under such horrible circumstances. This was a tragedy that was 100% preventable.""
The suit claims Wynne Building Corporation, which owns and operates Spanish Lakes Fairways, was negligent in that the owners knew the gator was lurking in the pond and failed to remove it or put up warning signs to notify people it was there.
The predator was so well-known that residents nicknamed it ""Henry,"" the attorneys from Lesser, Lesser, Landy & Smith, PLLC, a West Palm Beach firm said, according to CBS12.
Attorneys Gary Lesser and managing partner Joshua Ferraro also claimed the owners could have prevented the tragedy by enforcing rules on feeding wildlife.

The attorneys also claim that Gloria Serge was forced to walk her canines by the lake because the neighborhood has strict rules forbidding animals to be walked in the streets.
""Spanish Lakes is one of these communities that has a rule: you can’t walk your dog in the streets of your community,"" Lesser said.
""In fact, Gloria was given a violation and eviction warning for walking her small dog in the front yard of her house.""
WPEC reported that its crew did not observe any signs warning people to look out for gators on Friday, but did notice multiple signs telling residents they can’t walk their dogs in the street.
Fox News Digital reached out to Wynne Building Corporation for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

The alligator was trapped and killed by a nuisance gator trapper. Serge’s dog survived the attack.
Days after the tragedy, the Spanish Lakes Fairways homeowners association in St. Lucie removed three more alligators from the neighborhood, although it wasn’t clear if the alligators were removed from the same pond where the woman tragically died, the Gainesville Sun reported.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) says alligator attacks against people are considered rare as they typically do not attack people unless provoked. Alligators can become aggressive during mating season or to protect their nests, the FWC says.
Alligators live in all 67 counties in Florida and can be found in practically all fresh and brackish water bodies and occasionally in salt water. Although exact population figures are not known, Florida has a healthy and stable population of about 1.3 million alligators of every size, according to the FWC.
From 1948 to 2022, 453 unprovoked bite incidents occurred in Florida, 26 of which resulted in human fatalities, the FWC states.

(VIDEO: @eugeniamartinezdeirujo/Instagram)
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was caught on video attempting to dance ""La Macarena"" at a party in Spain with the duo who made the song infamous, Los del Rio.
After her meeting in Madrid with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Albares, Clinton traveled to Seville to attend a party in her honor at the iconic Palacio de Dueñas, according to Hola.com.
The video that was shared to Instagram shows Clinton being pulled up in front of a group of people to dance with the band. She attempts to follow along, but doesn't appear to know the moves of the iconic '90s dance hit.
The Olive Press, a news outlet in Spain, said Clinton brought ""the cringe"" with her on her January 19 trip.

The Olive Press said Clinton's lack of knowledge of the dance was puzzling, since it was played constantly at Democratic Party events during the campaign to re-elect her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
Clinton's trip also happened to align with the 30th anniversary of the 90’s classic, which went on to become an unofficial anthem of her husband, Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign in 1996, according to Olive Press.

JUH8ML5TL2_DGRORCJ9N23CC4J,Supreme Court rejects appeal from former Hunter Biden business partner regarding criminal conviction,"By Joe Schoffstall , Cameron Cawthorne Fox News","Published January 22, 2024 4:06pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-rejects-appeal-former-hunter-biden-business-partner-regarding-criminal-conviction,"President Biden tells Fox News Peter Doocy that he never talked business with anybody on Your World.
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal from Hunter Biden's former business partner regarding his criminal conviction for his alleged role in defrauding a Native American tribe.
Devon Archer, who served on Ukrainian energy company Burisma's board alongside Hunter Biden, previously lost an appeal before the high court. A federal judge sentenced Archer to prison in 2018 for allegedly defrauding the tribe by fraudulently issuing $60 million in tribal bonds after he was convicted by a jury.
However, his conviction was thrown out in late 2018 by U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan because she was ""left with an unwavering concern that Archer is innocent of the crimes charged,"" according to Reuters.

Archer’s conviction was reinstated by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals a month before the 2020 election and he received a one-year and one-day prison sentence in February 2022.
Despite the sentence, Archer’s lawyer, Matthew Schwartz, has maintained his innocence and said they intended to file a series of appeals, which has delayed Archer serving his sentence.
""Mr. Archer is obviously disappointed with today’s sentence, and intends to appeal. It is unfortunate that the judge, who has previously expressed concern that Mr. Archer is innocent of the crimes charged and reiterated that belief today, felt that she was constrained not to act on her independent assessment of the evidence,"" Schwartz said in February 2022.

The ordeal stems from Archer’s alleged role in defrauding a Native American tribal entity and various investment advisory clients of tens of millions of dollars in connection with the issuance of bonds by the tribal entity and the subsequent sale of those bonds through ""fraudulent and deceptive means,"" according to the Department of Justice.
Hunter Biden was not involved with the scheme.

Abrams previously ruled that evidence presented earlier against Archer did not show that he ""knew that the bond issue was fraudulent, or that he received any personal benefit from it,"" according to Reuters. However, she would later say in 2022 that the alleged crime was ""too serious"" to let Archer get no prison time, claiming that ""there’s no dispute about the harm caused to real people.""

MANCHESTER, N.H. – Donald Trump won again.
But the former president didn't land a knockout blow in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, as his last remaining major rival in the GOP nomination race vowed to keep on fighting.
""You’ve all heard the chatter among the political class. They’re falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not last in the nation. This race is far from over,"" Nikki Haley stressed, as she spoke to supporters after the New Hampshire race was quickly called for Trump.
The former two-term South Carolina governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration now heads back to her home state, which on Feb. 24 holds the next major contest in the Republican nominating calendar.
TRUMP TOPS HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT DOESN'T DELIVER KNOCKOUT BLOW

A rally Wednesday night in Charleston is the first in a series scheduled over the coming days. And the campaign said they're launching a new $4 million ad blitz in South Carolina this week.
Trump, in an interview with Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman, argued that it was time for Haley to suspend her campaign, so he could begin targeting President Biden in what's expected to be a general election rematch.

""She should because, otherwise, we have to keep wasting money instead of spending on Biden,"" the former president emphasized. ""If she doesn’t drop out, we have to waste money instead of spending it on Biden, which is our focus.""
Trump's victory in New Hampshire came eight days after he captured a majority of the vote and crushed the competition in Iowa's low-turnout Republican presidential caucuses. And it came two days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign, making the race a two-candidate contest between Trump and Haley.
New Hampshire – where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary – was considered fertile ground for Haley. And Haley spent plenty of time and resources in the state, and secured the influential endorsement of popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.
Pundits viewed New Hampshire's primary as Haley's best and possibly last chance to slow down or derail the former president's march towards renomination.
And the former president's nearly twelve point margin over Haley was below what most of the final public opinion surveys conducted ahead of the primary had suggested.

Trump, who praised his opponents in his victory speech in Iowa a week ago, set a very different tone in his New Hampshire address.
He argued that Haley ""ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely"" and delivered ""a speech like she won. She didn’t’ win. She lost.""
""Let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night. She had a very bad night,"" Trump emphasized.

But seasoned Republican strategist Colin Reed emphasized that Haley ""was wise to get out there quickly and make it clear that this race was going to continue and end that narrative in its tracks before it got any traction.""
""Now she’s got to sharpen her message… she’s got a month to make her case,"" noted Reed, who is once again neutral in the GOP nomination after helping to steer a super PAC that was supporting former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's  unsuccessful 2024 campaign.
A source in Haley's political orbit, speaking to Fox News, argued that there are ""now two states where Trump got barely half the vote. That's incredibly weak for an incumbent.""
And Haley, in her speech, spotlighted that ""we still have ways to go, but we still keep moving up.""
Haley's campaign told Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning that they hauled in $1.5 million in fundraising since DeSantis dropped out of the race. And they noted that they're planning major fundraisers in the days ahead.
Longtime New Hampshire-based Republican consultant Jim Merrill said that ""the reality is Haley overperformed expectations.""
""Donald Trump wanted a narrative out of New Hampshire that this race was over. And New Hampshire didn’t give it to him,"" Merrill, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, noted.
Merrill, who remains neutral in the 2024 GOP nomination race, said that ""it’s a challenging road for Haley that lays ahead, but I think she’s earned the right to make that journey.""
But Mike Dennehy, another longtime New Hampshire-based GOP strategist, hinted that the end of the Republican race appeared near, as he pointed towards the exit polls.
""The bottom line is she only won 25% of registered Republicans. There is no good news coming out of New Hampshire for her.""
And Mike Biundo, a New Hampshire-based Republican consultant who is neutral again after heading up a super PAC that was backing Vivek Ramaswamy's unsucessful White House campaign, told Fox News that ""Last night was Nikk's best and only opportunity to make a lasting impact on this race.""
Pointing to a ""potential humiliating loss in her home state just 30 days away,"" Biundo argued ""there is no secure landing for her campaign. If I were advising her, I would suggest making a strong case that it's time for her to save herself for 2028 and beyond and to back Trump before it's too late for her career.""

A Russian court on Thursday sentenced a woman to 27 years for a cafe blast that killed a prominent pro-war blogger after he was given a bust of himself that later exploded.
In a separate proceeding, a Moscow court convicted a former leader of separatist rebels in Ukraine who called President Vladimir Putin a coward of extremism and sentenced him to four years.
Darya Trepova, 26, was convicted by a court in St. Petersburg of carrying out a terrorist attack, illegal trafficking of explosive devices and forging documents in the April 2 blast at the cafe in which Vladlen Tatarsky was killed and 52 others were injured.
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: NATO GOES BACK TO THE COLD WAR TO FEND OFF RUSSIA
Tatarsky, 40, was an ardent supporter of the Kremlin’s military action in Ukraine and filed regular reports on the fighting from the front lines.

Trepova was seen on video presenting Tatarsky with the bust moments before the blast at the riverside cafe in the historic heart of Russia’s second-largest city where he was leading a discussion.
She insisted that she didn’t know the bust contained a bomb. Russian authorities have blamed Ukrainian intelligence agencies for orchestrating the bombing. Authorities in Kyiv have not directly responded to the accusation.
The Moscow court imposed the four-year sentence on Igor Girkin, who used the surname alias of Strelkov (shooter), was the most prominent leader of Russian-backed separatist fighters in Ukraine’s Donetsk region in 2014, when rebellion arose after the ouster of Ukraine’s Russia-allied president.
He briefly became the self-declared separatist government’s defense minister, but left the post in August 2014 after rebel forces shot down a Malaysian passenger airliner over Donetsk, killing all 298 people aboard. He was convicted in absentia of murder in the Netherlands, where the flight had originated, for his role.
He returned to Russia and became a nationalist commentator and activist. He supported launching Russia’s war in Ukraine, but sharply criticized authorities for being inept and indecisive in carrying out the fight.
US LAUGHS OFF REPORTS OF PUTIN EYEING ALASKA AS RUSSIA'S 'FORMER REAL ESTATE': 'NOT GETTING IT BACK'
Girkin called Putin a ""nonentity"" and a person of ""cowardly mediocrity."" He was arrested in July on extremism charges and remained in custody since then.
His conviction reflects the high sensitivity of Russian authorities to criticism and opposition. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, that sensitivity intensified sharply, with the passage of laws criminalizing statements and news reports that allegedly discredit the Russian military.
Two protesters calling for Girkin to be freed were detained by police outside the court building, Russian news agencies said.
Girkin's sentence was considerable less harsh than those handed to some figures who have denounced the war, notably the 25-year sentence imposed on opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Murza.
Treopva's sentence is the longest imposed on a woman in modern Russia, according to the Mediazona website that reports on human rights and justice issues."

The parents of University of Idaho stabbing victim Kaylee Goncalves are hoping the judge schedules a trial soon for the man suspected of killing her and three friends, according to a new interview.
Latah County District Judge John Judge previously scheduled a Friday afternoon hearing on prosecutors' request for a summer proceeding.
Goncalves and her classmates died in the early hours of November 13, 2022, after a masked man entered her off-campus rental home with a knife and butchered them.

Prosecutors say that man is Bryan Kohberger, whose DNA they allegedly recovered from a Ka-Bar knife sheath found under the body of Madison Mogen, 21, Goncalves' best friend. The two were killed in a third-floor bedroom.
The other two victims, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20, were found on the second floor, where a surviving housemate came face to face with the masked intruder before he left through the back door, according to court filings.

Speculation about a motive, the long delay before a 911 call around noon the next day and the suspect's connection to the victims has been rampant, with few confirmed details, due to a gag order on the case and with many court documents filed under seal.
""It keeps being locked away from the people, and it encourages – it pretty much manifests – an environment where speculations and rumors and conspiracies thrive,"" Goncalves' father, Steve Goncalves, told ""Good Morning America"" Friday.

Kohberger could face the death penalty if convicted on any of the four first-degree murder charges he faces.
The judge entered not guilty pleas to those charges and to felony burglary on his behalf during his arraignment in May.

K164JIF31Q_MH9PZH14U1CPKNE,Biden admin probed after Fox News Digital shows it may have fabricated paper trail to shutter chemical plant,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 3:14pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-probed-after-fox-news-digital-shows-it-may-have-fabricated-paper-trail-to-shutter-chemical-plant,"'America Reports' panelists Steve Moore and Dan Greenhaus break down the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate's lavish program that is turning the heads of concerned economists.
House Republican leaders on the Science, Space and Technology Committee are probing the Biden administration over its apparent actions fabricating a paper trail in pursuit of a chemical plant shutdown in Louisiana.
Environment Subcommittee Chair Max Miller, R-Ohio, and Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Chair Brian Babin, R-Texas, penned a letter Wednesday to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan, requesting more information about his agency's actions preceding the Department of Justice's lawsuit against synthetics manufacturer Denka Performance Elastomer (DPE) in early 2023.
The federal lawsuit seeks to compel DPE's manufacturing facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, to massively reduce its emissions of the chemical chloroprene in accordance with the standard determined to be safe by a 2010 study. DPE has argued for a more updated scientific review of chloroprene emissions, an action local EPA officials said it would pursue in 2021 before the EPA's federal Office of Research and Development (ORD) intervened.
""Officials in EPA’s Office of Research and Development may have violated scientific integrity policies by influencing EPA’s Region 6 Office to withdraw a request for a scientific review of the cancer risk assessment in the 2010 Toxicology Review of Chloroprene under EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System Program,"" Miller and Babin wrote in their letter to Regan.

The lawmakers' letter cites a Fox News Digital report which uncovered deposition testimony from Michael Morton, who serves as EPA Region 6 science liaison to ORD, stating that he didn't author a July 2021 email sent from his email address to federal officials calling off a review of chloroprene. Months earlier, in April 2021, Region 6 nominated chloroprene for review to revisit its assessment of the chemical's health risks.
Morton told defense lawyers representing DPE in the lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice during deposition in November that he was unaware of who authored the email sent from his email address.
ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST
""I didn't write that,"" Morton told counsel. ""I didn't say that. For – for that part, I didn't – I don't know that, so I don't know who wrote that,"" he added when pressed on the July 2021 email.
In addition to Morton's testimony, DPE counsel submitted in court filings metadata of his email showing it was originally authored by ORD officials.
Metadata of EPA Region 6 official Michael Morton's 2021 email walking back his office's nomination of chloroprene. The metadata shows the email was authored by EPA ORD official Dahnish Shams. (United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana)
The revelations suggest that, to walk back the nomination of chloroprene, ORD cited an email purportedly from Region 6, but which it appears to have actually crafted and sent to itself using Morton's email address. If EPA had moved forward with the nomination of chloroprene and engaged with new research, though, its eventual lawsuit targeting DPE's LaPlace facility may have been derailed.
""Based on this evidence alone, it appears that ORD officials, in an apparent effort to build a fabricated scientific record, authored the email withdrawing the request for scientific review on behalf of Region 6, which had previously determined a scientific review necessary,"" Miller and Babin continued in their letter. ""This practice is otherwise known as 'ghostwriting.'""
BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION
""Additionally, because this ghost-written email was sent several weeks after the chloroprene nomination was rejected, the actions undertaken by ORD officials appear to be a retroactive attempt to provide scientific rationales and may have been an action to silence scientific opinions of chloroprene that differ from the Agency’s public position,"" they wrote.
The Republican lawmakers added that the revelations ""raise serious concerns that could amount to a violation"" of EPA's Scientific Integrity Policy which prohibits ""all EPA employees, including scientists, managers, and other Agency leadership, from suppressing, altering, or otherwise impeding the timely release of scientific findings or conclusions.""

Further, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s Scientific Integrity Policy states that ""scientists’ ability to freely voice the legitimate disagreement that improves science should not be constrained.""
ENERGY DEVELOPER AXING KEY COAL POWER PLANTS TO MEET ECO GOALS, JEOPARDIZING POWER FOR MILLIONS
Miller and Babin demanded answers to a series of questions posed to Regan and additionally asked for the EPA’s Office of the Inspector General to conduct a review of the matter.
EPA declined to comment, citing pending litigation in the case.

Meanwhile, if the Justice Department's lawsuit is successful, it could threaten the future operations of the DPE's LaPlace facility — the so-called Pontchartrain Works Site which represents the only U.S. plant to produce neoprene, a synthetic rubber common in military equipment, wetsuits and medical technology — and set a precedent broadly threatening the multi-billion-dollar U.S. petrochemical industry.

Overall, the multi-billion-dollar petrochemical industry in Louisiana is a key driver of jobs and investment in the state. The industry is also a central reason why the state is the third-largest consumer of petroleum and largest consumer of petroleum per capita in the nation, according to the Energy Information Administration.
However, the petrochemical industry has long been target of environmentalists who argue it is responsible for harmful emissions and pollution negatively impacting surrounding communities' health.

Eisenhower aircraft carrier, as well as Tomahawk missiles.
U.S. defense officials said U.S. and U.K. ships and warplanes carried out multiple strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Monday.
Multiple locations in Yemen experienced large explosions which were the result of the airstrikes.
A U.S. official tells Fox News one of the Houthi targets struck by U.S. and British munitions included Al Dailami Air Base along with missile launching sites and weapons storage facilities for ballistic missiles and drones.
This is the second joint U.S.-U.K. strikes from air and sea since Jan 11.

The strikes consisted of Tomahawk missiles fired from U.S. warships, as well as F-18 fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier.
""Today, the militaries of the United States and United Kingdom, at the direction of their respective governments with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes against 8 Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the Houthis' continued attacks against international and commercial shipping as well as naval vessels transiting the Red Sea,"" a joint statement from the U.S., U.K. and other countries stated.
The statement referred to a series of illegal, dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions, including anti-ship ballistic missile and unmanned aerial system attacks that struck two U.S.-owned merchant vessels earlier this month.

The ""precision strikes"" on Monday were intended to ""disrupt and degrade"" Houthi efforts to threaten global trade and the lives of mariners.
""Today's strike specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis' missile and air surveillance capabilities,"" the statement read. ""The Houthis' now more than thirty attacks on international and commercial vessels since mid-November constitute an international challenge.
""Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,"" the joint statement continued.
Defense officials provided more information about the strikes on Monday evening, saying the mission was successful in removing ""significant"" Houthi capability.

""We can tell you that we observed good impacts and effects at all eight locations. Assessing that we did, in fact, destroy missiles, unmanned aerial systems and weapon storage areas.""
Along with the F-18 super hornets from the USS Eisenhower, guided missile destroyers USS Mason, USS Philippine Sea and USS Gravely assisted with Tomahawk land attack missiles.
The U.K. also contributed fighter aircraft during the mission.
Pentagon officials estimate 25-30 munitions were dropped on Houthi targets, though assessments are ongoing.
The number of Houthi casualties is unknown, but the number is expected to be low, according to U.S. military officials, because the targets were ""not intentionally selected for casualties. They were going after weapons systems.""
The Pentagon also said this was the first time the U.S. has struck an underground storage facility of this time in Yemen.
""The particular weapons storage facility was assessed to have more advanced conventional weaponry in it than in the first strike on the 11th,"" a senior military official said, adding the facility was used to store missiles and unmanned systems.

Still, the senior official stressed that the U.S. is selecting targets with no intent of expanding the conflict in the Middle East.
""We're specifically avoiding escalation by selecting these locations and individual targets that will remove capability used in maritime attacks,"" the official said. ""We are not at this time expanding beyond that.""
There have been at least 151 attacks on U.S. forces in the region since Oct. 17.

Eisenhower aircraft carrier, as well as Tomahawk missiles.
The U.S. has carried out ""necessary and proportionate"" strikes in Iraq, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday.
U.S. forces targeted three facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group and other Iran-linked groups, Austin said in a statement.
The Kataib Hezbollah headquarters was targeted, along with storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities, U.S. Central Command said.
""These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against U.S. and Coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias,"" said Austin.

The strikes were in response to the Iran proxy group Kataib Hezbollah's massive ballistic missile attack on al-Asad air base on Saturday, and an attack on al-Asad on Tuesday, a U.S. defense official told Fox News. The group fired 17 ballistic missiles and rockets at the base, where the majority of the 2,500 troops in Iraq are stationed.
On Saturday, the U.S. Army's Patriot missile defense system fired 15 missiles to intercept the ballistic missiles and rockets, but two got through, damaging the base and resulting in four U.S. service members being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.
All have returned to duty.
The attack on al-Asad on Tuesday resulted in only minor injuries. U.S. forces in Iraq have been repeatedly targeted by Iran-linked groups in multiple attacks in recent months.
""The President and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend them and our interests. We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region,"" Austin said. ""We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks.""

Long-shot presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., GOP candidate former President Donald Trump, and other high-profile figures are siding with Texas in the Lone Star State's spat with the Biden administration over its handling of illegal immigrants at the border.
The independent said Texas was ""right"" to defend its borders amid what he regarded as the failed policies of the Biden administration.
""A country without borders is not a country at all,"" he tweeted.
TRUMP TELLS STATES TO SURGE NATIONAL GUARD TO TEXAS AS ABBOTT STANDOFF WITH BIDEN ACCELERATES
Kennedy is among a growing list of public figures and red states that are throwing their support behind Texas after a Monday Supreme Court decision gave Border Patrol officials the green light to remove razor wire from a riverfront park near Eagle Pass that has become a popular corridor for immigrants illegally entering the U.S.
MSNBC'S REID COMPARES LAWMAKERS WORRIED ABOUT BORDER TO ‘OLD SOUTHERNERS’ WHO RESISTED INTEGRATION
Former President Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner in the 2024 race, said all Americans ought to be supporting Texas’ ""commonsense measures"" and vowed to work with Gov. Abbott and other border states to ""stop the invasion, seal the border, and rapidly begin the largest domestic deportation operation in history.""
""Those Biden has let in should not get comfortable because they will be going home,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., accused President Biden’s ""failed"" border policies of having ""wreaked havoc in every corner of our country, including Louisiana.""
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin accused the Biden administration of refusing ""to secure the border"" and offered his state’s support of Gov. Abbott and Texas’ ""constitutional right to defend itself.""
Youngkin is among more than two dozen Republican governors who have released a joint statement targeting the Biden administration for refusing to ""take action or responsibility for the crisis at the Southern border.""
SPEAKER JOHNSON SAYS HOUSE ‘WILL DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER’ TO BACK TEXAS OVER BORDER FEUD
""President Biden and his Administration have left Americans and our country completely vulnerable to unprecedented illegal immigration pouring across the Southern border,"" reads a joint statement from 25 Republican governors. ""Instead of upholding the rule of law and securing the border, the Biden Administration has attacked and sued Texas for stepping up to protect American citizens from historic levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and terrorists entering our country.""

The statement continues: ""We stand in solidarity with our fellow Governor, Greg Abbott, and the State of Texas in utilizing every tool and strategy, including razor wire fences, to secure the border. We do it in part because the Biden Administration is refusing to enforce immigration laws already on the books and is illegally allowing mass parole across America of migrants who entered our country illegally.""
The razor wire fencing in Texas has become one of Gov. Abbott's most visible measures to deter migrants in the border city of Eagle Pass.
Texas seized control of the park this month and began denying entry to Border Patrol agents, escalating a feud between Abbott and the Biden administration. On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security sent the state a letter demanding access again to Shelby Park, which is next to the Rio Grande.

K6YAFFVBWL_8W0UJ2OVYIM7RNW,White House halts enormous natural gas projects in victory for environmentalists,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 5:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-halts-enormous-natural-gas-projects-victory-environmentalists,"Price Futures Group senior analyst Phil Flynn and Copenhagen Consensus Center President Bjorn Lomborg on the concerns about bans on natural gas for costs and reliability.
The White House is halting the permitting process for several proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects over their potential impacts on climate change, an unprecedented move environmentalists have demanded in recent months.
In a joint announcement Friday morning, the White House and Department of Energy (DOE) said the pause would occur while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. Climate activists have loudly taken aim at LNG export projects in recent weeks, arguing they will lead to a large uptick in emissions and worsen global warming.
""As our exports increase, we must review export applications using the most comprehensive up-to-date analysis of the economic, environmental and national security considerations,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters on a press call. ""This action includes a pause on pending applications for exports of U.S. natural gas as LNG to non-free trade agreement countries until the department can update the underlying analyses for authorizations.""
""The U.S. is committed to affordable energy and economic opportunities for all Americans. We are committed to strengthening energy security here in the U.S. and with our allies,"" Granholm continued. ""And we're committed to protecting Americans against climate change as we lead the world into a clean energy future.""

While it is unclear which proposed projects the action will affect, a senior administration official told reporters at least two have a larger capacity and two have a smaller capacity. Another official added that the pause implemented Friday will only impact projects that have gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) lengthy approval process and are ripe for DOE approval.
According to federal data updated this week, there are 11 projects that have been green-lit by FERC but are not yet under construction. An additional four projects are pending before FERC and two are in the pre-filing stage. Those six projects wouldn't be impacted by the pause since they are not before DOE yet, but they would be impacted if approved by FERC.
BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION
""From day one, we have looked out for frontline communities from day one,"" White House climate czar Ali Zaidi said. ""From day one, we have stood with our allies and partners. That's how Joe Biden leads on climate change. And when it comes to the climate crisis, we square our shoulders, we take on the challenge in front of us, we lean into the solutions and, yes, we transition globally away from fossil fuels. That is the solution, that is the strategy that the president has articulated.""
""As the department steps forward in this way under Secretary Granholm's leadership, I think it's important to note the context in which this happens,"" Zaidi added. ""We're doing this weeks removed from a U.N. climate conference where the United States, under President Biden's leadership, was out front making sure that the global community was clear-eyed about the need to transition globally away from fossil fuels.""

LNG export terminals have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who argue they would create harmful pollution and contribute to global warming. The issue has led to activists posting videos on social media which, over the last two months, have generated tens of millions of views.
Additionally, in December, dozens of environmental groups wrote to Granholm, imploring her to reject the LNG development ""for the sake of our climate and communities."" Days later, 170 scientists penned a letter to President Biden, asking him to reject pending LNG facilities.
ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST
Climate activist Bill McKibben recently announced he was organizing a civil disobedience protest outside the DOE's headquarters in Washington, D.C., over the permitting of new LNG export terminals. He said the action would mimic the protests that helped nationalize the Keystone XL pipeline fight during the Obama administration.
But proponents of additional LNG export facilities say the projects are vital to help meet energy demand in Europe and Asia as nations look to wean off Russian natural gas supplies. In the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Biden traveled to Europe and struck a deal with the European Union, vowing to send more U.S. LNG to the bloc.

""I think they're really making a miscalculation here. This isn't just bad policy, it's bad politics,"" former FERC Chair Neil Chatterjee told Fox News Digital. ""We made a commitment to our European allies, to Germany, that we would be there and help them. You really should not be playing politics with energy security.""
""What's really frustrating from the environmental perspective is that U.S. LNG actually displaces more intense fossil sources of fuel overseas,"" Chatterjee said. ""We have a much cleaner process than the Russians do. So, not only are we providing geopolitical assets to our allies, but U.S. LNG displacing dirtier sources of fuels actually lowers global carbon emissions. And the activists seem to be just kind of brushing over that.""
BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS
This month, energy associations Eurogas and the Asia Natural Gas & Energy Association (ANGEA) issued strong statements of support for continued permitting of U.S. LNG export terminals. Eurogas reiterated such exports were critical for ensuring the full phase down of Europe's dependence on Russian natural gas, while ANGEA added U.S. LNG is needed to meet Asia's decarbonization goals.
The German state-owned energy company Securing Energy for Europe said in a recent letter to Granholm that U.S. LNG is ""vital for Germany's energy security."" That company has already entered into a purchase agreement with at least one proposed LNG export terminal project in Louisiana.

""This would be a win for Russia and a loss for American allies, U.S. jobs and global climate progress,"" American Petroleum Institute (API) CEO Mike Sommers said after reports of the actions emerged Wednesday.
""There is no review needed to understand the clear benefits of U.S. LNG for stabilizing global energy markets, supporting thousands of American jobs and reducing emissions around the world by transitioning countries toward cleaner fuels,"" Sommers continued. ""This is nothing more than a broken promise to U.S. allies, and it’s time for the administration to stop playing politics with global energy security.""

API joined a letter to Granholm alongside dozens of other fossil fuel industry associations on Wednesday, calling for the energy secretary to allow LNG export permitting to continue apace. They wrote that LNG exports ""insulate American consumers from increasing global instability while advancing American national interests and ensuring the energy security of key U.S. allies.""
In addition, proponents of increased LNG exports have noted that transitioning the world's economy to more natural gas reliance would also help ensure nations meet decarbonization goals. Without increased LNG, they argue, nations would rely more heavily on coal-fired power generation, which has a much larger carbon footprint when burned than natural gas power generation.
The industry letter to Granholm noted that the U.S. has led the world in carbon emissions reductions thanks in large part to greater reliance on natural gas. Coal produced the largest share of electricity generated in the U.S. for decades until 2015, when natural gas surpassed it.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday proposed an $8.6 billion budget for fiscal year 2025 and, as he has done before, urged lawmakers not to raise taxes or fees for Vermonters, saying it will be a tough budget year.
The budget proposal makes investments in the priorities the governor focused on earlier this month in his state-of-the-state address: affordability, public safety and housing.
""I also understand the realities of a supermajority, which means you don’t have to listen, or even consider, my priorities or objections,"" he told lawmakers assembled in the House chamber for his budget address. ""But I bet many of you do hear, and maybe even share, some of my concerns. More importantly, I’m pretty sure the majority of our constituents certainly do.""

Last year, Scott vetoed the $8.5 billion budget bill that was largest spending plan in state history. But the Democratic-controlled legislature overrode his veto.
He said Tuesday that he doesn't believe there will be a lot of disagreement about what is in his budget plan but likely in what is not included. Federal pandemic-era funds have ended, and the state has returned to pre-pandemic spending levels, he warned. While the state had a recent increase in revenues, it has had unexpected costs, too, he said.,

House Speaker Jill Krowinski, a Democrat, said Vermont has challenges, but it also has opportunities. ""I think his speech was long on fear and short on hope,"" she told WCAX-TV.
Among the investments are $4.9 million of the opioid settlement funds to increase the amount of staff and hours in three or more hubs for drug treatment and to support the work of re-entry and recovery centers for those leaving incarceration, according to the budget summary. He also suggests investing $1.7 million for 20 mental health workers in state police barracks and $6 million in a program that provides grants to improve vacant rental housing units and add housing units to existing buildings.
After catastrophic flooding hit Vermont in July, Scott proposes using $12.5 million to help communities with their state match requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance to mitigate flood hazards and $500,000 for a state match for federal funding to evaluate future flood measures for the Winooski River."

John Kennedy asked her to define basic terms for orders issued regularly by judges.
FIRST ON FOX — A group of House Republicans are urging President Biden to withdraw a controversial nominee who has ties to 9/11 hijacker sympathizers.
In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital, a group of 10 GOP members who represent districts over which the Third Circuit Court of Appeals presides wrote to the president about judicial nominee Adeel Abdullah Mangi, who has garnered significant criticism from lawmakers for troubling affiliations.
The ""grave concerns"" raised by Chief Deputy Whip Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., and nine of his colleagues from Pennsylvania and New Jersey stem from 2019 to 2023, when Mangi served as a member of the board of advisers for the Center for Security, Race, and Rights at Rutgers Law School.
The center has a ""deep history of amplifying antisemitic speech, terrorist propaganda, and anti-American rhetoric,"" the lawmakers said in the letter.

""During his tenure as a board member, the Center supported efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel by pushing for the boycott, divestment, and sanction (BDS) movement and calling for resistance in Palestine,"" they wrote.
""In 2021, the CEO of the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey stated that one of the Center’s events sought to ‘delegitimize Israel and to push their antisemitic agenda into a mainstream discourse.’ The Jewish News Center, among other organizations, labeled a 2021 center event as ‘pro-Hamas’ and a ‘terrorist-whitewashing webinar.’""
The Coalition for Jewish Values, the Zionist Organization of America, Americans Against Antisemitism and others have thus opposed his nomination.
Additionally, the center has a record of sympathizing with radical terrorist organizations, the lawmakers said.

On the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the center sponsored an event titled ""Whose Narrative? 20 Years since September 11, 2001."" The event, which sought to challenge the ""exceptionalization"" of the attacks, included speakers with ties to terrorist organizations, according to the lawmakers.
The Republicans informed the president that Sami Al-Arian, a convicted felon who provided support to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), was a featured speaker. At the event, Al-Arian blamed the 9/11 attack on the United States and its support for Israel.
""As your Administration is aware, PIJ is a foreign terrorist organization and was involved in the atrocities committed against Israel on October 7, 2023,"" they wrote.
WHO ARE SOME OF THE BIDEN-APPOINTED JUDGES THE SENATE JUST CONFIRMED?

The lawmakers go on to argue that ""while Mr. Mangi’s affiliation and financial support for the Center is cause for alarm, we also find it deeply troubling that he has failed to denounce the Center and its radical ideology.""
""On numerous occasions in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Mangi was given ample opportunity to denounce examples of antisemitic rhetoric espoused by the Center,"" they said.
""He failed to do so in his written responses and oral testimony to the committee every single time.""
Mangi advanced out of the committee on an 11-10 party-line vote. His nomination now proceeds to the full Senate for a vote.
Mangi, a New Jersey resident and partner at the law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, has been praised by Democrats for possibly being the nation’s first Muslim-American federal appellate judge.

""Mangi is a standout figure in New Jersey’s legal landscape. It speaks volumes that his exceptional legal abilities are only exceeded by his character and unwavering commitment to fairness in the administration of justice,"" Democrat Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital that ""President Biden is deeply proud"" to have nominated Mangi, calling him ""an indisputably qualified and experienced attorney who has lived the American dream and is devoted to our Constitution and the rule of law.""
He called the Republicans' criticisms ""vile, unconscionable smears"", noting that they have ""been discredited by the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and the American Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, among many others.""
Bates accused the GOP lawmakers of applying a ""religious litmus test,"" targeting Mangi for his Muslim faith – which, he noted, the Constitution ""forbids.""

A government inquiry into the deaths of four divers in Trinidad who became trapped in a pipe while doing maintenance for a state-owned fuel supplier recommends that prosecutors consider filing corporate manslaughter charges against the company, saying it made ""little or no attempt to rescue"" them.
The commission of inquiry report criticizes Paria Fuel Trading Company's response to the deaths in February 2022, which angered many in the eastern Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. A fifth diver who survived recounted the ordeal to the commission.
The report accuses the company of preventing a contractor from sending commercial divers to rescue those stuck and of spending several hours searching open waters despite knowing the divers could be inside the 30-inch (76-centimeter) pipe. It says Paria delayed in seeking cameras as part of the operation and did not consult with commercial divers on site.

""Paria made little or no attempt to rescue in that they failed to manage and coordinate the resources that were available,"" the report says. ""The opportunity to rescue the men from the pipe was completely wasted by a degree of inertia that is difficult to comprehend.""
The commission of inquiry says it found ""that there are sufficient grounds to conclude that Paria’s negligence could be characterized as gross negligence and consequently criminal.""
Four divers in Trinidad were trapped and lost their lives while doing maintenance for a state-owned fuel supplier. A government inquiry into the divers' deaths recommends that prosecutors file corporate manslaughter charges against the company.
Paria did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The report was presented to Trinidad and Tobago’s Parliament on Friday.
The Trinidad & Tobago Guardian newspaper quoted a Paria spokeswoman on Sunday as saying the company would not be commenting. The newspaper also quoted legal experts noting that a corporate manslaughter charge equals a fine and no jail time.

Saddam Hosein, an opposition member in Parliament, told a press conference Sunday that the government must individually prosecute Paria officials and compensate the sole survivor, given the report’s details.

Abbott is currently fighting multiple legal battles with the Biden administration. The federal government has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, while lawsuits are ongoing over the administration’s cutting of razor wire set up by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.

The Supreme Court this week found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas along the border. Texas this week published images of it strengthening physical barriers along Eagle Pass.
The administration has also sued over a recently signed law that allows Texas state and local officials to arrest illegal immigrants. The administration has accused Texas of interfering with federal control over immigration and border security, and has said it is putting agents and migrants in danger.

Abbott, however, cited constitutional language that demands the federal government ""protect each [State] against invasion"" and the right of states to protect their own borders.
Abbott argues that ""the failure of the Biden administration"" to fulfill those duties triggers a clause in Article 1 that ""reserves to this State the right of self-defense."" He notes he has already declared an ""invasion"" to invoke the authority, which he calls ""the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary.""

""The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the States,"" Abbott said in a statement this week. ""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now. President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""
Over the past few days, over a dozen Republican governors have issued statements saying that they will back Abbott in his dispute with Biden.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Thousands of artworks were destroyed in a fire that swept through the main art gallery in Abkhazia, reports said, a severe blow to the cultural heritage of the separatist Georgian region.
The blaze swept through the Central Exhibition Hall on Sunday in the city of Sukhumi, where the gallery was located on the second floor of a building. The cause of the fire has not been determined.

The gallery's estimated 4,000 artworks were mostly stored in poor conditions, unprotected and jammed into small rooms and narrow halls, according to the news website Abkhaz World.
That treatment of the region's artwork ""painfully mirrors our country, plagued by criminal neglect and abandonment,"" commentator Roin Agrba wrote on Abkhaz World.
A fire at Abkhazia's National Art Gallery has devastated the breakaway region's cultural heritage.
The fire brought an ""irreparable loss for the cultural heritage of our state,"" the regional parliament said in a statement.
The gallery had held much of the work of Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze, noted for his production designs of operas and shows at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, and elsewhere.

Abkhazia, a region of steep mountains about the size of Cyprus along the Black Sea coast, came mostly under the control of separatists in 1993 after intense fighting. Georgia held a small portion of Abkhazia's interior until the 2008 Russia-Georgia war.
Russia now stations thousands of troops in Abkhazia and recognizes it as an independent country. Nicaragua, Nauru, Venezuela and Syria also recognize Abkhazia's independence but other countries regard it as a part of Georgia."

KJQMO8X9JY_ZFSQI8LWO03WJZJ,Scams are the policy problem no one is talking about,Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 2:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/scams-policy-problem-no-one-talking-about,"Yaron Litwin, executive of AI-powered company Canopy, explains how ""AI can be used for good"" in an ongoing chess match with criminals using deepfakes in sextortion scams.
Eight percent of U.S. adults – or 21 million Americans – were scammed in the past year, according to a recent survey by Gallup. To put this number in context, 21 million is roughly equivalent to the entire population of the state of Florida. Each year!
A recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report estimated that fraud losses are between $21 billion to $137 billion annually, and the report says the lower figure is ""very conservative.""
If fraud does account for $137 billion annually, that would exceed the annual revenue of such corporations as Verizon, Comcast, Met or Target. It would also exceed the total annual budget of the Department of Homeland Security, which was $134 billion in 2023.
The poll found that 57% of Americans worry about being scammed, making it the second-highest crime concern in America. (iStock)
A recent AARP poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe that scams have reached a ""crisis level.""
SCAMMERS USE SOPHISTICATED NEW TECHNOLOGY TO TERRORIZE CALIFORNIA FAMILY: ‘WHERE IS MY SON?’
Clearly, scams are a problem of immense proportion. They affect Americans throughout the socio-economic chain, often disproportionally impacting those without college degrees and whose annual household incomes are below $50,000, according to Gallup.
The Gallup poll also found that 57% of Americans worry about being scammed, which makes it the second-highest crime concern in America, trailing only identity theft.
And keep in mind that scams are a public health problem in addition to a financial crime – victims often experience significant emotional and health issues in the aftermath of a scam.
Scammers are using more sophisticated technology and the targets are becoming more diverse. Four types of scams stand out above the rest, according to FBI data: investment, tech support/call center, business email compromise, and confidence/romance fraud. Scams in each of these areas are on the rise and have different targets.

The rise of cryptocurrency has led to a significant increase in investment scams, which are now the costliest scams reported to the FBI.
Tech support and ""call center"" scams are among the most effective at targeting the elderly and are principally perpetrated by organized crime gangs in India, according to the FBI.
Business email compromise is rampant in small and medium-size businesses.
Confidence/romance scams are also rising, like the ""grandparent scam"" in which a scammer impersonates a loved one in trouble.
DON'T FALL FOR THAT DECEPTIVE EMAIL ASKING FOR YOUR HELP
The FBI reports a growing wave of ""sextortion,"" where scammers posing as teen girls ask boys for nude photos, and then demand money and threaten to share the boy’s photos with his social-media followers if he doesn’t pay. U.S. officials say the criminals behind these scams are based in Nigeria. Indeed, most scams against U.S. citizens are perpetrated by foreign organized crime gangs.
Even as foreign scam attacks on Americans skyrocket, state and federal authorities have not yet created a plan to address this significant policy issue.
Meanwhile, the British government announced a major fraud initiative in May 2023. And the U.K. recently signed the world’s first ""Online Fraud Charter"" with 12 of the world’s largest technology companies, who agreed to voluntarily undertake 39 actions to combat fraud, including blocking, reporting, increased enforcement, and other measures to combat internet-based fraud.

The British approach involves public-private cooperation, and also an all-of-government coordinated effort to address the issue. The United States should adopt a similar model and establish an interagency working group – directed by the White House – that focuses on combating fraud. The government should establish clear authorities and metrics.
Additionally, Congress should authorize a federal advisory commission to work with industry partners to build a U.S. version of the British strategy.
The U.S. government’s response to scams needs to be a top issue in 2024. If scams continue to go unaddressed, it is likely that the wave of fraud – turbocharged by artificial intelligence – will continue to grow out of control. If we don’t act soon, more and more lives will be ruined.

KKKA8851Y0_MBUKWEL195DTIBO,Georgia Senate advances bill to define antisemitism in state law,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 7:29am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-senate-advances-bill-define-antisemitism-state-law,"Willis is accused of having an ""improper"" romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.
A bill to define antisemitism in Georgia law stalled in 2023 over how it should be worded. But a revised version won unanimous endorsement from a key Senate committee Monday, backed by Republican support for Israel in its war with Hamas and a surge in reported bias incidents against Jewish people in the state.
""I think the whole world saw what happened on Oct. 7 and the fallout to Jewish communities around the world,"" said Democratic state Rep. Esther Panitch of Sandy Springs, the only Jewish member of Georgia’s legislature. She is a co-sponsor of the measure that won the support of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
But fears of opponents who say House Bill 30 would be used as a shield to block criticism of Israeli war crimes against Palestinians are stronger than ever, showing how what was already a fraught topic in early 2023 has become downright raw with the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanting ""Free Free Palestine!"" were dragged from the committee room by police officers after the vote. Other opposition witnesses told lawmakers they were privileging political support for Israel.
GEORGIA LAWMAKERS WILL TURN ATTENTION TO ANTISEMITISM, ELECTIONS AS 2024 REGULAR SESSION BEGINS
""What it does do is weaponize attacks and hatred against my community and to silence Palestinian and Muslim Georgians, making threats against me somehow more important than threats against my own neighbors and implying that my safety can only come at their expense,"" said Marissa Pyle, who said she is Jewish. ""Making other people less safe does not help me.""

The bill already passed the House last year and Monday's vote signals the measure is likely to pass the state Senate and be signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp. The Republican governor has previously said he supports the measure.
The committee also advanced Senate Bill 359 on a split vote. The measure attempts to target the distribution of antisemitic flyers in residential neighborhoods by adding littering, illegal sign placement, loitering, misdemeanor terroristic threats, disorderly conduct and harassing communications to the list of crimes that draw enhanced sentences under Georgia's hate crimes law. The law would also make any two crimes subject to Georgia's hate crimes law eligible for prosecution under the state's expansive anti-racketeering statute.
In at least eight states nationwide, lawmakers are working on measures to define antisemitism, part of an upsurge of legislation motivated in part by the Israel-Hamas war. Arkansas passed such a law last year, and like in Georgia, a South Carolina measure passed one chamber in 2023. New bills are pending this year in Indiana, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and South Dakota.
Sponsors say a definition would help prosecutors and other officials identify hate crimes and illegal discrimination targeting Jewish people. But some critics warn it would limit free speech, especially in criticizing the actions of Israel. Others don’t oppose a law, but object to the measure defining antisemitism by referring to a definition adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
""When can we anticipate the legislature moving forward on a bill that addresses Islamophobia?"" said Asim Javed of the Georgia Muslim Voter Project. Javed added that the bill ""stifles our First Amendment rights by censoring any criticisms of Israel.""
GEORGIA ANTISEMITISM BILL LIVES AGAIN AFTER NEW VOTE
But the warnings of free speech harms by the opponents were met by personal stories of harms suffered by the supporters, including Rabbi Elizabeth Baher of Macon's Temple Beth Israel. She recounted how an antisemitic group hung a Jew in effigy outside the synagogue as worshipers were arriving for services in June.
""We the people of Georgia stand united against bigotry and discrimination. Our diverse tapestry is woven with threads of resilience, understanding and mutual respect,"" Baher said.
Also among those who testified was David Lubin. He's the father of Rose Lubin, who grew up in suburban Atlanta but moved to Israel, becoming a staff sergeant in the Israeli army before she was stabbed to death in Jerusalem on Nov. 6. Lubin said that when her daughter was a student at suburban Atlanta's Dunwoody High School, she reported a student making antisemitic remarks and making ""Heil Hitler"" salutes.
""We need laws in place to deter the threat and convict those who commit the actions of hatred,"" David Lubin said."

Ron DeSantis suspends his 2024 Presidential campaign after a disappointing Iowa performance and endorses former President Donald Trump. CREDIT: DeSantis Campaign
MANCHESTER, N.H. – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign peaked before it even started.
A year ago, DeSantis was still basking in the glow of his convincing gubernatorial re-election victory in Florida and was the clear alternative to former President Trump in the burgeoning Republican White House race.
The former president was still facing plenty of criticism by fellow Republicans for contributing to the GOP's lackluster performance in the 2022 midterms.
Additionally, Trump's 2024 presidential campaign launch at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, a couple of weeks after the midterms was panned by many pundits.

DeSantis was neck and neck with Trump in a slew of national and early state polls, but as winter turned to spring, the Florida governor came under repeated verbal assault by the former president and his allies.
DeSantis was already bruised by the time he formally launched his campaign, an announcement on social media that was mired with technical difficulties – marking the first of many bad omens for the popular governor.
RON DESANTIS ENDORSES DONALD TRUMP AS HE DROPS OUT OF THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
The governor faced an onslaught of negative ads from the Trump world during late spring into summer.
Veteran New Hampshire-based Republican strategist Michael Dennehy, who served on multiple presidential campaigns, argued that ""Trump’s barrage of attacks was the beginning of the end of DeSantis.""

DeSantis made headlines over the summer, with a series of campaign staff purges and resets. There were more staff shakeups in the fall, this time at the DeSantis-aligned super PAC Never Back Down, which had taken over many of the traditional duties of a presidential campaign, including grassroots outreach.
Longtime Republican consultant Alex Castellanos, a veteran of half-a-dozen presidential campaigns, noted that DeSantis ""ran a mechanical campaign and failed on two mechanical fronts.""
""He wasted bazillions on door knocking when you don’t build a brand going door to door. And two – he’s a mechanical candidate who you don’t want at your door. You need to be a people person to run for public office,"" he argued.
Dennehy agreed, charging that DeSantis ""just didn’t have the charisma to connect with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.""

Jim Merrilll, another longtime New Hampshire-based Republican strategist and presidential campaign veteran, said that the DeSantis ""withdrawal is also a reminder of a simple rule - voters need to first like and connect with candidates before they can support them.""
Merrill added that ""DeSantis is an excellent governor whose national campaign time and again failed to put him in a position to succeed.""

Castellanos stressed that ""the biggest thing that hurt him is that Republican voters aren’t looking for an alternative to Donald Trump. Donald Trump is their incumbent president.""
Dan Eberhart, a top DeSantis donor, bundler and surrogate, told Fox News Digital that ""Ron DeSantis ran into a bump and the bump was named Trump.""
""This wasn’t about money. The campaign insists they had enough money to get to Super Tuesday. I think this was about data and polling and Gov. DeSantis being realistic about whether or not Trump was beatable,"" Eberhart said.
He added: ""more importantly, I think this was about 2028, and DeSantis doesn’t want a 5% to 8% showing in New Hampshire on his record. Let’s face it, he’s the Republican voters' de facto second choice, and he’s Trump voters’ second choice, and so he’s decided to get out and govern Florida.""

The latest public opinion polls in New Hampshire indicate Trump holding on to a double-digit lead over Haley with hours to go until Primary Day.
Merrill said that DeSantis' departure from the race ""narrows Haley's margin for error here. Many, if not most, of DeSantis voters are going to migrate over to Trump. And so it’s critical for her to do well in New Hampshire to give her some momentum heading into South Carolina.""
But he added that ""clearly the consolidation of the field over the last week indicates that there’s increasing pressure to bring the primary process to a close.""
Dennehy was more blunt.
""I think it puts a nail in her coffin,"" he said of Haley. ""I don’t think she’ll be able to keep under 50%. And I think there’s a very good chance that Trump hits 60% on Tuesday, which will signal the end of the Haley campaign and virtually seal the deal for the Trump nomination.""

Authorities in Virginia announced on Monday the arrest of a man accused of fatally stabbing his estranged wife three decades ago after being on the run for years.
The Fairfax County Police Department said Jose Cruz was wanted for the murder of Ana Jurado, 24, on April 30, 1991. At the time of the killing, the pair were married but were in the process of getting a divorce.
At the time of her death, Jurado was a mother to three children, police said.
""This really isn't a traditional cold case,"" Police Chief Kevin Davis told reporters. ""It was solved virtually right away. He was on the lam. He was on the run. He avoided accountability for something he did nearly 33 years ago.""
MISSISSIPPI MOTHER CONVICTED OF MURDER IN 1995 CHARGED WITH KILLING HER SON, HIDING BODY IN FALSE WALL
Police officers found Jurado on the side of a road in Falls Church when a neighbor called 911 after hearing a scream, authorities said. She died from ""upper body trauma,"" police said.
An arrest warrant was issued for Cruz for first-degree murder. He fled to El Salvador, where he lived for three decades, police said. Cruz was detained in 2022 while traveling from Nicaragua to Costa Rica and was extradited last week to the United States.

Investigators traveled to El Salvador in 1999 to get a lead on Cruz's whereabouts but nothing materialized at that time.
Before fleeing to El Salvador, Cruz attempted to cross into Canada but was denied entry because he was using fraudulent identification, police said. Canadian border agents noticed he had fresh cuts on his hand, they said.
Cruz then took a bus to Houston where he illegally crossed into Mexico, authorities said. From there, he ended up in El Salvador. At the time, the Central American nation didn't have an extradition ""mechanism"" in place, police said.

Investigators said Cruz was working as a truck driver in El Salvador and re-married and fathered several children.

U.S. Central Command says Iranian-backed Houthi militants fired a ballistic missile toward the USS Carney in the Gulf of Aden on Friday.
The projectile was ""successfully shot down"" by the American destroyer and there were no reports of injuries, according to CENTCOM.
The attack is the 37th by the Houthis directed at commercial vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Nov. 19.
For weeks, the Yemeni terrorist group's actions have been disrupting maritime traffic, while the U.S. military has been responding with strikes.

The USS Carney previously shot down three Houthi drones headed in its direction in early December.
Friday's attack comes after White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that two ships were targeted by the Houthis on Wednesday.

One of the ships targeted Wednesday was identified as the U.S. flagged and U.S. owned M/V Maersk Detroit Commercial Container ship, a U.S. defense official told Fox News. The missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — An unprecedented surge in gang violence is plaguing Haiti, with the number of victims killed, injured and kidnapped more than doubling last year, the U.N. special envoy for the conflict-wracked Caribbean nation said Thursday.
In a grim briefing, Maria Isabel Salvador told the U.N. Security Council, ""I cannot overstress the severity of the situation in Haiti, where multiple protracted crises have reached a critical point.""
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP URGES INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO HELP STOP GANG VIOLENCE IN HAITI
She said the 8,400 victims of gang violence documented by her U.N. office last year — a 122% rise from 2022 — were mainly targeted by gangs in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Some 300 gangs control an estimated 80% of the capital, and accounted for 83% of last year's killings and injuries, Salvador said. But, she added, their tentacles have reached northward into the Artibonite region, considered Haiti’s food basket, and south of the capital ""gangs conducted large-scale attacks to control key zones,"" systematically using sexual violence to exert control.
The briefing came more than three months after the Security Council approved the deployment of a multinational armed force led by Kenya to help bring gang violence under control.
Haiti is teetering on the brink of anarchy as gangs control increasing amounts of territory in the troubled Caribbean nation.
But the deployment of Kenyan security officers has faced a series of hurdles. It finally got a green light from Kenya's parliament. And Kenya’s U.N. ambassador, Martin Kimani, told the council a court verdict in a case brought by an individual seeking to block the deployment would be announced Friday.
If the court allows the deployment, Kenyan authorities told The Associated Press last month that the first group of about 300 officers was expected to arrive in Haiti by February. Kenya’s contribution would eventually rise to 1,000 officers at the head of a 3,000-strong multinational force. Burundi, Chad, Senegal, Jamaica and Belize have pledged troops for the multinational mission.
Haiti’s National Police are no match for the gangs. Less than 10,000 officers are on duty at any time in a country of more than 11 million people. Ideally, there should be some 25,000 active officers, according to the U.N.
Salvador told the council that although 795 new recruits will join the force in March, about 1,600 police officers left the force in 2023, according to data gathered by her office, further diminishing the Haitian police’s ability to counter gang violence and maintain security.
Haitian Foreign Minister Jean Victor Génus said the country stands ""at a decisive crossroads on which the hopes for Haiti’s future are pinned.""
""The Haitian people have had enough of the armed gangs savagery,"" he said, adding that the gangs have stepped up their activities, perhaps concerned that the multinational mission is going to arrive any day.
""Every passing day that this long-awaited support has not yet arrived is one day too many — one day too many that we’re being subjected to the hell imposed on us by the gangs,"" Génus said. ""Given that time is of the essence, we would like to see a swift and effective deployment.""

Kenya’s ambassador said the government has made ""significant progress"" preparing for the deployment, while awaiting the court decision, including making assessment missions to Haiti.
Kenya is preparing for a planning conference with other police contributing countries in mid-February, Kimani said, and it is engaging with partners to prepare a pledging conference to mobilize funds for the mission."
L38D8ANCKP_J8XP2BT70KBL3BT,Jersey Shore town's beaches threatened as winter storm devastates sand dunes,Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 7:14am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/jersey-shore-towns-beaches-threatened-winter-storm-devastates-sand-dunes,"The 'Outnumbered' co-hosts react to the new cross-shaped pier in Ocean Grove, N.J.
A New Jersey shore town locked in a legal battle with the state over tens of millions of dollars it has spent trying -- mostly in vain -- to hold back the ocean now is more vulnerable than ever.
A recent winter storm destroyed part of the sand dunes in North Wildwood, leaving tiny piles about the size of a child’s sand castle to protect a popular resort town with $2.5 billion worth of private property, and at least that much in government buildings and infrastructure.
New Jersey has fined the town $12 million for unauthorized beach repairs that it says could worsen erosion, while the city is suing to recoup the $30 million it has spent trucking sand to the site for over a decade.
DECRIMINALIZATION OF MARIJUANA USE HAS UNINTENDED EFFECT ON JERSEY SHORE TOWNS
While they wait for a judge to sort things out amid climate change that brings rising sea levels and more intense storms, North Wildwood’s plight is a stark reminder that in the man vs. nature battle, in the long run, nature usually wins.
Mayor Patrick Rosenello points to a destroyed section of sand dune in North Wildwood N.J. on Jan. 22, 2024. A recent winter storm punched a hole through what is left of the city's eroded dune system, leaving it vulnerable to destructive flooding. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry)
""This is the most vulnerable we have ever been,"" Mayor Patrick Rosenello said. ""It doesn't even take a storm anymore to threaten us. On most regular high tides, the water comes up and through where this dune used to be.""
He walked along the beach where the surging surf punched a hole in the dunes, completely obliterating them for about 20 feet (6 meters). On either side, all that remained were sand piles that barely reached his knees. Elsewhere along the beachfront, dunes that had been about 18 feet (5.5 meters) high last summer were less than half that height — and much lower than that in numerous places.
Previously, the city said it has spent $21 million trucking in sand for emergency repairs to its beaches. That has since risen to $30 million, Rosenello said.
But trucking in sand is no longer an option, the mayor said, adding that erosion has created choke points along the beach that are too narrow to let dump trucks pass.
North Wildwood has asked the state for emergency permission to build a steel bulkhead along the most heavily eroded section of its beachfront — something previously done in two other spots.
But the state Department of Environmental Protection has tended to oppose bulkheads as a long-term solution, noting that the hard structures often encourage sand scouring against them that can accelerate and worsen erosion.
The agency prefers the sort of beach replenishment projects carried out for decades by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, where massive amounts of sand are pumped from offshore onto eroded beaches, widening them and creating sand dunes to protect the property behind them.
Virtually the entire 127-mile New Jersey coastline has received such projects. But in North Wildwood, legal approvals and property easements from private landowners have thus far prevented one from happening.
Although the last two towns required to sign off on a sand replenishment project did so 11 months ago, the project still needs a final go-ahead. When it gets that, the work will probably take two years to complete, officials say.
On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs, including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey's environment protection commissioner, warned the town last July that unauthorized work could have more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of future shore protection funding.
LaTourette wrote that the city ""has repeatedly engaged in destructive and illegal conduct in the name of tourism and, supposedly, public safety. This is wrongheaded and it must stop.""
The Department of Environmental Protection says heavy equipment moving sand around has weakened and reduced the height of the dunes, actually making things worse while destroying natural plants and animal habitat.
But North Wildwood sees itself as facing an existential threat with an unprotected coastline.
""Our fear is that there will be no more Wildwood,"" said Maureen Lipert, who was out for a walk along the beach Monday. ""All of North Wildwood could be wiped out if the water keeps coming over.""
""The water is going to hit our hotels and motels,"" added another resident, Kim Milligan. ""There's new homes being built here every day. Our homes are going to be ruined.""
MYSTERIOUS TAR BALLS WASH UP ON NEW JERSEY BEACHES
After Superstorm Sandy devastated the Jersey Shore in 2012, the Army Corps began a program to rebuild dunes along virtually the entire coastline. Numerous scientific studies found that oceanfront communities with dunes already protecting them fared much better during Sandy than those that did not.
Sand replenishment has been the government's go-to method of shore protection for decades. Critics say it's inherently wasteful to keep pumping sand ashore that will inevitably wash away. But Congress keeps appropriating money for such work, arguing it is effective in protecting lives and property, not to mention sustaining the crucial tourism industry.
Milligan, who lives several blocks inland from the ocean, only half-jokingly found a potential silver lining if the worst comes to pass in North Wildwood.
""I'll have beachfront access,"" she said."

An 85-year-old woman in Texas will soon be reunited with her bridal photos that were snapped more than 60 years ago, thanks to social media.
The pictures were spotted at an auction by Lynchburg, Virginia, resident Sandra Poindexter, according to FOX Television Stations. Originally on the hunt for vintage picture frames, Poindexter was intrigued by the photos and flipped them over to find out any information about the pictures.
Poindexter saw a piece of masking tape with the name ""Harriet Galbraith"" written on the back. She soon posted about the find in a Facebook group, where a user was able to track down Galbraith.

""I thought, well, maybe a family member would like to have these,"" Poindexter told FOX Television Stations. ""I certainly would like to have them if it was of my family member, and they were just so beautiful.""

Galbraith, a San Antonio resident, had sent the glamorous bridal portraits to her mother in 1959, shortly after her wedding.
She wore a Christian Dior gown and elegant elbow-length gloves in the pictures. Galbraith said the shots were taken by Washington, D.C., photographer Bradford Bachrach shortly after she was engaged.
The octogenarian married William Galbraith Jr., who worked as an undercover CIA agent. He died in 2016.

""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro awkwardly cheered and celebrated on Monday over Gov. Ron DeSantis', R-Fla., decision to drop out of the GOP presidential primary.
Navarro, a Florida resident and Republican who openly detests Florida and Republicans, said when she first heard the news, she celebrated by throwing her hands in the air and cheering. Some in the audience chuckled but Navarro quickly regained her composure after her outburst got the muted response.
""But then I calmed down,"" she said after her cheers. ""Yes, he was doomed from the start, he was the most overblown candidate I've ever seen in my lifetime. He won in Florida by 20 points, but he won because he really used every weapon of the incumbency to give himself an advantage.""
The liberal leaning Navarro claimed DeSantis ""suppressed the Black vote"" in his landslide victory.

Navarro also blamed his 2022 victory in Florida on his Democratic competition, Charlie Christ, who Navarro said was the ""worst Democrat nominee"" in her lifetime.
""My dog could have beaten Charlie Crist,"" she said.
Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, who announced her support for GOP candidate Nikki Haley, took issue with DeSantis' endorsement of former President Trump.
""There's some sexism we haven't talked about. Ron DeSantis actually intellectually knows Nikki Haley is more qualified and more fit to be the nominee,"" Farah Griffin said. ""He knows Donald Trump is not better than her.""

Griffin also criticized former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who also recently dropped out of the race, for not backing Haley.
""It feels like the boys can't handle losing to women,"" Griffin said.
DeSantis endorsed Trump after announcing his departure from the race.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis said in a video posted to social media. ""They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.""

L71RED6KUE_C29QBXYNLV72I70,Several senior House Republicans still silent on Trump 2024 amid growing pressure for party unity,By Elizabeth Elkind Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/several-senior-house-republicans-still-silent-trump-2024-growing-pressure-party-unity,"Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell provides voter analysis following the GOP New Hampshire primary election on 'The Faulkner Focus.'
Former President Trump’s decisive victory in the New Hampshire primary this week spurred several new endorsements from lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have so far been silent on the race.
Among the most notable pivots was House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., who endorsed Trump over the weekend minutes after his preferred candidate, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, dropped out of the race.
As of Thursday afternoon, Trump has more than 120 House Republican endorsements – the majority of the House GOP Conference and far outpacing former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley’s one backer.
Fox News Digital took a look at some of the senior House Republicans who have yet to weigh in despite mounting calls to unify behind the former president.

Comer has not weighed in on the 2024 presidential primary publicly so far. It’s worth noting his hands have been full on Capitol Hill leading an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s rival, President Biden.
Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., who are also leading the inquiry, have both endorsed Trump.
Fox News Digital reached out to Comer’s office but did not immediately hear back.
HALEY AND PHILLIPS OUTPERFORMED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT IT'S STILL A TRUMP VS BIDEN HORSE RACE
Fitzpatrick, a more moderate member from a Pennsylvania swing district, also hasn’t picked a side in the 2024 primary.
When Trump was indicted in June over his handling of classified documents, Fitzpatrick was one of the few Republicans who did not rush to his defense. The former FBI agent urged people to respect the legal process and not rush to judgment.
""No one is above the law or beyond prosecution,"" he said. ""No one should be targeted for prosecution merely because of their status, position or affiliation.""
Fitzpatrick’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

McMorris Rodgers is seen as one of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s closest allies on Capitol Hill, but unlike Johnson, R-La., she has yet to weigh in on the 2024 presidential primary race. Johnson endorsed Trump late last year.
In December 2019, she was named a state honorary co-chair for Trump’s reelection bid, according to the Spokesman-Review newspaper.
She made clear there was some distance between them after the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, reportedly telling constituents in August 2023 that efforts to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss that day were ""un-American.""
BIDEN CHALLENGER DEAN PHILLIPS BLASTS PRESIDENT AS 'UNELECTABLE AND WEAK' AS BIDEN SET TO SKIP NEW HAMPSHIRE
But she reportedly said, ""I also believe that Donald Trump, or any American, deserves due process.""
Fox News Digital reached out to McMorris Rodgers' campaign for comment.
Roy went into the 2024 presidential primary cycle as one of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ most enthusiastic supporters. But unlike Freedom Caucus Chair Good, Roy has not stepped behind Trump so far in the two-candidate race.
Trump threatened to recruit a primary challenger against Roy, who is popular in his district and running unopposed, for his support of Trump’s former rival.
Roy said on CNN in late December, ""I was just at multiple events with Ron DeSantis, where he’s shaking their hands and looking them in the eye while Donald Trump hangs out in his basement in Florida, afraid to actually debate.""
He said on ""Fox Across America"" on Thursday that Trump is ""likely going to be the nominee"" and called on him to ""stand up in defense of the hardworking American family getting steamrolled by corporate America and by Republicans too weak-kneed to fight for them.""
Roy's office pointed to his earlier comments when reached by Fox News Digital on Thursday afternoon.

South Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is urging people not to eat fried toothpicks made out of starch in what has reportedly become a viral trend.
Videos showing people eating deep-fried toothpicks topped with seasonings such as powdered cheese are generating thousands of likes and shares on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, according to Reuters.
""Starch toothpicks are a hygiene product!"" the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in a post on X. ""The safety of sanitary products is managed according to standards and specifications for ingredients, manufacturing methods, and uses, but their safety as food has not been verified. Do not consume!""
The toothpicks, which are made from sweet potato or corn starch, are given their green color through food coloring and are frequently used in restaurants in South Korea, Reuters reports.

""It's very crispy,"" one TikTok user was quoted by the news agency as saying in a video.
The health warning comes after South Korea's parliament passed a bill earlier this month to ban the breeding and slaughter of dog meat for consumption due to animal welfare concerns, which will bring an end to the country’s centuries-old practice.

The law, which will come into effect in 2027, will ban the breeding, slaughtering and selling of dogs for their meat.
It gained bipartisan backing and is supported by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, an animal lover who owns six dogs and eight cats with First Lady Kim Keon Hee, also a vocal critic of dog meat consumption. The bill was passed by an overwhelming 208 votes with two abstentions in the single-chamber parliament.

A Rwandan official said Thursday that the remains of 119 people believed to be victims of the 1994 genocide have been discovered in the country’s south, as authorities continue to find mass graves nearly three decades after the killings.
The remains of more victims continue to be found because perpetrators of the genocide tried their best to hide possibly incriminating information, Naphtal Ahishakiye, executive secretary of the genocide survivors’ organization Ibuka, told The Associated Press.
In October, authorities first found six bodies under a house that was being built in Huye district. They have since found more bodies there after investigating further, he said.

A progressive activist drew attention on social media after she argued the suffering of Jews isn't ""exceptional"" as she explained her support for Palestinians in light of the Israel-Hamas war.
There have been ""so many similar genocides,"" Nicole Carty told The New York Times Magazine last week. She said at another point that it's ""so weird"" that the Jewish holiday of Passover is solely about ""Jewish subjugation.""
An activist who leads a group pushing for reparations for Black Americans, Carty was leery of the growing movement to unite Jewish and Black progressives in protesting Israel's actions in Gaza since the October 7 Hamas attack.
""The question for White Jews is to what degree the assimilation into whiteness means that you do not disrupt White supremacy and oppression for all of us?"" Carty told NYT Magazine.

Black Americans see their own history of oppression being played out in the Middle East with Palestinians in Gaza, according to Carty, who has also worked with the, far-left, anti-Israel Jewish group IfNotNow.
""The Palestinian experience activates Black trauma,"" she said. While the activist has allied with Jewish groups in the past on racial justice causes, she worries about White Jews' level of commitment to the Palestinian cause.
Carty said pro-Palestinian Jewish allies like IfNotNow rubbed her the wrong way by organizing vigils for victims in the days following the October 7 Hamas attacks.
""My Jewish friends wanted to mourn,"" Carty said. ""That felt right to them. But that didn’t feel right to me. I didn’t go to that action. It didn’t meet the moment. I tried to be compassionate, but we lost time in really speaking out in a politically targeted way against the slaughter of Palestinians that we could all see happening.""

The Jewish group prayed for both Israelis and Palestinians killed, but Carty claimed the incident was part of the Jewish tendency for ""trauma myopia.""
She urged Jews to recognize that their ""history and relation to trauma and dehumanization has been exceptionalized [sic].""
""I’ve been to a lot of Passover celebrations,"" she added, ""and it’s so weird that the story is only of Jewish subjugation, even though subjugation is still so present for other people.""
""Black people still haven’t had their histories honored. We are still gaslit about the impact of slavery and the continued impacts of White supremacy,"" Carty argued.

The activist was hopeful for a ""multiracial democracy"" where ""all people have equal rights and all religions are respected"" in the Middle East and compared the conflict to fights over slavery and Civil Rights in the United States
Carty's remarks on Passover and other topics raised eyebrows on X.
Some critics have pushed back on progressive narratives portraying Israel as a White oppressor in the Middle East as ""wildly inaccurate.""
""The reality is that in Israel you will see Jews who look Black, brown, Asian, African and everything in between,"" Dan Feferman, a former national security adviser to the Israel Defense Ministry, told Fox News Digital.
""The mischaracterization is wildly inaccurate and unfortunately drives animosity in the Middle East and around the world against Israel,"" he added.

Fisher said the officer saw the suspect wielding a knife and stabbing the two people in a bus shelter area outside the Five Points transit station around 11 a.m. Officials said the suspect then charged the officer, who fired his weapon twice and stopped the attack.

LBR8NKC0C0_8UUSMIPPJJ3FPXX,Kentucky House passes 'three-strikes' violent crime bill: 'Reasserting some basic and simple truths',By Elizabeth Pritchett Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 3:09am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-house-passes-three-strikes-violent-crime-bill-reasserting-some-basic-simple-truths,"Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson joined ‘Fox News Sunday’ to discuss his city’s exasperated crime problem as lawmakers attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement.
Kentucky lawmakers advanced a sweeping crime bill that would require tougher sentences for many offenses, including a ""three-strikes"" penalty that would put felons behind bars for life after committing their third violent act.
House Bill 5, whose lead sponsor is Republican Rep. Jared Bauman, passed by a 74-22 vote on Thursday and now heads to the GOP-led Senate.
""With this bill, House Bill 5, we are reasserting some basic and simple truths,"" Bauman said. ""That there is a right and wrong, and that criminals are accountable for their actions, not society. And that society has the right to protect itself from the criminal element.""
While the bill suggests imposing harsher penalties for a handful of crimes from vandalism to attempted murder, the key component is the ""three-strikes"" provision, since it would place those who have committed their third violent felony in jail permanently.

""If someone has committed three violent crimes and they’re incarcerated and can’t get back out, they’re not going to commit another violent crime,"" Rep. John Blanton said. ""That’s a fact.""
Other key elements of the bill include: limiting bail payments by charitable bail organizations, cracking down on fentanyl distribution that results in a death, designating the murder of a first responder in the line of duty as a crime punishable by death, and requiring those convicted of carjacking to serve at least 85% of their sentence before being released on probation or parole.
Early release would also be prevented for offenders who possessed a firearm as a convicted felon or while on probation or parole, or if they knew the firearm was stolen; and tougher sentences would be imposed on adults who use minors as criminal accomplices.

Under the measure, employees and business owners would be offered criminal immunity in cases where they had to use a ""reasonable amount of force"" against thieves or in protection of themselves or the business.
The bill also aims to ban street camping and allows local governments to designate temporary camping locations for those who are homeless.
House Bill 5 would require many offenders to serve out the majority of their sentence before being eligible for parole or probation. (IStock)

House representatives debated the bill for about three hours, according to The Associated Press.
Supporters described it as an overdue policy shift that focuses on holding criminals accountable for their actions, while opponents claimed it would put more people behind bars and cause additional unknown costs.
Opponents also said the bill overreaches and doesn't address what leads people to commit crimes.
""We do have about 20 different bills that have been crammed into one,"" Democratic Rep. Sarah Stalker said. ""Why we’re doing a rinse and repeat of this failed attempt from the ’90s is unclear to me.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The family of a man who died by suicide at a Virginia jail after his antipsychotic medication was discontinued has received a $1.75 million settlement in a civil lawsuit.
Records at U.S. District Court in Alexandria show that the family of Christopher Lapp, who died in 2021 at the Alexandria jail, accepted the settlement offer Thursday from a psychiatrist who worked at the facility and was the target of the suit.
Lapp, who was 62 when he died, was being held at the jail awaiting sentencing on a federal charge for the armed robbery of a Wells Fargo Bank in Great Falls in November 2018. Lapp was bipolar and had a history of mental health problems, and the robbery occurred during what the judge called a manic episode and what his family’s lawyer described as a psychotic break.
VIRGINIA PRISON OFFICIALS TO GRANT EARLY RELEASES TO INMATES FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR FOLLOWING LAWSUIT
He was initially found incompetent to stand trial but was restored to competency after being sent to the federal medical prison in Butner, North Carolina, where he received mental health care.
The settlement includes no admission of guilt or liability, with the psychiatrist's lawyers arguing that Lapp refused medication voluntarily.
Lapp then decided to plead guilty to the bank robbery charge. Judge, T.S. Ellis III accepted the plea but ordered that Lapp be returned to Butner while he awaited sentencing so he could continue treatment.
But Butner refused to take him back, saying it had a policy against accepting an inmate who had not yet been sentenced for ""continuity of care purposes.""
Lapp remained at the Alexandria jail, and the psychiatrist who evaluated him there ended his medications after Lapp insisted he did not need them.
Lapp hanged himself in his cell in May 2021, roughly a month after his plea. In a note left behind for his daughter, he wrote that ""some bad people have been after me for a while.""
A month later Ellis chastised Butner officials during a hearing for disregarding his order. He also accepted a measure of blame himself — Lapp’s lawyer had filed notice to the court in late April that Butner refused to admit his client, but Ellis said he was unaware that Lapp had not been transferred.
VIRGINIA PRISON REFUSES TO RELEASE COMPLAINT RECORDS FOLLOWING 2022 DEATH OF AN INMATE
Last month a different judge dismissed the federal government as a defendant in the civil suit but allowed the case to continue against the jail psychiatrist.
The settlement includes no admission of guilt or liability. In court papers, the psychiatrist's lawyers argued, among other things, that Lapp didn't want to take the antipsychotic medications and he had no ability to force him.
The jail declined to comment Friday.
Lapp was a nuclear physicist who had multiple degrees including a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His father, Ralph Lapp, was a scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project.
He lived in a wealthy Great Falls neighborhood where he owned a $1.3 million home. Prosecutors said in court papers that Lapp had multiple romantic interests, including a Playboy model, and ""he was working to keep his romantic love interests happy with additional money."""

A Texas superintendent doubled down on the district's decision to punish a Black student who wears dreadlocks for violating its dress code even after being faced with litigation.
The superintendent of the Barbers Hill Independent School District, Greg Poole, took out a full-page ad on Jan. 14 in the Houston Chronicle to defend suspending a student for hair that was too long. He said districts with a traditional dress code are safer and achieve higher academic performance.
""We will not lose sight of the main goal — high standards for our students — by bending to political pressure or responding to misinformed media reports. These entities have 'lesser' goals that ultimately harm kids,"" Poole wrote.
One particular part of the ad that garnered outrage was when Poole asserted ""being an American requires conformity.""

Greg Poole faces calls for termination over full-page ad taken out in the Houston Chronicle on Jan. 14, stating, ""Being American requires conformity."" (Fox News Digital)
""Our military academies... maintain a rigorous expectation of dress. They realize being an American requires conformity with the positive benefit of unity, and being a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Poole said.
Obama's former Department of Education secretary, Arne Duncan, responded to the story on X, saying, ""Dear School Board: Please do your job and fire this superintendent.""
The district claims high school student Darryl George's, 18, twisted dreadlocks violate a policy limiting hair length for male students. The district said other students with locs comply with the length policy.
""We have African-American students with hair longer than our dress code permits. They applied, qualified for, and were granted religious exemptions... The criticism from the... media is based upon assumptions that the school district is clinging to outdated values or social norms, but academic excellence never goes out of style,"" Poole said in the ad.
'DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE' HISTORY HOMEWORK SUGGESTS STUDENTS DECLARE 'INDEPENDENCE' FROM THEIR PARENTS
Black student suspended over dreadlocks hairstyle.
The student, on the other hand, said he felt stress and frustration over what he saw as unfair punishment. He argued that the way his hair is styled – tied and twisted on top of his head – should not be considered a violation of the hair length policy.
A trial is set for Feb. 22 to determine whether the district's dress code restrictions violate the CROWN Act. The new Texas law, which took effect in September, prohibits race-based hair discrimination and bars employers and schools from penalizing people because of hair texture or protective hairstyles including Afros, braids, dreadlocks, twists or Bantu knots.
""I'm glad that we are being heard, too. I'm glad that things are moving, and we're getting through this,"" George said about the litigation moving forward.
""I have a son, 18 years old, that wants to go to school, that wants to get his education, and y'all messing with him. Why?"" the student's mother, Darresha George, said.

In an affidavit filed in the case by the plaintiffs, George argued that he was being subjected to ""cruel treatment.""

The mother of a three-year-old girl who died after spending more than 11 hours in the woods in freezing weather has been arrested, authorities in Georgia said.
Uriha Ridge, 35, faces multiple counts of cruelty to children and one count of felony murder, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday.
Deputies responded to the Foxhall Resort before noon on January 16 in reference to a woman and her two children ""allegedly lost in the woods."" Resort employees assisted deputies in finding Ridge and her two children, who were ""soaking wet,"" ages three and seven, in a wooded area far from the resort they were staying at. The mother and children were taken to hospitals, where the three-year-old died due to what investigators believe is exposure to the elements.
""The consumption of illegal drugs is believed to be the root cause of why Uriha Ridge took her two small children into the woods, minimally clothed, in below-freezing temperatures, and in the rain for more than eleven hours,"" the sheriff's office said.

Legislators in racially diverse Puerto Rico have opened a public debate on a bill to explicitly prohibit discrimination against hairstyles such as cornrows and Afros, sparking a heated debate.
Local government officials argue the legislation is unnecessary because federal and local laws already ban such discrimination. But Puerto Rican activists said at a hearing Tuesday that the island’s Afro-Caribbean community still faces discrimination and needs explicit protection when it comes to public services, work, education and housing.
""I’m 23 years old, and I’m tired of this problem,"" said Julia Llanos Bultrón, a teacher who wears cornrows. ""I’m very disappointed with a system that pushes us to change the hair with which we’re born.""
FORMER PUERTO RICO LEGISLATOR FOUND GUILTY ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
Llanos said that a school in the northeast town of Fajardo offered her a job last year on condition that she cut her hair because they didn’t allow locks. She declined.
Similar incidents were recounted by others who spoke at a crowded public hearing held at San Juan’s seaside Capitol building, noting that the hairstyles in question are culturally important and carry historical significance.
More than 1.6 million people in the U.S. territory of 3.2 million identify as being of two or more races, while nearly 230,000 identify solely as Black, according to the U.S. Census.
Lorraine León Ramírez, mother of two sons who have Afros, said her youngest was banned from attending two different schools until he cut his hair.
""It was one of the worst experiences we’ve had as a family,"" she said.
""The big question is, is it fair that our children have to grow up with regulations that undermine their identity? The answer is no,"" she said. ""It’s time to break these stigmas.""

A community in Texas has been grappling with a similar issue even after the state passed a law that went into effect in September to prohibit race-based hair discrimination.
The family of a Black high school student in Belvieu, Texas, is arguing that his suspension since August has been a violation of the new law. The school says that the length of Darryl George’s hair, falling below his eyebrows and ear lobes, violates the school’s dress code.
In Puerto Rico, government officials have noted that the island's laws and constitution, along with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, protect from discrimination. But a precedent was set in 2016 when a U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed a discrimination lawsuit after finding that an employer’s no-dreadlock policy in Alabama did not violate Title VII.
During Tuesday's hearing, the co-author of the bill, Puerto Rico Sen. Ana Irma Rivera Lassén, said she didn't understand the government's position. ""What is the problem with adding explicit protection?"" she said.
Backing her was Puerto Rican university student Alanis Ruiz Guevara, who said she has been pushing for creation of the bill because specific hairstyles including braids, locks and Bantu knots are not covered by certain laws.
Others pushing for the bill is renowned Puerto Rican author Mayra Santos-Febres.
""All of this legal work is so important because it creates a protocol that is needed now,"" she said. ""We need tools to defend ourselves from systemic racism.""
Debate over the bill is expected to continue in upcoming weeks.
In the U.S. mainland, Texas and least 23 other states have implemented a version of the CROWN Act, which stands for ""Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair."" It bans hairstyle discrimination within employment, housing, education and public accommodation places. The U.S. House of Representatives approved a federal version of it in 2022, but it failed in the Senate.

A former North Dakota lawmaker is running for the state's only seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Republican Rick Becker, a plastic surgeon in Bismarck, announced his campaign on Monday. He received over 18% of the statewide vote in his unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid in 2022, when he ran as an independent against Republican Sen. John Hoeven, who won, and Democrat Katrina Christiansen, who is running for Senate again this year.
Republican U.S. Rep. Kelly Armstrong, an attorney and former state senator, said earlier this month that he is running for reelection to the seat he first won in 2018. Democrat Trygve Hammer, a military veteran, also is running.

""It's not so much a matter that I'm interested in tearing him down, it's simply I present an option for voters,"" Becker said. ""I think that we are at a point in time in which people are really looking for someone to be bold and to fight and to take on what I call the progressive, woke agenda.""

Becker served from 2012-22 in the state House, where he founded the ultraconservative Bastiat Caucus, a Trump-aligned group of Republican lawmakers who support more gun rights and tighter budgets. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican endorsement for governor in 2016.
Becker also is leading a proposed 2024 ballot initiative to eliminate local property taxes."

LACONIA, N.H. - South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott spoke to Fox News Digital on Monday night about why he endorsed former President Trump instead of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, even though Haley appointed him to his Senate seat.
""It came down to a simple question, who guarantees us the best future for the average American who starts where I started?"" Scott told Fox News Digital in New Hampshire while speaking in support of Trump.
""I started as a poor kid living in really devastated neighborhoods. I asked myself, the Reagan revolution that transformed my opportunities, who's best suited for the kids today? Living in similar search situations to have that kind of Reagan revolution?""
Scott continued, ""I don't have to look that far in the past; 2016, 2020, we got actually the lowest unemployment, but we had the fastest wage growth for the bottom quintile of our demographics. That is powerful. So if we can have that and world peace, count me in, Donald Trump is the only guy that's going to do that.""

The announcement came despite the long political history Scott shares with Haley, dating back to when they both served together in the state legislature. In 2012, then-Gov. Haley appointed then-Rep. Scott to the Senate to fill a vacancy.

""Look, I mean South Carolina is a blood sport and I have dealt with the old guard and the fellas all the time,"" Haley told Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Saturday about Scott's endorsement, adding that appointing Scott as senator was the ""right thing to do.""
""Everybody has a decision to make and they have to live with their decision. He'll have to live with his. What I know is, we're going to continue to go forward. Trump has focused his time on getting as many Washington insiders, elected officials, endorsements as he can, if you notice, I haven't tried to do any of that,"" Haley explained, adding that she will not receive a lot of legislative endorsements in South Carolina because ""that's not who I'm fighting for.""
When asked if he has had any recent conversations with Haley, Scott said, ""Only texts.""

The U.S. Coast Guard launched a rescue operation on Monday to help save 20 people who were stranded on an ice floe on Lake Erie, officials said.
The group was stuck on the ice about half a mile off the shore of Catawba Island State Park near Port Clinton, Ohio, the Coast Guard said.
Rescuers responded around 10:20 a.m. to the initial call, deploying two Coast Guard airboats and a helicopter to help with the operation, Petty Officer Jessica Fontenette told The Associated Press.
The Coast Guard rescued nine people from the ice floe, while the Put-in-Bay Fire Department saved four others. The remaining seven stranded individuals were able to make it ashore using their own airboat, the Coast Guard said. No injuries were reported.

FIRST ON FOX: The Heritage Foundation is renewing its push for better educational opportunities in the United States with a mini-documentary celebrating school choice and the impact it has made on students.
The documentary, which was released in accordance with National School Choice Week, features comments from parents, educators and children about how school choice has had an effect on them and their communities in Arizona – one of the first states to champion school choice.
In 1997, Arizona became the first state to offer tax-credit scholarships, and in 2011 it became the first state to offer K–12 education savings accounts (ESAs).
Titled ""Making the Grade,"" the documentary profiles four faith-based schools in Arizona to see the difference that education choice policies make for the families they serve.

""Our mission is to partner with families in nurturing their children for academic and spiritual growth,"" said Amanda Bennett, the co-founder of Arcadia Christian School. ""We have 120 students in our school – preschoolers all the way through sixth grade.""
""The unique thing about our school is that we're a hybrid model, which means that we're a blend between homeschool and at-school learning,"" Bennett added.
Alex Thompson, a parent and teacher who was featured in the video, said she has taught online and at a public school in the past but that her experience teaching at Arcadia Christian School has been a ""night and day difference.""
""I think the biggest difference is I'm able to give my students the time and energy they need because I only have 15 kids,"" Thompson said.
Bennett said she believes the use of ESAs has ""enabled"" her school to ""exist this year and thrive.""
The difference school choice has made for Highlands Latin School was also shown in the video.
""ESA has made it possible for us to be in this school,"" said one Highlands Latin parent.
The impact of school choice can also be seen at Pusch Ridge Christian School in Tucson.
""The mission of the school is to teach kids to become like Christ through a classical Christian education within a covenantal community – we just do it in Spanish,"" said Jonathon Basurto, the principal at Pusch Ridge Christian School.
""We feel that the public school was lacking in educating the children nowadays, and we wanted something better for our daughter,"" said Maria Gomez and Daniel Trujillo, whose daughter attends Pusch Ridge. ""Our daughter has flourished here. She loves coming to school. When she's on vacation she misses being here.""
The Torah Day School of Phoenix has also benefited from unfettered school choice options for parents in the Grand Canyon State.

""Torah day school was founded in 2010. We started with seven kids. It was actually started in my house. Thanks to really the policies in Arizona, we've grown tremendously … we now have over 400 [students],"" said Gaby Friedman, a founding board member for the school.
Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, said the steps Arizona has taken in its mission to uphold the best educational standards for children could help other states who are looking to follow suit. (iStock)
""Most of the students who come to our school come from low-income families, so we have a lot of students who are able to receive the corporate tax credit scholarship from Arizona, and we also have children who are also receiving an ESA,"" Friedman added. ""We never wanted to turn a child away because their parents couldn't pay anything. Thanks to the policies in Arizona, we have been able to maintain that open-door policy.""
Speaking to Fox News Digital about the mission to get school choice in every state, Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, said the steps that Arizona has taken in its mission to uphold the best educational standards for children could help other states who are looking to follow suit.
CHICAGO TO MOVE AWAY FROM SCHOOL CHOICE, CENTER NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS TO RECTIFY ‘STRUCTURAL RACISM’
Arizona's decision to ""adopt education savings accounts,"" Burke said, shows that it recognizes ""parents are their children's first and primary educators.""
Referring to ESAs as the ""iPhone of school choice,"" Burke said parents and students can use an ESA to ""not only pay for private school tuition but to also hire a private tutor or purchase textbooks, buy curricula and roll over unused funds year to year.""
""This is an amazing way to provide families access to their child's share of the money that would have been spent on them in the public school,"" she said. ""In Arizona, you get 90% of what would have been spent on your child in the public school. It literally goes on to a debit card that you control, and then you can pay for all of those things I just mentioned. It's an incredible way to think about the public financing of education.""
Burke said ESAs, or some form of them, are now being used in a total of 14 states.
Arizona, according to Burke, kept regulations ""appropriately light"" and allowed for more opportunities to flow in the state.

SCHOOL CHOICE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR A ‘FREE, DIVERSE, EQUAL, SOCIETY:’ NEAL MCCLUSKEY
Because of Arizona's steadfast approach to giving students and parents in the state school choice options, the state ranks second behind Florida on the Heritage Foundation's Education Freedom Report Card.
The report card, which features a ranking for each state, measures four categories – Education Choice, Teacher Freedom, Transparency, and Return on Investment – that encompass more than two dozen discrete factors.
Despite support for school choice from many different corners of America, some in Arizona, including the state's Democrat Gov. Katie Hobbs, question the school voucher program's value.
The voucher program – championed by Hobbs' GOP predecessor, Gov. Doug Ducey – allows students to apply to use public money for private-school tuition and other education costs. It started in 2011 as a small program for disabled children but was repeatedly expanded over the next decade until all students became eligible in 2022. More than 73,000 students currently participate in the program. Critics say the expansion is a drain on the state’s coffers and is subsidizing private school tuition, but backers say the expansion lets parents choose the best school for their children.

Earlier this month, Hobbs said that she and her administration had seen a ""steady stream of news coverage around unacceptable and sometimes downright outrageous use of taxpayer money"" under the voucher program – pointing to things like ""water park admissions, ski passes, and luxury car-driving lessons.""
Hobbs has also proposed requiring Arizona students to attend public school for 100 days before becoming eligible for the voucher program. Doing away next year with school tuition organizations that funnel tax credits to students for private school tuition could be another money-saving measure to the tune of $185 million, Hobbs’ office estimated.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
North Korea fired several cruise missiles into waters off its western coast, South Korea’s military said Wednesday.
The U.S. and South Korean militaries are analyzing the launches, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is not immediately clear how many missiles were fired. Flight details were also not provided.
""Our military has increased surveillance and vigilance and is closely coordinating with the United States while monitoring for further signs and activity from North Korea,"" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
The launches were North Korea’s second known launch event of the year following the country’s first solid-fuel intermediate range ballistic missile on Jan. 1, which the North claimed proved capable of targeting U.S. military bases in Japan and Guam.

Cruise missiles are among a broad range of weapons North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un continues to test as he issues provocative threats toward the U.S. and its allies, including South Korea and Japan.
The U.S., South Korea and Japan have also been expanding their combined military exercises in response to the North’s missile tests.

Tensions on the already turbulent Korean Peninsula have increased in recent months with such tests and with the North taking actions that have shown a clear change in its policies.
NORTH KOREA DEMOLISHES MONUMENT SYMBOLIZING POTENTIAL UNIFICATION WITH SOUTH: REPORT
Kim has declared that the North was abandoning its long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and went as far as to rewrite the North’s constitution to identify the South as its arch enemy and most hostile foreign adversary.

On Tuesday, South Korean intelligence analyzed commercial satellite images that appeared to suggest the North tore down an archway that symbolized reconciliation with South Korea. The symbolic arch stood approximately 100-feet tall in its capital city of Pyongyang over a highway leading to the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea.
Last week, Kim described the Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification, which was also commonly called the Arch of Reunification, as an ""eyesore"" and called for its removal.

Former President Trump Georgia prosecutor Nathan Wade, who is allegedly in a relationship with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, was slammed by his wife's lawyers in new divorce documents for giving ""inadequate"" answers about his alcohol, drug and medication use.
Wade has been involved in a contentious split from Joycelyn Wade, his wife of 26 years, since filing for divorce in 2021. He had filed papers for divorce the day after Willis appointed him special prosecutor in the Trump election interference investigation. Willis has recently come under fire for her alleged secret relationship with Wade.
But despite seeking an end to his marriage, Mr. Wade has repeatedly failed to answer basic questions and provide documentation asked for by his wife, whose lawyers claimed in court papers that Mr. Wade gave information that was ""so woefully inadequate so as to be useless.""
The court papers from February 2023 were unsealed by a judge on Monday.

Mrs. Wade asked her estranged husband to provide information about his alcohol usage, the brands of alcohol he drank and if he ever drove within an hour of drinking. He replied, ""Red wine once a week at home with dinner,"" according to the court filing.
When asked whether he used any legal or illegal drugs, Mr. Wade said, ""no illegal drug use ever,"" an answer Mrs. Wade's lawyers say failed ""to address any legal or prescription drug use at all.""
Her lawyers said Mr. Wade revealed he had taken pain medications and antibiotics after a surgery in April 2020 but did not disclose ""which medications, the duration of the prescription, the dosage, the prescribing authority, nor whether he took the drug as prescribed.""
Mr. Wade is not accused in the court filings of abusing drugs or alcohol.

The prosecutor's wife had first requested answers to questions about his drug and alcohol use and his finances in November 2021, so she could negotiate a fair divorce settlement. But her lawyers say in court papers that Mr. Wade has since repeatedly failed to cooperate by refusing to disclose basic information.
In August, Mr. Wade faced a civil contempt order for not complying with a judge's order to hand over discovery to his wife's lawyers, court papers show.
The lawyers filed another motion in September arguing he was avoiding turning over financial records. He had claimed to have received more than half a million dollars working on the Trump investigation without having produced ""one single document evidencing this income.""
Mr. Wade ""has knowingly obfuscated this civil litigation to his own ends,"" his wife's lawyers said. ""Furthermore, while earning such substantial sums, [Mr. Wade] has provided nearly nothing to [Mrs. Wade] for her support and survival as her own bank account is often in overdraft.""
His wife's lawyers served Willis with a subpoena for her to be deposed in the divorce case amid allegations of him having a relationship with the district attorney. But a judge on Monday put that deposition on hold at least until he can hear from Wade, who has also not been deposed.

Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson also unsealed the divorce case on Monday over the recent rise in interest because of the misconduct allegations against Mr. Wade and Willis.
Additionally, Thompson ruled Monday that Mrs. Wade has the right to uncover any alleged affair by her husband.
Willis' lawyer argued she should not be deposed in the divorce case because it is about dividing marital assets that she ""has nothing to do with"" and that any alleged affair is irrelevant in the case.
Mrs. Wade's lawyer, however, told the judge Monday, ""I want to know how [Mr. Wade] has been spending his money. I have reason to believe he is spending it on another woman and that's my client's money."""
LSCKIASPJT_QWPUG3RZRC4NM33,"Kansas City Chiefs fans' deaths: Drugs, freezing weather could have created lethal conditions, experts say",By Christina Coulter Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/kansas-city-chiefs-fans-deaths-drugs-freezing-weather-could-have-created-lethal-conditions-experts-say,"Former Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Currie Myers joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the latest on the case involving the unexpected deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans.
As their families wait for toxicology results to shed more light on the mysterious deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans, experts have told Fox News Digital a mix of drugs and frigid weather could have dealt the trio a lethal blow.
The bodies of Ricky Johnson, 38, Clayton McGeeney, 36, and David Harrington, 37, were discovered on Jan. 9, two days after they had gathered at friend Jordan Willis' home to watch the Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers.
The Kansas City Police Department has told Fox News Digital no foul play is suspected and ""this case is 100% not being investigated as a homicide.""
The men's families have accused Willis of playing an active role in the deaths, including allegations they were drugged.

The families cite Willis' attorney's changing narrative about the friends' final hours, his claims his client slept on his couch through much of the 48 hours that his friends were dead in his backyard and his role as a ""brilliant scientist"" with a Ph.D. working at a nonprofit developing immunizations.
Experts who spoke to Fox News Digital, though, all posited that the deaths were most likely accidental and caused by recreational drug use gone horribly awry.
""If they all took alcohol, they would not collapse around the same time. People react differently to large doses of alcohol, metabolize it at different speeds,"" forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden said. ""They react to it, but they don’t react right away, [and] they’re conscious enough to go indoors if they feel like they’re going to pass out.
""It would be the type of drug that causes a person to be disoriented,"" Baden said, ruling out carbon monoxide because the men's bodies were found outside. ""Fentanyl-type drugs can cause disorientation and can cause a rapid sleep-like loss of consciousness.
BROTHER OF CHIEFS FAN WHO WAS FOUND DEAD IN FRIEND'S BACKYARD SPEAK OUT, SAYS STORY 'NOT ADDING UP'
""If these four people all took it together, the guy on the couch sleeps it off for a long time, whereas the three who went outside disoriented, maybe didn’t have on their coats. Because of the freezing weather, it [could be] a combination of the drugs and hypothermia that caused their death."" Death from an overdose of fentanyl or a fentanyl analog, versions of the drug with a similar but slightly different chemical structure, isn't immediate, Baden said, and can take about an hour. When a fentanyl overdose takes place, naloxone can prevent users from going deeper into a coma after they lose consciousness.
""It isn't a sudden death in minutes,"" he said.
Family and friends of (L-R) Clayton McGeeney, David Harrington and Ricky Johnson are clamoring for answers after the three men inexplicably died in freezing temperatures outside their friend's Kansas City home. (Facebook)
But hypothermia sets in when the body's internal temperature lowers to 95 degrees or lower. Although temperatures weren't particularly low on the evening of Jan. 7 in Kansas City, hitting a low of around 29 degrees, Baden said a prolonged period in the snow in any weather under 32 degrees would be ""cold enough"" to kill a man.
""They probably aren’t dead when they collapse in the snow, but because of the cold they then go into a deeper coma and die from the hypothermia,"" Baden said. ""They wouldn’t have died if they had gotten home all right. But if they were in the snow, they die in the snow. They don’t feel any pain or anything. They can’t wake up in time.""
The theory the four men consumed a drug laced with fentanyl would support Willis' claim that he slept for all or most of two days after his friends visited his house, Baden pointed out.
""Because of the freezing weather, it [could be] a combination of the drugs and hypothermia that caused their death.""
Powdered fentanyl can be mixed with drugs like heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine or pressed into pills that look like prescription opioids. Police in Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana and New York have reported finding the synthetic opioid in marijuana.
Two of the three grieving families have told Fox News Digital detectives have reached out asking for passcodes to their sons' phones. In all likelihood, the Kansas City Police Department is trying to determine whether drugs were sold or given to any of the men and establish a chain of possession, attorney and retired NYPD inspector Paul Mauro said. That process may further delay the investigation.
Although Willis is not facing criminal charges and has not been accused of any wrongdoing by police, he could be charged with drug-induced homicide or manslaughter if he were found to be the supplier of the deadly drugs, the experts all said.
5TH MAN CONTRADICTS KANSAS CITY CHIEFS FANS' PAL ABOUT MEN'S DEATH

""I would think that now they have to try to jailbreak the phones [if they can't get passwords] which is very difficult to do these days,"" Mauro said. ""Most of these phones … a lot of the data default to the cloud. You can get a cloud search warrant. Instead of having the password, you’re not going to get in with the thumbprint.
""The person needs to be alive. If you aren’t alive, you don’t have the necessary heat or electricity. There are some workarounds, but the bottom line is, if they don’t have a password they’re going to have a hell of a time getting in there.""
Although the deaths of McGeeney, Johnson and Harrington have garnered interest nationwide, the phenomenon of mass overdose deaths is more common than one might realize, retired DEA special agent Derek Maltz said.
""If I had to bet my pension, they were drinking, they smoked weed, the weed was laced with K2, they overheated and threw themselves into the snow,""
In a presentation to the House of Representatives' Committee on Homeland Security in 2023, Maltz was able to compile 70 pages of news articles from 2023 on deaths of three or more victims, and some with more than 10 or even 20, who died at once from the drug – sometimes thinking it was a ""safer"" substance, and other times through innocuous items like a lollipop.
""This is happening in every state,"" Maltz told Fox News Digital. ""Everyone is so fixated on 'three people dead, they were frozen to death in the backyard.' But they don't know that this is happening all the time in multiple states all across the country every day. People are not putting this together. The news is just reacting to stuff instead of understanding what's really happening. That's where it gets really sad for me. The more we talk about it, it's just people continuing to die.""

Ricky Johnson, right, was a ""responsible"" man who ""wasn't going to go outside and freeze to death,"" his parents told Fox News Digital.  (Norma Chester)
Although he stressed that it was just a theory, Maltz said he thought the Kansas City tragedy was ""a clear case of cocaine laced with fentanyl.""
However, he said, other drugs could cause a fast-acting, disorienting effect, including synthetic opioids like nitazenes and horse tranquilizer xylazine, that he said are being produced in Chinese labs.
""This is happening in every state.""
But Baden, Mauro and Maltz all expressed that if the substance were a fentanyl derivative or a synthetic, it may be difficult for less-equipped labs to detect in an autopsy report, potentially requiring Kansas City's Frontier Forensics Midwest LLC to outsource testing and delay results further.
""They may not have the capacity. I hope they have the wherewithal to say, 'Our lab can’t do this’,"" Mauro said. ""I hope the cops are thinking this way. If they just test for heroin, and it’s a synthetic, it's not going to show. I hope that they know to test for it.""
Mauro also theorized that K2 or ""spice,"" a synthetic marijuana sometimes passed off as the real thing or used by those who want to avoid positive marijuana results on drug tests, could have been the offending substance.

""If I had to bet my pension, they were drinking. They smoked weed. The weed was laced with K2. They overheated and threw themselves into the snow,"" Mauro said. ""Let's say he went out for a cigarette or something. It doesn’t matter how drunk you are – in that area it hits you.""

FIRST ON FOX: Former President Trump will deliver the keynote speech for the NRA’s Presidential Forum at its massive annual outdoor show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, next month, Fox News Digital has learned.
""President Trump's unwavering support for the Second Amendment, and his track record of protecting the rights of gun owners make him an exemplary speaker for this momentous event. His fellow NRA members can’t wait to hear from him for the eighth time,"" NRA President Charles Cotton said in the press release provided to Fox News Digital on Monday.
The NRA’s Great American Outdoor Show will run between Feb. 3-11, including Trump’s speech on Feb. 9 during the event’s Presidential Forum. The NRA noted that this is Trump’s eighth address to NRA members, with his speeches stretching back to 2015, showing he is a ""steadfast advocate for the NRA, the Second Amendment, and self-defense rights.""
Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, promised in 2016 that we ""will never let"" NRA members down, which NRA leadership lauded in their press release, explaining that Trump carried through on this commitment when he was the commander in chief.
TRUMP SAYS 'EXISTENCE OF EVIL' IS WHY LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS NEED SECOND AMENDMENT

""As President, Trump upheld this commitment by appointing a record-setting number of judges who respect the Second Amendment, designating firearm retailers as critical infrastructure during COVID-19, and unsigning from the ATT arms trade treaty on stage at the 2019 NRA Annual Meeting in Indianapolis,"" the press release said, also noting Trump is a lifetime NRA member.
The Great American Outdoor Show is billed as the world’s largest outdoor show that features more than 1,000 exhibitors across 650,000 square feet of exhibit space over the course of nine days of events. Events stretch from Trump’s speech, a concert, dog and lumberjack competitions, and hunting and gun ownership forums.

""President Trump's presence at the Great American Outdoor Show is a testament to his ongoing commitment to our constitutional freedoms. His leadership has been crucial in safeguarding the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and all Americans who cherish our outdoor heritage,"" executive director of NRA-ILA Randy Kozuch said in the press release.
TRUMP MOCKS DESANTIS, PENCE DURING STUMP SPEECH AT NRA CONVENTION
The NRA’s announcement comes on the heels of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropping out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, ahead of the New Hampshire primary. The primary, the first in the nation, will now be a showdown between Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Trump will join the NRA event ahead of the South Carolina primary, Haley's home state, on Feb. 24.

Trump handily dominated the Iowa caucuses last week, winning 98 of the 99 counties. Polls in New Hampshire show Trump in the lead over Haley, with an average of polls on FiveThirtyEight showing Trump with nearly 49.8% support compared to Haley’s 36.1% support.
WATCH: GOP VOTERS WEIGH IN ON 2024 CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT, SHRED 'BOGUS' TRUMP CHARGES
Pennsylvania, where the NRA event will be held, is a swing state where Trump took 48.84% of the votes in 2020 compared to Scranton native President Biden’s 50.01%. The former president managed to take the state in 2016 when he faced off against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, earning more than 40,000 additional votes than Clinton.
After DeSantis’ Sunday afternoon dropout, Trump told Fox News Digital that he was ""very honored"" DeSantis endorsed his run for the White House, adding that he looks forward ""to working together with him to beat Joe Biden.""

The co-chairs of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus on Wednesday opened the first trip by U.S. lawmakers to the island where the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third straight term in presidential elections this month.
U.S. Reps. Ami Bera, a Democrat from California, and Florida Republican Mario Díaz-Balart plan to ""engage with senior officials and business leaders,"" Bera’s office said in a statement, without naming those with whom they would meet.
CHINA CONDEMNS PHILIPPINES AFTER PRESIDENT CONGRATULATES TAIWAN ELECTION WINNER
""The aim of the trip is to reaffirm U.S. support for Taiwan following their successful democratic elections, express solidarity in their shared commitment to democratic values, and explore opportunities to further strengthen the robust economic and defense relationship between the United States and Taiwan,"" the statement said.
China, America's chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring it under its control. Beijing strongly condemned the election of current Vice President Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's leader and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage with the island's government first set down following the election of the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.

Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan and responded to a 2022 visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits by foreign government officials as them recognizing the island’s sovereignty.
President Joe Biden has sought to calm that complaint, insisting there’s no change in America’s longstanding ""one-China policy,"" which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei.

While China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and harass Taiwan, there was no discernible spike in activity on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Defense Ministry reported seven Chinese warplanes and five naval vessels had been detected near the island over the previous 24 hours. It also said two Chinese balloons flew over the island's northern and southern regions. The nature of the balloons remains unclear."
LXQEV8HMLA_L2WRYD19E1X4OBL,Washington state to consider ban on hog-tying after Manuel Ellis' death,Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 6:51am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-state-consider-ban-hog-tying-manuel-ellis-death,"Washington State gubernatorial candidate Dave Reichert, a Republican, shares why he feels he has a chance to shift his state leadership from blue to red.
Washington state lawmakers are expected to consider a proposal Monday to prohibit police from hog-tying suspects, nearly four years after Manuel Ellis, a 33-year-old Black man, died facedown with his hands and feet cuffed together behind him in a case that became a touchstone for racial justice demonstrators in the Pacific Northwest.
The restraint technique has long drawn concern due to the risk of suffocation, and while many cities and counties have banned the restraint technique, it remains in use in others.
Democratic Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, who sponsored the bill, said she doesn’t want anyone else to experience the ""dehumanization"" Ellis faced before his death.
WASHINGTON STATE JUDGE DENIES EFFORT TO REMOVE TRUMP FROM BALLOT
""How do we move through the need for folks to enforce the laws, but do it in a way where they’re treating people the way we expect, which is as human beings?"" she said.
In the last four years, states across the U.S. have rushed to pass sweeping policing reforms, prompted by racial injustice protests and the death of George Floyd and others at the hands of law enforcement. Few have banned prone restraint, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California prohibited law enforcement in 2021 from using techniques that ""involve a substantial risk of positional asphyxia,"" in which the body's position hinders the ability to breathe. That same year, Minnesota banned correctional officers from using prone restraint unless ""deadly force is justified.""

Yasmin Trudeau of Washington wants to pass legislation to prevent police from hog-tying people, nearly four years after Manuel Ellis died in a case that sparked racial justice demonstrators across the Pacific Northwest. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)
The U.S. Department of Justice has recommended against the practice since at least 1995 to avoid deaths in custody, and many local jurisdictions bar it.
The attorney general’s office in Washington recommended against using hog-tying in its model use-of-force policy released in 2022. At least four local agencies continue to permit it, according to policies they submitted to the attorney general’s office that year.
The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department said it still allows hog-tying but declined to comment on the bill. One of the department's deputies was involved in restraining Ellis, whose face was covered by a spit-hood when he died.
Ellis was walking home in March 2020 when he passed a patrol car with Tacoma police officers Matthew Collins and Christopher Burbank, who are white. Burbank and Collins said Ellis tried to get into a stranger’s car and then attacked the officers when they confronted him in the city about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Seattle.
Witnesses said the officers jumped out of their car as Ellis walked by and knocked him to the ground.
He was shocked and beaten. Officers wrapped a hobble restraint device around his legs and linked it to his handcuffs behind his back while he remained in the prone position, according to a probable cause statement filed by the Washington attorney general’s office.
After the hobble was applied, Ellis stopped moving, the statement said.
A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide caused by lack of oxygen. Collins, Burbank and a third officer, Timothy Rankine, were charged with murder or manslaughter. Defense attorneys argued Ellis' death was caused by methamphetamine intoxication and a heart condition, and a jury acquitted them in December.
Trudeau, who represents Tacoma, said she made sure Ellis’ sister, Monet Carter-Mixon, approved of her efforts before introducing the bill.
Democratic Sen. John Lovick, who worked as a state trooper for more than 30 years, joined Trudeau in sponsoring the bill.
Republican Rep. Gina Mosbrucker, a member of the House public safety committee, said she looked forward to learning more about the legislation.

""If it does turn out that this form of restraint for combative detainees is dangerous in any way, then I think the state should put together a grant and some money to buy and train on alternative methods to make sure that the officer and the person arrested is safe,"" she said.
The bill comes a few years after a wave of ambitious police reform legislation passed in the state in 2021.
The legislation included requirements that officers could use force only when they had probable cause to make an arrest or to prevent imminent injury, and required them to use appropriate de-escalation tactics if possible.
The following year, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee approved bills fixing some elements of that legislation, including making it clear officers may use force to help detain or transport people in behavioral health crises."

The former South Carolina governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in former President Trump's administration was interviewed a couple of hours after DeSantis suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump, the clear frontrunner in the 2024 GOP race.

""We know that DeSantis supporters love America, and we know that they want a new generational conservative leader,"" Haley, 52, emphasized. ""And so what we're saying is we’re going to fight for you. We’re going to earn your support.""
Trump, speaking at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, once again repeatedly blasted Haley. He charged – among other things – that she ""puts America last"" and ""wants to gut Medicare.""

Haley pushed back against what she argued are Trump's lies about her record and agenda.
""It is not what Donald Trump says. I have never said I want to raise the retirement age or cut social security. I’ve never raised a tax, regardless of what he says. He said multiple things, like I don’t believe in the border. I passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country as governor,"" she touted.

And Haley, in a separate interview with Fox News ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier, argued that ""if you've got to lie to win, you don't deserve to win. And I know that. And he knows that he's unraveling because he sees what's happening.""
Trump, the commanding frontrunner in the GOP nomination race as he runs a third straight time for the White House, grabbed 51% of ballots cast in last week's low-turnout Iowa Republican caucuses. DeSantis edged Haley out for a distant second place.
But DeSantis wasn't a factor in New Hampshire, where independent voters have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary.

Trump held 11-point and 19-point leads over Haley in two new polls released on Sunday morning, with DeSantis a distant third in the single digits before he dropped out of the race. His departure leaves Trump and Haley as the last major candidates battling for the nomination.

Haley has repeatedly declined to set expectations for her finish in New Hampshire, reiterating to reporters on Sunday at a stop in Epping that ""we'll find out what strong and stronger is on Election Day.""
Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney told reporters on Saturday that they're moving full speed ahead to South Carolina, which holds the next major contest in the GOP presidential nominating calendar, on Feb. 24.
Ankney said Haley will hold a large event in her hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday, the same day that the campaign will launch a $4 million statewide ad blitz.
Asked by Fox News Digital if she's moving on to her home state regardless of her finish in New Hampshire, Haley quickly responded ""absolutely.""
""I can’t wait to make sure that we go and have that homecoming. And then I’m going to fight every day to earn their support. South Carolinians are smart. They’re tough. They expect you to do your homework,"" she emphasized. ""But I’ve won there twice. I know what it takes to do that and we’ll do it again.""

Minutes after her Fox News interview, Haley took the stage at Exeter High School after being introduced by daytime TV host Judith Sheindlin, who is best known to Americans as Judge Judy.
""Please, New Hampshire. Use your brains and your heart,"" Sheindlin stressed. ""Bring her home on Tuesday.""
After the two hugged as Haley came on stage, the candidate said ""how cool is it to have Judge Judy endorse you? It really is.""
Haley said of Sheindlin, ""she’s a trailblazer. She’s tough. She speaks hard truths. She doesn’t mince words.""
And reacting to the roar of the crowd, Haley said ""Can you hear that sound? That’s the sound of a two-person race.""

A reigning beauty queen from Georgia has been arrested and charged in the death of an 18-month-old boy, authorities announced.
Trinity Poague, 18, was arrested Friday, according to online Sumter County Sheriff's Office jail records. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a press release that they were asked to investigate the child's death around 2 p.m. Jan. 14 by the Georgia Southwestern State University Police Department.
The boy had been admitted to the emergency room at Phoebe Sumter Hospital in Americus. Hospital staff tried to save him, but he later died.
After conducting interviews and examining evidence, GBI agents arrested Poague. She is the reigning Miss Donalsonville, FOX 5 Atlanta reports.

Smith told Fox News that Poague was Julian's girlfriend, and the child lived with his father full time.
""We are all very hurt and confused, just really in disbelief,"" Smith said. ""Ja is trying to manage as best as possible, but it is obviously very hard on him. He doesn’t want to speak to anyone about anything right now.""

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., tells 'America Reports' the presidential race should now become Trump versus Biden.
South Carolina Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace told Fox News on Monday there is no reason for the GOP primary contest between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley to continue to her home state after Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
Mace, who recently endorsed Trump, said the presidential sweeps should narrow to a race between Trump and President Biden.
However, she proffered that Haley – who had campaigned for her in the past – is a formidable political figure either way.
""Nikki Haley was a great governor for South Carolina. She's run a great race. And look, when she jumped in, I told everyone… not to underestimate her. And she's the last opponent standing today,"" Mace said.

""But I also have an obligation to listen to my voters in my district, to listen to the state of South Carolina. They are saying overwhelmingly they are with Donald Trump.""
Mace went on to criticize Biden, saying he has a track record of four years of weak leadership, and contrasting him with Trump's message of ""peace, prosperity and patriotism.""
""There's no reason why this race should continue on to South Carolina after tomorrow,"" she told ""America Reports."" ""We need to have it a one-on-one race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.""
Mace said many Americans want the primary to end, and instead for Republicans to focus on defeating Biden given all the turmoil around the country and globe.

Asked about polls showing Haley defeating Biden at a greater margin than Trump, Mace said the former president ""crushed it"" in the Iowa caucuses and is primed to win not only her Lowcountry district but the entire Palmetto State.
The South Carolina Republican presidential primary is February 24. The DNC moved its primary up to February 3.
Another South Carolina lawmaker who recently endorsed Trump, Sen. Tim Scott, told ""The Story"" Monday that he threw his support behind the former president not in spite of his state's former governor, but in the best interest of the nation.
After hearing of Scott's endorsement, Haley said that ""he has to live with that decision."" Scott was notably appointed by Haley to the Senate, upon the resignation of Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who became president of the Heritage Foundation.
Scott said he had the option to either sit on the sidelines of the race or to endorse Trump.

""I did so for three very specific reasons. Number one: When I fought for Opportunity Zones to bring more resources to the poorest Americans, Donald Trump said yes. When I cut taxes and wrote the personal side of the tax code, lowering a single mother's taxes by 70%, the president, Donald Trump, said yes.""
""When I looked around the world in the Middle East, in Eastern Europe and in the Indo-Pacific, we had peace, peace and peace; stability. Why?""
""President Trump brought stability because he understood peace-through-strength. That's missing. We need four more years of that.""
When asked if he would entertain speculation that he is a potential running mate choice for Trump, Scott said he did not endorse in search of a job. Instead, Scott said, he wants the ability to work beside the president in fighting for common issues for the betterment of the American people.

M6ORAVUDVU_LBXYGQ5JF9LDPA1,Arizona's $10B clean energy transmission project challenged in court,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 1:21pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizonas-10b-clean-energy-transmission-project-challenged-court,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A federal judge is being asked to issue a stop-work order on a $10 billion transmission line being built through a remote southeastern Arizona valley to carry wind-powered electricity to customers as far away as California.
A 32-page lawsuit filed on Jan. 17 in U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona, accuses the U.S. Interior Department and Bureau of Land Management of refusing for nearly 15 years to recognize ""overwhelming evidence of the cultural significance"" of the remote San Pedro Valley to Native American tribes including the Tohono O’odham, Hopi, Zuni and Western Apache.
The suit was filed shortly after Pattern Energy received approval to transmit electricity generated by its SunZia Transmission wind farm in central New Mexico through the San Pedro Valley east of Tucson and north of Interstate 10.
TRIBAL LEADERS ASK WASHINGTON STATE LAWMAKERS FOR FUNDING TO COMBAT OPIOID CRISIS
The lawsuit calls the valley ""one of the most intact, prehistoric and historical ... landscapes in southern Arizona,"" and asks the court to issue restraining orders or permanent injunctions to halt construction.
""The San Pedro Valley will be irreparably harmed if construction proceeds,"" it says.
SunZia Wind and Transmission and government representatives did not respond Monday to emailed messages. They are expected to respond in court. The project has been touted as the biggest U.S. electricity infrastructure undertaking since the Hoover Dam.
This photo, taken on Nov. 13, 2023, by Archaeology Southwest and Lighthawk shows the beginnings of infrastructure for the transmission line that would carry electricity from a wind power plant. The image was included in a lawsuit filed Jan. 17, 2024, asking a U.S. District Court in Arizona to order the work to stop. (Archaeology Southwest via AP)
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the Tohono O’odham Nation, the San Carlos Apache Reservation and the nonprofit organizations Center for Biological Diversity and Archaeology Southwest.
""The case for protecting this landscape is clear,"" Archaeology Southwest said in a statement that calls the San Pedro ""Arizona’s last free-flowing river,"" and the valley the embodiment of a ""unique and timely story of social and ecological sustainability across more than 12,000 years of cultural and environmental change.""
The valley represents a 50-mile (80-kilometer) stretch of the planned 550-mile (885-kilometer) conduit expected to carry electricity linking massive new wind farms in central New Mexico with existing transmission lines in Arizona to serve populated areas as far away as California. The project has been called an important part of President Joe Biden's goal for a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.
Work started in September in New Mexico after negotiations that spanned years and resulted in the approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency with authority over vast parts of the U.S. West.
The route in New Mexico was modified after the U.S. Defense Department raised concerns about the effects of high-voltage lines on radar systems and military training operations.
Work halted briefly in November amid pleas by tribes to review environmental approvals for the San Pedro Valley, and resumed weeks later in what Tohono O’odham Chairman Verlon M. Jose characterized as ""a punch to the gut.""

SunZia expects the transmission line to begin commercial service in 2026, carrying more than 3,500 megawatts of wind power to 3 million people. Project officials say they conducted surveys and worked with tribes over the years to identify cultural resources in the area.
A photo included in the court filing shows an aerial view in November of ridgetop access roads and tower sites being built west of the San Pedro River near Redrock Canyon. Tribal officials and environmentalists say the region is otherwise relatively untouched.
The transmission line is also being challenged before the Arizona Court of Appeals. The court is being asked to consider whether state regulatory officials there properly considered the benefits and consequences of the project."
MBGOT3MG5T_QCGD76MYMFWNPKL,"Ramaswamy: Haley should drop out for the good of the country, as observers say she's still 'alive and kicking'",By Charles Creitz Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 10:27pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ramaswamy-haley-should-drop-out-good-country,"Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy tells 'Jesse Watters Primetime' New Hampshire is a decisive Trump victory.
Following Fox News' projection that former President Trump would win the New Hampshire Republican primary, former candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said the right move for runner-up Nikki Haley is to drop out and unite the party.
Ramaswamy called Tuesday's results a decisive Trump victory and added that a large number of independents voted in the Republican primary due to the Granite State's open-primary system.
He also called New Hampshire a microcosm of the national electorate:
""It's like a terrain for the general election,"" he said, adding that some of Haley's large donors like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman are anti-Trump figures or typically Democratic donors.
TIM SCOTT'S ENDORSEMENT ROILS NH AS SUNUNU CLAIMS HE WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB WITHOUT HALEY
""So I think this is a prediction of what you're going to see in the general election. And the decisive margin we see tonight is, in some ways, I think, something that bodes well for Trump heading into the general election in November to reunite this country,"" he said.
""And so, in my view, the general election really begins tonight. I think the Republican primary, for all intents and purposes, is over tonight. And I think the party and the country are better off if we see that for what it is.""
Ramaswamy, who famously held up a notepad reading ""Nikki = Corrupt"" during a primary debate, remarked how he has never been afraid to criticize the former South Carolina governor – and stated his belief that the only reason Haley signaled she will remain in the race for the long haul is in hopes that Trump's candidacy is neutered by outside forces like lawsuits.
""If Nikki Haley does stay in, it will send the signal that her only path and what she's playing for is for Donald Trump being eliminated by forces outside of this process, by the judicial system, by secretaries of state in places like Maine or elsewhere. And I think that's downright wrong,"" he said.
He said Hoffman has helped fund advice columnist E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit against Trump, and that his connection to Haley shows why continuing the two-way primary is bad for the party and country in the long term.
TRUMP OFFERS BIPARTISAN DEFENSE OF PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY, CITES OBAMA CIVILIAN DRONE DEATHS
Pivoting to Trump's candidacy itself, Ramaswamy said recent comments by high-profile Democrats that appeared counter to the Biden administration's platform on issues like the open border also show that there is an appetite for a second Trump term.
He pointed to Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who was once a supporter of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., presidential bid, appearing to call out the left's immigration policy in telling CNN the American Dream is being threatened by hundreds of thousands of migrants swarming the border.
""That says that many Democrats and independents and libertarians agree with the views of this America First movement. That's why I took myself out of the race to endorse Donald Trump. I think the other Republicans have done the right thing. It's time for Nikki Haley to do the right thing as well and focus on a landslide this November,"" he said.
In her post-primary speech, Haley countered that the worst-kept secret in politics is that Democrats want to run against Trump in November, calling a Trump nomination precipitous of a ""Biden win and Kamala Harris presidency.""
However, Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany added on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" that Haley's plan to remain in the race through South Carolina and beyond is an obvious ""play"" for the vice presidency in a Trump administration.

In the same vein, former Bush White House aide Karl Rove said Haley remaining the race may in one way benefit Trump, because battling the former governor allows him to ""articulate a vision for the general election… if he takes on the task of describing a general election message, and positioning himself to beat Biden… then he's going to be better off.""
""Whoever is the Republican nominee is going to have a lot to do in unifying the party and lowering the temperature and the principal responsibility is the front-runner,"" Rove said.
As Trump prepared to take the stage for a victory speech late Tuesday, Fox News political analyst Brit Hume quipped the former president was hoping for a resounding victory that would drive Haley from the race.
As results trickled in showing about a 10-point spread at press time, Hume considered that the race was instead a ""run for [Trump's] money that he didn't want.""
""He wanted what happened tonight to be a blowout win for him that would blow her out of the race,"" he said. ""I don't think that's happened, so I don't know how gracious he's willing to be.""
Hume said Haley's candidacy appears to still be ""alive and kicking"" as South Carolina approaches next on the docket in late February.

MD5QZYGDVO_L098PL1B8VZCUF0,Professor accused of antisemitism leaves U.S. for job in Qatar,By Kendall Tietz Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 3:43pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/professor-accused-antisemitism-leaves-us-job-qatar,"Americans in the nation's capital shared whether antisemitism has gotten better or worse in the U.S. since Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 ambush on Israel.
A professor facing a federal antisemitism complaint reportedly plans to leave her post at a D.C. university for a job in Qatar.
Lara Sheehi, assistant professor of clinical psychology at George Washington University (GWU), left her job after she faced allegations of mistreatment toward her Jewish and Israeli students in a mandatory diversity graduate course she taught, the College Fix reported.
Sheehi reportedly took a new job as an assistant professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies in the capital of Qatar, according to a statement she released.
""I am writing to let you know that I have been offered a job at another university and I have made the difficult decision not to return to GW at the end of this year,"" Sheehi wrote in an email sent to the university’s psychology department.
PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS SHUT DOWN SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL'S MAIN STREET
""As you can imagine, while this is an aligned professional and personal choice, I have mixed emotions, especially as GW has been my professional home since I was a graduate student,"" she added.

Sheehi no longer has a faculty bio on GWU's website and could not be reached for comment, but according to her faculty bio on the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies website, her ""work takes up decolonial and anti-oppressive approaches to psychoanalysis, with a focus on liberation struggles in the Global South.""
Qatar is close to Hamas and ""has pumped an estimated $1.8 billion dollars into Hamas-run Gaza"" since 2007, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The middle eastern nation also released a statement on October 7 holding ""Israel alone responsible"" for Hamas’s terrorist attack that left at least 1,200 Jewish people dead.
In January 2022, the international pro-Israel group. StandWithUs, filed a Title VI complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights against Sheehi to address antisemitism students said they experienced in her mandatory diversity course.
STUDENT VINDICATED IN DEFAMATION SUIT BROUGHT BY PRO-CHOICE NOTRE DAME PROFESSOR SAYS TRUTH ‘WORTH DEFENDING’
In one incident, when a Jewish Israeli student introduced herself to the class on the first day of class and explained that she was from Israel, Professor Sheehi’s response was, ""It’s not your fault you were born in Israel,"" which the complaint said implied ""the student’s Israeli national identity is something of which she should be ashamed.""
""A professor singling out and targeting Jewish and Israeli students for adverse treatment because of their identity is textbook antisemitic discriminatory conduct,"" said Roz Rothstein, StandWithUs CEO and Co-Founder said in a press release.
Sheehi also invited guest speaker, Dr. Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, to a lecture where she allegedly ""demonized"" Israeli and Jewish people, referring to ""white Israeli racism"" in her presentation and ""suggested that one of the correct responses to this activity of Jews and Israelis is violent resistance.""

""In a class designed to educate future therapists about different identities and sensitize the students to bias experienced by those identities, Dr. Sheehi singled out the Jewish students and deprived only them of an opportunity she afforded all other students — defining their own identity and what it means to experience discrimination based on that identity,"" the complaint said.
""In this way, Dr. Sheehi engaged in ‘erasive antisemitism,’ a form of antisemitism that denies the uniqueness of Jewish identity and erases Jewish history and the Jews’ lived experience,"" the complaint added. ""Not surprisingly, other students in the class quickly followed the professor’s lead and began disparaging and denying Jewish identity in a similar discriminatory fashion.""
MICHIGAN TECH PROFESSOR BACK FROM LEAVE AFTER SLAMMING ‘DUMB, RACIST’ CONSERVATIVE GROUP
GWU launched its own investigation into Sheehi, which cleared her of the allegations, stating they were ""significantly decontextualized,"" ""inaccurate,"" and ""misrepresented."" In November 2022, the Jewish students who had been the most outspoken in their complaints about Sheehi learned that she started allegedly making false claims about them during faculty meetings.
For example, Sheehi alleged that the students had called guest speaker, Dr. Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a ""terrorist,"" that the students’ journal entries were ""combative"" and that they were racist.

She also used these claims to initiate disciplinary action against the students, who were informed that ""faculty voted to initiate disciplinary proceedings against them"" and ""asked the students to describe to the faculty what they did wrong and what harm they caused,"" according to the complaint. Failure to do so could ""result in further disciplinary action and a permanent disciplinary notation on the students’ academic records.'
Yael Lerman, founding director of the StandWithUs legal department, said the university ""has failed to provide adequate protection for the Jewish and Israeli students seeking redress from Professor Sheehi’s persistent antisemitic bigotry in and out of the classroom.""

""Instead, George Washington administrators disregarded the students’ allegations and enabled a professor to retaliate against those students after they sought the administration’s help in fighting discrimination,"" she added.
Rothstein told the College Fix in a statement that Sheehi's departure from GWU does not address all the issues raised in the Title VI complaint, adding ""it does not by itself provide a full remedy for the hostile antisemitic environment at GW.""

LACONIA, N.H. - Florida GOP Rep. Byron Donalds spoke to Fox News Digital in New Hampshire on Monday, speaking directly to undecided Republican voters who are on the fence about whether to support former President Trump or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
""I mean, look, my closing message is this, our party, we're blessed, we have a lot of talent in our party, but it is pretty clear at this point that the majority of our party wants President Trump in office again,"" Donalds told Fox News Digital at a Trump rally. ""The vast majority. It's pretty clear at this point.""
Donalds continued, ""Secondarily, with how bad Joe Biden has been, we need somebody who can step in on day one. Nikki Haley couldn't do that, Vivek Ramaswamy couldn't do that, and Ron DeSantis couldn't do that. Donald Trump can. This is about the future of our country.""

""But I would urge those people who are on the fence, it's time for us to unite, because we're dealing with radicals in the White House who are destroying this country, and we got to unite as a party.

After a convincing 30-point victory in Iowa's low-turnout GOP presidential caucuses a week ago, Trump is aiming for an encore performance in the Granite State as he tries to bring the Republican nomination race to an early ending.
For Haley, a former two-term South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, the New Hampshire primary may be her best and possibly last chance to slow down or derail the former president's march toward renomination.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Two burglary suspects in Maryland were charged with the attempted murder of a police officer on Sunday after dragging the officer across a highway in a stolen church van during their failed getaway, authorities said.
Two officers responded just before 2 a.m. to a possible burglary in progress at a closed gas station in the 7600 block of Crain Highway, when they found a burgundy van backed up to the front door of the business, the Prince George’s County Police Department said.
Police said that a van had been used in another burglary in the area just an hour earlier.
As the two officers began to investigate, two men ran from the store and jumped into the van, according to authorities.

One officer gave verbal commands to stop and tried to remove the driver, identified as 51-year-old Dennis Burkett, from the seat, police said.
Burkett allegedly refused to stop and instead began to speed away with the officer caught in the driver’s side door. Police said the second officer shot discharged his firearm, striking Burkett.
Police said Robert Burkett Jr., 50, admitted to the burglary, fleeing from police and stealing the getaway van from a church. (Prince George's County Police Department)
However, Burkett continued to speed out of the parking lot and across four lanes of Crain Highway, according to police, and dragged the officer until he fell from the van on South Osborne Road.
Burkett and the other suspect, identified as 50-year-old Robert Burkett Jr., led officers on a 30-minute car chase until the van became disabled, authorities said.

A more than 100-year-old tradition continues in New Hampshire.
""Don't complain about what happens in a general election if you don't play in this primary tomorrow. It matters,"" Nikki Haley told voters at one of her final campaign events before voting begins.
She is hoping for an upset win over former president Donald Trump.
""Every one of you is going to cast the most important vote of your entire life. This is a very, very important vote,"" Trump said at one of his final New Hampshire rallies.

Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race over the weekend, leaving New Hampshire voters with just two options.
""If he was going to drop out, I'm glad he did it before Tuesday, because that seemed to be like the respectable thing for him to do,"" New Hampshire Government Teacher Donna Morin said.
In 2016, Morin was undecided between former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Former Ohio Governor John Kasich. After seeing all the candidates, she landed on former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.
""So embarrassing,"" Morin said laughing.

In 2020, she voted in the Democratic primary and backed Pete Buttigieg. This election cycle she is planning to vote in the Republican primary once again and is supporting Nikki Haley.
""She wants to stay strong by helping Ukraine. That's vital. We cannot let Putin take that over,"" Morin said. ""She has a lot more honesty to her.""
Haley told supporters at a recent rally that she speaks hard truths. Morin hopes her students learn from each election cycle.

""A lot of them are really into it,"" Morin said. ""They better vote on Tuesday because a lot of them are 18.""
Most voters in New Hampshire are registered independents. Many have voted for candidates from both parties, including Alyssa Ehl. She voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 election but eventually shifted her affiliation to republican.
""The Democratic Party left the people. The people aren’t leaving the Democratic Party,"" Ehl said. ""They're going too far extreme to the left. I just can't support their ideals at this time.""
Ehl said she liked several candidates this election cycle, including Vivek Ramaswamy, Ron DeSantis and former President Trump. With just Trump remaining, she still has some hesitancy.
""He lost last time in 2020, so I’m concerned that putting him up again with all the hype and just the constant battering, his reputation is going to be an issue,"" Ehl said. ""I think a lot of people are saturated in the whole Trump drama.""

Ehl wants a candidate who can beat President Biden. But she doesn’t think Haley has what it takes.
""I just feel as though it's just not a good time. She's just not firm enough on a lot of issues,"" Ehl said.

""New Hampshire voters are unique,"" Vailas said. ""They do their reading, they do their research, and they make the best move.""
Vailas has four sons and a stepdaughter who live nearby. She’s worried about the rising prices of family homes.
""They can't afford to buy a house. We've had to help one of our sons to buy one,"" Valias said.
Vailas says she was impressed by Nikki Haley in the first debate.
""I am generally a pro-life person, but I think there needs to be some exceptions. When she pointed out that we would never pass that through our Congress, it just it just struck me.""
Vailas agrees that New Hampshire takes its job seriously.

""New Hampshire has had a long-standing tradition as part of our Constitution, that we have the first-in-the-nation primary,"" Vailas said. ""And that's why the Democrats are missing the boat.""
Tim Kolojay believes former President Trump is the only one who can win.
""I’ve never been to a Trump rally, but he draws them like it’s unbelievable,"" Kolojay said.
Kolojay has voted for President Trump in the past two election cycles and plans to support him once again.
""I thought he was going to win the general election last time. I guess people are just upset with his actions and his attitudes,"" Kolojay said. ""I think with all these criminal indictments throwing at him, you always vote for the underdog. I say I vote for the underdog. And to me, he's become an underdog.""

Kolojay says he understands why the former president has faced criticism but also believes Trump’s policies were better for the country.
""I like a lot of things that Donald Trump did back in the four years he was there,"" Kolojay said. ""He may have spoken too loudly and too much on Twitter. He upset a lot of people. But as far as what he did for this country, I liked it.""

MI9CGYBP7I_JEXCYHQE44Z2BRR,Anti-Trump pundits celebrate DeSantis dropping out of GOP primary despite it helping their ‘biggest bogeyman’,By Brian Flood Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 5:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-trump-pundits-celebrate-desantis-dropping-out-gop-primary-despite-helping-biggest-bogeyman,"Fox News host Martha MacCallum interviewed former President Trump following Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., pulling out from the 2024 presidential race on The Big Weekend Show.
Liberal anti-Trump pundits regularly insist the former president is a threat to democracy and must be kept from a second term at all costs, but many of the most outspoken Trump critics in the media are celebrating Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropping out of the race.
DeSantis quit the 2024 Republican presidential contest and endorsed Trump on Sunday, just two days before the New Hampshire primary. Trump, already a heavy favorite to capture the nomination after easily winning the Iowa caucuses, has begun to consolidate most Republican support and is looking for a knockout blow this week against Nikki Haley.
While pundits such as CNN’s Jim Acosta and ""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro have openly expressed alarm over Trump, they weren’t particularly upset when one of his most serious challengers threw in the towel after a disappointing Iowa finish.

Author David Marcus said the reaction from prominent liberals proves they simply have an issue with populism. DeSantis ran for governor of Florida in 2018 as a Trump acolyte and has often been derided in the media for his style of governance.
""The left views DeSantis as a version of Trump, so they were never going to see the governor winning in a positive light, even if he thwarted their biggest bogeyman, which shows, it’s not really Trump they fear most, it’s populism,"" Marcus told Fox News Digital.
Navarro, who has called Trump a racist, criminal and threat to the country's foundations, said Monday on ""The View"" that when she first heard the DeSantis news, she celebrated by throwing her hands in the air and cheering.
""Drag brunches and Disney are alive, and the DeSantis presidential campaign is DEAD,"" Navarro wrote on Instagram. ""Hallelujah!""
CNN'S JIM ACOSTA CELEBRATES FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF VIRAL CONFRONTATION WITH TRUMP THAT COST HIM PRESS PASS
Jim Acosta recently posted on Instagram celebrating the five-year anniversary of his viral confrontation with former President Donald Trump.  ((AP Photo/Evan Vucci/Instagram/Screenshot)
CNN’s Acosta was among the faces of the mainstream media’s anti-Trump resistance during his administration. Acosta regularly clashed with the former president and members of his administration during press conferences and other events, and he often lapsed into editorializing despite having an ostensibly nonpartisan job. Since he took a weekend anchoring position at CNN after Biden took office, he has been openly left-wing in his stances and once said Trump was an ""insult to clowns.""
But Sunday, when Trump’s top rival dropped out, Acosta decided to applaud the occasion with Disney-themed jabs at the Florida governor.
""DeSantis spent a lot of time in the run up to the primaries and caucuses getting underway, going after woke-ism, going after targets like Walt Disney. And at the end, he went from Space Mountain to It’s a Small World… it just did not work,"" Acosta snarked.
Acosta also suggested GOP voters want the ""drama"" that comes with Trump.

The Lincoln Project, a fiercely anti-Trump group that reviles the former president as a dangerous authoritarian but suggested in 2021 it wanted Trump to be the 2024 nominee anyway, also mocked DeSantis on X.
""America's Sweetheart Ron DeSantis is hanging up his heels and suspending his presidential campaign. Take a look back with us at his spectacular disaster of a campaign. Laugh at what was, enjoy what could have been,"" the group posted to accompany a montage of unflattering DeSantis clips.
Former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, another vehemently anti-Trump voice in the press, took to social media with his reaction to DeSantis stepping aside.
""Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaha,"" Hasan wrote on X to caption news of DeSantis suspending his campaign.
Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, who left a cozy job at ESPN in 2020, so he’d be free to criticize Trump on YouTube, called DeSantis ""an utter trainwreck of a human being.""
The New York Times, which endorsed Biden in 2020, called the end of DeSantis’ campaign the culmination of a ""spectacular implosion"" in its report.
NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck believes anti-Trump pundits want to continue ""financial grift operations"" that were so profitable from 2016 through the 2020 election.
""Liberal journalists and pundits are ebullient with Ron DeSantis dropping out of the race because they know that, with Trump as the nominee, their financial grift operations can continue unabated,"" Houck told Fox News Digital, noting that many prominent reporters such as Acosta have written books critical of Trump.
""Acosta is only a semi-household name because of his cartoonish antics during the Trump years. Before that, no one knew who this guy was. Commentators like Ana Navarro were third-rate pundits on talk shows where they needed a Republican to serve as a doormat for the two or three liberals,"" Houck said.
Houck recalled then-CBS executive Les Moones admitting in 2016 that Trump entering the race was ""damn good for CBS,"" and said the notion remains true for much of the media.
""With the Biden years having seen widespread cuts and shutterings in the liberal, establishment press, a Trump romping has them weak in the knees at the prospect of their coffers refilling with sweet, sweet cash from terrified ‘resistance’ types, fearful a Trump presidency will be a dictatorship and end with them in labor camps,"" Houck said.
""If DeSantis had continued or become the nominee, one can't say definitively what would have happened to the press,"" he added. ""But, I feel safe in predicting that DeSantis's effectiveness in sparring with journalists over the years and control on his social media platforms would have frustrated them until they spontaneously combusted into yellowed pieces of newsprint.""
NBC NEWS REPORTER SAYS TRUMP CAMPAIGN STOPPED HIM FROM COVERING NEW HAMPSHIRE EVENT
Houck’s colleague, NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham feels ""journalists have used Trump for years to paint themselves in the most heroic colors as pro-democracy,"" when they're actually just pro-Democrat.
""If DeSantis wanted to be Trump without the baggage, the reporters just feared a smarter, more effective, less cartoonish Trump. They were glad to get rid of him to stick to the original formula they love to confront,"" Graham told Fox News Digital.
""Is there anything less self-aware than Jim Acosta reporting ‘it seems like Republican voters want Trump and the drama?’ They all thrive on Trump and the drama,"" Graham continued. ""They are the dramatists, and they can't stop writing this drama.""

MIDUUZTQ0K_5WVMQ2HCNE7WZTR,California community alarmed by homeless camps found in underground caves: 'Huge safety hazard',By Bailee Hill Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/california-community-alarmed-homeless-camps-found-underground-caves-huge-safety-hazard,"Tracy Rojas lives near the caves and she joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how she discovered the caves and what the city is doing to ensure public safety.
One California woman is sounding the alarm after her community discovered homeless people were residing in underground caves, warning the below-ground encampments are a threat to public safety.
Tracy Rojas lives in the Modesto neighborhood where the caves were discovered. She joined ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss how local officials have handled the discovery amid lingering concerns surrounding the safety repercussions.
""We were told to just keep an eye on the area,"" Rojas told Carley Shimkus and Todd Piro on Friday. ""If we saw people going over the embankment to call it in or report it on an app that they have called Modesto Go app, and that they would continue to patrol, and that just wasn't satisfactory.""

""It's a safety issue, not only for the homeless who are living in there with the rains and the water rising, but children can get in there,"" she continued. ""A number of things. It's just a huge safety hazard.""
Rojas said she was notified of the encampments, which are about 20 ft. below the street level, during a community cleanup near the Tuolumne River. While speaking to a volunteer park ranger, Rojas said she was told about the shocking discovery of encampments in underground caves.
Modesto residents and police officers cleaned out homeless camps in underground caves. They reportedly found personal belongings, drugs and weapons. (Tracy Rojas, 'Fox & Friends First' screengrab)
""In that conversation, he advised that they had discovered eight caves along the riverbank, and when I heard caves, I considered just a dugout in the dirt. Something very simple. Maybe a little bit of shelter,"" she said. ""It wasn't until later on that afternoon when one of the volunteers shared with me and my neighbors a video of what exactly was found down along the riverbank.""
""As you can see, that is more than just a single little dugout in the side of a riverbank. It is a home practically underground,"" she continued.
Volunteers teamed up with the Modesto Police Department over the weekend to remove 7,600 pounds of trash near the area, according to CBS News.

Rojas said the eight caves were cleared of furnishings, personal belongings, weapons, and drugs.
""This particular area has been plagued by vagrancy and illegal camps, which have raised concerns due to the fact that these camps were actually caves dug into the riverbanks,"" the Modesto Police Department said in a statement.
Despite the massive cleanup effort, which reportedly wasn't the first of its kind, Rojas said she is worried the issue will persist as the state's homeless crisis continues to spiral.
""They had put up the caution tape in the afternoon,"" Rojas said. ""By that evening, they had already gone down there. The homeless. There's already stuff in that cave. People have already started lining the riverbank there, if you will, and setting up shop again. And they come at night.""
""They leave in the morning while all the news media is there, and then they come at night, and there was already stuff back in that cave,"" she continued.

MIOI1PDNO5_MSQM8OQLSV3SMT0,Saudi Arabia opens its first liquor store in over 70 years as kingdom further liberalizes,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 5:15pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/saudi-arabia-opens-first-liquor-store-over-70-years-kingdom-further-liberalizes,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
JERUSALEM (AP) — A liquor store has opened in Saudi Arabia for the first time in over 70 years, a diplomat reported Wednesday, a further socially liberalizing step in the once-ultraconservative kingdom that is home to the holiest sites in Islam.
While restricted to non-Muslim diplomats, the store in Riyadh comes as Saudi Arabia's assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to make the kingdom a tourism and business destination as part of ambitious plans to slowly wean its economy away from crude oil.
SAUDI ARABIA RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO AGREE TO PALESTINIAN STATE WITH FRESH DEMAND
However, challenges remain both from the prince's international reputation after the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi as well as internally with the conservative Islamic mores that have governed its sandy expanses for decades.
The store sits next to a supermarket in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a socially sensitive topic in Saudi Arabia. The diplomat walked through the store Wednesday, describing it as similar to an upscale duty free shop at a major international airport.
Liquor sales had long been banned in the conservative Saudi Arabian nation.
The store stocks liquor, wine and only two types of beer for the time being, the diplomat said. Workers at the store asked customers for their diplomatic identifications and for them to place their mobile phones inside of pouches while inside. A mobile phone app allows purchases on an allotment system, the diplomat said.
Saudi officials did not respond to a request for comment regarding the store.
However, the opening of the store coincides with a story run by the English-language newspaper Arab News, owned by the state-aligned Saudi Research and Media Group, on new rules governing alcohol sales to diplomats in the kingdom.
It described the rules as meant ""to curb the uncontrolled importing of these special goods and liquors within the diplomatic consignments."" The rules took effect Monday, the newspaper reported.
For years, diplomats have been able to import liquor through a specialty service into the kingdom, for consumption on diplomatic grounds.
Those without access in the past have purchased liquor from bootleggers or brewed their own inside their homes. However, the U.S. State Department warns that those arrested and convicted for consuming alcohol can face ""long jail sentences, heavy fines, public floggings and deportation.""
Drinking alcohol is considered haram, or forbidden, in Islam. Saudi Arabia remains one of the few nations in the world with a ban on alcohol, alongside its neighbor Kuwait and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.
Saudi Arabia has banned alcohol since the early 1950s. Then-King Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia's founding monarch, stopped its sale following a 1951 incident in which one of his sons, Prince Mishari, became intoxicated and used a shotgun to kill British vice consul Cyril Ousman in Jeddah.
Following Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and a militant attack on the Grand Mosque at Mecca, Saudi Arabia’s rulers soon further embraced Wahhabism, an ultraconservative Islamic doctrine born in the kingdom. That saw strict gender separation, a women's driving ban and other measures put in place.
Under Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, the kingdom has opened movie theaters, allowed women to drive and hosted major music festivals. But political speech and dissent remains strictly criminalized, potentially at the penalty of death.

As Saudi Arabia prepares for a $500 billion futuristic city project called Neom, reports have circulated that alcohol could be served at a beach resort there.
Sensitivities, however, remain. After an official suggested that ""alcohol was not off the table"" at Neom in 2022, within days he soon no longer was working at the project."
MML0UYYAUO_FRAKZK7D4VQH9A7,Democrats blast impeachment inquiry after GOP witness says he was 'unaware' of Joe Biden's role in family biz,By Brooke Singman Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 5:55pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-blast-impeachment-inquiry-gop-witness-unaware-joe-biden-role-family-biz,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., discusses Hunter Biden’s upcoming appearance for his deposition on ‘Hannity.’
House Democrats blasted the impeachment inquiry on Thursday after a witness testified he was ""unaware"" of any involvement President Biden may have had in his son’s business dealings.
Hunter Biden’s business associate, Mervyn Yan, testified behind closed-doors before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees Thursday after receiving a subpoena.
House Republicans, on the other hand, said Yan's testimony raised many questions about the nature of the Biden family's business dealings in China.
A source with direct knowledge of Yan’s testimony told Fox News Digital that Yan told congressional investigators he is ""unaware of any involvement President Biden may have had with his son’s business pursuits.""

Yan, despite interacting with Hunter Biden and James Biden, ""never met, spoke to, did business with or had any personal or professional communication with President Biden,"" the source said.
The source also said Yan testified he ""does not possess any materials or information bearing on President Biden’s alleged involvement in his family’s business dealings.""
""Just like every other witness in Chairman Comer’s ‘clueless investigation’ — that even House Republicans are calling a ‘parade of embarrassments’ and ‘a disaster’— Mervyn Yan testified to the committee today that he has no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden and that, to his knowledge, President Biden was not involved in, did not profit from and took no official actions in relation to his family’s business dealings,"" the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, ranking member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Thursday.

But apparently, Raskin was not at the deposition Thursday.
""@RepRaskin wasn't even at the deposition today,"" House Judiciary Republicans tweeted Thursday evening. ""So how would he know this?""
House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said Thursday he plans to release the transcript of Yan’s interview. Comer said Yan’s testimony raised more questions for the committee’s investigation regarding the Biden family’s interactions with China.
""Mervyn Yan admitted on the record the Bidens had no experience in the energy and infrastructure sectors and was not sure what they brought to the table,"" Comer said Thursday. ""His testimony raises many questions about the Bidens’ dealings with the Chinese government-linked energy firm, and we hope to learn more tomorrow from Rob Walker, another Biden family associate.""
HUNTER DEMANDED $10M FROM CHINESE ENERGY FIRM BECAUSE 'BIDENS ARE THE BEST,' HAVE 'CONNECTIONS'
The committee is expected to hear testimony from Rob Walker on Friday.
Walker is scheduled to appear at 10 a.m. Friday on Capitol Hill after being subpoenaed by both House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in November.

In notifying Walker of the subpoena, Comer and Jordan note that his Robinson Walker, LLC received a payment of $3 million from State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company, less than two months after Biden left the Obama administration. Comer and Jordan said that in the three months following that payment, Robinson Walker, LLC made ""incremental payments totaling over $1 million to Biden family members and their companies, including Hallie Biden and entities associated with Hunter Biden and James Biden.""
Comer and Jordan have stressed that evidence collected by congressional investigators reveals that President Biden ""was at least aware of some of his family’s business ventures and sought to influence potential business deals that financially benefited his family.""

Comer and Jordan believe Walker can provide information related to whether Joe Biden, as vice president and/or president ""took any official action or effected any change in government policy because of money or other things of value provided to himself or his family, including whether concerns that Chinese sources may release additional evidence about their business relationships with the Biden family have had any impact on official acts performed by President Biden or U.S. foreign policy; abused his office of public trust by providing foreign interests with access to him and his office in exchange for payments to his family or him; or abused his office of public trust by knowingly participating in a scheme to enrich himself or his family by giving foreign interests the impression that they would receive access to him and his office in exchange for payments to his family or him.""

Former President Trump congratulated Ron DeSantis Sunday for running a ""great campaign"" for president after the Florida governor dropped out of the 2024 race.
DeSantis ended his campaign and endorsed Trump, saying in part on X, ""It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare to this day to attack him.""
Trump spoke at a campaign event in Rochester, N.H., ahead of the 2024 primary and praised DeSantis for ""doing a very good job."" He also said he looks forward to working with the former presidential candidate and others to defeat President Biden.

Fox News’ Kayleigh McEnany said Trump will need a ""conciliatory"" tone for the next several months if he wants to beat Biden in November.
""I think he [Trump] gets the DeSantis voter both in the primary and the general. The DeSantis voter tends to be a traditional conservative person of faith, and that naturally translates to Donald Trump. Where I think his challenge is both here and going forward into a general election, is winning over the Nikki Haley voter, winning over the establishment voter, winning over the independent, which is why I think that vice presidential pick is so important,"" McEnany said on ""The Big Weekend Show.""
""You must pick someone who helps to bring in that bloc because I believe the conservatives, the base, is going to come home, show up, rain or shine. You need the independent, you need the suburban women. You need that tone.""

""Boston is on trial to redress historical injustices that flow directly and indirectly from the institution of chattel slavery, and the examination of the truth and expansion of the narrative that will give us that evidentiary pool from which to argue for repair,"" task force member L’Merchie Frazier said.
The Boston City Council voted to form the task force in December 2022.
This is the latest attempt of a local government trying to enact reparations. Similar efforts are underway on the federal level and across the country, usually in Democratically controlled states and cities like San Francisco.
New York in December established a commission to explore the best methods of providing reparations to descendants of slaves.

Byrne Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 4:15am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/newly-elected-school-board-pennsylvania-reclaims-indigenous-mascot-rejects-cancel-culture,"Former Pennsylvania Democrat Steve Kochanowski joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why he changed his party affiliation as tens of thousands of voters ditch the Democratic Party in Biden's home state.
A Pennsylvania community reclaimed its local Indigenous history and a school's popular tribesman mascot last week, just two months after five new school committee members won elections and ran on pro-Native American platforms.
The Southern York County School District (SYCSD) school board voted 7-2 on Thursday to allow Susquehannock High School to bring back its traditional Warriors logo.
""This vote was the Lexington & Concord moment in the effort to defeat cancel culture,"" Native American activist and historian Andre Billeaudeuax told Fox News Digital, after lobbying on behalf of the traditional image that pays homage to the Indigenous Susquehannock people.
NATIVE AMERICAN GROUP THAT WANTED ‘REDSKINS’ REMOVAL IS FUNDED BY SOROS FOUNDATION, OTHER LEFTIST ORGS
All seven votes in favor of the logo came from members who were elected since a previous board voted to remove the logo back in 2021.
""The SYCSD school board stands as a role model and blueprint for other communities fighting for their Native names and imagery,"" the North Dakota-based Native American Guardians Association (NAGA) said in a statement, after it presented its case last week at the board meeting.

School District school board in Nov. 2023 — running on pro-Native American platforms. They voted in January 2024 to reclaim a local high school's Native American logo and mascot.

Five of the newcomers were elected in November after the sudden removal of the popular image in 2021 — and an effort to rewrite the region’s Native American history — spurred community anger and action.
""This movement was about erasing Native American culture and I wasn’t about to stand for it,"" Jennifer Henkel, a mother of three children and one of the new school board members, told Fox News Digital.
""The SYCSD school board stands as a role model and blueprint for other communities fighting for their Native names and imagery.""
She and the other four new school board members, including her husband, Nathan Henkel, had never before run for elected office, she said.

Their arrival, however, is apparently not welcome by everyone in the community.
""They came into their new positions with bravado to push their personal agendas, and not with humility to learn their jobs,"" wrote Deborah Kalina, a former member of the school board, in a recent guest editorial that appeared in the York Daily Record.

""To put the mascot away is respect for the past, for the present and for the future,"" Katy Isennock, identified as a school alumna, mother and Native American, also told the same local outlet after the vote last week.
Henkel said she was moved to political action by the negative impact on the community of the COVID-19 lockdowns and school closures — and by a cancel-culture effort to rewrite local history to stir public sentiment against the Warriors image.
The outrage instead fueled the community's effort to save its local history.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO WAS REVERED AS THE ‘PATRON SAINT’ UNTIL HE WAS CANCELED: LENNI LENAPE CHIEF TAMMANY
""Current research findings demonstrate that there is no evidence that the Susquehannock Indians lived in or around the municipalities that comprise the Southern York County School District,"" the board’s diversity committee wrote in a 2021 study.
Yet that diversity committee report appears to conflict with centuries of known local history. European explorers wrote about the Susquehannock people who lived along the Susquehanna River as early as 1608, while historians believe they lived in the area centuries earlier.
Native American activist and historian Andre Billeaudeaux is the author of the book ""How the Redskins Got Their Name."" He has lobbied on behalf of the traditional image that pays homage to the Indigenous Susquehannock people.  (Courtesy Andre Billeaudeaux)
Susquehannock ""communities were located along the Susquehanna (River), especially in Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster and York counties,"" reports the website of the Susquehanna National Heritage Area, citing several historical sources.
The Native peoples, the website also said, ""lived in large fortified towns, the largest of which may have had a population of nearly 3,000 people.""
""This movement was about erasing Native American culture and I wasn’t about to stand for it.""
The diversity report apparently relied heavily on information provided by the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) to stoke opposition to the Susquehannock Warriors mascot. The powerful Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group is supported by taxpayer dollars and by left-wing activist groups.
It’s the same group that led efforts to encourage the NFL’s Washington, D.C. franchise — now the Commanders — to change its name from the Redskins, while also targeting hundreds of other sports-team images around the nation.

The NCAI ""receives grants from left-wing foundations like the Ford Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and George Soros' Open Society Foundation, reports InfluenceWatch.org.
The NCAI, a major Native American rights organization, has taken a strong stance against the use of Native American imagery.
The NCAI ""has tracked the retirement of more than 200 unsanctioned Native ‘themed’ mascots since 2019, and has supported legislation banning the use of these mascots in multiple states,"" the group said in a statement to Fox News Digital in Sept. 2023.

Fox News Digital reached out to the group for comment regarding the Pennsylvania school district news.
A report the NCAI issued in 2013 included a lengthy history of the Redskins franchise, but did not mention the two influential Native Americans who inspired the organization’s name and imagery.
Blackfoot chief John Two Guns White Calf is shown at left — he served as inspiration for the Washington Redskins logo (right), which represented the NFL franchise on the field from 1972 to 2020. The franchise's original logo from its founding in 1932 was inspired by Lenni Lenape chief Tammany, dubbed ""The Patron Saint of America"" by the Founding Fathers and the generation that fought the American Revolution.  (Getty Images)
One was Lenni Lenape chief King Tammany, who was dubbed the ""Patron Saint of America"" for his role in motivating colonial troops in the American Revolution; and the other was Blackfoot chief John Two Guns White Calf, whose face appeared on the side of Redskins helmets for 48 years.

""It took a lot of bravery for people in York County to stand up and fight back against the agenda, like David against Goliath, and the difference they made is incredible,"" said Billeaudeaux.

White House officials declined to say whether President Biden has considered federalizing the Texas National Guard amid his clash with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.
White House National Security Adviser John Kirby sidestepped questions on the topic during a brief gaggle with reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. Abbott has used the Texas National Guard to block agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection from accessing certain areas along the U.S.-Mexico border.
""Is the administration considering federalizing the Texas National Guard?"" a reporter asked Thursday.
""We talked about this the other day,"" Kirby began. ""I don't have any decisions to speak to for the president. I don't have anything on that.""

Abbott on Wednesday declared that the Biden administration had broken its federal compact with the state of Texas by allowing an ""invasion"" of illegal immigrants to cross the border.
Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, called on Biden to federalize the National Guard on Tuesday after it became clear Abbott wasn't backing down.

""Governor Greg Abbott is using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border. If Abbott is defying yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, [Biden] needs to establish sole federal control of the Texas National Guard now,"" he wrote.
Abbott is fighting multiple legal battles with the Biden administration, which has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass. Texas has also filed lawsuits against the administration, which cut razor wire set up by the state on the Rio Grande to prevent migrants from illegally crossing into Texas, as well as the establishment of buoys on the river.

Henry Cuellar spoke with Fox News Digital along the Rio Grande after touring a section of the southern border with a bipartisan congressional delegation.
MCALLEN, Texas — Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, is warning fellow Democrats, including President Biden, to prepare for border security to be a top election issue in the 2024 cycle.
Standing along the Rio Grande in Hidalgo, Texas, Saturday, Cuellar emphatically told Fox News Digital the situation at the southern border will ""absolutely"" be on voters’ minds this year.
He traveled to the border this weekend as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation that also included Reps. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas; Randy Weber, R-Texas; and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas.

""If they're looking at the same polls I've been looking at, the American public doesn't like what's happening,"" Cuellar said of fellow Democrats.
""I represent an area where it's almost 80% Hispanic, a lot of Democrats,"" he said. ""So, yeah, the polls are showing that it's an important issue.""
Speaking of Biden, he said, ""It’s in the president’s best interest politically to come up with a solution on border security.""
WATCH: MIGRANTS CLAIM ASYLUM ON COLD JANUARY NIGHT AS CBP UNION LEADER TALKS BORDER CRISIS
A Fox News poll from last month found that eight in 10 voters think the situation at the southern border is either an emergency (34%) or a major problem (45%).
The group of lawmakers toured sections of the border Saturday and met with border and immigration officials. White House and Senate negotiators are working to cobble together a deal on border reform in exchange for GOP support for Biden’s $106 billion supplemental funding request for Ukraine, Israel and other issues.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss his support for former President Donald Trump in the primaries, avoiding a government shutdown and House Speaker Mike Johnson.
Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida is traveling to Montana for a weekend of campaigning for Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., amid rumors he is soon launching a Senate bid in the Big Sky State.
Rosendale has confirmed that he is considering a run for the Montana Senate in 2024, but has not yet made any official announcements.
Gaetz amplified the chatter Wednesday, telling Fox News Digital that he is campaigning in Montana because he believes Rosendale is what ""the Senate needs.""
""I’m going to campaign for Matt Rosendale because he’s exactly the shock to the system the Senate needs. Also I hear Montana is lovely in January,"" Gaetz told Fox.

N3PGMUZQCC_8BOAMBMHT1L2K56,Norovirus alert: FDA warns of contaminated raw oysters from Mexico,By Melissa Rudy Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 4:47pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/health/norovirus-alert-fda-warns-contaminated-raw-oysters-mexico,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Raw oysters from certain parts of Mexico could be a source of norovirus, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning.
The agency has advised restaurants and retailers to stop selling and to dispose of oysters harvested from Bahia Salina, Sonora, Mexico — which were shipped by freight carrier Sociedad Acuicola GolPac on Dec. 18, Dec. 19 and Dec. 27, 2023.
Consumers are also advised against eating these oysters and to seek medical attention for any symptoms of norovirus.
NOROVIRUS SPREAD ON THE WASHINGTON PACIFIC CREST TRAIL — WHAT TO KNOW AND HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF
The alert is geared primarily toward California restaurants, retailers and consumers, although the FDA noted that the potentially contaminated oysters may have also been shipped to other states.
The FDA was first alerted to an outbreak of norovirus in San Diego County on Jan. 10, which was linked to oysters shipped from Mexico.

""An investigation is ongoing and the number of illnesses is being tracked,"" the FDA’s alert said
""Mexican shellfish authorities have initiated an investigation into the source of the illnesses and have closed the Bahia Salina growing area to harvest on Jan. 12, 2024.""
CRUISES SEE SURGE OF NOROVIRUS, HIGHEST IN DECADE: CDC
The contaminated oysters may ""look, smell and taste normal,"" but can cause illness if eaten raw, particularly among those with compromised immune systems, the agency said.
Dr. Edward Liu, chief of infectious diseases at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital that it is likely the oysters grew in contaminated water.
""This virus is more common in colder months and can infect large groups of people due to its highly contagious nature,"" he said.
The FDA warned that the contaminated oysters may ""look, smell and taste normal"" — but can cause illness if they are eaten raw. (iStock)
Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, pointed out that the biggest problem is that people tend to eat oysters raw, which leads to the highest amount of norovirus if contaminated.
""I would pay very careful attention to these alerts and avoid all oysters coming from these areas in Mexico,"" he told Fox News Digital.
Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that causes inflammation of the stomach or intestines, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
While it is often referred to as a ""stomach flu"" or ""stomach bug,"" it is not related to influenza.
Primary symptoms of the virus include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea and stomach pain.
Some people may also experience fever, headache and body aches.

Frequent vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration for some patients.
""The treatment is supportive with hydration until the symptoms improve,"" said Liu of New Jersey. ""The most vulnerable people are the very young or old or immunocompromised, who can't tolerate dehydration.""

Symptoms typically develop within 12 to 48 hours of exposure and tend to subside within one to three days, the CDC stated.
Newer stool tests (PCR-based tests) can detect the virus and may be available in hospital emergency rooms and some physician offices, Liu noted, but older stool cultures will not detect the virus.
""The most vulnerable people are the very young or old or immunocompromised.""
""Outbreaks have happened due to contaminated food and are more common in certain settings, like cruise ships and patient facilities,"" he said.

To prevent the spread of the disease, Lui stressed the importance of good hand hygiene and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces.
""Careful handwashing and use of gloves can help food handlers from catching it or passing it along,"" Siegel added.

People who experience symptoms of illness after consuming oysters should seek medical attention and report their symptoms to their local health department, the FDA advised.

N5TMQLEG34_DCYNW2SDTKWZE4L,Wealthy Chicago suburb proposes allowing residents to sign up to house migrants,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 2:48pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wealthy-chicago-suburb-proposes-allowing-residents-sign-up-house-migrants,"FOX Business’ Kelly Saberi reports on Texas bus companies suing the sanctuary city of Chicago.
A suburban lawmaker outside Chicago proposed that residents be able to sign up to host migrants in their homes, noting, ""We do have a very affluent community.""
Naperville, Illinois, Councilman Josh McBroom voiced the notion during a city council meeting last week, and a conservative account reacted to the clip on X on Tuesday.
""In light of the fact, I’m not going to support using other people’s money to house or [for] aid. I do know that there’s a lot of people that do care, and I think we live in a compassionate community, so before we go down the road of, you know, following suit on some of these other cities are taking action on, my idea would be, let’s find out, let’s find out who’s willing to help,"" McBroom said.
""You know, we do hear from constituents on both sides of this; what are we going to do to preemptively stop this? And then we hear from people that tell us we should do more, so we do have a very affluent community, a lot of big homes, and what I’d like to do is direct staff to create a sign-up sheet … for individuals that would be willing to house migrant families,"" he continued. ""And if there’s people that would do that, God bless them. So, if we could raise awareness in that way, I think we need to find out. I think we need to find out who would be willing to house migrant families. That would be my new business. I would be looking for support from the diocese. Any questions, discussion, happy to have that.""

ELON MUSK ISSUES WARNING AFTER NYC STUDENTS PUSHED OUT OF SCHOOL TO HOUSE MIGRANTS: 'WILL COME FOR YOUR HOMES'
In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey, who declared a state of emergency over the migrant crisis during the summer, asked residents in August to consider sponsoring migrant families by hosting them in their homes as the state's shelter system reached capacity, according to local reports.
X owner Elon Musk warned this month that the government could go beyond voluntary sign-ups and force residents to house migrants in their homes should they run out of shelter and hotel space. Musk's comment came in response to New York City moving around 2,000 migrants from a shelter at Floyd Bennett Field to a Brooklyn public high school overnight during a storm, prompting school officials to close the building to students the next day and implement remote learning. Parents were outraged over the loss of learning ahead of crucial college entry exams.

Another Chicago suburb has been battered by a string of recent crimes committed by migrants who live in or near the Windy City, according to the police chief of Oak Brook, Illinois, who revealed just days ago that nearly 40 migrants had been arrested there from October to mid-January, mostly for alleged property crimes.
Chicago estimates about 38,000 migrants have arrived in the Windy City over the past 18 months as tens of thousands more come to Democrat-led cities such as New York and Denver from the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrat city leaders have largely placed blame on Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who says he's lifting the burden from small border communities through his bussing operation to send migrants to areas that have previously claimed to be sanctuary destinations for illegal immigrants.
The Biden administration, however, is facing mounting criticism over its handling of the border crisis during an election year.

House Republicans, vying to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, note that under President Biden's watch, the U.S. tripled the number of border encounters to 1.9 million in 2021, followed the next year by 2.7 million, and then 3.2 million apprehensions in fiscal 2023. And those figures represent just the migrants detected crossing the border; Republicans note that Border Patrol agents have been pulled off patrol to process large groups, leaving hundreds of miles of border with no security.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has reached out not only to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a plea, but to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as well, asking him to help stop a planned research study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which it claims involves cruelty to animals.
The study, intended to gather information about age-related cognitive decline, involves disrupting the sleep of aged marmosets, which are small, long-tailed South American monkeys.
""As the governor of the state with the largest number of older Americans, [DeSantis] is in a unique position to condemn — before they begin — planned ‘aging’ experiments on tiny marmoset monkeys,"" PETA articulated in an email to Fox News Digital about its outreach.

""PETA has obtained documents showing that [a research team] is going to be waking the monkeys every 15 minutes all night long by blaring loud noise at them,"" the email continued.
In the letter to DeSantis, which was shown exclusively to Fox News Digital, Kathy Guillermo, senior vice president of PETA’s Laboratory Investigations Department, described the study as ""horrific.""

Ron DeSantis of Florida as well, hoping that he might step in as the governor of a state with ""the largest number of older Americans.""  (iStock)
""Keeping a monkey from sleeping — considered a form of torture in humans that can ultimately result in death — won’t mimic insomnia in people,"" she wrote.
""This proposed experiment is so cruel that it’s classified by the university as what’s called a ‘Column E’ study — meaning it causes distress and pain without any relief.""
NEW ALZHEIMER’S TREATMENT ACCELERATES REMOVAL OF PLAQUE FROM THE BRAIN IN CLINICAL TRIALS
The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is led by Agnès Lacreuse, a professor at the University of Massachusetts–Amherst, and will be conducted at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, according to records on the NIH website.
PETA sent this letter to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asking for his help in stopping a planned study to take place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It says the Sunshine State has over 412,000 PETA members and supporters in Florida. (PETA)
PETA sent a second, more detailed letter to the NIH.
""The proposed experiments involve causing nonhuman primates irreversible harm for experiments that offer little to no new scientifically valuable knowledge or human benefit,"" stated the letter, which is signed by Katherine V. Roe, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at PETA’s Laboratory Investigations Department.
FASTING COULD REDUCE SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, STUDIES SUGGEST: 'PROFOUND EFFECTS'
Roe urged the NIH to ""consider discontinuing funding for these extremely invasive experiments so that those resources can be directed toward research that could actually help our ever-growing aging population.""
The study, intended to gather information about age-related cognitive decline, involves disrupting the sleep of aged marmosets, which are small, long-tailed South American monkeys. (iStock)
In a statement to Fox News Digital, Roe of PETA acknowledged that ""improving the lives of the aging population in the U.S. is of ever-increasing importance and deserves serious attention from the scientific community.""

The study will be conducted at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, according to NIH records. (iStock)
In later phases, they will be awakened over the course of three nights in a row.
""The animals, attended to by specially trained veterinarians in carefully managed conditions, will be awakened by sound — short tones played at about the same volume as a normal conversation or an alarm clock,"" she said. ""The sound will be loud enough to wake the animals but not scare them.""

It would be ""unethical and difficult"" to use humans in a study to explore sleep’s role in the development of a disease like Alzheimer’s, researchers noted. (iStock)

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Activists in Mexico have published photos of steel and cement pilings from a government project that were driven directly through the roofs of sensitive limestone caves on the Yucatan peninsula.
The network of caves, sinkhole lakes and underground rivers along Mexico's Caribbean coast are both environmentally sensitive and have been found to hold some of the oldest human remains in North America.
AMLO INAUGURATES FIRST STRETCH OF COASTAL MEXICAN TOURIST RAIL LINE
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had promised that part of his controversial $20 billion tourist train project, known as the Maya Train, would run on an elevated causeway supported by pilings to avoid crushing or disturbing the caves and sinkhole lakes known as cenotes.
They provide the region’s only fresh water source, because there are no surface rivers on the flat, limestone peninsula.
Authorities from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, known as the INAH, had claimed that soil mapping studies would be carried out to ensure the supports for the causeway wouldn’t hit caves. But caver and water quality expert Guillermo DChristy said Monday that was a lie.
""The promise from the president and the director of the INAH was that they (the caves) would be protected,"" DChristy said. ""López Obrador lied. They aren't protecting the caves and sinkhole lakes. The damage is irreversible.""
The army-run company that is building the train did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the pilings.
DChristy found the pilot columns sunk through the caves Sunday at a cave complex known as Aktun Túyul, near the beach town of Xpu Ha, about 17 miles (27 kilometers) south of Playa del Carmen. The columns appear to be almost 3 feet (1 meter) wide, with a steel jacket and poured cement core. The cave complex is located on an unfinished section of the train that runs between Cancun and the beach town of Tulum.
Because the caves were dry some 10,000 years ago, humans and animals used them before they were mostly flooded at the end of the last Ice Age about 8,000 years ago, essentially preserving the relics from being disturbed.
In December, López Obrador inaugurated another, partly finished section of the train to the north and east, between Cancun and the colonial city of Campeche.
The 950-mile line runs in a rough loop around the Yucatan peninsula and it's meant to connect beach resorts and archaeological sites.
López Obrador has raced to finish the Maya Train project before he leaves office in September, rolling over the objections of ecologists, cave divers and archaeologists. He exempted it from normal permitting, public reporting and environmental impact statements, claiming it is vital to national security.

While officials have touted the train as utilitarian transport for freight and local residents, its only real source of significant income would be tourists. However, given its frequent stops, unwieldy route and lack of feasibility studies, it is unclear how many tourists will actually want to buy tickets.
The train was partly built by the Mexican army and will be run by the armed forces, to whom López Obrador has entrusted more projects than any other president in at least a century."

ROME (AP) — The Vatican tribunal has rejected a wrongful termination lawsuit brought by the Holy See’s former auditor general and ordered him to pay restitution in a case that exposed the unseemly side of Pope Francis’ financial reforms.
Libero Milone and his late deputy had sued the Holy See for 9.3 million euros, claiming they were essentially extorted by Vatican police and forced to resign in 2017 or risk arrest and prosecution for their work investigating and auditing the Holy See’s finances.
POPE FRANCIS SAYS ‘LURE OF CORRUPTION’ IS CONSTANT THREAT IN THE VATICAN
In a decision released Wednesday, the tribunal rejected their claims. The tribunal found that the main target of the lawsuit, the Vatican secretariat of state, couldn’t be held liable for the alleged harm suffered by Milone and his deputy, Ferruccio Panicco.
It ordered them to pay more than 110,000 euros in restitution to the secretariat of state and the office of the auditor general, which was also named in the lawsuit. Panicco died last year, but his estate remained as a plaintiff in the case.
A Vatican tribunal has rejected the wrongful termination suit brought by former first auditor general, Libero Milone.
Milone declined to comment late Wednesday.
In the lawsuit, the auditors said they uncovered astonishing financial malpractice in the ""viper’s nest"" of the Vatican after Francis began a process of financial housecleaning. They said they believed they were forced out because certain cardinals and monsignors ""felt threatened by the investigations and simple requests for clarification.""

They identified Cardinal Angelo Becciu, then the powerful chief of staff in the secretariat of state, as having orchestrated their ouster. But the tribunal found that Becciu wasn't acting in his official capacity in his dealings with them.

Watch him scamper about with his watchful parent close by at the Wildlife World Zoo in Litchfield, Arizona.
A rhinoceros was impregnated through embryo transfer in the first successful use of a method that conservationists said might later make it possible to save the nearly extinct northern white rhino subspecies.
In testing with another subspecies, the researchers created a southern white rhino embryo in a lab from an egg and sperm that had been previously collected from other rhinos and transferred it into a southern white rhino surrogate mother at the Ol-Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.
""The successful embryo transfer and pregnancy are a proof of concept and allow (researchers) to now safely move to the transfer of northern white rhino embryos — a cornerstone in the mission to save the northern white rhino from extinction,"" the group said in a statement Wednesday.
BABY SUMATRAN RHINO BORN IN ASIA BRINGS HOPE FOR CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES
However, the team only learned of the pregnancy after the surrogate mother died of a bacterial infection in November 2023. The rhino was infected when spores from the clostridium strain were released from the soil by floodwater, and the embryo was discovered during a post-mortem examination.

Still scientists are very optimistic about their findings.
""Now we have the clear evidence that an embryo that is frozen, thawed, produced in a test tube can produce new life and that is what we want for the northern white rhino,"" Professor Thomas Hildebrandt is lead researcher and the head of the Department of Reproduction at BioRescue .
Roughly 20,000 southern white rhinos remain in Africa. That subspecies as well as another species, the black rhino, are bouncing back from significant reduction in their populations due to poaching for their horns.
However, the northern white rhinoceros subspecies has only two known members left in the world.
WELCOME TO THE WORLD! FIRST WHITE RHINO BORN IN DECADES IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA
Najin, a 34-year-old, and her 23-year-old offspring, Fatu, are both incapable of natural reproduction, according to the Ol-Pejeta Conservancy where they live.
The last male white rhino, Sudan, was 45 when he was euthanized in 2018 due to age-related complications. He was Najin's sire.
Scientists stored his semen and that of four other dead rhinos, hoping to use them in in vitro fertilization with eggs harvested from female northern white rhinos to produce embryos that eventually will be carried by southern white rhino surrogate mothers.
Some conservation groups have argued that it is probably too late to save the northern white rhino with in vitro fertilization, as the species' natural habitat in Chad, Sudan, Uganda, Congo and Central African Republic has been ravaged by human conflict. Skeptics say the efforts should focus on other critically endangered species with a better chance at survival."
NH5L3TH6HH_MUO9NVXJO98R7HA,"Mites, yes, the tiny bugs are used in some cheese production",By Maeghan Dolph Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 3:30am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mites-cheese-production,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The ancient craft of cheese-making holds many surprises when it comes to methods that shape the flavors and textures of different varieties.
One intriguing tradition involves deliberately introducing mites to the cheese — which contributes to its distinct characteristics.
Despite the initial surprise, the practice of using mites in cheeses has been an integral part of the cultural and culinary traditions associated with these cheeses for generations.
PIZZA CHEFS BREAK GUINNESS WORLD RECORD FOR USING 1,001 VARIETIES OF CHEESE ON ONE ITALIAN STAPLE
Here's a deep dive into the details of this age-old practice.
Two well-known cheeses that undergo a process involving mites are Mimolette and Milbenkäse.
Hailing from France, particularly the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, Mimolette is initially coated with edible annatto to give it an orange hue.
It undergoes a lengthy aging process when cheese mites are intentionally introduced.
The mites consume the outer layer, creating unique pits and cracks. This process contributes to the cheese's distinct flavor, featuring nutty and savory notes, along with a crumbly texture.

Originated in Germany, Milbenkäse is crafted by applying a layer of rye flour to the cheese, creating an environment suitable for the growth of cheese mites. Over time, these mites consume both the rye flour and the cheese's surface.
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CHEESE
The outcome is a cheese with a porous texture and a distinctive flavor.
Yes, it's generally safe to eat cheese that has been cured with mites.
In traditional cheese-making practices, such as with Mimolette and Milbenkäse, cheese mites are intentionally introduced during the aging process. These tiny creatures contribute to the unique characteristics of the cheese, such as flavor and texture.

The mites themselves are microscopic and don't pose any harm to humans when consumed.
They are considered a natural part of the cheese-making process for these specific types of cheeses.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) temporarily banned Mimolette cheese in March 2013.

The FDA said inspectors found more than the permissible six mites per square inch crawling on the rinds — which raised health concerns.
However, after working to address these concerns and meet the FDA's standards, Mimolette was reintroduced in the U.S.
No, not all cheeses have mites.
Many other types of cheeses are produced without the use of mites, and their characteristics are shaped by different methods such as fermentation, salting and aging.
If you have particular preferences or concerns about mites in cheese, it's recommended you check the specifics of the cheese you're interested in for more information.

NKW6MYR61N_ZU9JKJMPU0NLTX6,Search for missing Navy SEALs in Arabian Sea called off,By Bradford Betz Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 7:17pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/search-missing-us-navy-seals-arabian-sea-called-off,"Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., joined 'Fox & Friends First' to react to the news that the search for the Navy SEALs has been called off and his take on the Biden administration's handling of Iranian aggression.
A search for two U.S. Navy SEALs who went missing at sea off the coast of Somalia this month has been called off, U.S. Central Command said Sunday.
The SEALs had been on a mission chasing shipments of Iranian-made weapons bound for Houthi rebels in Yemen. A U.S. official previously confirmed to Fox News Digital that the SEALs were attempting to board a ship they suspected was falsely flagged that could be smuggling weapons.
The two special forces operators were climbing on a ladder to board a vessel while on a mission in the Gulf of Aden when high waves knocked one into the sea. The second SEAL jumped in after the first as part of Navy SEAL protocol to help a partner in distress, and they both vanished.
""We regret to announce that after a 10-day exhaustive search, our two missing U.S. Navy SEALS have not been located and their status has been changed to deceased,"" U.S. CENTCOM said in a statement, adding that it is now conducting recovery operations.

Airborne and naval platforms from the U.S., Japan and Spain continuously searched more than 21,000 square miles for the missing SEALs.
Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, the U.S. Coast Guard Atlantic Area Command, University of San Diego – Scripts Institute of Oceanography, and the Office of Naval Research – Oceanographic support also assisted in the search, CENTCOM said.

""We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honor their sacrifice and example,"" Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla said in a statement. ""Our prayers are with the SEALs’ families, friends, the U.S. Navy, and the entire Special Operations community during this time.""
The names of the SEALs have not been released as family notifications continue.
The SEALs’ Jan. 11 raid marked the latest seizure by the Navy and its allies of weapon shipments bound for the rebels, who have launched a series of attacks that threaten global trade in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over Israel's war against the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip. The seized missile components included types likely used in those attacks.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, discusses negotiations about border security and aid to Ukraine on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
FIRST ON FOX: Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, is sending a memo to GOP colleagues ahead of Wednesday afternoon's closed-door meeting on Ukraine, warning lawmakers about the latest Department of Defense (DOD) report that he said detailed the ""shortcomings in monitoring U.S. aid to Ukraine.""
The January 2024 report, the most recent in a series of government watchdog publications highlighting deficiencies in overseeing U.S. aid to Ukraine, outlines the inadequacies of both the Biden administration and the Ukrainian Armed Forces in effectively monitoring U.S.-supplied weapons.
The report from the Inspector General specifically delves into enhanced end-use monitoring (EEUM), a classification reserved for weapons that ""incorporate sensitive technology,"" are ""particularly susceptible to diversion or misuse,"" or could have ""serious consequences"" if diverted or misused.
According to the report, a substantial 59%, or $1.005 billion out of the total $1.699 billion value of EEUM-designated weapons sent to Ukraine, were classified as ""delinquent."" This means that they were not monitored in accordance with DOD standards.
JD VANCE: BIDEN IS THREATENING TEXAS OVER THE BORDER

""Claims of radical transparency and tracking of U.S. weapons in Ukraine are simply not accurate,"" Vance wrote in the memo. ""Assertions that ‘there is no evidence of illicit transfer of EEUM defense articles provided to Ukraine’ sidestep the reality that an accurate, up-to-date inventory of U.S.- supplied weapons in Ukraine – which the DOD IG report demonstrates that the U.S. does not have – is necessary to determine whether weapons have fallen into the wrong hands.""
The report also noted the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) and U.S. personnel didn't properly monitor important defense items, making it difficult to know if they were misused or stolen. The report revealed that the UAF failed to provide expenditure reports by serial number to U.S. personnel.
Vance wrote, ""U.S. personnel on the ground could not keep up with the volume of weapons streaming into Ukraine and failed to keep an accurate, timely record of them"" and that, ""There was no live, comprehensive database of equipment sent to Ukraine, and systemic failures inhibited the proper validation of reports of lost or expended equipment.""
Lastly, Vance wrote in the memo that ""EEUM procedures were not designed for use in war zones like Ukraine, and were thus less effective in ensuring oversight of U.S.-supplied weapons.""
""There were no official procedures for conducting EEUM in a hostile environment like Ukraine’s until December 2022 – more than nine months after this latest iteration of the Ukraine-Russia conflict began,"" he said.

RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS WEIGH BILL TO SEIZE PROPERTY FROM THOSE WHO CRITICIZE PUTIN'S INVASION OF UKRAINE
Vance, a vocal critic of more aid to Ukraine without proper oversight alongside a handful of other Republicans, previously said the U.S. needs to accept that Ukraine must ""cede some territory"" to Russia and that American leadership must ensure the U.S. is ""not writing more blank checks"" to fund Kyiv's forces.
Lawmakers have a private Senate GOP conference meeting to discuss additional aid to Ukraine on Wednesday afternoon as the White House has already depleted the amount of funds it can send without congressional approval. Border security is the key to more Ukraine assistance.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have remained in lockstep when it comes to pairing Ukraine aid and border security together, despite several dissenting voices in the GOP arguing they should be voted on separately.

Negotiations to secure a deal on the border are ongoing, and it's unclear when an agreement will be finalized. But it will likely face an uphill battle when it does get a vote in the upper chamber and makes it to the GOP-controlled House.

Former San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin claimed the city has been experiencing a ""hard turn to the right"" in recent years in a new interview.
Boudin, the former far-left DA who was financed by leftist billionaire George Soros and recalled from office in 2022 amid critics accusing him of soft-on-crime policies, told Politico in a piece published Wednesday that San Francisco is not as progressive as people think.
On the contrary, he claimed that it’s becoming more right wing, and noted his recall is part of the evidence for the change.

The former prosecutor, who now leads a criminal justice center at the University of California in Berkeley, told Politico, ""San Francisco is not nearly as progressive as its reputation, and my recall was only one small piece of evidence in support of that claim. Look at the recall of the school board. Look at the fact that the city has never had a progressive mayor other than perhaps Art Agnos.""
Boudin also argued that because there are a bunch of billionaires in San Francisco, and that mainstream Democratic Party officials hail from the city, that means it isn’t progressive.
""Look at the fact that the city is home to more billionaires per capita than probably any other jurisdiction in the world. Look at the fact that the city’s made a hard turn to the right in the last couple of years,"" he said.
""Look at the fact that the politicians that have come out of San Francisco on the national stage are anything but progressive: they’re mainstream centrist Democrats, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, etc.,"" he added.

Elsewhere in the interview, Boudin also denied there is an organic American backlash to progressive prosecutors like himself, noting that concerted efforts to oust them come from power centers in the country.
""I don’t think there is really a backlash in the traditional sense because you don’t see voters rejecting the progressive policies or candidates that they’ve endorsed except in very, very, very few cases,"" he said, later adding, ""The reality is the attacks on so-called progressive prosecutors are coming overwhelmingly from places where there’s more concentrated power rather than from voters.""
Despite his claims, 61% of San Francisco voters in his recall election chose to remove him from office, with many of them pointing to his progressive criminal justice policies as leading to an increased murder rate, violent crime, shoplifting, burglaries, and an open-air drug trade.
Those who supported Boudin however, praised him for keeping his promises of eliminating cash bail, not prosecuting quality-of-life crimes and putting fewer people behind bars.
Boudin is also the son of two members of the left-wing extremist group Weather Underground – one of which was convicted of second-degree murder.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted Thursday that American consumers are feeling better about the economy because President Biden has ""put equity at the center"" of his economic policies, added jobs and is getting critical infrastructure done.
The government official told CNN that Americans are feeling better about the economy thanks to Biden’s policies, which he and his team have dubbed ""Bidenomics.""
Host Phil Mattingly prompted Jean-Pierre’s points by bringing up recent consumer sentiment numbers that appear to show that Americans are starting to feel better about their finances. He noted how the administration has previously felt frustrated with Americans not feeling Biden’s economic achievements.

""The consumer sentiment numbers have been on a trend line upwards,"" Mattingly said. ""The latest one, I think, surprised just about everybody. My question for you, as he goes into this big moment… Do you feel like the corner is being turned right now, people are getting it, that it’s landing and that, not only will this not be a drag heading into a campaign season, this is actually going to be a benefit for the president?""
Jean-Pierre agreed, saying, ""You just said it! Consumer sentiment. People are feeling what the economy is doing.""
She then said this budding good feeling and better economy is all because of the president’s work.
""And we have to remember, this didn’t happen by accident. What we’re seeing with the trends – with the economic trends – it’s because of what this president has done,"" she said.
Providing points on what Biden has done specifically, she continued, ""He has put equity at the center of everything that he’s talked about when it comes to the economy. 14 million jobs created. Last year, 2.7 million jobs created. Unemployment under 4%. Wages are up. That matters.""

""He’s going to talk specifically about a bridge, called the Blatnik Bridge. That bridge – if we had not invested in that bridge, the $1 billion that’s going to that bridge because of bipartisan infrastructure legislation, it would have shut down by 2030.""
She added, ""Now jobs are going to be created. It is an artery connecting Wisconsin to Minnesota. It is so critical and important. Obviously, the president’s going to talk more about this later today.""
Jean-Pierre has routinely been positive about Biden’s handling of the economy during the administration, despite consistent polling showing that a majority of Americans have not been happy about it.

Though CNN and Jean-Pierre mentioned consumer sentiment going up, a recent CBS News segment appeared to contrast that narrative. The network’s reporters had trouble finding New Hampshire residents who felt good about the economy while they were covering the recent primary race there.

Food bank volunteers were shocked to discover that a donated canned good item had expired years ago — 25 years ago, to be exact.
Volunteers at the Sunderland and County Durham Food Bank in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, England, recently received a glass can of Uncle Ben’s Gratin’s Dauphionise Cheese & Onion Sauce for Potatoes.
A worker was checking new donation items at the food bank when the individual noticed the label was faded and the contents looked ""a little grey,"" according to SWNS.

Upon looking further, the worker discovered the sauce had expired on June 9, 1998.

Sutherland and Country Durham Food Bank manager Jonathan Conlon told SWNS, the British news service, that it was the oldest item they had ever received.
HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR SUNSCREEN IS EXPIRED
""We sometimes get things that are a couple of years out of date, and occasionally at harvest festival time, for example, we get things that people have cleared out from the back of their cupboards,"" he said.
Conlon said this cheese sauce can set a record for how far back the expiration date was on a donated item.
The expiration date of the sauce can read June 9, 1998.  (SWNS)
""It’s not that unusual to get the odd donation that is out of date, maybe a year or two — but this is the record,"" he said.
WHICH FOODS SHOULD YOU STOCK UP ON IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY?
Conlon joked that the 25-year-old can was even older than some of the food bank employees.
He also added that although the food bank isn't sure of the canned item's origin, it must have come from a personal donation.
Manager Jonathan Conlon (pictured) was shocked to see the can for himself.  (SWNS)
""It couldn’t have come from donations at a supermarket because everything is in date,"" he said.
As for whether or not the food bank will be opening the can or throwing it away, Conlon said the center is actually going to display it at their location.

Fox News Channel was the most-watched cable news network as the New Hampshire primary unfolded on Tuesday, crushing CNN and MSNBC's combined viewership in primetime.
During special coverage of the first-in-the-nation primary, Fox News reached roughly 4 million total viewers, with 521,000 in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo, during the 8 p.m. ET hour, according to data from Nielsen Media Research, as former President Trump was declared the winner in the GOP contest. Meanwhile, MSNBC trailed in second with 1.98 million total viewers and CNN came in third with 1.25 million total viewers, 278,000 and 284,000 viewers in the key demo, respectively.
Throughout the night from 8-11 p.m. ET, Fox News averaged 3.3 million total viewers with 453,000 in the key demo while MSNBC averaged 1.75 million total viewers and 237,000 in the demo and CNN averaged less than one million total viewers with only 246,000 in the demo.
Special coverage was spearheaded by Fox News' Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.

Fox News Channel also dominated cable news coverage of last week's Iowa caucuses, averaging 2.8 million total viewers from 8-11 p.m. ET compared to 1.1 million for MSNBC and a dismal average audience of 688,000 for CNN. Fox News more than quadrupled CNN’s audience and doubled MSNBC’s viewership.
Trump made history again on Tuesday as the first non-incumbent candidate in the modern era to win both the New Hampshire and Iowa contests. The former president earned 54% support among Granite state  primary voters while his remaining opponent, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, exceeded expectations with roughly 43% of the vote. Haley has vowed to carry on with her presidential bid and campaign in her home state of South Carolina as polls show her trailing behind the GOP frontrunner.

On the Democratic side, President Biden won his unprecedented write-in campaign, which was the result of a dust-up between the DNC and New Hampshire. The DNC had designated South Carolina to be its first-in-the-nation primary, while New Hampshire carried on with its contest abiding by state law declaring the Granite State the first primary in the country.
Also earning attention was Biden's leading primary challenger, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who received roughly 20% of the Democratic vote.

Liberal media outlets including MSNBC and CNN cut off former President Trump's victory speech in New Hampshire with fact-checkers and commentary, similar to their coverage of his win in Iowa. On ""Outnumbered"" Wednesday, former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon argued the strategy is ""feeding"" right into Trump's power.

TUDOR DIXON: I personally sort of love this approach because I see them doing this, and I think any time you ban someone from seeing something, they want to see it more. They get more excited. And Trump has a unique political movement that is more old school, where people are passing pamphlets and talking, so that makes them even more likely to say to their neighbor, hey, have you seen what they're doing to him? There's something up with this. Why do they want to hide him from us? And so I think it gives him power. I think they're feeding right into him, and they don't even realize it. It makes me sort of sit back and chuckle at how silly they are.

After former President Trump won a decisive and historic victory in Iowa, MSNBC refused to air former President Trump's victory speech.
Rachel Maddow told MSNBC viewers that the channel couldn't air ""lies"" when explaining the decision to skip Trump’s speech. The liberal anchor insisted the decision was ""not out of spite"" but that airing Trump's ""untrue"" statements live on television hurts MSNBC's brand.
MSNBC wasn’t the only network to object to Trump’s speech, as CNN host Jake Tapper interrupted the former president to accuse him of spouting ""anti-immigrant rhetoric.""
In similar fashion, MSNBC did not air Trump's full remarks after his victory in the New Hampshire primary. The outlet also included live fact checks from Maddow. CNN's Jake Tapper also cut off the GOP frontrunner's speech and included his own fact-checker.

An Amazon driver in Florida has been arrested after stealing a French bulldog with an estimated value of about $4,000, from a residence while making deliveries, according to authorities.
The Hernando County Sheriff’s Office in Florida said deputies responded to a home on Copper Hill Drive in Spring Hill on Dec. 23, after receiving reports of a missing French bulldog.
When officers arrived, they learned the owner let her dog, Kali, outside at about 9:15 a.m. the day before. A brief time later, Kali’s owner realized her pooch had escaped from the fenced-in backyard.
A neighbor told the dog’s owner he saw Kali walk up to a Hispanic man in his mid-20s, who was wearing an Amazon uniform and driving a white Chevrolet Cruz. The neighbor added that the man had just delivered a package to an address on Copper Hill Drive, and after interacting with the dog, he drove off with it.

Another neighbor, police said, told Kali’s owner she saw the man stop his vehicle on Larkenheath Drive before picking up the dog, placing it in the back seat of the car, and driving off.
Kali’s owner contacted Amazon customer support, who suggested getting law enforcement involved.
So, the owner contacted the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office and provided a photo with a detailed description of Kali, a 1-year-old French bulldog with a retail value of $4,000.

Guitarist Johnny Marr of the rock band The Smiths is strongly objecting to their music being played at former President Trump’s campaign events.
Footage went viral of The Smiths’ hit song ""Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want"" from 1984 being played at a Trump rally in South Dakota last year.
The confrontation began when reporter Ben Jacobs wrote on Monday night, ""As Trump is scheduled to take the stage in Laconia, the new addition to his pre rally music is The Smiths.""
ABC reporter Soorin Kim responded with footage from September and wrote, ""You actually hear the Smiths more often than you'd think at 2024 Trump rallies.""

Marr has not only locked horns with conservative politicians before, but also is a stark contrast from The Smiths' former frontman, Morrissey.
Rolling Stone juxtaposed how Morrissey has ""recently become a divisive figure"" with how Marr has ""spoken out against right-wing politicians who like The Smiths.""

Marr's former bandmate Morrissey has made headlines in recent years for speaking out against cancel culture and politicizing diversity.
""People could make five flops and the label would stick by them, now the labels are quite bloodless, they will just get rid of you if you say anything that they don't agree with, they’re not interested,"" Morrissey said at the London Palladium during a 2022 interview.

Nelson Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 5:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fired-flight-attendant-blasts-airlines-dei-push-alleges-religious-discrimination-lawsuit,"Ex-flight attendant Lacey Smith alleges religious discrimination in the lawsuit and calls for religious liberty amid the push for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace.
After Alaska Airlines flight attendants Marli Brown and Lacey Smith say they evoked their Christian faith during their company's push for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), the two called for religious liberty in the workplace.
Smith spoke with Fox News Digital about why she believes her termination by Alaska Airlines was motivated by religious discrimination. During the interview, she was accompanied by Stephanie Taub, Senior Counsel for First Liberty Institute (FLI), who is representing her in a lawsuit against Alaska Airlines that they filed in May 2022.
""I went to access my schedule in the morning … I saw that Alaska had posted an article that just said Alaska supports the Equality Act,"" Smith told Fox News Digital on Friday.
""There are a lot of different religious people who had issues with the Equality Act. And I guess I just had some questions with Alaska in terms of what that meant when they said things like, ‘Alaska supports the Equality Act’ … What does that mean for me?""
The Equality Act, which was introduced by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sought to add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes in employment, housing, and other capacities under federal civil rights law. The measure passed the House in February 2021.

HARTFORD TEACHER SUING SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER FREE SPEECH RIGHTS RIPS CRT, SAYS TEACHING PROFESSION 'DWINDLING'
Her comments to Fox News Digital came after FLI and the Ard Law Group on Wednesday filed a motion for summary judgment on behalf of Smith and Brown after they sued Alaska Airlines and the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), a union for flight attendants, in May 2022.
FLI and Ard Law Group alleged that the airline terminated them because they ""asked questions in a company forum about the company’s support for the Equality Act"" and that the AFA ""failed to adequately defend them.""
""At the time, it's important to look at the context that this is taking place when Alaska Airlines had a major DEI push where they were encouraging their employees to have courageous conversations with each other about and ask difficult questions and share their diverse perspectives,"" Taub told Fox News Digital.
She went on to say, ""And so that's why it's pretty shocking when we have a couple of Christian flight attendants that were sharing their perspectives and were fired.""
The flight attendants’ skepticism of the Equality Act came at the time the bill was being discussed in Congress in 2021. During that period, Alaska Airlines voiced support for the bill, but the two flight attendants were concerned that their employer’s stance on the measure was premature because how the bill would impact employees who could hold conflicting beliefs was unclear.

""I think that was the issue is that they didn't know how it would affect me in the workplace,"" Smith told Fox News Digital.
""For me personally, I have traditional Christian views on sexual morality: male and female, all of that.""
She explained further that there was a lot of confusion around the details of the bill.
""I wanted to know what that meant for me as an employee with Alaska Airlines supporting the Equality Act,"" she explained.
UNITED CEO ENRAGES MUSK, LARRY ELDER AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOR VIRAL DIVERSE HIRING COMMENTS: 'THIS IS MESSED UP'
They say the airline announced support for the bill on an internal employee message board. Brown and Smith challenged the threat to religious liberty and parental rights that the bill poses on a messaging platform.
Brown asked if Alaska supported ""endangering the Church, encouraging suppression of religious freedom, obliterating women's rights and parental rights.""
She warned that the act would force ""every American to agree with controversial government-imposed ideology or be treated as an outlaw,"" thus, ""demolishing existing civil rights and Constitutional freedoms,"" which are protected under the Civil Rights Act.
Brown claimed that the Equality Act would endanger the safety and privacy of girls and women, including shower and locker room facilities, female-only shelters, and prisons.
Smith told Fox News Digital that she questioned the airline, ""As a company, do you think it’s possible to regulate morality?""
Alaska Airlines Senior VP of People, Andy Schneider, responded to Smith’s comment, according to court documents reported by Fox13 Seattle.
""Supporting the Equality Act is not about regulating morality. It’s about supporting laws that allow our LGBTQ+ employees and guests, no matter what state they live in or fly to, to be protected against discrimination,"" Schneider said.
""That's the question that got me terminated,"" Smith told Fox News Digital.
""That was the first conversation that I had with Alaska that they posted back. And then shortly after they took that down, deleted the comment, and then they told me that they were calling me in for something that I had posted online.""

Eventually, Smith noticed that all of her trips were canceled.
""And, so you're just like… it's starting to seem more and more serious,"" Smith said.
FLI claimed they had their comments removed for being ""discriminatory,"" ""hateful"" and ""offensive,"" and were suspended from flight shifts pending an investigation.
Other comments criticizing the airlines’ support for the Equality Act were not removed because they did not address religious liberty concerns, the court document noted.
When the flight attendants sought ""religious accommodation"" during the termination process from the AFA, they claimed they did not get any help.
She added that they did not agree with her criticism of the bill.
An AFA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that ""conversations are taken out of context by First Liberty.""""Union leaders did not report or turn the Flight Attendants into Alaska management. The conversations were private — not in a ‘company chat,’"" the spokesperson said.
The statement explained further, ""AFA represented the plaintiffs vigorously and decided not to advance the plaintiffs' cases to arbitration because their claims lacked sufficient merit. We stand against discrimination in all its forms.""
After their comments were removed, Smith and Brown were subject to an investigation and probed by airline officials. Eventually, they were terminated.
Furthermore, FLI alleged that the other participants were treated better than Brown and Lacey and that the airline violated their own ""Three Strikes Policy"" after what appeared to have been one offense from both of the plaintiffs.
A spokesperson for Alaska Airlines declined to comment due to ""pending litigation."" (Orange County Fire Authority)
According to court documents, it explained that Smith received a ""Notice of Discharge,"" explaining that she was fired ""because it perceived her moral beliefs about gender identity or sexual orientation to be discriminatory.""
""If Lacey held different religious beliefs about sexual morality, then the Company would not have fired her,"" the court brief states.

""Alaska Airlines VP of Inflight testified that an employee’s use of the term ‘opposite sex’ violates the Airlines’ discrimination policy because that implies that there are only two sexes,"" FLI reported.
""Since this is pending litigation, we can't comment,"" a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told Fox News Digital.
""Benjamin Franklin equates ignorance with tyranny. And I think unfortunately, currently in 2024 and obviously 2021, etc., there's a lot of people who are ignorant to their freedom and protection from religious discrimination in the workplace,"" Smith told Fox News Digital.
""I don't know how we got here as a nation to where somebody can't bring up their own questions about morality without losing their job. But that's where we're at.""
Smith now works as a front desk receptionist at a hotel.

An investigation and manhunt are underway after multiple people were found dead in two homes in Illinois on Monday afternoon, according to the Joliet Police Department.
During a press conference Monday evening, police said the seven people were found shot to death.
Joliet Police Detectives are currently seeking the whereabouts of Romeo Nance, 23, who is believed to be driving a red Toyota Camry with the license plate number Q730412.
Police believe that Nance knew the victims and that they were relatives.

Nance is also wanted in connection to several other shootings.
Deputies said just before 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, they were called to an apartment complex where they found a man bleeding from the head from an apparent gunshot wound. Deputies told WGN 9 that the victim later died.
The victim was later identified as Toyosi Bakare, 28, who was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the U.S. for nearly three years, WGN 9 reported.
According to deputies, about ten minutes before the fatal shooting, a 42-year-old man was shot in the leg and sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Authorities stated the victims in Sunday’s shootings are not connected to one another and appear to be random in nature.
Officials said the plate numbers on the vehicle that authorities believe Nance is driving match the vehicle spotted near both shooting scenes on Sunday.
According to the Patch and court records, Nance was charged about a year ago after he tried to shoot a woman multiple times. Police found him near his home and arrested him after a brief struggle with officers.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Four Baltimore police officers who fired three dozen shots at an armed man during a foot pursuit in November won’t face criminal charges, state prosecutors said Friday.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a news release that the officers returned fire after Hunter Jessup, 27, fired seven shots in their direction while fleeing. Jessup was later pronounced dead at a hospital.
The decision not to charge the officers comes after an investigation by the attorney general’s office, which is authorized under state law to investigate police shootings and in-custody deaths. A law change that went into effect last year also gave the agency the authority to make charging decisions; previously those decisions had fallen to local prosecutors.
BALTIMORE POLICE SHOOTING PROMPTS CRITICISM OF SPECIALIZED GUN SQUADS
Jessup’s death occurred on Nov. 7 after officers on a District Action Team — a squad focused on seizing illegal guns — approached him while patrolling in southwest Baltimore.

(Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun via AP, File)
In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members questioned whether his death was necessary. They said officers on the department’s specialized gun squads have a reputation for displaying overly aggressive behavior and escalating otherwise peaceful encounters, especially in that neighborhood.
SHOOTING IN BALTIMORE LEAVES DOZENS WOUNDED, MULTIPLE DEAD: POLICE
But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley has commended the officers’ actions, saying they protected public safety in an area plagued by violence. He also said they yelled at Jessup multiple times to drop his weapon before firing.
The attorney general’s office found that the officers acted in self-defense or defense of others and did not use excessive force.
""Because the officers had no reasonable alternative to using deadly force at the moment they fired, a prosecutor could not prove that the shootings constituted excessive force,"" the office's report released Friday said."

The war between Russia and Ukraine rages on.
A Russian military transport plane crashed in an area north of the border. Russia claimed Ukrainian missiles shot it down with 74 passengers on board, including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war. No confirmation of that.
This comes as Russia continues to pound cities across Ukraine with ballistic, cruise and guided missiles, killing dozens, injuring more and destroying residential areas.
Russian artillery pounds away along a 600-mile front line, firing up to 10 times as many shells as the Ukrainian military.
This threat from Moscow prompted NATO to stage its biggest military exercise in Europe since the Cold War, dubbed ""Steadfast Defender 24."" Starting this week, 90,000 troops, 1,100 tanks and other combat vehicles, 130 jets and ships will be in action.

The exercise aimed at getting U.S. forces to Europe. A U.S. Navy dock landing ship kicked off the drill with its departure from Norfolk, Virginia.
Once all the forces and hardware are gathered in Europe, NATO will rehearse, at least, fending off Russia from targeting a member country.

Supreme Allied Commander General Christopher Cavoli called the war games ""a clear demonstration of our unity, our strength, and our determination to protect each other.""
Strategic expert Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute told Fox News that he was ""glad to see NATO doing this exercise"", calling it ""important for us to recognize the degree to which Russia threatens NATO.""
The Kremlin is defiant about NATO’s challenge. Spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, called the activity of NATO near its borders ""provocative,"" declaring it ""will not remain without an appropriate reaction from Moscow.""

As Russian sabre-rattling grows, Moscow officials have now rejected a Biden administration offer made last year to resume nuclear arms control talks as long as the U.S. supports Ukraine.
Embattled Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy, who has seen Russian aggression up close for nearly two years of full-fledged war, has emphasized the bigger stakes of this all. ""If anyone thinks this is only about us, only about Ukraine,"" he said recently, ""they are mistaken.""
The massive NATO exercise is happening as billions of dollars of U.S. military aid remains held up on Capitol Hill.
According to analyst Fred Kagan, all this is more ammunition for Russian President Vladimir Putin to strengthen his fight with the West.

(Philippine Coast Guard/Handout)
A Filipino fisherman defiantly ignored the Chinese coast guard when confronted in the disputed South China Sea, telling the authorities to leave and asserting the Philippines' right to the territory.
""This is Philippine territory. Go away,"" Joely Saligan, the captain of a small fishing vessel, told the Chinese coast guard, which tried to drive them away from the Scarborough Shoal near the northwestern Philippines.
Saligan relayed the details of the Jan. 12 confrontation to the Philippine Coast Guard after eventually leaving the area. Commodore Jay Tarriela, a spokesperson for the Philippine Coast Guard, said they have validated the written statements and videos submitted by the crew.
Saligan and his men took a small boat and visited a coral outcrop that becomes exposed during low tide. The crew looked to collect seashells and fish from the area but had to cut their excursion short as five Chinese coast guards, three of whom carried steel batons, landed and ordered the boat to leave.

Both sides tried to document the altercation as the Chinese authorities boarded the ship and got physical, trying to take a cellphone one of the fishermen tried to use.
""They looked angry. They wanted us to return our catch to the sea,"" Saligan told a group of journalists in Manila. ""That’s inhuman because that was food which people should not be deprived of.""

OXN8GMGTM6_I86QAAA7ZUQ8JF9,Republican states unite with pro-life doctors for SCOTUS abortion pill battle,By Chris Pandolfo Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 2:23pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-states-unite-pro-life-doctors-scotus-abortion-pill-battle,"Fox News' Shannon Bream reacts to the Supreme Court's abortion pill ruling, discusses Sen. Dick Durbin calling for Chief Justice John Roberts to testify before a Senate committee as well as her new book.
Three Republican attorneys general have asked to join a lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court that could determine whether women have access to the abortion pill, mifepristone.
Missouri, Idaho and Kansas on Monday jointly filed a motion to intervene in U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vs. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which, if granted, would allow the states to become plaintiffs in the case. The move is an effort to keep the lawsuit alive if the justices find the pro-life doctors who originally challenged the FDA's approval of mifepristone lack standing to do so.
""This is one of the most important cases before the Supreme Court this term. We're fighting to protect women and their unborn children from these dangerous abortion pills,"" Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey told Fox News Digital in a statement.
The Supreme Court last month agreed to consider appeals from the Biden administration and drug manufacturer Danco Laboratories defending deregulation of mifepristone, the abortion pill, as part of an effort to make it easier to access and use the drug since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

In its landmark June 2022 decision, the court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to an abortion and that the matter should be decided by the states. In the aftermath, 14 states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation.
The case now pending before the court concerns pro-life doctors and medical groups that sued the FDA in 2022, alleging that the agency unlawfully approved mifepristone in 2000 and that the drug is unsafe.
Mifepristone, known by the brand name Mifeprex, is a pill taken with misoprostol in a two-drug regimen that first deprives an unborn baby of hormones it needs to stay alive and then causes cramps and contractions to expel the dead fetus from the mother's womb.
In a highly controversial ruling, the district court in Texas where the case originated halted the FDA's approval of mifepristone, triggering an appeals process that has now landed before the Supreme Court.

The Biden administration and Danco are asking the high court to reverse an appellate ruling that would cut off access to the abortion pill through the mail and impose other restrictions, even in states where abortion remains legal. The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in pregnancy. The nine justices rejected a separate appeal from abortion opponents who challenged the FDA's initial approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.
The case will be argued in the spring, with a decision likely by late June, in the middle of the 2024 presidential and congressional campaigns.
Before the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri moved to intervene in the case in the original district court. Texas U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk allowed the three states to join the lawsuit on Jan. 12, 2024, but by then the Supreme Court had already agreed to hear the case.
Now, the Republican attorneys general say the Supreme Court should allow them to join the lawsuit as plaintiffs, asserting there are injuries their states have suffered that the pro-life doctors and medical groups are unable to address in court. They claim that abortion rights organizations have shipped abortion pills into their states, with the assistance of the FDA, in violation of state abortion bans.

""FDA's actions impose substantial monetary and sovereign harm on the States. The private plaintiffs have no capacity to assert the States' interests. So if this Court denies intervention and holds that the private plaintiffs lack standing, the States may be forced to wait for relief until this Court resolves a future emergency application or certiorari petition by Petitioners,"" the states told the court in a legal filing.
Bailey, in the filing, also pointed to data that shows thousands of women have traveled out of state to purchase mifepristone and then return to Missouri. ""The Federal Government admits that 5 to 8 percent of these women experience significant complications after returning home,"" the filing states.
""Intervention would also promote efficiency,"" the attorneys general argued, observing that their separate challenge to the abortion pill is likely to end up before the court ""within months"" anyway.
Should the Supreme Court decline their motion to intervene, the Republicans said they ""are happy simply to submit an amicus brief.""
""I am very pleased the district court in Texas has recognized Idaho’s standing in this case.  We intervened over concerns for the safety of Idaho women and the virtually unregulated access to mail-order abortion pills,"" Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""The Federal Drug Administration’s recklessness puts the lives of both pregnant women and their unborn children in medical jeopardy.""

""Biden is beholden to the nation’s most radical abortion extremists so the FDA is allowing the shipment of chemical abortion pills,"" Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach said. ""The FDA lacks the statutory authority to do so. And that’s why Kansas is suing.""
The FDA has defended its approval of mifepristone and said the drug is safe when used correctly.
""The FDA approved Mifeprex more than 20 years ago based on a thorough and comprehensive review of the scientific evidence presented and determined that it was safe and effective for its indicated use,"" the FDA's website states.
Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Erik Baptist, who is representing the private plaintiffs, expressed optimism that the Supreme Court will ultimately come down on their side.
""Women should have the ongoing care of a doctor when taking high-risk drugs,"" Baptist said. ""The FDA betrayed women and girls when it removed safety standards that it previously deemed necessary for women’s health and well-being. The FDA should do the right thing and protect women and girls. Three courts have already agreed with us, and we are hopeful that the U.S. Supreme Court will also agree.""

Christopher Nolan was still sleeping when his film, ""Oppenheimer,"" landed a leading 13 Academy Awards nominations Tuesday. Emma Thomas, Nolan's wife and producing partner, roused him after a flurry of congratulatory messages came through on her phone.
""Don’t take it as being blase,"" Nolan told The Associated Press, laughing. ""We just didn’t want to jinx anything. Watching the nominations was more than our nerves could take so we just had a restless night and slept through.""
Nolan and Thomas didn't have much reason to be anxious. ""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's sprawling American saga of J. Walter Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb, has more or less been the Oscar frontrunner since it made its acclaimed debut in late July. On Tuesday, it earned nominations for seemingly every creative aspect of its achievement, including acting nods for Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt.
CHRISTOPHER NOLAN INVITED TO PELOTON STUDIO AFTER INSTRUCTOR ADMITS SHE DISSED 'TENET'
""Oppenheimer"" was nominated for Nolan's direction and adapted screenplay; for Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography; Jennifer Lame's editing; Ellen Mirojnick's costume design; Ruth De Jong and Claire Kaufman's production design; Luisa Abel's makeup and hairstyling; best sound; and Ludwig Göransson's score. It came one nomination shy of tying the record for best Oscar nominations ever.
""It's flabbergasting,"" said Thomas, who spoke with her husband in an interview a few hours after nominations were announced. ""Then we got on with the routine of getting a 16-year-old out of bed, but with a spring in our step.""
Though Nolan is regarded as the big-canvas auteur of his era, he’s never won an Academy Award — nor have any of his films won best picture. He was nominated for best director once before, for ""Dunkirk."" But Nolan's absence from the movie's biggest stage has often been more notable than the honors his films have collected. After his ""The Dark Knight"" was overlooked for best picture in 2009, the academy expanded the category beyond five films.

But this year's Oscars may be leading toward a coronation for the 53-year-old Nolan and a three-hour opus that broke records — and Hollywood conventional reasoning — in grossing nearly $1 billion worldwide. On Tuesday, he and Thomas reflected on the movie's Oscar success.
AP: Do you see the success of ""Oppenheimer"" as a statement to the industry — which usually funnels big budgets only to sequels and remakes — about what's possible for an original film made with scale?Nolan: I grew up loving Hollywood movies and believing studio filmmaking can take on anything. Seeing audiences respond to that this summer was incredibly thrilling and getting this kind of recognition from the academy, I don’t know what to say, really. It certainly confirms our faith in what studio filmmaking can be.
SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL BEGINS, ATTENDEES INCLUDE CHRISTOPHER NOLAN, KRISTEN STEWART
AP: Have you reflected on why ""Oppenheimer"" has resonated so much?
Nolan: It's always a tricky thing to try to analyze the zeitgeist or analyze success. We were really interested and excited, in particular, to see young people responding to a piece of history. I keep coming back to the unique nature of the story. I think it is one of the great American stories. It encompasses so much that’s important and dramatic about our history. That gives audiences a lot to hang to, when you get a great group of actors and incredible cast like we have, you can make this feel real and emotionally accessible. That's as far as I can analyze its success. Beyond that, sometimes you catch a wave and it's a wonderful and unique thing.
Thomas: Oftentimes you think of history as being the ancient past, and it’s not terribly relevant to today. But I think the unique thing about the Oppenheimer story is that everything the movie deals with has direct relevance to this moment in time as well. And so I think that’s something that really touched audiences.
Nolan: Yeah, that's a good point. When I first started on the project, one of my kids said to me about nuclear weapons, people my age don't really worry about that so much. This was a couple of years ago. With everything that’s going on in the world since, that’s very much changed. We came along right at a time when people were beginning to worry about this again, and worry about the fate of the world. Oppenheimer's story is so relevant to that — not just the threat of nuclear weapons but also the burgeoning threat of AI and what it can do to our world.
AP: Though your films have often been celebrated by the academy, neither of you have won an Oscar. Does this year feel different?
Nolan: I think the breadth of recognition that we woke up to this morning is something we haven’t experienced before, and it’s really thrilling for us. It’s a very unique feeling to see in academy recognizing all different aspects of the film, from the performances to the technical achievement of the film. I mean, I grew up watching the Academy Awards. It’s the pinnacle of sort of the recognition of your peers.

AP: Do you see ""Oppenheimer"" as the culmination of your collaboration together?
Thomas: It definitely feels like a film that was made with all the things we've learned together over the years. It all came together on this film. But I'm hoping it's not the culmination. I'm hoping that we'll get to make another one. (Laughs) We're at the midway point!
Nolan: We're just getting started! With every film, you try to build on what you've learned previous films.
AP: Any big plans to celebrate tonight?
Thomas: Well, we'll probably be having dinner with our kids. We've got one who's going back to college. We'll have a family celebration, which feels entirely appropriate given the nature of our movie and the way we work."

It is the second time a grand jury has indicted Baldwin for Hutchins' death. Baldwin was originally charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter on Jan. 31, 2023, and the charges were later dropped in April 2023.
ALEC BALDWIN FACES NEW INDICTMENT IN ‘RUST’ MOVIE SET SHOOTING
Baldwin's legal team requested any ""results or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of scientific tests or experiments, including all polygraph examinations of witnesses, made in connection with this particular case, or copies thereof, within the possession, custody, or control of the state, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the prosecutor"" as part of the entry of appearance.
In addition, his defense asked for ""any material evidence favorable to the defendant which the state is required to produce under the due process clause of the United States Constitution.""
""Failure to provide this discovery violates the Defendant's right to cross-examination, to present a defense, to a fair trial, to compulsory process, and to due process of law,"" the docs state.
Baldwin was indicted Friday for involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Halyna Hutchins. (MEGA)
Baldwin must enter a plea on Feb. 1. If Baldwin fails to appear at the time and place specified, a warrant will be issued for his arrest.

Baldwin's representatives did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Hutchins was killed on the New Mexico set of the Western film, and director Joel Souza was wounded by a bullet from a weapon Baldwin was holding while rehearsing a scene in a church on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin has denied he pulled the trigger of the gun that killed Hutchins.
Special prosecutors revealed they would ask a grand jury to decide if Baldwin should face criminal charges for a second time in October, nearly two years after Hutchins' death.

""After extensive investigation over the past several months, additional facts have come to light that we believe show Mr. Baldwin has criminal culpability in the death of Halyna Hutchins and the shooting of Joel Souza,"" special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis said in a statement last month.
Baldwin also faces a number of negligence suits by ""Rust"" crew members. (Dimitrios Kambouris)
""We believe the appropriate course of action is to permit a panel of New Mexico citizens to determine from here whether Mr. Baldwin should be held over for criminal trial.""
In November, video released by NBC News from the ""Rust"" set showed Baldwin telling crew members to move out of the way as he prepared to shoot his weapon. The footage was reportedly taken some time before Hutchins was fatally shot.
""Now, wait a second, I'm going to shoot right,"" Baldwin said. ""Do you mind going to the other side of the camera? I don't want to shoot toward you."" At another point, Baldwin seemed concerned for the safety of whoever is behind the camera, saying, ""I don't know why you're going up hills and all this other — you're going to break your f---ing neck.""

Baldwin still faces a handful of civil lawsuits, including one brought by ""Rust"" script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and another by Hutchins' mother, father and sister. The plaintiffs are represented by attorney Gloria Allred.
Amid the legal drama, Baldwin, the cast and crew finished filming ""Rust"" in May.

P70LUXY0NL_VTHVZ9IKP7L42EN,Idaho murders case: Judge to consider Bryan Kohberger attorney's request for summer 2025 trial start date,"By Michael Ruiz , Louis Casiano Fox News","Published January 26, 2024 5:11pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/idaho-murders-case-judge-consider-bryan-kohberger-attorneys-request-summer-2025-trial-start-date,"Forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan says ‘valuable information’ could have been lost by tearing down the house, possibly helping the suspect.
Latah County District Judge John C. Judge held off Friday on setting a trial date for Bryan Kohberger, the 29-year-old Pennsylvania criminologist accused of killing four University of Idaho students in a 4 a.m. ambush in November 2022, over concerns by prosecutors and defense lawyers about the time it would take to be ready for the proceeding.
Judge also denied a motion to dismiss the quadruple murder charges against Kohberger, citing potential delays to the case, and denied a defense request to appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court.
Kohberger's trial had initially been scheduled for October, but his defense lawyers waived his right to a speedy trial. Defense lawyers said they expect the trial to last 12 to 15 weeks.
Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson's office asked the court to set a summer trial date to avoid interfering with parking at the neighboring high school, and to hold proceedings between semesters for the victims' classmates. The trial date hearing happened Friday afternoon, shortly after a closed-door session on other matters in the case.

""If we are going to try this case effectively with minimal unnecessary harm of disruption to our community, it should be done during the summertime,"" Thompson told Judge.
Taylor noted that a change of venue isn't necessary given the case's global attention and media coverage.
Defense attorneys requested a trial start date of sometime in the summer of 2025, citing the massive amounts of evidence involved.
""A few months from not a sufficient amount of time,"" defense attorney Anne Taylor said. ""There is no possible way I can even read or watch everything I have now, or react to things that are still coming in if we're to have a deadline in time for a summer of 2024 trial.""
She said her team recently received discovery evidence of more than 9,000 tips law enforcement received after the murders.
""Your honor, summer of 2024. It's impossible for us to do it,"" Taylor said.

Meanwhile, Judge said he needed more time to think about a start date, given the differences between the prosecution and defense.
""It's a decision that pulls me in two different directions,"" Judge said. ""I just want to let it percolate a little bit. It's really hard for me to set something in 2025.""
A summer trial with the university out of session would leave more room in hotels for people visiting town for the proceedings, prosecutors argued.
The University of Idaho's academic calendar shows next year's spring semester ends in the second week of June.
Prosecutors also asked the court for shortened days, from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. PT.
BRYAN KOHBERGER TRIAL: MOTHER OF IDAHO MURDER VICTIM FIGHTS TO KEEP KING ROAD HOUSE INTACT
""For a trial of this length, it is appropriate to afford jurors some amount of time to tend to their personal affairs,"" a court filing reads. ""Additionally, having more time in the afternoon allows for better preparation by the parties and allows for reasonable opportunities and time for the Court and counsel to address any motions or other matters that routinely arise during the course of jury trials.""
Jennings also asked Judge to set key pretrial deadlines, including for discovery, expert disclosures, witness lists and pretrial motions.

Kohberger is accused of entering a six-bedroom house on King Road in Moscow, Idaho, around 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022 and killing four students inside.
The victims were Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21; and Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Italy’s lower chamber of parliament on Wednesday approved a novel government deal with Albania to house migrants during the processing of their asylum requests, a cornerstone of Premier Giorgia Meloni’s efforts to share the migration burden with the rest of Europe.
The proposal, which passed 155-115 with two abstentions in the Chamber of Deputies, now goes to the Senate, where Meloni’s right-wing forces also have a comfortable majority.
Meloni and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced the groundbreaking initiative last November, in which Albania would shelter up to 36,000 migrants for a year in two centers while Italy fast-tracks their asylum requests.
TINY ITALIAN ISLAND OVERWHELMED WITH THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVED WITHIN 24 HOURS
Italy has long sought concrete gestures of solidarity from fellow European Union nations to help it handle the tens of thousands of migrants who arrive each year. Albania is hoping to join the bloc, and Italy has been a strong supporter of its bid.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has endorsed the deal as an important initiative and the fruit of necessary ""out-of-the-box"" thinking to deal with the migration issue. But human rights groups have expressed concern that Italy is outsourcing its international obligations. Italy’s center-left opposition has branded the deal as an expensive exercise in propaganda ahead of European elections this year, and a shameful bid to turn Albania into Italy’s ""Guantanamo.""
ITALY'S CALL FOR NAVAL BLOCKADE MAY BE ONLY WAY TO STEM EUROPE'S MIGRANT CRISIS, EXPERT SAYS
Albania's constitutional court in December suspended ratification of the deal pending a review of its constitutionality, but Rama has said he is confident the court would find no violation."

Federal judges will hear arguments on Tuesday to determine whether to restore the right to vote to Mississippi residents convicted of certain felonies.
Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of 10 specific felonies, including bribery, theft and arson, lose the right to vote. Criminal justice advocates sued the state after the list was expanded to 22 crimes, including non-violent offenses such as timber larceny and carjacking.
On Tuesday, 19 federal appellate judges on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court's 17 full-time active judges and two senior-status part-time judges, are expected to hear arguments that could potentially restore the right to vote to tens of thousands of people.
In August, a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled that the ban violates the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibiting ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. However, the full 17-member circuit court vacated that ruling weeks later.

The hearing on Tuesday will ultimately determine whether Mississippi’s ban remains in effect or if felons should have the right to vote.
""Mississippi stands as an outlier among its sister states, bucking a clear and consistent trend in our Nation against permanent disenfranchisement,"" Senior Judge James Dennis wrote in the August opinion, joined by Senior Judge Carolyn Dineen King.
Dennis was nominated to the court by former President Clinton, and King was nominated by former President Carter.

The third judge on the panel was Judge Edith Jones, nominated to the court by Republican President Reagan. In a dissent to the August ruling, Jones cited a previous Supreme Court ruling regarding felons' disenfranchisement, saying it is up to legislatures to decide such matters.
VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS QUASH REPUBLICAN VOTING BILLS AND SHELVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
Attorneys for the state have argued that the voting ban is a ""nonpunitive voting regulation."" They have also countered the court’s three-judge panel in saying that it did not constitute punishment and, even if it did, it was not cruel or unusual.
Under the current law, people convicted of such crimes must get a pardon from the governor to be able to vote. Similarly, they could persuade lawmakers to pass individual bills just for them to vote. Such legislation would require two-thirds approval.
In August, a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled that the ban violates the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment. The full panel reversed the decision and scheduled Tuesday's hearing. (iStock)

WASHINGTON – Nearly 200 people have been arrested and charged in a series of law enforcement actions targeting large-scale drug-trafficking organizations throughout the country, according to the Justice Department.
The cases in question led to the arrests of defendants in 10 states across the nation, including Alaska, netting nearly 50 kilograms of fentanyl and over 70 kilograms of meth. The DEA assisted in several cases, including in Alaska.

On Jan. 25, the District of Alaska announced charges against 54 defendants in connection with a large-scale organized crime ring operating in the state, allegedly being run by an inmate from a California prison. Heraclio Sanchez-Rodriguez, 57, is accused of using contraband cell phones to communicate with his suppliers in Mexico and their brokers, leaders in California and Oregon, and distributors of the drug trafficking enterprise in Alaska.
From February 2022 to July 2023, law enforcement intercepted over 36 kilograms of fentanyl, 27.3 kilograms of meth, 11.3 kilograms of heroin and 118 grams of cocaine connected to the enterprise. The ring mainly used suppliers to send drug packages through the U.S. Postal Service from Oregon and California to Alaska.

Meanwhile, on Jan. 24, the Northern District of West Virginia announced charges against 82 defendants for a drug trafficking ring operating in the Eastern Panhandle. According to court documents, Gary Bernard Brown, Jr., 38, of Baltimore, supplied others with large quantities of fentanyl capsules and powder for redistribution in Berkeley and Jefferson Counties. The investigation yielded 10 kilograms of fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, firearms and hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets.

On Jan. 23, the District of Nebraska announced charges against 19 defendants for their roles as part of a meth distribution ring operating throughout Nebraska with ties to Kentucky and California. Alejandro Ruiz, 41, allegedly ran the crime syndicate out of California and trafficked meth and other narcotics from Mexico into California and then into the Midwest, including central Nebraska. In addition to meth seized through controlled buys, law enforcement also seized three firearms.

Also on Jan. 23, the Southern District of Mississippi arrested 40 individuals stemming from a four-year federal investigation of multiple drug-trafficking organizations distributing meth, cocaine and other illegal narcotics. The case included defendants throughout Mississippi with connections to Mexico, California, Texas, Alabama and elsewhere. Some defendants are charged with committing a meth drug offense while minors, including a young toddler, were at the location. Investigators seized 36 firearms, five kilograms of crystal meth and one kilogram of cocaine.
According to the DOJ, all of these cases and arrests are part of Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces operations, which aim to, ""identify, disrupt, and dismantle the highest-level drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations that threaten the United States by using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies against criminal networks.""

A Gulfport, Mississippi woman who was convicted of murder in 1995 has been arrested again, this time for allegedly killing her son and stashing his body behind a false wall.
The Gulfport Police Department said 66-year-old Jerri Lynn Isreal was arrested on Saturday and charged with first-degree murder.
According to the investigation, officers responded to a home on 16th Avenue at about 5:45 p.m. on Dec. 22, 2023, for reports of a missing person.
After several follow-up interviews with Isreal, detectives began to notice on Dec. 27 that there were several discrepancies in her statements.

Police said Isreal became increasingly uncooperative throughout the investigation and changed her statements multiple times.
Investigators learned Isreal had been arrested and convicted of murder in Florida in 1995.
The detectives further discovered she had attempted to dump the body of the deceased person at several locations throughout Florida.

As detectives and crime scene technicians executed the search warrant, Isreal was transported to a nearby hospital for unspecified medical treatment.
Detectives at the home discovered a wooden box behind a false wall during the search, which police said contained a body later identified as John Allen Gaither.
According to WLOX in Biloxi, Mississippi, Gaither is Isreal’s son.

- Democrats hold an ""unsanctioned"" primary – with Biden appearing only as a write-in candidate
- Pelosi, AOC accused of ‘disdain for law’ for social media use
Former President Trump and Nikki Haley are the last two Republicans campaigning for the GOP nomination for president in 2024.
Trump's early results are strong, and the Fox News Decision desk projects that the former president will handily win the most delegates in the state.
The stakes are high for Haley. If she comes in with a strong showing, she could stay in the race for more state primaries in the coming weeks. But Trump's impressive, record-breaking showing in Iowa may cast some doubt about whether Haley has a path to the nomination.
Biden also took a victory in New Hampshire — but an empty one. A dispute between New Hampshire and the DNC made it an ""unsanctioned"" primary. Still, Biden will take the most votes through a write-in campaign. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips, however, could be in the double digits – an embarrassment for the incumbent president.

Thom Tillis posted a video on X, 'I have no patience for Hamas sympathizers.'
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., confronted an anti-Israel protester in a Senate office building stairwell on Thursday afternoon, after the woman claimed Hamas was ""legitimately"" voted in by the Palestinian people.
In a video posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, Tillis can be heard telling the protester ""Hamas has caused this carnage, Hamas has to cease to represent the Palestinian people so we can save them and protect them.""
The unidentified protester, who a Tillis staffer said was with the feminist activist group Code Pink, can be heard that saying ""Hamas were legitimately voted in"" in 2006.

Tillis fired back at the protester and said ""they canceled future elections.""
""They are dictators who have raped and murdered Israelis,"" Tillis said. ""When the people of Palestine elect somebody in a free election, I'll be arguing for a ceasefire.""
The unidentified Code Pink protester then said ""Israel won't let them have an election,"" to which Tillis shot back and said ""Hamas will not let them have an election.""
""No, it's Israel, Israel is the occupier sir,"" she said.

One of Tillis's aides who recorded the video told Fox News Digital the interaction occurred after a Senate, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee meeting. The aide said the protester was waiting outside the room when the meeting ended and began following Tillis.
According to its website, Code Pink is ""a feminist grassroots organization working to end U.S. warfare and imperialism, support peace and human rights initiatives, and redirect resources into healthcare, education, green jobs and other life-affirming programs.""

Code Pink told Fox News Digital ""no comment,"" but referred to a statement on their website applauding ""the decisive stance the International Court of Justice (ICJ) took in its preliminary ruling on South Africa v. Israel.""
""The Court ordered Israel to cease all actions tantamount to genocide and to facilitate humanitarian aid to mitigate the unfolding humanitarian crisis urgently, which is a crucial step toward justice,"" the statement read.
Earlier this month, South Africa launched a case at the United Nations' top court alleging that Israel's military campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide.
The United Nations' top court is set to rule Friday on a call for Israel to halt its military offensive in Gaza, when it issues a preliminary decision in a case accusing Israel of committing genocide in the tiny coastal enclave.
Top of the South African list is a request for the court to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza."" It is also asking for Israel to take ""reasonable measures"" to prevent genocide and allow access for desperately needed aid.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sided with the Biden administration in a case involving a razor wire fence along Texas’ border with Mexico.
The court’s decision allows Border Patrol agents to cut concertina wire that Texas had installed along the border near Eagle Pass while litigation continues.
The roughly 30 miles of wire had been installed as part of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's broader fight with the administration over immigration enforcement and attempts to stem the historic flow of migrants across the border since Biden's term began.

In court papers, the Biden administration argued that the wire impedes Border Patrol agents from reaching migrants as they cross the river and that, in any case, federal immigration laws trumps Texas' own efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the country.
In a 5-4 vote Monday, the justices granted an emergency appeal from the Biden administration, which has been in an escalating standoff at the border with Texas and had objected to an appellate ruling in favor of the state.

Most of the razor wire is deployed in the Shelby Park area of Eagle Pass. It is owned by the city but was recently seized by the State of Texas. Federal Border Patrol agents have been blocked from the park since then, a move the Border Patrol Union publicly supports.
Brandon Judd, President for the National Border Patrol Council, said the ruling would ""undoubtedly encourage more illegal immigration.""
""Unfortunately, this means Border Patrol agents are going to be tied up dealing with give ups rather than going after the criminal elements that constantly cross our borders illegally,"" Judd said in a statement to Fox News.
""The administration no doubt will say this is a win for border security, but if they sought rank and file input, they would be told this will do the exact opposite. Agents support what Texas was trying to accomplish in the absence of true border security policies from this administration.""

PSVORICNRG_KR20TTD1381S94W,Native American exhibits closing at American Museum of Natural History as museums now need tribal consent,By Timothy H.J. Nerozzi Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 2:07pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/native-american-exhibits-closing-american-museum-natural-history-tribal-consent-concerns,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The American Museum of Natural History announced the closure of two Native American exhibits on Friday, citing concerns over tribal consent.
The Manhattan museum, one of the most famous in the country, made the decision after the federal government passed regulations requiring museums receive assent from tribes before displaying cultural artifacts to the public.
""The halls we are closing are artifacts of an era when museums such as ours did not respect the values, perspectives and indeed shared humanity of Indigenous peoples,"" museum president Sean Decatur said in a Friday letter, according to The New York Times.

He added, ""Actions that may feel sudden to some may seem long overdue to others.""
The two canceled exhibits showcased Native American cultural items from the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains.
President Biden's administration has attempted to hasten the repatriation of Native American remains and cultural objects.

New federal regulations were put into effect this month that expedite the processes outlined in the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
Museums, universities, and other institutions are now required to begin repatriation of human remains or relevant cultural items within five years.

A major change is the sweeping power given to tribal leaders and representatives in making claims on museum property and requesting repatriation.

The federal regulations rolled out earlier this month greatly loosen the burden of proof for tribes to make claims on objects or remains.
Institutional curators are required to ""defer to the Native American traditional knowledge of lineal descendants, Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations"" in lieu of missing historical documentation.

PVA9HBRO3P_NZHUHH82YWXS6PX,"NYC drug gang member jailed 45 years for murder, other shootings",By Michael Dorgan Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 10:42am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-drug-gang-member-jailed-45-years-murder-other-shootings,"Former NYPD Sgt. Pete Panuccio said a culture of fear still exists in New York despite city leaders touting crime drop, as crime remains higher than 2019.
A lifelong member of a violent and deadly drug gang that ""terrorized"" East New York has been sentenced to 45 years in prison for carrying out a string of gun crimes, including murder and attempted murder.
Tyshawn Corbett, also known as ""Reck,"" was sentenced in federal court in Brooklyn on Monday having pleaded guilty in September 2022 to three firearm offenses involving murder or assault in aid of racketeering, each of which carried a mandatory consecutive term of 10 years.
Corbett, 32, was a longtime member of the East New York-based Elite Assassin Millas (EAM), a set of the Bloods street gang that operated primarily in East New York which made money through fraud and drug dealing, particularly sales of crack cocaine and marijuana, according to a press release by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of New York citing court filings and transcripts.
Tyshawn Corbett, also known as ""Reck,"" shot and killed a man while he also shot another man six times, leaving him paralyzed. (US District Attorney's Office)
NEARLY 2 DOZEN SUSPECTED MS-13 GANG MEMBERS ARRESTED FOR 'BRUTAL VIOLENCE' IN NEW YORK CITY, LONG ISLAND
Prosecutors said the gang’s members murdered or attempted to murder its rivals to maintain its grip on power. EAM even referred to its East New York-based chapter as ""Gun Town"" for the level of violence its members and associates committed and perpetuated.
Within the gang, Corbett developed a reputation as a ""shooter"" for being willing to shoot and kill other people, prosecutors said.
In this case, Corbett pleaded guilty to committing three shootings, the first of which took place in April 2015, when the gun-toting gang member shot and killed Michael Tenorio.
Then, between 2016 and 2018, Corbett engaged in extensive efforts to stalk and kill another individual, identified as ""John Doe #1.""
Corbett attempted to kill John Doe #1 in March 2016 but John Doe #1 survived the shooting.
When that murder attempt failed, Corbett and other EAM gang members stalked John Doe #1 to again try to kill him.
That opportunity arose more than two years later, on June 28, 2018, when Corbett located John Doe #1 and fired at him repeatedly at close range, striking him approximately six times.

DOJ WON'T SEEK DEATH PENALTY AGAINST ALLEGED MS-13 GANG MEMBERS ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE KILLINGS IN LONG ISLAND
Miraculously, John Doe #1 survived the shooting but was left paralyzed. He has now been sentenced for those crimes.
Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said Corbett and his gang struck fear into the East New York community.
""For years, Corbett inflicted violence on rivals and terrorized the East New York community with impunity, but with today’s sentence he has been punished for his repeated, flagrant disrespect for the law,"" Peace said.
""My office is deeply committed to combating gang violence and will continue to work tirelessly with federal and local law enforcement to dismantle these groups.""
Corbett participated in at least four additional shootings over the years, prosecutors said, citing evidence presented during the trial of a co-defendant.

The government’s case has led to the convictions of six other members and associates of EAM, including its leader, Quandel Smothers, who was convicted at trial and is scheduled to be sentenced in March 2024.
""Everyone who was subjected to the intimidation and brutality perpetrated by Mr. Corbett can breathe easier today with news of this meaningful prison sentence,"" NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban said.
""The NYPD, in close partnership with our colleagues at the FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District, will continue to focus its resources on the relatively small number of criminals responsible for driving the violence in New York City.""
""Neither we nor the people we serve will ever stand for our neighborhoods to be overrun by illegal drugs, guns, and associated gang violence, and I commend the investigators and prosecutors involved in this case for their steadfast commitment to our public safety mission.""

Authorities in Pennsylvania are looking for a ""dangerous"" teenage murder suspect who escaped police custody in a hospital parking lot Wednesday afternoon.
Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner of Investigations Frank Vanore said Shane Pryor, 17, was in the parking lot of the emergency room at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia around noon when he escaped. Two prison staff members were in the car with Pryor, according to Vanore, but he was not handcuffed when he exited the car.
Pryor was at the hospital to be seen for an alleged hand injury of unknown origin. He is not believed to be in a hospital.

Nathan Wade, a prosecutor accused of having an inappropriate romantic relationship with Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis, is not ""qualified"" to handle the Trump Georgia election case, according to one legal analyst.
Court documents filed earlier this month say Willis hired special prosecutor Wade, her alleged romantic partner, to prosecute former President Trump in Georgia's election interference case. They also allege they benefited financially from the relationship in the form of lavish vacations that the two went on using funds his firm received for working the case.
Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a hearing on the accusations for February 15.
CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig told the network on Monday that the legal issues surrounding the case boil down to money and a potential conflict of interest.

CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig said on Monday that the conduct of Fani Willis and Nathan Wade poses a real ""conflict of interest."" (Photo by David Walter Banks/Getty)
""[Wade's] primary area of practice is personal injury law, not, in my view, qualified to handle a major, complicated racketeering case,"" Honig said.
Wade was allegedly paid over $650,000 so far in the case. In comparison, two other prosecutors hired to work on the case only received around $70,000 and $90,000, respectively.
""There's a question of—is he working nine times as much as the other folks,"" Honig said. ""The other big problem, though, is there is clearly a relationship of some nature, we don't know exactly between the DA and Mr. Wade and some of that money is being used on travel that the DA is accompanying him on.""
He suggested that the money was being used for ""personal purposes"" and posed a real ""conflict of interest.""
""At a minimum, it looks terrible, and it raises legitimate questions about the DA,"" Honig added.
Willis has not confirmed or denied the claim but suggested Wade is being scrutinized because he is Black.
Attorneys for Wade's estranged wife, Joycelyn Wade, filed court documents on Friday that included 2022 bank statements showing purchases of flights to Miami and San Francisco.

The statements, which were obtained by Fox News, show that Wade bought round-trip tickets for himself and Willis to Miami in October 2022, which also included a third ticket for someone named Clara Bowman on the same day from Houston to Miami. Another round-trip ticket to San Francisco for Wade and Willis was purchased in April 2023, documents show.
Wade's bank statements show more purchases, including two $1,387 and $1,284 payments for a Royal Caribbean cruise, which were made on the same day, October 4, 2022, that Wade bought the airline ticket to Miami in Willis' name. Other expenses between October 2022 and May 2023 were for Atlanta tour operator Vacation Express, the Hyatt Regency Aruba Resort and the Norwegian Cruise Line, and for the DoubleTree by Hilton Napa Valley – American Canyon.
Joycelyn Wade's attorneys, who seek to have Willis deposed for her divorce from Nathan Wade, argued that there ""appears to be no reasonable explanation for their travels apart from a romantic relationship.""

Willis has been subpoenaed to give a pretrial deposition in the divorce case on January 23, but in a Thursday court filing, she argued that the subpoena should be quashed. Her attorney, Cinque Axam, has argued that Joycelyn Wade has ""conspired with interested parties in the criminal Election Interference Case to use the civil discovery process to annoy, embarrass, and oppress District Attorney Willis.""

WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced Friday a surge of new resources to help combat violent crime in Washington, D.C., where crime rates have surged in recent years.
DOJ officials said the rise in carjackings has been particularly concerning. The new resources include moving more prosecutors to investigate cases and a multi-component Gun Violence Analytic Cell (GVAC) to help identify additional federal investigations that should be opened in the district.

Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley's mother will stand trial this week for her alleged role in the murder of four students.
Jennifer Crumbley and her husband, James Crumbley, face four counts of involuntary manslaughter each in the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting at Oxford High School, where Ethan, then 15, killed 16-year-old Tate Myre, 16-year-old Justin Shilling, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana and 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin, and left seven others severely injured.
""[W]hen given the option to help [Ethan] and take him out of school, defendants did nothing,"" a March 2023 court filing from the Michigan Court of Appeals states. It lays out the reasoning for a trial for James and Jennifer Crumbley. James Crumbley's trial, recently separated from Jennifer's, is scheduled for March.
On the morning of Nov. 30, 2021, when James and Jennifer met with school counselors to discuss their son's disturbing drawings just hours before their son shot up the school, ""they did not, contrary to the recommendations of [school counselor Shawn] Hopkins, take [Ethan] home and get him immediate medical help,"" the filing states.

""Nor, when they decided to leave him at school, did they tell school officials about [Ethan's] history of mental health issues nor explain to them that [Ethan] had access to a gun similar to the one he drew on the math worksheet,"" the appeals court added.
On Monday, Ethan Crumbley filed an appeal to his life sentence without the possibility of parole, and new lawyers for the 17-year-old said they will advise the convicted killer not to testify at his parents' trials, according to The Oakland Press.

Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald has said James and Jennifer Crumbley dismissed school administrators' concerns about Ethan's drawings and left Oxford High School on the morning of the shooting without taking him home.
""The thoughts won't stop,"" Ethan Crumbley wrote beneath a drawing of a gun, which he crossed out before meeting with school officials, followed by, ""Help me."" Above a drawing of a bullet, the drawing says, ""Blood everywhere."" Further down on the page are other handwritten words and phrases including, ""My life is useless.""

The 15-year-old suspect was able to convince school officials during the meeting that the concerning drawings were for a ""video game."" His parents ""flatly refused"" to take their son home, the prosecutor said in 2022.
""Just got to go to my son's school and meet his counselor. S--- day,"" Jennifer Crumbley allegedly texted an acquaintance just before 11 a.m. on Nov. 30 in a conversation about her horse lesson scheduled for later that day.

After the meeting, Jennifer Crumbley suggested in another text that she might take Ethan to the horse farm on the afternoon of Nov. 30 after school, saying, ""He can’t be left alone.""

Jennifer also said in a Facebook post prior to the shooting that she and her husband purchased the same gun Ethan used in the shooting as a Christmas present for their son. The gun was allegedly not properly secured inside their home, prosecutors have said.

Neither James nor Jennifer Crumbley asked Ethan during their meeting Nov. 30 ""if he had the gun with him, nor did they look in his backpack. And, when they left the school, defendants did not go home and ensure [Ethan] had not taken the gun,"" the appeals court filing said.
Immediately after the shooting, the Crumbleys allegedly fled their Oxford home as Michigan authorities issued a be-on-the-lookout alert for the couple after the shooting. They were considered fugitives before U.S. Marshals apprehended them Dec. 4, 2021.

Barrett's body was found in a ditch along Interstate 95 in Jacksonville, Florida, on March 24, 1980. A day earlier, the Ohio native had been enjoying spring break in Daytona Beach when she was kidnapped from her motel.
For decades, all law enforcement had was her body and a sketch of the suspect based on interviews with Barrett's friends. The case went cold until about 2017.
Billy Mansfield Jr., 65, who killed at least five women and girls coast to coast, admitted that he was the suspect in the sketch, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said on Thursday.

Mansfield finally copped to the killing and abduction in September 2022 after two years worth of interviews, according to police.
""Billy Mansfield advised that he was in fact the suspect in the police sketch completed following the abduction,"" the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said in a statement on Thursday. ""He went on to confess to the abduction from the Daytona Beach Shores hotel, as well as to her murder shortly thereafter.""
He was 24 at the time of Barrett's murder.

Since his admission, police have worked with the State Attorney's Office, which will not seek prosecution, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said.
The State Attorney's Office in the 4th Judicial District did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Mansfield is currently serving a life sentence in California and four concurrent life sentences in Florida for the murders of five women and girls between 1975 and 1980.
He buried the victims under his Spring Hill home along the west coast of Florida, about a 2.5-hour drive across the state from Daytona Beach, where he killed Barrett.

QB7VW26OBO_8SMV90MUEKH00US,The Speaker’s Lobby: Make Way for Ducklings,By Chad Pergram Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 11:38am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-speakers-lobby-make-way-for-ducklings,"Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins ‘Fox News Live’ to report on the latest news emerging from Congress as they avoid a government shutdown.
An emergency bill to avert a government shutdown wasn’t all it’s quacked up to be.
The title of the measure bore one of the more lumpish, incongruous names for a piece of legislation designed to fund the government. Congress named the bill ""To Amend the Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013 To Allow the Secretary of the Interior To Issue Electronic Stamps Under Such Act, And for Other Purposes.""
Legislation about ducks to fund the government?
That’s just daffy.
The duck bill which Congress converted into a spending measure wasn’t just a decoy. However, it is yet another stopgap bill, re-upping all old funding from the fiscal year which ended in September and extending things until early March.
HOUSE VOTES TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AFTER SPEAKER JOHNSON BUCKS GOP REBELS
Many House Republicans gave this bill the bird. They don’t like that this is the third temporary plan to avert a shutdown. That’s why only 107 House Republicans voted yes on the plan; 106 voted nay. There were 126 and 127 GOP yeas on the two previous spending plans. But those numbers plummeted last week.

This bill was certainly an ugly duckling.
House Democrats covered for Republicans, providing the majority of votes to approve the latest bill. That’s what Democrats did in earlier spending packages.
""The American people are frustrated that this does nothing Republican Congress can't get out of its own way,"" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.
Conservatives crowed about the latest extension hatched by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.
SENATE PASSES SHORT-TERM SPENDING BILL TO FUND GOVT UNTIL MARCH, SAYS THERE WILL BE NO SHUTDOWN
""We just need a little more time on the calendar to do it,"" said Johnson.
Johnson allies concede there’s a reason the speaker needs an assist from the Democrats. Republicans are operating the House on a wing and a prayer.

""It is the smallest Republican majority ever,"" said Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla. ""I don't care who you put in the speaker's office. You’re actually going to have a very difficult time trying to govern.""
Democrats are in the minority. But it’s Republicans who often find themselves on a wild goose chase trying to round up votes for major bills. So to fund the government, a coalition of Democrats and Republicans teamed up. But conservatives? Those birds of a feather flocked together in opposition.
""We know that they are a dysfunctional majority. We know that they do not have actual votes to govern,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.
Johnson hopes the House’s individual spending bills to fund the government can soon take flight. The goal is to flush all 12 appropriations measures by early March.
Still, conservatives shot down Johnson’s decision to do another emergency spending bill. The 1980s comedy ""Howard the Duck"" scored better reviews from movie critics. If Johnson doesn’t fix this fast, it may be time for him to duck and cover.
Rep. Pete Aguilar said, ""We know that they are a dysfunctional majority. We know that they do not have actual votes to govern."" (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
But why would lawmakers use the waterfowl legislation bill to temporarily fund the government? There’s no reason to summon Darkwing Duck to investigate. Let me explain.
You can blame Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution for this turkey.
The Constitution requires that ""All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.""
In other words, any legislation with tax implications must start in the House.
Or, perhaps in this case, taxonomy implications.
So in the rush to avert a government shutdown, the Senate took the molting Duck Stamp Act from the House, plucked it of its parliamentary plumage and stuffed it with brand new legislative text to fund the government. After the Senate passed the bill, the measure migrated across the Capitol Rotunda for the House to sync up.
But conservatives felt this was anything but just ducky.

""We are about to fund the entire government of the United States as an amendment to a bill about duck hunting,"" groused Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. ""And that doesn't strike me as a good way to fund the government or even pass a bill about duck hunting, for that matter.""
But that’s what Congress does sometimes to make duck soup.
""Duck stamps"" have been a part of public policy in Washington for nine decades. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the first duck stamp piece of legislation into law. The Migratory Bird Conservation Fund benefits from duck stamps. Nearly every cent spent on duck stamps goes to the fund to buy and lease wetlands for birds. Those preserves help birds rest and feed when they fly south in the winter and north in the summer.
Congress just re-upped duck stamps with another piece of legislation late last year. The new stamps for hunting are electronic and available to hunters online. Hunters no longer need to buy a $25 physical stamp. However, hunters can still get regular stamps from the post office. They can also obtain an actual copy of the stamp after duck season concludes.
The process the Senate used isn’t new or nefarious. The House or Senate just needs an appropriate legislative vehicle to advance tax or spending legislation. Sometimes it’s easier for a bill to start in the House and then go to the Senate. Sometimes it’s better if the Senate initiates the process and sends something back to the House.
Rep. Matt Gaetz said, ""We are about to fund the entire government of the United States as an amendment to a bill about duck hunting."" (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)
Kind of like killing two birds with one stone. Or, a bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
Bills used for revenue and appropriations purposes must feature a certain parliamentary pedigree. Any old bill won’t necessarily do. Only certain measures qualify.
So it helps for the House to have passed some bills – which frankly aren’t going anywhere. The Senate can repurpose those pieces of legislation.
So the government is funded through March. If Congress can avert a shutdown then with individual bills, it will be free as a bird. If Mike Johnson commits to another stopgap bill, conservatives will cry ""fowl.""
But this is the nest Congress made.

The government is funded. There’s no shutdown. There’s nearly six weeks to figure this all out.
In the meantime, make way for ducklings!

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Czech Parliament's lower house on Friday approved an amendment to the country’s gun law that tightens requirements for owning a weapon more than a month after the worst mass killing in the nation’s history.
The legislation now goes before the Senate and if approved there must then be signed by President Petr Pavel before becoming law.
On Dec. 22, a lone shooter killed 14 people and wounded dozens before killing himself at a Charles University building in downtown Prague. The assailant was a 24-year-old student who had a proclivity for firearms, with a license to own eight guns, including two long guns. Authorities said he had no criminal record and therefore did not attract the attention of authorities.
1 DEAD, 19 INJURED AFTER FAST TRAIN COLLIDES WITH TRUCK IN EASTERN CZECH REPUBLIC
Parliamentary debate on the legislation had already begun before that shooting. Interior Minister Vit Rakusan has said it was hard to speculate whether the new rules would have prevented it if they had been in effect before it took place.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek/File)
In the 200-seat lower house, lawmakers approved the changes in a 151-0 vote. If approved by the Senate, where the ruling coalition government has a majority, and signed by President Petr Pavel, it would then be possible for authorities to seize a weapon from private owners for a preventive reason.
It also includes a requirement for businesses to report to police suspicious purchases of guns and ammunition and gives doctor access to databases to find out if their patients are gun owners.
CZECH POLICE ARREST SUSPECT WHO SAID 'HE WAS INSPIRED' BY PRAGUE SHOOTER AND WANTED TO 'ALSO KILL'
Gun owners would have to undergo a medical check every five years, not every 10 years, as it is now.
In the country of 10.9 million people, 314,000 had a gun license at the end of 2022 and owned almost a million weapons of various types."
QHMDE9W0MQ_KRCUMPU9QR6UGHM,Trump White House official Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months for defying Jan 6 subpoena,"By Danielle Wallace , Jake Gibson Fox News","Published January 25, 2024 12:38pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-white-house-official-peter-navarro-learns-sentenced-months-defying-jan-6-subpoena,"Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro details the events leading to his arrest and the explanation over the Navarro arrest spectacle on 'Hannity.'
Peter Navarro, who served in the White House under former President Donald Trump, was sentenced Thursday for flouting a House Jan. 6 committee subpoena.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Navarro to four months in prison and ordered him to pay a fine of $9,500.
That's two months shorter than the six prosecutors had sought, but Mehta drastically reduced the whopping $200,000 fine sought by the Justice Department.
A former adviser to the president on trade and manufacturing policies, Navarro was convicted in September of two counts of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for documents and a deposition from the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The subpoena required Navarro to appear and produce documents in February 2022, and sit for a deposition in March 2022, but Navarro refused to provide the materials and testify. As a private citizen, he was indicted on June 2, 2022.
In announcing the sentencing decision, Mehta cited how Navarro had claimed a ""two-tier system of justice"" and described the Jan. 6 committee as a ""kangaroo court.""
""I have made clear my confusion about his arrest when he could have been offered self-surrender… The idea that he is subject to a two-tiered system of justice when he’s sitting here with four very capable lawyers is a real head-scratcher,"" the judge said. ""The words ‘executive privilege’ are not magical dust… it’s not a ‘get out of jail free’ card. To not engage with the committee to work through the issues… to simply not engage, there’s no basis for it.""
Mehta on Thursday had gone through a tedious recounting of the sentencing guidelines and came to the conclusion that there is a ""zero to six months range,"" of imprisonment in this case, as well as a fine range of $500 to $9,500. Sentencing guidelines are only a suggestion, and the judge could have sentenced Navarro to a longer sentence if he saw fit.
At the sentencing hearing, Navarro spoke in his own defense, saying he defied the subpoena because he believed in ""good faith"" that Trump had invoked executive privilege.
""When I received that congressional subpoena, the second, I had an honest belief that the privilege had been invoked, and I was torn. Nobody in my position should be put in conflict between the legislative branch and the executive branch. Is that the lesson of this entire proceeding? Get a letter and a lawyer? I think in a way it is,"" Navarro said. ""I am disappointed with a process where a jury convicted me, and I was unable to provide a defense, one of the most important elements of our justice system.""
DOJ RECOMMENDS 6 MONTH SENTENCE FOR FORMER TRUMP ADVISER PETER NAVARRO
""The day of the attack on our Capitol was one of the worst days of my life. Desecration of our Capitol and the end of any argument about the Vote Count law on our books,"" he added.
Navarro's defense attorney said the court of appeal will determine if executive privilege applies. The judge noted how in citing executive privilege, another White House adviser, Kellyanne Conway ""had an (DOJ Office of Legal Counsel) OLC opinion she could rely on,"" but Navarro had no such opinion and didn't hire representation.

""I have a great deal of respect for your client and what he accomplished and that makes it more disappointing,"" Mehta said, also noting that Mark Meadows, who also faced a Jan. 6 committee subpoena, ""produced documents, produced texts, he didn’t testify, but at least he did something.""
""Before he was contacted, what they wanted. He responded, ‘Executive Privilege.’ That makes it clear that this defendant did not take this seriously. The defendant simply defied Congress. The defendant believes that he is above the law,"" a prosecutor said of Navarro in addressing the court Thursday. ""The things the committee wanted to talk to him about were not exclusively about conversations he had with the president.""
Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Navarro to six months behind bars and impose a $200,000 fine. The Justice Department has previously noted that each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of up to $100,000.

""The United States vs. Peter Navarro has turned out to be a very important landmark constitutional case. That is going to resolve important issues about the constitutional separation of powers as well as, the integrity, efficiency of presidential decision-making. And we'll see what happens today. Is that what Trump loves to say? Let's see what happens,"" Navarro told reporters upon arriving at the courthouse Thursday morning. He said his legal bills associated with the case have surpassed $1 million and thanked 20,000 small donors for their help.
He also appealed to supporters to donate to help cover his legal expenses at defendpeter.com.
Navarro has vowed to appeal the verdict, saying he couldn’t cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege.
The judge barred him from making that argument at trial, however, finding that he didn’t show Trump had actually invoked it. Justice Department prosecutors say Navarro tried to ""hide behind claims of privilege"" even before he knew exactly what the committee wanted, showing a ""disdain"" for the committee that should warrant a longer sentence.
Defense attorneys said Trump did claim executive privilege, putting Navarro in an ""untenable position,"" and the former adviser should be sentenced to probation and a $100 fine.
Navarro was the second Trump aide to face contempt of Congress charges. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon was convicted of two counts and was sentenced to four months behind bars, though he has been free while appealing his conviction.

Navarro’s sentencing comes after a judge rejected his bid for a new trial. His attorneys had argued that jurors may have been improperly influenced by political protesters outside the courthouse when they took a break from deliberations. Shortly after their break, the jury found him guilty of two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress.

But Mehta found that Navarro didn't show that the eight-minute break had any effect on the September verdict. No protest was underway and no one approached the jury — they only interacted with each other and the court officer assigned to accompany them, according to the judge.

Four high school students in Las Vegas were indicted Friday as adults on second-degree murder charges in the deadly beating of their schoolmate in November, a fight that was captured on cellphone video and had been widely shared across social media.
Chief Deputy District Attorney John Giordani said in court that the indictment also charges the teenagers with conspiracy to commit battery, a gross misdemeanor.
The Associated Press is not naming the students because they were juveniles at the time of the Nov. 1 beating.
STOPPING OR STANDING ON LAS VEGAS STRIP BRIDGES NOW PUNISHABLE BY JAIL TIME
Nine students have so far been arrested in connection with the attack that left 17-year-old Jonathan Lewis Jr. dead. Giordani said the other students are awaiting separate hearings.
According to Las Vegas police, 10 students between the ages of 13 and 17 participated in the beating that unfolded after school in an alleyway just around the corner from Rancho High School. The police department said Friday that investigators are still searching for the 10th suspect.
In the aftermath, students, teachers and staff were left to grapple with how a conflict over a stolen vape pen and a pair of wireless headphones escalated.

Police said that Lewis walked to the alley with his friend after school but don’t believe he was the target.
Lt. Jason Johansson said the cellphone video showed Lewis taking off his shirt to prepare for the fight, then the 10 students ""immediately swarm him, pull him to the ground and begin kicking, punching and stomping on him.""

After the fight, according to Johannson, a person in the area found Lewis badly beaten and unconscious and carried him back to campus, where school staff called 911 and tried to help him.

The Georgia state Senate has passed a bill to redraw school board districts in Georgia’s second-largest school system after a federal judge ruled they were unconstitutionally discriminatory.
But Democrats warn that the Republican-backed map doesn't fix the racial discrimination that led U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross to order the Cobb County school district to not use the map in the May 2024 election, when four board seats will be contested. The districts had produced a 4-3 Republican majority even though a majority of Cobb voters have backed Democrats in recent statewide elections.
The lawsuit, which was filed by a group of Cobb County residents and liberal-leaning political groups, alleges that Republicans illegally crammed Black and Hispanic voters into three districts in the southern part of the suburban Atlanta county, solidifying Republicans’ hold on the remaining four districts.

Ross agreed, finding the people who drew the map relied too much on race.
Republican Sen. Ed Setzler of Acworth said the map would maintain core communities from current districts, calling it ""the work of a very thoughtful process."" But Democratic Sen. Jason Esteves of Atlanta, who represents parts of Cobb County, said Setzler and Republicans short-circuited the normal local legislative process to try to maintain a Republican majority.

""This map and the proposal in the bill violate the clear provisions of the federal court order that was issued late last year,"" Esteves said. ""This map continues the packing of Black and brown voters in Cobb County, particularly on the south side of the county, limiting their influence.""
The map moves on to the House for more debate. If lawmakers give it final passage, Ross would have to decide if it passes legal muster. If lawmakers don't act quickly, Ross could draw a map without legislative input.

""This is not something we need to wait around until March to do,"" Setzler said. ""There’s an election coming up in May.""
Any new map could upset the Republican majority on the board. The 106,000-student district has been riven by political conflict in recent years, with the GOP majority often imposing its will over the protests of the three Democratic members.
The district has alleged the plaintiffs are pursuing a Democratic takeover of the board through the lawsuit and appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a confusing pair of rulings last week, one three-judge panel on the appeals court refused to reinstate the school board, while another three-judge panel on the same day stayed Ross' injunction."

Police this month filed 18 criminal charges against Dad's Place church Pastor Chris Avell over allegations the rented church building — located by a separate homeless shelter along Main Street in Bryan, a city of about 8,600 in northwestern Ohio — was violating the zoning ordinance, lacked proper kitchen and laundry facilities, and had unsafe exits and inadequate ventilation.
An attorney for Avell and the church, Jeremy Dys, said he thinks city leaders don't want the ministry in the middle of town, describing it as a ""not in my backyard"" issue and accusing officials of inventing problems.

""Nothing satisfies the city,"" Dys said Monday, hours after the lawsuit was filed. ""And worse — they go on a smear campaign of innuendo and half-truths.""

An initial meeting with the federal judge and lawyers for Bryan and the church was scheduled for Tuesday morning.
Avell, who pleaded not guilty during in municipal court Jan. 11, said in a release that his church wants to welcome anyone ""to experience the love and truth of Jesus, regardless of the time of day.""

The defendants are the city, Bryan Mayor Carrie Schlade and other Bryan officials.
""We absolutely deny any allegation that the city has treated any religious institution inappropriately,"" said Bryan city attorney Marc Fishel, noting that Schlade supported the church opening in the building four years ago. ""The city has been and continues to be interested in any business, any church, any entity complying with local and state law.""
The church's lawsuit said its leaders decided in March to remain open at all hours as a temporary, emergency shelter ""for people to go who have nowhere else to go and no one to care for them."" Eight people stay there on a typical night, they say, and a few more when weather is bad.
The church's policy has been to let anyone stay overnight and won't ask them to leave ""unless there is a biblically valid reason for doing so or if someone at the property poses a danger to himself or others,"" according to the complaint. Held from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m., the church's ""Rest and Refresh in the Lord"" ministry, overseen by two volunteers, includes scriptural readings piped in under dim lights, and anyone is allowed to come or go.
The city said in a news release that police calls to investigate inappropriate activity at the church began to increase in May, giving as examples criminal mischief, trespassing, theft and disturbing the peace.
Bryan's planning and zoning administrator gave the church 10 days to stop housing people, saying it was in a zone that does not permit residential use on the first floor. After an inspection about two weeks later, charges against Avell for code violations were sought by the local police in early December.
Since then, the lawsuit claims, ""the city has repeatedly attempted to harass and intimidate the church,"" while the church has tried to address the city's complaints by making changes that include installation of a new stove hood and a decision to shut down laundry facilities.
Dys said that the church is not permitting criminal activity to take place and that the police calls there have been made to sound more serious than they actually were, or to seem related to church activity when they were not.

""The city is creating problems in order to gin up opposition to this church existing in the town square,"" Dys said.
The church wants a federal judge to protect what it says are violations of constitutional rights to free exercise of religion and protections against government hostility to religion.
""No history or tradition justifies the city's intrusion into the church's inner sanctum to dictate which rooms may be used for religious purposes, how the church may go about accomplishing its religious mission, or at what hours of the day religious activities are permitted,"" the lawsuit said.
The church wants a federal judge to issue a restraining order or an injunction to keep the city and top officials from ""enforcing or applying the city's ordinances to burden the plaintiff's religious exercise."" It also seeks damages and attorneys' fees."

For those with severe depression, relief could soon be just an MRI away.
In a major clinical trial, researchers from the University of Nottingham in the U.K. applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the brains of 255 patients with treatment-resistant depression over a total of 20 sessions.
The patients reported ""substantial improvements"" in their symptoms and quality of life for at least six months after the procedure, according to a press release from the university.
MENTAL HEALTH MAY BE WORSE IN TEENS FROM LARGE FAMILIES, STUDY SUGGESTS: 'FEWER RESOURCES'
More than two-thirds of participants responded to the treatment, with a third showing 50% improvement in symptoms.
For one-fifth of the patients, their depression did not return.

""Given that these patients are people who have not responded to two previous treatment attempts and have been ill for an average of seven years, to get such a significant response rate and a fifth who have a sustained response is really encouraging,"" lead researcher Richard Morriss, professor of psychiatry at the University of Nottingham, told Fox News Digital, said in the release.
The findings were published in the journal Nature Medicine on Jan. 16.
JEWISH STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH ANTISEMITISM AT COLLEGE NOW HAVE USE OF WALK-IN MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC
""Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a well-established treatment for depression that is available in many but not all centers, unlike antidepressants, ECT and psychological treatments, which are available anywhere,"" Morriss told Fox News Digital.
Previously, TMS has been delivered in a less effective and precise way, Morriss said, and the results didn’t last as long.
The patients reported ""substantial improvements"" in their symptoms and quality of life for at least six months after the procedure, said researchers. (iStock)
""The importance of this research is that for the first time, in a large enough randomized controlled trial, the benefits on depression lasted six months or more,"" he said.
""Not only that, but on average, one in two people [who received] the TMS had a substantial benefit in depression lasting at least six months — enough to improve their anxiety and make them think clearly, function better and have a better quality of life.""
""The benefits to people who have suffered for years are quite remarkable.""
The researchers used an MRI scan to personalize the site of the magnetic stimulation for each patient, Morriss noted.
""We used a neuronavigation system, or tracking system, to ensure that the same site was hit for all 20 TMS sessions, [even] if the person sat in a slightly different position or moved slightly,"" he said.
Ninety-two percent of the study participants completed the full treatment, said Morriss, with only ""minor side effects"" that lasted less than a day.
In 2023, 29% of Americans reported having been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lives, while 17.8% said they currently suffer from it. (iStock)
""People went to the hospital and could resume their usual activities, and they could drive there and back for this treatment,"" he said.
Although the MRI-guided treatment costs about 25% more than the traditional TMS treatments, Morriss said the benefits last longer — ""so maybe the person only needs one or at the most two courses of treatment per year.""
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY RATES HIGHER AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS THAN THEIR PEERS, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS
The study did have some limitations, Morriss acknowledged.
The researchers were not able to include a placebo group, as it was deemed ""ethically and clinically unacceptable"" to give a placebo treatment for as long as six months to such a seriously ill group of people, he said.
Although the MRI-guided treatment costs about 25% more than the traditional TMS treatments, the benefits last longer, researchers said. (iStock)
""So we do not know for sure how much of the TMS effect is real and how much is due to other factors,"" he noted. ""It seems likely that a high proportion of the effect is due to TMS.""
Not every center offering TMS can access MRI technology, Morriss said, but many sites across the U.S. and Canada do have the equipment.

""The additional cost and lack of availability of MRI or the expertise to use it is something that doctors and insurers will need to consider,"" he added.
Alex Dimitriu, M.D., a psychiatrist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine in California, was not involved in the Nottingham study but reviewed the findings.
""There is no doubt that magnetic brain stimulation can be an effective treatment for depression, and this study, using targeted magnetic pulses, further reinforces the efficacy of this treatment,"" a psychologist said.  (iStock)

Murder charges were filed Tuesday against a suburban Chicago man accused of killing his wife and three adult daughters in what police have described as a domestic-related shooting.
Maher Kassem, 63, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder, according to authorities. Police allege he shot four family members after an argument at their home Sunday morning in Tinley Park, which is about 30 miles from Chicago.
Killed in the shooting were Majeda Kassem, 53; twins Halema and Zahia Kassem, both 25; and Hanan Kassem, 24.
CHICAGO AUTHORITIES IDENTIFY 4 WOMEN SHOT TO DEATH IN SUBURBAN HOME
""Words can’t describe how deeply saddened I am at this horrible tragedy,"" Mayor Michael Glotz said in a statement Tuesday. ""A mother and her three daughters are gone, murdered in an act of senseless domestic violence.""

Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday at a mosque while friends held an online memorial fundraiser to build a mosque in honor of the women. The family is of Palestinian descent and Muslim.
A day earlier, mourners arranged flowers upright in the snow outside the home and left small stuffed animals. Friends and neighbors noted Majeda Kassem's passion for cooking and how all three daughters were intelligent devoted students.
Samah Qasmieh, a Chicago State University professor, taught Halema, who was a third year student.
""I just envision her in her bedroom studying for the exam they have Tuesday, doing nothing wrong at all,"" Qasmieh told The Chicago Sun-Times as she stopped by the home Monday to pay respects.
ILLINOIS SHOOTING LEAVES 4 WOMEN DEAD, SUSPECT IN CUSTODY: POLICE
Maher Kassem was expected in bond court Tuesday. A listed phone number for him couldn’t take messages. Cook County court officials didn't immediately respond to a message about whether Kassem had an attorney. The Cook County public defenders' office couldn't immediately say if they were representing him. The Cook County state’s attorney did not have details on an attorney.
Authorities allege Maher Kassem called police and said someone had been shot at the home. Officers arriving at the home found the four deceased women in the home's lower level. Police took Kassem, who was not injured, into custody shortly after and recovered a gun believed to have been used in the shooting.
Tinley Park police called it the deadliest shooting in the village of about 55,000 people since 2008 when five women were killed at a Lane Bryant clothing store at a strip mall in the suburb. The murders remained unsolved."

Gretchen Whitmer warned on Sunday that President Biden could face protesters when he visits the state amid mounting backlash from progressives over his support for Israel.
Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned on Sunday that President Biden could face protesters when he visits the state, as he faces backlash over his support for Israel.
""As we spoke to one of your constituents last night who said he went door to door for Joe Biden in 2020 and he’s lost his vote in 2024, and he said he plans to protest against him. Is President Biden going to face protesters when he comes here because of this one issue?"" CBS host Margaret Brennan asked.
Whitmer said, ""he may.""
""A lot of voters are going to vote for things like individual freedoms, like the basis of our democracy, climate change, so there are a lot of things that are going to come into play as we get closer and closer to the election, but certainly these are legitimate and raw feelings that people have, and they’re entitled to their opinions,"" she added.

Brennan also asked how Biden would be received in Michigan as the state is home to roughly 300,000 Arab-Americans.
""No community is monolithic. I will start with that. I will say that one of the great things about this state is, this is where people came from around the world for a good-paying job and a high quality of life. It’s true today, but it’s why we have such a robust and beautiful Arab community in Michigan and a robust Jewish community in Michigan. These two communities have lived as neighbors in harmony for decades, and what’s happening in Israel and Gaza has certainly, I think, caused pain for everyone,"" Whitmer said.
Democratic strategists and voters in Michigan told the Wall Street Journal that there was concern for the president's chances, as polls continue to show former President Trump ahead of Biden in hypothetical matchups.
""The level of concern is growing, and it should be,"" Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist based in Michigan, told the media outlet. ""The problem is not policy. The problem is the man.""

One Democrat said the president's support for Israel was ""costing him"" in the state.

(Reuters)
Fourteen new ambulances are now in the possession of Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s national ambulance and emergency service agency, after a donation from the Rev. Franklin Graham and Samaritan's Purse, which is a charitable Christian organization that helps people around the globe.
A dedication ceremony took place on Tuesday, Jan. 23.
On the ground in Israel, Graham told the agency, ""I believe in this organization. You risk your life to save life – and I felt that these ambulances needed to be replaced immediately,"" the team at Samaritan's Purse shared with Fox News Digital on Tuesday afternoon.
FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S SAMARITAN'S PURSE SPONSORS 21 AMBULANCES IN ISRAEL TO REPLACE THOSE DESTROYED BY HAMAS
During the Oct. 7 attack on innocent Israeli civilians, Hamas terrorists killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 14 Israeli ambulances; since the war began, 19 medics have also been killed, Samaritan's Purse relayed to Fox News Digital.
The organization has now replaced those 14 ambulances. It said that in the months ahead, it will further expand Magen David Adom's fleet by providing seven additional armored ambulances.

Graham spoke to the widow of Dr. Daniel Levi, who was killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 as he treated wounded people in a clinic in Kibbutz Be'eri in Israel.
""Do you think your husband would’ve liked this?"" Graham said to Lihi Levi-Ingber, the organization told Fox News Digital.

He said he believes that ""Magen David Adom has an incredible team, and I am proud to have a small part in your lifesaving work. We dedicate these ambulances today to God – to His glory – and we honor those who have lost their lives.""
Ophir Levy, father of 19-year-old Lior Levy who was also killed by Hamas, said of the ambulances, ""These are not just vehicles but a symbol of life, courage and hope. … Every time an ambulance goes on a mission, it will be like Lior and her friends are still helping and saving lives.""

Holly Madison lived at the Playboy Mansion for nearly a decade – but for the model, life was far from glamorous.
The former Playboy pinup and ""Girls Next Door"" star has spent the last several years hopping down the rabbit hole of her life story and Hugh Hefner’s empire.
The model is returning for Season 2 of Investigation Discovery's (ID) true-crime series, ""The Playboy Murders,"" which looks at high-profile tragedies associated with the iconic magazine brand. She’s also hosting a new series, ""Lethally Blonde"" in March, which promises to expose ""the dark side of people pursuing beauty and fame.""
HOLLY MADISON'S 'PLAYBOY MURDERS' INVESTIGATES 'HORRIBLE' TRUE-CRIME CASES: 'COULD REALLY HAPPEN TO ANYONE'
Holly Madison is back for Season 2 of ""The Playboy Murders."" (ID)
""I think people are really curious about the [Playboy] world,"" the 44-year-old told Fox News Digital. ""Even though there were a lot of negative experiences attached to it, I think for better or worse, that’s what I was put here to experience – [to] come out on the other side and tell people about it.""
""I do look back, and I wish there were little ways I could have done it differently,"" she admitted. ""But you never know. If I had stuck up for myself more, had more of a voice back then, I probably wouldn’t have lasted there. So I don’t think there’s any winning when it comes to that. I can’t really say I have any regrets, but would I want to go back and relive it? No.""
Madison was 21 years old when she moved into the Holmby Hills home. She was Hefner’s girlfriend from 2001 to 2008. Even though the magazine mogul had multiple girlfriends – at one point, as many as seven, he had ""a jealous streak,"" Madison alleged.

""Even though Hef was dating multiple people, I think it was really important to him and his image that he was seen as somebody who these women were completely devoted to,"" she explained. ""He had a jealous streak. If he found out that one of his girlfriends was being seen with another man, that would really set him off.""
""That’s why I saw some girls get kicked out and [get] banned from working for the company,"" she added.
The Playboy Mansion, once a celebrity hot spot, was known for hosting countless parties. In the property’s infamous Grotto, or the steamy cave-like pool, there were numerous debauched escapades.

Madison alleged that as one of Hefner’s girlfriends, there were strict rules to follow, including maintaining a no-nonsense 9 p.m. curfew. She insisted that Hefner was plagued with ""insecurities"" to maintain his image as a pipe-smoking hedonist.
""He’d just gotten out of a marriage that he didn’t feel great about for whatever reason,"" Madison explained. ""So he wanted to surround himself with multiple women and not just get hung up on one person. And I think he liked the attention he got when he was with three beautiful women on his arm, two of them who were identical twins. He always loved the attention and always wanted to be relevant and chase that kind of thing… And then when those three moved on, he went on to have seven girlfriends because how do you top dating twins?""

""Anytime a woman would feel independent enough that she would want to leave and move on to the next thing, he felt burned by it,"" Madison shared. ""And things got stricter and stricter as time went on… I was not allowed to spend one night away until much, much later when we started doing ‘Girls Next Door.’ And that wasn’t even until Season 3. We were allowed to go on an overnight trip to learn how to snowboard. And because I’m going with security and cameras, he was OK with it for one day. But for most of my seven years with him, we were not apart for maybe more than two or three days.""

Madison alleged that all of Hefner’s girlfriends had to maintain a certain look, and they couldn’t date other men or have an apartment of their own. If anyone broke a house rule, they would be shown the door. The greatest sin any girlfriend could commit was to be seen with another man, the series claimed.
""When I first moved in, I saw multiple girls get kicked out really abruptly, literally had their things packed and set out by the back gate,"" she claimed. ""They were banned from any other event or working for Playboy again. So I was scared of breaking a rule. I was always walking… on eggshells and just didn’t want to get kicked back out on the street where I didn’t really know anybody in LA at that time and didn’t have a lot of resources. So for me, it was kind of… living in fear… just always wanting to do the perfect thing and never make anybody mad.""

""It was a lot of control,"" she said about living at the Playboy Mansion. ""A lot of being made to feel insecure, a lot of being put down. But… you don’t want to be kicked out, and you don’t want to p--- anybody off. I feel like even people who were going to parties at the mansion felt like they knew Hef… [but] they didn’t necessarily see that side.""
""I was a regular guest for the Sunday pool parties for probably a good year before I moved in,"" she continued. ""And the reason I thought it would be a good idea to move [was] because… I saw that level of access [and] what looked like the nicest guy who was so generous, so great with his friends. He was great with some people. But with me, it was a very different story.""
Holly Madison said she has no regrets but wouldn't want to relive her past. (Michael Bezjian/WireImage)
In 2016, Madison wrote a memoir, ""Down the Rabbit Hole,"" where she alleged years of verbal and emotional abuse during her time at the Playboy Mansion. Then in late 2021, she described her ""traumatic"" first sexual encounter with Hefner in the podcast ""Power: Hugh Hefner."" And in early 2022, she sat down for A&E’s ""The Secrets of Playboy,"" where she alleged the mansion was ""cult-like.""

""Some may not approve of the life my Dad chose, but my father was not a liar,"" the 32-year-old tweeted. ""However unconventional, he was sincere in his approach and lived honestly. He was generous in nature and cared deeply for people. These salacious stories are a case study of regret becoming revenge.""

A Virginia man who served as a senior attorney with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has pleaded guilty to convincing young girls to perform sexually explicit acts on a live internet stream, and secretly recording them.
The U.S. Department of Justice said 50-year-old Mark Black of Arlington, Virginia, was a member of two internet groups dedicated to exploiting children.
The goal of both groups was to find prepubescent girls online and convince them to livestream themselves engaging in conduct considered sexually explicit, the DOJ said, referring to court documents.

As the girls engaged in the acts, Black and other members of the groups secretly recorded them and shared the videos among each other.
Court documents show the behavior took place between January 2018 and October 2021. Specifically, in July 2019, Black recorded his screen as a prepubescent minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct on a streaming application.
Later that month, Black and an unnamed co-conspirator convinced a different minor to perform sexually explicit acts on an application that allows people to share photos and videos, the DOJ explained.

On Tuesday, Black pleaded guilty to conspiracy to produce child pornography as well as coercion and enticement.

Iranian dissidents have announced a hunger strike to end the executions of activists after the death of 23-year-old protester Mohammad Ghobadlou.
""This is an act of solidarity with 61 female political prisoners in Iran,"" Iranian-American journalist and activist Masih Alinejad announced in a post on social media platform X.
""Miles away from Iran—this is a very emotional experience,"" Alinejad wrote. ""I feel close to my fellow Iranian women who are leading the campaign against unjust executions in my home country.""
""These brave women have been tortured and endured sexual harassment in prison, yet they still choose to send a message to the rest of the world: We are united against this murderous regime,"" she added.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi announced the strike, and it quickly gained international support from journalists, lawyers, former prisoners, artists and other Iranian groups in the global diaspora, Radio Free Europe reported.

Police arrested Ghobadlou on charges of allegedly killing a policeman during the 2022 protests. The Iranian Supreme Court in the summer of 2023 overruled a death sentence for Ghobadlou, who suffered from bipolar disorder, and ordered a retrial that never happened. Ghobadlou had remained under psychiatric observation since he was 15, and he had allegedly stopped taking his medication ahead of the incident, Barron's reported.
Amir Raisian, Ghobadlou’s lawyer, said on X that he had learned of his client’s execution only the night before it happened – merely 12 hours’ notice. He issued a blistering condemnation for the execution, calling it a ""murder"" and insisting that the authorities lacked ""any legal basis"" for it.

Iran has executed at least seven other protesters for alleged crimes related to the 2022 protests, which broke out in response to the killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died from alleged police brutality due to her seeming breach of the country’s headscarf laws.
Some foreign-based Iranian human rights groups have claimed that Iran executed more than 700 prisoners last year, with at least 11 more at ""imminent risk"" of execution, according to watchdog group Human Rights Watch. The group noted that most of the ""at risk"" prisoners are of Kurdish ethnicity, just as was Amini.

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green on Monday used his annual State of the State address to lead lawmakers and guests in a moment of silence for victims of the Lahaina wildfire and to propose aggressive steps to shift more vacation rentals into residential use to meet both Maui and the state's acute housing needs.
Those gathered for the speech delivered a standing ovation to two Maui firefighters — Keahi Ho and Koa Bonnell — who traveled from Maui for the governor's talk, which focused heavily on helping Maui recover from August's deadly wildfires.
""The people of Maui have shown strength in the face of adversity,"" said Green, a Democrat. ""But the days ahead will not be easy and they will continue to need our support and we will be there for them as long as it takes.""
LAST HAWAIIAN PRINCESS LEAVES $100M OF HER ESTATE FOR NATIVE HAWAIIAN CAUSES
A wildfire fueled by hurricane-force winds raced through the historic coastal town of Lahaina on Aug. 8, killing 100 people and destroying thousands of homes and buildings.
Green's acknowledgment of all those who rushed to Maui's aid after the fire brought tears to the eyes of state Rep. Dee Morikawa, the House majority floor leader and a Democrat representing the western part of Kauai and Niihau.
""It’s just good to know that all of Hawaii is coming together for Maui,"" Morikawa said after the address.

The most urgent unmet need on Maui is now stable long-term housing for some 5,000 residents who are staying in hotel rooms because they haven't been able to find affordable places to rent on the island, one of the nation's most expensive places to live.
Green aims for all 5,000 to move into long-term housing by March 1 in part by encouraging owners of vacation rentals to make their units available to wildfire evacuees. He told reporters authorities have about two-thirds of the needed housing units lined up so far. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and charitable organizations will be covering the rental costs.
More broadly and longer-term, Green proposed a two-year ""tax amnesty"" to encourage owners of vacation rentals around the state to sell to owner-occupants or long-term rental landlords. Participants would be exempt from capital gains, conveyance and general excise taxes under this two-year program.
Green told reporters afterward he was going to put ""a lot of pressure"" on short-term rentals because he didn't believe they were appropriate.
HAWAII HIKERS RESCUED, CITED AFTER RUNNING OUT OF FOOD AND WATER ON MAUNA LOA VOLCANO AMID WINTER WEATHER
""I don’t want to be rude, but I do want people to realize that that market should be for our local families,"" Green said. He noted that workers in a range of fields — including nurses now on strike at the state's only pediatric hospital — are struggling because of Hawaii's housing shortage and high housing costs.
In addition, Green said he's asking the Legislature to put $373 million in the budget for infrastructure and housing.
""This remains our administration’s top statewide priority,"" he said.
Green revisited the idea of imposing a fee on travelers to help pay for environmental upkeep after a proposal to do so died in committee last year. The governor suggested charging each family visiting Hawaii a $25 ""climate impact fee"" when they check in to their hotel or short-term rental. He said this would raise $68 million a year.
Democratic House leaders identified common priorities with the governor, particularly on affordable housing, mental health care and climate change.

The House Finance Committee's chairperson, Rep. Kyle Yamashita, said he would have to look at the details of the governor's tax amnesty plan but indicated he was open to the idea.
""At the end of the day, I think we have to look at every option to deal with this issue,"" Yamashita said after the speech. ""They are affecting residential areas throughout the state. And it’s something that we have to look into more deeply.""
House Speaker Scott Saiki said the House would cooperate with the governor.
""We need to solve problems in our state, and we need to find solutions that are going to be workable,"" Saiki said."

Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, discusses the Supreme Court temporarily allowing Border Patrol agents to remove Texas razor-wire fencing on Your World.
FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is raising the alarm about a massive number of ""gotaways"" at the southern border last year, after a new Congressional Budget Office report found that the number last fiscal year exceeded the population of Missouri's two largest cities combined.
Hawley, in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, cited the new CBO report which found that there were a record-setting 860,000 illegal immigrants who evaded Border Patrol agents in fiscal year 2023.
""These ""gotaways"" outnumber the combined populations of Kansas City and St. Louis, the two largest cities in Missouri,"" Hawley said. ""At the very least, you owe the American people full transparency into what your Department knows about illegal immigrants who have entered our nation without being stopped or tracked.""

The CBO report had found that DHS had not released official estimates for FY 23, but Mayorkas himself had testified that there had been over 600,000 gotaways. It then cited media reporting that the number was over 770,000.
""To account for the second group, people who crossed the border but were not observed or detected by CBP officials, CBO then adjusted the estimate of 750,000 people upward by 15 percent (or 110,000 people), to 860,000 people, following testimony by the Chief of the Border Patrol, who said that the estimated number probably undercounted those people by 10 percent to 20 percent,"" the report said.
The gotaways came amid a record fiscal year that saw over 2.4 million migrant encounters. Gotaways are particularly worrisome to officials as they are more likely to have something to hide, including criminal convictions, from officials. Jason Owens, now head of the Border Patrol, told lawmakers last year of his concerns over gotaways.

""If a person is willing to put themselves into harm’s way crossing through very remote, very dangerous conditions to evade capture, you have to ask yourself why. What makes them willing to take that risk? That’s of concern to me,"" he said. ""What’s also of concern to me is I don’t know who that individual is. I don’t know where they came from. I don’t know what their intention is. I don’t know what they brought with them. That unknown represents a risk, a threat. It’s of great concern to anybody that wears this uniform.""
Hawley says the crisis has gotten worse under Mayorkas’ leadership.
""The yearly number of gotaways has increased dramatically under your watch, up from nearly 600,000 in fiscal year 2022 and more than double the 389,515 in fiscal year 2021,"" he says. ""All told, nearly 2 million illegal immigrants have successfully evaded border officials during the Biden Administration.""
He also cited reports that there were over 302,000 migrant encounters in December, itself a new record.

""These unprecedented figures underscore the need for you to be fully transparent about your Department’s own accounting of the southern border crisis,"" he said.
He is asking for DHS to corroborate the CBO estimate, and to provide methodology of how gotaway estimates are calculated, and how many suspected terrorists, violent criminals and other felons are among them.
DHS has previously noted that gotaways have been an issue for multiple administrations, blaming it on a ""broken"" immigration system that is in need for reform and funding from Congress. The administration is seeking over $14 billion in border funding, which includes money for technology and staffing at the border. That funding is currently being held due to Republican demands for limits on asylum and the use of parole.
DHS has said that its investments in technology and personnel it has been able to make has led to high levels of apprehensions, including over 70% in 2021, and that the average rate has remained identical to the Trump administration, compared to around 35% between 2002-2004.
The department says that there is also more awareness of who is getting in, even if they are not captured, due to those investments.

""With the investments that this Congress has made in the Border Patrol, CBP as a whole, we have greater situational awareness now than I’ve ever had,"" then-Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said in March last year.

Republican strategists told Fox News Digital that GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley needs a ""realistic path"" to win primary elections in her quest for the White House.
Fox News Digital reached out to several Republican strategists for their takes after Haley's New Hampshire loss to former President Trump on Tuesday.
Targeted Victory Vice President Matt Gorman told Fox News Digital that while the race isn't over, Haley needs a ""realistic path"" in her campaign to win future primary elections.

""It’s not over yet, but Haley needs to set a realistic path for supporters, donors and the press as to how she’ll start actually winning some of these,"" Gorman said.
Haley did not win the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary but is continuing her campaign as the GOP primary race heads to her home state of South Carolina. A win for Haley in South Carolina would be a critical step in her presidential aspirations.
Jimmy Keady, JLK Political Strategies founder and president, told Fox News Digital that ""President Trump is dominating these primaries, and he has the benefit of being a sort of pseudo-incumbent.""
""Voters across the country remember the positives of his Presidency; a stronger economy, more secure border, and respect abroad — his Presidency is fresh on the minds of voters,"" Keady said.
""The trick is that candidates and their consultants must capitalize on the momentum and not fizzle out as we have seen in the past,"" he continued. ""What we are going to see in the coming weeks will likely be a coalescing of support from Republican leaders across the country.""
""It is up to either campaign to build off the momentum from New Hampshire,"" he added.

Matt Wolking, Axiom Strategies vice president of communications who previously worked for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' super PAC, Never Back Down, told Fox News Digital that the ""numbers in New Hampshire show that Trump is as strong among Republican voters as he is weak among the broader electorate that will determine the outcome of the general election in November.""
""Haley cannot win the Republican primary by relying on non-Republican voters, and it’s unlikely she will still be a candidate in March,"" Wolking said. ""The only question is whether she calls it quits before or after South Carolina.""
Trump won the New Hampshire primary by a sizable margin, securing 54% of the vote to Haley's 43%. Still, Haley vowed to continue her campaign through the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24.
Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas told Fox News Digital that we ""don’t do coronations in this country.""
""We do elections,"" Perez-Cubas said. ""The political elites can back Donald Trump, but Nikki Haley will continue to fight for the nearly 50% of Republican primary voters and the 70% of all Americans who don’t want a Biden-Trump rematch.""
But some GOP strategists still don't see a path forward for the former governor. Aaron Evans, national GOP strategist and president of Winning Republican Strategies, said, ""Iowa and New Hampshire reinforced what we have known for months — there’s only one viable candidate in the Republican nomination process and that’s President Trump.""
""Despite all efforts otherwise from his competitors, the vast majority of Republican voters remain all-in for Trump. Haley’s loss in New Hampshire was a major blow in a state we were told she could win, and when she loses her home state of South Carolina in a few weeks, the blow will be even bigger. Optimism and hope from a failing campaign is not a strategy.""
""It didn’t work for Ron DeSantis, and it won’t work for Nikki Haley. President Trump will decisively be the Republican nominee,"" Evans added.
GOP strategist with Calvary LLC John Ashbrook told Fox News Digital, ""President Trump's team has put on a clinic in every state where they've operated this cycle.""
""Nikki's campaign is incredibly talented and President Trump's victories are a testament to the professional machine he's built,"" Ashbrook said.

The strategists' comments come after Haley's loss to Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday.

DeSantis ended his campaign two days before the primary, effectively making it a head-to-head race between Trump and Haley.
The results of the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of nearly 2,000 New Hampshire Republican primary voters, show the contours of a race that was notably closer than the Iowa caucuses, which Trump won by 30 points.

FIRST ON FOX: Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee are investigating Chicago’s housing of illegal immigrants at two airports in the city -- asking whether the city is violating funding requirements, and accusing the city of being an ""illegal immigrant magnet"" with its sanctuary city policy.
The Republicans, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have written to Mayor Brandon Johnson over its moves to house migrants at O’Hare International Airport since March and more recently in Midway International Airport. Images emerged last year of hundreds of migrants camped out in O'Hare in a section of the airport. It came as the city struggled to deal with an influx of tens of thousands of migrants since mid-2022.
""Repurposing airport facilities and infrastructure to house illegal aliens not only degrades taxpayers’ investment in the national airport system but, at least in the case of O’Hare, as federally-funded airport facilities are withdrawn from public access and use, it violates the requirement that these federally funded facilities ‘be available for public use as an airport.’""
""No rational person would define an airport as a facility that houses illegal aliens,"" they say.

They also note Chicago’s status as a ""sanctuary city"" and say that its opposition to busing of migrants from Texas by Gov. Greg Abbott shows the city is ""working overtime to avoid making good on such platitudes.""
""Just recently, you characterized the sending of illegal aliens to Chicago as ‘sow[ing] seeds of chaos,’ implied Texas Governor Greg Abbott is motivated by racial animus and that his voluntary transportation program for illegal aliens to sanctuary cities is ‘attacking . . . cities that are being led by black leaders or leaders of color,’ and demanded the federal government and the American taxpayer pick up the bill for Chicago’s decision to flout federal law,"" they say.

It also highlights a dispute between the city and United Airlines and American Airlines regarding a new terminal at O’Hare, and asks if the city is ""trying to squeeze more money out of United and America as you struggle to offset the costs of being a sanctuary city.""
The lawmakers are asking about the number of migrants being housed at the airports, the related costs, the hazards it has created, if it received any federal waivers and if it consulted with the TSA on matter of aviation safety and security.

""Rather than advocating for border communities alone to shoulder the burden, we encourage you to use the authorities at your disposal to advocate for border and transportation security, the enforcement of immigration laws, and consider reversing the illegal immigrant magnet that is Chicago’s misguided sanctuary city policy,"" they say.
In December, Johnson touted his administration’s efforts to provide housing, healthcare and schooling for the migrants coming to the city, but has appealed for additional federal help. He is one of a coalition of mayors who has called for more than $5 billion in assistance from the federal government.

""I've said repeatedly we need more resources,"" he added.

RGMGGNJDRO_6F1DEXNM1E7O98L,Texas governor doing 'exactly right thing' amid constitutional battle over border enforcement: legal experts,By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 7:18pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-gov-doing-exactly-right-thing-amid-constitutional-battle-ever-border-enforcement-legal-experts,"Montgomery County, Texas, resident Jonathan Hullihan discusses counties in the Lone Star State that have declared a border invasion.
The latest Supreme Court decision in Texas’ battle with the Biden White House has sparked a showdown over the Lone Star State’s constitutional authority to defend itself with the federal government seemingly getting in its way.
On Monday, in a 5-4 decision on an emergency appeal, the Supreme Court ruled to temporarily overturn a lower court’s injunction that banned the federal government from cutting razor fencing Texas had installed along the border near Eagle Pass while litigation continues.
Late Wednesday night, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared his constitutional authority to reserve the right of his state to self-defense against an invasion, adding that the executive branch had broken its constitutional pact with the states by failing to enforce federal immigration laws.
Legal experts told Fox News Digital Texas is well within its constitutional rights and within the Supreme Court’s order to keep building the razor-wire fence even if the feds continue to cut it before an appeals court addresses the matter.
BORDER BATTLE LINES: DEMS CALL ON BIDEN TO SEIZE CONTROL OF TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD, AS GOP ALLIES BACK ABBOTT

Gene Hamilton, vice president and general counsel at America First Legal and a former Justice Department official in the Trump administration, said Abbott's continuation of installing the razor wire is ""exactly the right move.""
""Unless and until a federal judge comes in and says, ‘You may not, State of Texas, put razor wire up along the border anymore,' Texas should keep doing exactly what it needs to do. And, eventually, this turns into a game of will between the feds and the State of Texas,"" Hamilton said.
ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS 'RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE' FROM MIGRANT 'INVASION' AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN
Hamilton noted that he believed the Supreme Court’s controversial order was wrong and gave too much weight to the government's assertions about the wire's effect on the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws.
He asserted that Texas was not interfering with the government's enforcement of the laws by creating additional barriers along the border and contended that those barriers actually facilitate the federal government's ability to deter and prohibit illegal crossings at the locations where they were present.

""The Supreme Court’s two-sentence order simply vacated the injunction preventing the federal government from tearing down the barbed wire fencing Texas has placed on state property while the case is on appeal,"" Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies told Fox News Digital.
""The Supreme Court’s order does not prevent Texas from continuing to place barbed wire or other barriers along the border on state or private property. But while the case is pending, there is nothing preventing the federal government from tearing down the wire fencing,"" he said.
As to Abbott's Article 1 assertions, von Spakovsky said that ""whether or not what is happening is an ‘invasion’ within the meaning of the Constitution is a controversial and legally undetermined issue.""
Article 1, Section 10, which Abbott says was ""triggered"" by Biden's inaction at the border, states, ""No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.""
GOP GOVERNORS RALLY BEHIND TEXAS AS ABBOTT DEFIES BIDEN: ‘DERELICTION OF DUTY’
""It is truly shocking and outrageous that the Biden administration has so intentionally and deliberately mishandled the security of our Southern border that states like Texas, for the first time in our history, feel the need to invoke the invasion clause,"" von Spakovsky said.
Ultimately, he says, the matter will need to be decided by the Supreme Court.
In 2012, the Supreme Court decided a case against Arizona brought by the federal government, which sued after Arizona empowered state officials to enforce immigration laws.
Arizona lost that case, but the late Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, writing that ""as a sovereign, Arizona has the inherent power to exclude persons from its territory, subject only to those limitations expressed in the Constitution or constitutionally imposed by Congress. That power to exclude has long been recognized as inherent in sovereignty.""

William Lane, a partner at Wiley Rein LLP and former DOJ official, suggested to Fox News Digital the Supreme Court may eventually consider the Texas case on the merits or a number of other challenges between states and the executive branch percolating in the courts. If the court does choose to weigh in, it may be asked to reconsider Justice Scalia’s theory.  ""A decade ago, the Supreme Court rejected an attempt by Arizona to regulate immigration. Justice Scalia, dissenting, argued that states retain at least some inherent authority under the Constitution to control their borders,"" said Lane. ""The court has changed significantly since then, and it'll be interesting to see whether there's any appetite to revisit that decision as states like Texas try to address illegal immigration on their own,"" he said. ""It should be no surprise that Gov. Abbott has chosen to embrace Justice Scalia’s theory of state sovereignty in defending Texas’s actions.""

Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, emphasized that the high court’s ruling Monday, as an emergency docket decision, was ""very narrow.""
""I think what we are getting closer to is, unless the Supreme Court says what Texas can and can’t do, Texas will be pushing the boundaries,"" Blackman said.
The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear the merits of Texas’ case over the Eagle Pass razor wire on Feb. 7.

RHTOF3DBG3_J707QWYKRIAA7SJ,Rights group reports more arrests as Belarus intensifies crackdown on dissent,Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 5:04pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/rights-group-reports-more-arrests-belarus-intensifies-crackdown-dissent,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A rights group on Thursday reported dozens more home raids and arrests across Belarus in the latest intensification of a years-long crackdown on dissent in the country of 9.5 million people.
The Viasna human rights center said it knew of at least 159 people targeted by searches and detentions in multiple Belarusian cities, including the capital, Minsk. Those targeted by authorities included relatives of jailed dissidents, journalists and others, it said.
BELARUS ARRESTS AT LEAST 64 IN LUKASHENKO REGIME'S LATEST ANTI-DISSIDENT CRACKDOWN
Leaders of Belarusian opposition have called the new wave of arrests, which is the biggest in recent months, ""a blow to the solidarity within the country.""
According to Viasna, there are 1,419 political prisoners now held in Belarus. Many of those detained Thursday and earlier in the week had been helping families of those jailed for political reasons.
Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko unleashed an unrelenting crackdown on dissent in August 2020, after an election the opposition and the West denounced as a sham gave him his sixth term in office.
President Alexander Lukashenko has continued his crackdown on domestic dissent.
The outcome of the vote triggered unprecedented mass protests that rocked the country for months. Belarusian authorities detained more than 35,000 demonstrators, with police and security forces brutally beating many. Thousands have fled the country, and dozens have been labeled extremists by authorities.
Many of those detained Thursday were reportedly involved with the INeedHelpBY project, which helps ""provide food to political prisoners and others who find themselves in dire straits amid repressions."" Officials have outlawed the project as extremist, which exposes anyone involved to prosecution and imprisonment of up to seven years.
INeedHelpBY activst Filip Hauryshau has urged people involved to leave the project's online chat and unfollow it on social media, saying authorities are seeking a list of those involved. INeedHelpBY reported the project has provided assistance worth of more than $1.5 million since 2020.
Arrests have been carried out by Belarus’ main security service, the KGB, and its officers demand those targeted and those who witness raids to sign a non-disclosure agreement, one such witness told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals.
Viasna said security operatives also forcibly install spyware on the phones of those detained and their relatives, which allows the KGB to monitor closed chats of activists.
""The attack on the people and the initiatives, which in harsh conditions make sure Belarusians aren't left without help, aims for revenge for the solidarity, to destroy the support infrastructure, intimidate people involved in it,"" Viasna rights advocate Pavel Sapelka told AP.
The Belarusian Association of Journalists said that among those arrested was Aksana Yuchkovich, a journalist with the news outlet Catholic.By who was involved in helping families of political prisoners.
It said that in the western city of Drahichyn, authorities arrested Siarhei Gardzievich, a journalist who previously served 1 1/2 years in prison before being released in October 2022. In the eastern city of Vitebsk, journalist and rights advocate Barys Khamaida was arrested.
According to the association, authorities also launched a criminal investigation of 20 Belarusian analysts and pundits who live abroad, accusing them of conspiring to overthrow the government and ""propaganda of extremism.""
In a statement, Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she was ""shocked by the raids of the Belarusian regime on families of political prisoners.""

Josep Borrell, the European Union's top diplomat, condemned the new wave of arrests, noting it is unfolding ahead of parliamentary elections in February.
Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement that the latest arrests represent ""a new departure in the chilling campaign to exterminate all vestiges of dissent in Belarus since the disputed 2020 election."""

With no help from police or the city, the owner says he paid to get his house back.
Squatters have taken over a multi-million dollar mansion on the border of Beverly Hills, inviting partygoers to ravage the property through all hours of the night, according to frustrated neighbors.
Squatters have occupied the four-bedroom Beverly Crest mansion — listed on Zillow for nearly $4.6 million — for several months, outraging neighbors, ABC7 reported Tuesday. The squatters not only appear to be living in the home, but even charge admission for advertised late night parties, the neighbors told the local outlet.
""There's a roaming pit bull with children around,"" said Fran Solomon, who owns and rents out the home next door to the alleged squatters. ""There are people drunk and stoned, wobbling, walking in and out, and then driving the canyons. Does someone need to be killed before the police will do something?""
Drug paraphernalia and condoms were littered across the property, while partygoers loiter on the streets from late night into the morning, ABC7 reported. One neighbor, Rick, told NBC4 Los Angeles nearby residents have called the police and fire department to report issues involving the home and have towed cars off their private properties.

SQUATTER'S PARADISE? AMERICA'S BIGGEST CITY ‘PLAYING WITH FIRE’ OVER THIS NEW RULE, ATTORNEY SAYS
""We’re very concerned as neighbors for our own safety, for the safety of our kids and for our homes,"" Rick said
Solomon told ABC7 her tenant was forced to hire armed security.
""We rented in good faith, and they rented in good faith and here they're in this situation where they are hiring an armed security guard to protect them and their family,"" Solomon said. ""That's how concerned our tenant is for their safety.""
ARMY OFFICER AWAY ON ACTIVE DUTY SPEAKS OUT AFTER SQUATTER MOVED INTO GEORGIA HOME: ‘QUITE ALARMING’
The house was most recently owned by MDRCA Properties LLC, but the company filed for bankruptcy last year, NBC4 reported. Los Angeles Police Department Senior Lead Officer James Allen, who's handling the investigation into the alleged squatters, told the Daily Mail that the house's ownership is in question and entering foreclosure, but people living there claimed to know a former owner who invited them to stay there.
""I guess we can say they're squatters,"" Allen told the Daily Mail. ""But they're squatters to the owner that's in foreclosure to the bank. We're working on a plan with the bank to evict the individuals because there's no one at this point to evict them and say they're there illegally.""
PENNSYLVANIA MAN PAYS RANSOM TO RECLAIM HOUSE FROM SQUATTERS: ‘THE CITY IS REWARDING CRIMINALS’
Allen said the alleged squatters' drivers licenses are registered to the home, which could lead to a lengthy court eviction process, the Daily Mail reported. He also submitted a request to the Los Angeles City Attorney's office to help oust the alleged squatters.
""If you were able to grab a house illegally, and I didn't catch you during that process, but now you have an ID because you went to the [Department of Motor Vehicles] and you got mail to that house, then it has to go through the eviction process,"" Allen said. ""I'm no longer able to just take you out of that home.""
John Woodward IV, the property listing's broker that a court hired after a previous owner fled the country amid murder accusations and an alleged link to a Medicare fraud scheme, told KTLA5 he found the front locks and gate code were changed after receiving a call that people were moving in.
A home in Hollywood Hills was also trashed by squatters last year, according to the LAPD.  (Coutesy: Fox 11)
Woodward called the police, but the people refused to leave and told officers they had a lease, he said. One of the alleged squatters also told KTLA5 on Wednesday that he had a lease, but couldn’t provide further comment.

""This is a very affluent area, paying exorbitant taxes, and we can’t seem to get the proper response from the LAPD to close this down,"" Solomon said in another interview with NBC4. ""The law abiding citizens aren’t getting protection from criminals that have taken over a home that doesn’t belong to them.""
LAPD declined to comment. The city attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

RN6IH3SPUN_I7SKSUHOLP48TM7,Protesting farmers heap pressure on new French prime minister ahead of hotly anticipated measures,Associated Press,"Published January 26, 2024 2:55pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/protesting-farmers-heap-pressure-new-french-prime-minister-hotly-anticipated-measures,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
PARIS (AP) — Protesting farmers shut down long stretches of some of France's major highways again Friday, using tractors to block and slow traffic and squeeze the government ever more tightly to give in to their demands that growing and rearing food be made easier and more lucrative.
The farmers' spreading movement for better remuneration for their produce, less red tape and lower costs, as well as protection against cheap imports is increasingly becoming a major crisis for the government. It echoes the 2018-2019 yellow vest demonstrations against economic injustice that rocked the first term of President Emmanuel Macron and lastingly dented his popularity.
1 KILLED, 2 INJURED AT FARMERS' PROTEST BARRICADE IN NORTHERN FRANCE
This time, Macron's new Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, his mettle being sorely tested just two weeks into the job, is hoping to assuage and win over demonstrating farmers with a series of measures he announced during a visit to a cattle farm in southern France on Friday afternoon. They include ""drastically simplifying"" certain technical procedures ""starting today."" Some of the measures will reduce 14 rules to one, Attal said.
In another move to placate farmers, he announced the progressive end to diesel fuel taxes for farm vehicles.
The prime minister, wearing a suit and tie and reading from notes that rested on a bale of hay, said the government has decided ""to put agriculture above all,"" words he repeated numerous times. In an apparent nod to the far right, he said the ""marching order"" is ""to protect our heritage and identity"" because French agriculture defines ""who we are.""
""We have to open a new chapter, change the mentality ... firstly that of the state,"" he said, before heading to one of the first farmers' blockades for a first-hand encounter with the anger.
Ranged against the government has been the well-organized and media-savvy movement by determined farmers. Using their tractors and sometimes hay bales as barriers, they've been blocking and slowing traffic on major roads. They've also dumped stinky agricultural waste at the gates of government offices.
Highway operator Vinci Autoroutes said two highways that are usually busy thoroughfares for road traffic through southern France and into Spain, the A7 and A9, were closed Friday morning by farmers' blockades for long stretches totaling nearly 400 kilometers (250 miles). Blockades also severed more than a dozen other highways, Vinci said. Tractors also blocked some major roads leading toward Paris.
Farmer Nicolas Gallepin, who took part in a demonstration in his tractor at a traffic circle south of Paris this week, said thickets of regulations that govern how food can be produced are swallowing up chunks of his time and that fuel costs are eating into his bottom line.
""We’ve seen, in the last 10 years, one good year in 2022, but that’s it. We’ve not been paid what we deserve in 10 years,"" he said. ""What really hurts us is competing imports from other countries that don’t comply with the same regulations.""
The yellow vest protests held France in their grip for months, starting among provincial workers camped out at traffic circles to protest fuel taxes and subsequently snowballing into a nationwide challenge to Macron's government. Likewise, farmers initially vented their anger more modestly, turning road signs upside down to protest what they argue are nonsensical agricultural policies.

But their grievances were largely unheard before they started to grab headlines in recent weeks with traffic blockades and other protests.
More widely, the unrest in France is are also symptomatic of discontent in agricultural heartlands across the European Union. The influential and heavily subsidized sector is becoming a hot-button issue ahead of European Parliament elections in June. Populist and far-right parties are hoping to make hay from rural disgruntlement against free trade agreements, burdensome costs worsened by Russia's war in Ukraine and other complaints."
ROCCE1ILGY_4L5SYS3IY6ZNZCF,Eric Swalwell calls out soft-on-crime prosecutors for letting 'dangerous people threaten our kids',By Joe Schoffstall Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 12:12pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eric-swalwell-calls-out-soft-on-crime-prosecutors-for-letting-dangerous-people-threaten-our-kids,"Fox News’ Jonathan Serrie reports on calls to oust the city’s top cop.
Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell took aim at soft-on-crime prosecutors on Thursday, saying that their actions threaten children.
The California lawmaker took to social media to respond to a story about a carjacker lifting a 2-year-old boy out of a stolen car and leaving him on the Oakland streets.
""My wife and I play these scenarios over in our head all the time,"" Swalwell wrote. ""We've practiced going out through the back seat to get our kids out of our car if we are carjacked.""

""This is not normal. Soft on violent-crime prosecutors are letting too many dangerous people threaten our kids,"" he said.
Swalwell's views deviate from those of many other Democrats, who tend to fully support such prosecutors due to their ""reform-minded"" nature.
Liberal billionaires have played a significant role in pushing many left-wing prosecutors into office in several cities nationwide. George Soros, for example, has devoted tens of millions of dollars to elect such candidates.

RPSBASTP5K_78RZ14JKTOM9DUW,"Israeli-American chef from Turkish family battles antisemitism, is labeled a 'Nazi' after Oct. 7 terror attack",By Kerry J. Byrne Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 4:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/israeli-american-chef-turkish-family-battles-antisemitism-labeled-nazi-oct-7-terror-attack,"Americans in the nation's capital shared whether antisemitism has gotten better or worse in the U.S. since Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 ambush on Israel.
First-generation Israeli-American Avi Shemtov, a multi-ethnic chef, has confronted racism, antisemitism and shocking charges of White supremacy ever since speaking out against the Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, he told Fox News Digital.
""Cry harder, Nazi,"" read one attack on social media against the owner of restaurant Simcha in Sharon, Massachusetts, he relayed.
""People have basically called me a White supremacist,"" Shemtov said in an interview — despite the fact that his late father’s family is from Asia.
RACIST CLAIMS OF ‘WHITE ISRAEL’ STOKE HATRED, ENDANGER JEWS AND DENY MULTIRACIAL REALITY, SAY EXPERTS
Yona Shemtov was a chef, Sephardic Jew and first member of his Turkish family born in Israel. His uncle was murdered during a period of antisemitic violence in Turkey. The family fled for the new Jewish state in 1949 as it welcomed people of all races and ethnicities from around the world.
Yona Shemtov then moved to the United States in 1972.

Avi Shemtov opened Simcha in 2019 to celebrate his multicultural heritage and the global influences of modern Israeli cuisine he learned from his father.
Simcha serves Moroccan carrots, Yemenite fried chicken and woodfire-roasted okra — common in East Africa. Its signature dish is shakshuka, a savory tomato stew with influences from Turkey and North Africa.
""Israel enjoys maybe the world’s most diverse food scene because Israel may have the world’s most diverse population."" — Avi Shemtov
""Israel enjoys maybe the world’s most diverse food scene because Israel may have the world’s most diverse population,"" said Shemtov, whose mother is Polish-American.
""It has all the diversity found in the United States compressed into an area the size of New Jersey.""
He was typically bemused when guests asked if the woman depicted in a mural on the restaurant wall was Native American.

(Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)
The woman is actually his late grandmother, Simcha.
She and her husband, Ovadya, were Sephardic Jews born and raised in Istanbul before they moved to Israel. Simcha is also the Hebrew word for ""joy"" or ""happiness.""
ISRAELI-AMERICAN RAPPER KOSHA DILLZ FEARLESSLY EMBRACES HERITAGE, SKEWERS ANTISEMITISM IN VIRAL VIDEOS
His grandmother’s ethnicity merely confirmed the restaurant’s purpose, said Shemtov. It showed that the Israeli people, like the food he served, defied a single identity.
But his bemusement turned to anger, activism and concern for the safety of his family in the United States and overseas after the Hamas terror attacks in October.
""Jews have never been indigenous to Israel,"" one critic raged at Shemtov on social media, contradicting the entire known history of the Jewish people. ""You’re White. White people aren’t indigenous to the Middle East.""

Shemtov, a member of the local school committee and a prominent figure in the Boston-area food scene, was shocked when he was confronted by the racism and ignorance at the root of antisemitism in America.
""Nobody would ever call my grandmother White. Nobody ever thought of my father as White,"" said Shemtov.
""The reality is that in Israel you will see Jews who look Black, Brown, Asian, African and everything in between.""
""Look at my dad’s family. Do they look White? This is what Israelis look like.""
The image he provided of his grandparents, father, aunts and uncles shows a family with various shades of olive to deep brown skin with dark eyes and thick, dark hair.
""The reality is that in Israel you will see Jews who look Black, Brown, Asian, African and everything in between,"" Dan Feferman, a former national security adviser to the Israel Defense Ministry, told Fox News Digital last week.

""The mischaracterization [that Israelis are White] is wildly inaccurate and unfortunately drives animosity in the Middle East and around the world against Israel.""
More than 1 in 5 of Israel's 9.4 million residents are Arab, according to the nation's Central Bureau of Statistics.

About 72% are Jewish, but more than half of them are, like the Shemtovs, Sephardic.
They are Turkish, Arab, Persian and African, among other ethnicities.
More than 90% of the Jews in America, however, are Ashkenanzi Jews from Europe, said Feferman.
The image of White Jews has been reinforced in American pop culture, from Woody Allen flicks to the classic TV sitcom ""Seinfeld.""

The narrative of Israel as a White nation is being exploited by organizations such as National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP), among those inciting protests around the United States and calling for the destruction of Israel.
""Israel was founded through racism,"" the NSJP wrote last year in its online magazine, The Written Resistance.
""If you think for a second I’m going to beg forgiveness … for demanding that our hostages be returned, you’ve misjudged me."" — Avi Shemtov
The attack on Israel continued, ""The idea of a state ‘for’ a particular ethnic group is racist because it entails privileging one group over another. Therefore there can be no Jewish state, or any ethnostate for that matter, that is not fundamentally racist.""
The narrative of Israel-Palestine as a race war parroted in protests is also being used to fuel charges of racism used against Israeli-Americans.
Shemtov's defense of Israel sparked a community petition in November looking to remove him as chair of the local school committee.

""Mr. Shemtov has tried to justify the use of white phosphorous bombs on Palestinian civilians,"" one person even charged in a public school committee meeting late last year.
But Shemtov wrote in a social media response to critics, ""[My great uncle] was stabbed to death in public as part of the pogroms that expelled Jews from Turkey and other Arab lands.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Senior U.S. and Chinese representatives are expected to meet in the Thai capital as the two countries seek to cool tensions.
Officials from both sides said U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi would meet in Bangkok. The exact schedule for their talks was not announced, but both are scheduled to be in the city from Friday, where they’re meeting separately with Thai officials.
National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said their planned meeting ""continues the commitment by both sides at the November 2023 Woodside Summit between President Biden and President Xi to maintain strategic communication and responsibly manage the relationship.""
US AND IRAQ TO DISCUSS FUTURE MILITARY PRESENCE IN COMING WEEKS: PENTAGON OFFICIAL
That summit meeting was seen as an effort to patch up frayed relations due to quarrels over a range of economic and geopolitical issues.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin confirmed that Wang Yi plans to meet with Sullivan. Speaking at a news conference in Beijing, he said the Chinese foreign minister ""will make clear China’s position on China-U.S. relations and the Taiwan issue, and exchange views with the U.S. on international and regional issues of mutual concern.""
An immediate issue of concern to both countries is tensions in the Red Sea that have upended global trade by forcing many shippers to avoid the Suez Canal.
China has been in ""close communication with all parties concerned and making positive efforts to de-escalate"" the conflict, during which Iran-backed Houthi rebels have attacked international ships with missiles, Wang Wenbin said Wednesday.
Washington has reportedly sought to have Beijing use its influence with Iran to address the attacks.
The meeting comes days after another senior Chinese diplomat traveled to North Korea.
Sullivan and Wang are separately holding bilateral talks with Thai officials, according to the U.S. and Chinese statements. Washington is contending with Beijing for influence with longtime U.S. ally Thailand, as Beijing has been flexing its diplomatic and economic muscle globally in recent years.
SPACE WARFARE: US, CHINA, AND RUSSIA ARE GEARING UP FOR THE NEXT FRONTIER OF ARMED CONFLICT
Sullivan, whose visit is scheduled to end Saturday, paid a courtesy call Friday on Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and later held a bilateral meeting with Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara, the Thai foreign ministry said.
""During the discussions, both sides reiterated commitment to the long-standing treaty alliance between the two countries based on shared values of democracy, human rights, and human security,"" said a Thai statement.
It said the talks also covered ""ways to to further enhance partnership both at the bilateral and regional levels across diverse fields."" and discussion of regional and international crises in Myanmar, Ukraine and the Middle East.
The Thai foreign ministry announced that Wang Yi will meet with his counterpart on Saturday to sign an agreement exempting Thai nationals from requiring visas to visit China, and on Monday will meet with the prime minister."
RR0Y31PKD3_6NA7GMW5M38JJL3,Biden’s incompetence could force us into another Middle East war,By K.T. McFarland Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 5:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-incompetence-could-force-another-middle-east-war,"Former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland tells ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ that the way in which the Biden administration carried out the strikes on the Houthis ‘reinforced weakness.’
Events in the Middle East are rapidly spinning out of control. The Biden administration’s policy of placating Iran in hopes of avoiding a larger conflict is having the opposite effect. It's made war more likely.
President Joe Biden’s policies have not convinced Iran to become a responsible power, they have emboldened Iran and its proxies to launch increasingly aggressive actions. If they sink a ship or kill Americans, we would be dragged into a war we don’t want, are unprepared to fight ... and might have been avoided if President Donald Trump’s policies had remained in place.
Starting on October 7, when Hamas killed hundreds of Israeli civilians, Iran has unleashed its proxies – Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen – to attack U.S., Israeli, and allied military, civilian and commercial interests, facilities and ships.
IRANIAN PROXIES STEPPING UP THEIR DRONE ATTACKS IN WAR WITH ISRAEL
In these last three months, Iran’s proxies have launched over 100 attacks on U.S. outposts in Syria and Iraq. Iran’s Houthi rebels are now firing daily on ships in the Red Sea.

So far, we’ve engaged in perimeter defense of these ships, destroying Houthi missiles just before they reach their targets.
Finally, last week, the Biden administration took the fight to Yemen, targeting launch sites. Once the dust settled, however, it appeared the U.S.-U.K. combined attack wasn’t that ambitious. It destroyed less than a third of the Houthi’s offensive capabilities, according to U.S. officials. Not enough to stop more attacks. But just enough to encourage the Houthis to up the ante.
It’s a miracle there have been no mass casualties, so far. It’s a testament to our armed forces, especially our Navy. But sooner or later, a missile will get through our defenses and hit its target and sink a ship. There will be large-scale American and allied casualties.
We will then be at war – the very war the Biden administration has been at great pains to avoid.
On and off for 45 years, American presidents have tried to prod Iran into pursuing peace with its neighbors. But peace in the Middle East was never Iran’s plan.
Since the mullahs took over the country in 1979, their goal has never wavered. They want to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and push the United States out of the Middle East.
When Biden came into office, he inherited a relatively peaceful Middle East. Trump’s sanctions and low oil prices had cut Iran’s revenues in half.
The assassination of Qassem Soleimani and other senior Iranian military officials was a major setback for Iran’s terrorist and proxy operations. The Arab-Israeli Abraham Accords left Iran isolated. By 2020, Iran was on the ropes.
This undated photograph released by the U.S. military's Central Command shows what is described as Iranian-made missile components bound for Yemen's Houthi seized off a vessel in the Arabian Sea.

(U.S. Central Command via AP)
In his zeal to do the opposite of everything Trump did, Biden became Iran’s great enabler. Biden’s war on American fossil fuels doubled, and occasionally tripled, the historically low oil prices of the Trump years. Biden’s failure to enforce Trump-era sanctions allowed Iran to sell oil.
Biden paid Iran ransom for American hostages and unfroze funds. By some estimates, Iran is $100 billion richer than it would have been if Trump’s policies had remained in place. Predictably, Iran used its windfall profits to unleash its proxies and attack Israel, the U.S. and our allies.
If we are to avoid getting dragged into a larger war, the United States needs to reestablish deterrence, and fast.

First, let Iran and their proxies know if they kill Americans, they die. Don’t wait for incoming missiles to get right up to our ships before shooting them down. We have the technology to identify where the drones and missiles are coming from. We know where Houthi warships dock. If they launch against American or allied ships, immediately destroy the sites.
That’s what Trump did in the early days of his administration, when Syrian planes attacked their own people with chemical weapons. Trump didn’t threaten or wring his hands, he destroyed the Syrian airfields. A larger war was avoided. We didn’t hear from the Syrians for years.
That’s also what President Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s. When Iran mined the Strait of Hormuz and nearly sank an American warship in international waters, Reagan retaliated by destroying Iran’s minelaying ships and port. A larger war was avoided. We didn’t hear from Iran for decades.
Second, target Iran’s economy. Reinforce the sanctions. Drive down the price of oil by unleashing American energy production. Wars are expensive. If Iran’s oil revenues are cut in half, it won’t have the money to fund terrorist proxies.
On and off for 45 years, American presidents have tried to prod Iran into pursuing peace with its neighbors. But peace in the Middle East was never Iran’s plan.

Finally, let Israel finish the job of destroying Hamas. Let Iran know that the United States – working with our allies – will not tolerate Iranian aggression.
These last few years have been heady ones for Iran. It’s time to reestablish deterrence. If not, we could soon find ourselves dragged into another forever war in the Middle East – a war which we don’t want, which we’re not prepared to fight and which could have been avoided.

However, the ""Big Little Lies"" star's followers were divided on the cleanliness of eating snow. ""I thought eating snow was like dangerous to our health,"" one user commented.
Another user wrote, ""No no no.. snow is not made to eat.. u can get seriously sick.""
""OK, talking about the snow not being filtered, I didn’t grow up drinking filtered water,"" Witherspoon responded to the comment. ""We drank out of the tap water.

RSY5D9JBWB_PIQVCFTZK3VBNS8,NYC profs see Supreme Court as 'only hope' in fight with 'antisemitic' teachers union,By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 4:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-profs-see-supreme-court-only-hope-fight-antisemitic-teachers-union,"CUNY law professor Jeff Lax joined FOX & Friends to discuss why he blames professors and school faculty for indoctrinating students as anti-Israel protests sweep campuses nationwide.
A group of City University of New York (CUNY) professors are suing a teachers union they say promotes antisemitism, waging a legal battle in which they believe the Supreme Court could be their ""only hope.""
New York State law requires that even if one chooses to leave a teachers union, they still have to remain members of a collective bargaining unit represented by the union.That unit effectively controls pay raises, benefits, leave and other policies both for union and nonunion faculty.
In 2021, one such teachers union, Professional Staff Congress/CUNY (PSC), adopted a ""Resolution in Support of the Palestinian People"" which the group of six professors viewed as antisemitic, anti-Jewish and anti-Israel. These professors chose to then resign from the union, but under state law are still required to affiliate with and be represented in bargaining by that same union.
""My family and I suffered severe anti-Semitic harassment and persecution at the hands of the Soviet Union for over fifteen years,"" professor of mathematics Avraham Goldstein said in a statement. ""I hoped it was all in my past. But now I am forced to associate with a union that makes anti-Semitic political statements in my name without my permission or consent.""

The Supreme Court in 2018 issued a decision in a case called Janus v. AFSCME, which said nonmember public employees could not be forced to pay fees to a union, as doing so would violate their First Amendment rights.
But right before the high court decided Janus, New York amended what’s known as the Taylor Law – the law governing public-sector collective bargaining in the state – to reduce the duties public-sector unions owed to nonmembers.
Prior to the Taylor law, unions were required to fairly represent both members and nonmembers.
The Fairness Center, a nonprofit public interest law firm representing the professors, says that with amendments to the Taylor Law, ""unions like the PSC are free to treat nonmembers, like these professors, as second-class employees, offering them inferior services compared to members.""
""Plaintiffs’ forced inclusion in their bargaining unit does a disservice to them and causes them to be disadvantaged in their terms and conditions of employment and in their relations with their fellow employees and the general public,"" the professors’ brief states.
The professors, all but one of whom are Jewish, are suing the union, the university and the city, citing the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
""[T]he ongoing deprivation of rights… caused by state statutes and Defendants’ contracts, policies, and practices that designate PSC as Plaintiffs’ exclusive bargaining representative with their Employer, force Plaintiffs into a defined bargaining unit with others who do not share the same interests, and require some Plaintiffs to continue to financially subsidize PSC’s speech even though they have resigned their membership in the union,"" the legal filing reads.
CUNY PROFESSOR RIPS GRADUATION SPEAKER'S 'DISGUSTING' ANTI-ISRAEL, ANTI-POLICE TIRADE: 'WORST' I'VE EVER HEARD

""PSC’s designation as exclusive bargaining representative and Plaintiffs’ mandatory inclusion in a bargaining unit violate Plaintiffs’ speech, petitioning, and associational rights under the First Amendment,"" it continues.
The case was filed in a district court in 2022. In November of last year, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the case, and is expected to issue an opinion in the coming weeks. If it doesn’t go their way, the professors say they will appeal their case to the Supreme Court.
""I think our only hope is the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Professor Jeffrey Lax told Fox News Digital in an interview.
""And my message would be to the Supreme Court… we’re not just trying to take a position that’s different than the union’s. We’re not just saying that the union’s views towards Jewish people are abhorrent to us. That’s not why we’re saying we want to leave this union,"" said Lax.
Lax, a descendant of Holocaust survivors, said he believes the antisemitic underpinnings of the union are based on Marxist teachings, to which members of the union subscribe.

Lax said he is ""not surprised"" to see the uptick in antisemitic activism on college campuses following the devastating attacks in Israel on Oct. 7 carried out by Hamas terrorists, because antisemitic ideology has been simmering on campuses for years. And he says the unions are in part to blame, promoting anti-Israel demonstrations on campus.
""These unions have almost limitless funds. They’re not using it to bargain, they’re not using it to help their employees’ better salaries or working conditions… they’re doing it for political and ideological gain and to indoctrinate students."" Lax said.
Returning a request for comment Friday, a spokesperson for the union told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that ""[t]he Goldstein lawsuit is meritless.""
""It has been brought by members of the CUNY faculty who are not members of the PSC and who are funded by the anti-union National Right to Work Legal Foundation in another attempt to eliminate unions,"" the statement reads. ""Representing every worker in a shop is fundamental to a union’s power. It’s what makes the workers’ power collective and gives them the combined strength to win better pay and working conditions.""
""The core question of the suit has been answered,"" the statement added.
The resolution at the center of the suit adopted by the union in 2021 termed ""the continued subjection of Palestinians to the state-supported displacement, occupation, and use of lethal force by Israel,"" and required chapter-level discussion of possible support by PSC for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions – or BDS – movement.

Lax said that while ""it is true the union’s opinion about Jewish people, and Zionism and Zionist Jews are abhorrent to us,"" that’s not the main crux of his case.
""The main thing is that by forcing us to be part of the bargaining unit, they force us to allow them to bargain for our working conditions, and they don’t care about the pervasive antisemitism that we’re all seeing that’s going on right now at universities across the country, and it is the worst at my university,"" he said.

RT8MCMVDO1_RWQEGMN3NGYSDCQ,Former Malaysian leader dismisses graft probe into his son as political hit,Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 10:43am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/former-malaysian-leader-dismisses-graft-probe-son-political-hit,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad attacked a graft probe into his associates as politically motivated, a week after his eldest son was ordered to hand over information to investigators.
Mahathir, a two-time prime minister who's been a fixture in Malaysian politics for decades, said Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government is using corruption charges to go after political rivals.
Mahathir came out of retirement in the wake of the massive 1MDB corruption scandal, joining hands with the opposition in 2018 for a short second term as premier after ousting a long-ruling coalition he once led.
FORMER PAKISTANI PM IMRAN KHAN INDICTED ON GRAFT CHARGES ALONGSIDE WIFE
Businessman Mirzan Mahathir and tycoon Daim Zainuddin were revealed to hold millions offshore in the Pandora Papers, a 2021 document leak that revealed offshore accounts held by some of the world's wealthiest people and politicians.
The anti-graft agency ordered Mirzan to declare all his assets within 30 days on Jan. 17. It had earlier opened a probe into Daim, a former Finance Minister and ally of Mahathir. Mirzan has also been accused of shady dealings in relation to the sale and acquisition of a government-linked company.
Mahathir, 98, said he believed Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was fishing for evidence to implicate him, and accused Anwar of selective prosecution.
Prosecutors dropped 47 graft charges against Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi last year while the trial was at an advanced stage.
Mahathir also said no action was taken against anti-graft agency chief Azam Baki over a share trading scandal in 2022.
Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia speaks to the press at his office in Putrajaya, Malaysia, on Jan. 22, 2024.
""This is Malaysian justice under Anwar's regime,"" Mahathir told a news conference.
""The law is being abused for political ends. I'm saying very clearly that the people who are against the government will have the law thrown in their faces. Those who are for the government can escape,"" he said.
Mahathir held office from 1981-2003, and again from 2018-2020. He has a long political history with Anwar, who was his deputy and finance minister in the 1990s before they fell out amid the Asian financial crisis. Anwar was later jailed for corruption and sodomy, charges he said were framed to kill his political career.
The pair joined hands for the 2018 general elections to oust the long-ruling coalition, while Anwar was in jail for a second sodomy charge. He was pardoned by the king shortly after their victory. Mahathir became premier a second time in a deal that called for him later to hand over power to Anwar, but their alliance collapsed amid infighting.
Mahathir now supports the opposition Malay-Islamic alliance, and has constantly slammed Anwar's unity government, took power in November 2022.
The anti-graft agency has said it began investigations in August 2022 — before Anwar took power — into all entities and related assets named in the Pandora Papers and the Panama Papers, a giant leak of financial records in 2016 that showed how some of the world's richest people hide their money.
It said it has questioned 10 people so far, including Mirzan and Daim, and recently seized a building belonging to Daim. Last week, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists said that new leaked documents it obtained showed that Daim's family members were beneficiaries of a multimillion-dollar trust with investments in U.K. and U.S. real estate.

Daim and his family say their offshore assets were a result of legitimate business activities and investments, and have taken legal steps to challenge the graft probe, which they call unconstitutional."

KTVU FOX 2 reports.
Legislation that would allow a referendum on a casino in the northern Virginia suburbs of the nation’s capital cleared a hurdle Wednesday when a state Senate committee voted to advance the bill.
The bill would allow Fairfax County to hold a referendum on placing a casino, as well as a convention center and concert hall, in Tysons Corner, in the heart of some of the nation's wealthiest suburbs.
The favorable vote came even as civic groups and homeowner associations in the neighborhoods around the proposed casino are expressing opposition. Several senators noted that they have received hundreds of emails and letters opposing the plan.

Supporters, though, say the legislation merely allows the residents of the county to decide for themselves whether to allow a casino. They also note that the county's board of supervisors would have to sign off on a referendum as well.
The bill now goes to the Senate Finance Committee for another round of review. It would then need to pass the full Senate, and then the House of Delegates, and finally get the signature of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
The bill's sponsor, Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, said a casino would help diversify the tax base of a county that has traditionally been the state's economic engine and cash cow. But he said the post-pandemic economy has hit the county particularly hard, and that office space once filled with federal government contractors who desired physical proximity to the nation's capital is empty now that many are working remotely.

""This is the canary in the coal mine that our economy is changing in northern Virginia, and we need this help,"" Marsden said Tuesday at a subcommittee hearing.
The vote Wednesday in the Senate's General Laws and Technology Committee was 10 in favor, with four opposed and one abstention.
Virginia voted in 2020 to allow locations in five cities, subject to referendum. Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth and Norfolk all voted for a casino; Richmond voters twice rejected a proposed casino in that city.
Another bill that passed the committee Wednesday would allow Petersburg to hold a referendum on a casino in place of Richmond.
Marsden said allowing a casino in northern Virginia provides geographic diversity and fairness. Legislative studies have also shown that a northern Virginia casino would generate more tax revenue than anywhere else.

He also said a northern Virginia location will draw gamblers from the wealthy Maryland suburbs like Potomac and Bethesda, allowing Virginia to recoup some of the money that now flows out of state when northern Virginia residents drive across the Potomac River to MGM's massive casino in Maryland's National Harbor.
Opponents have expressed concerns about traffic and crime. The Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce supports the bill.
Also on Wednesday, the committee voted in support of legislation that would allow online sportsbooks to take wagers on games involving colleges located within the state."

The New York Times headline was ‘Bush jarred in first primary. President Bush scored a less than impressive victory over Pat Buchanan.' Haley did much better than Buchanan ever did. Why is this not jarring? You just showed the stats.Thirty-five percent of Republicans in the state are not going to vote for Donald Trump. He's bleeding centrists. He needs those Haley voters, and right now, a lot of the Republican Party and independents are saying they're not going to vote for him. So it's a warning sign. …
She's the only candidate who has shown in polls, in several polls, to have a double-digit lead over Biden. So her argument is: do you want to go with your heart or do you want to go with your head? Do you want to win this election? Are you willing to risk four more years of Joe Biden, which will be the first Kamala Harris presidency? And you look at everything that's happening in the world, is that a risk you're willing to take? And a lot of Republicans are saying, yeah, because Trump is being under attack and they want to rally around it.

The New Hampshire primary was a head-to-head face off between Trump and Haley after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign.
When polls closed Tuesday, Trump secured another win against Haley after his decisive victory in Iowa. Unlike results in the Hawkeye State, the former president didn't land a knockout blow in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary.
Trump scored 54.54% of the vote, while Haley racked up 43.17%, keeping it within 12%. New Hampshire's 22 delegates were divided up with 12 going to Trump and nine going to Haley.

Despite the loss, Haley has vowed to stay in the race.
""You’ve all heard the chatter among the political class. They’re falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not last in the nation. This race is far from over,"" Haley stressed, as she spoke to supporters after the New Hampshire race was quickly called for Trump.
Candidates are now shifting focus to Haley's home state of South Carolina, which will hold the next primary election on Feb. 24.

Donna D'Errico has more confidence than ever thanks to OnlyFans.
The ""Baywatch"" actress stripped down fully nude for her upcoming campaign with PETA and gave Fox News Digital exclusive, behind-the-scenes access to the photo shoot.
While D'Errico has never felt more comfortable in her own skin, she admitted that her priest may not agree with what she is posting on the adult subscription-based site, but she has found peace with her Internet fame.

She has never questioned her faith, but she has felt a tinge of conflict with her beliefs while working on OnlyFans.
""I’ll be honest, there is a little bit, and I get conflicted sometimes, but, I mean, I’m not doing anything,"" D'Errico said. ""I’m not doing porn, I’m not sleeping around, I’m not doing anything with anyone period. I’m having fun. I’m not hurting anyone.

""Is it considered sinful if I asked my priest, ‘Is it OK if I do this?’ He would say, ‘Ya, It’s not OK.’ But I’ve found my peace. I feel like, as women, we can be all of the above. We don’t have to just be the OnlyFans girls, or just the super elegant, classy girl that dresses in a demure way – you can be everything.""

But just because you're on OnlyFans doesn't mean you're doing it.""

D’Errico, who starred as lifeguard Donna Marco on ""Baywatch,"" joined the photo-sharing site last year, and she has since built an extremely lucrative business and gained ""tens of thousands of online boyfriends"" from OnlyFans.
Another perk: confidence in being in her own skin.

""I was comfortable with my body before, but I've gotten a lot more comfortable now after having found OnlyFans because, unlike Instagram and some other social media where there's a lot of censorship, censoring and bullying, on OnlyFans it's not like that,"" D'Errico said.
""I feel a lot more comfortable with my nude self around people than I did before.""

Feeling comfortable being naked helped D'Errico make the decision to go completely nude – aside from an 18K gold, double-sided Saint Benedict Pendant gold coin necklace from Saint by Ira Dewitt – for her upcoming PETA campaign.
""They came up with this concept of wearing your own skin, meaning not just I'd rather go naked than wear fur, it encompasses anti-down, because there's clothing that's filled with down. Anti-wool, anti-leather, anything that comes off of an animal that we wear as clothing – it encompasses that,"" D'Errico said.

D'Errico, who chooses a vegan lifestyle, uses cactus-leather handbags by Gaia Leon, and advocates for animals at any chance she can, was so committed to the ""wear your own skin"" theme that she opted against wearing the nude coverings often offered to stars of the photo campaigns.
""They offered me nude colored pasties and a nude thong to wear because there would be a crew around and I'm like, 'I'm comfortable. I'm OK with my naked body. It's a natural thing,"" Donna said.

RZAQ2WWNDQ_WSD1VNLTPFCOS2R,Sen Tuberville says ‘Trump understands’ school choice will be a 'focal point' of 2024 election,By Jamie Joseph Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 4:00am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tuberville-says-trump-understands-school-choice-focal-point-2024-election,"A former school principal, Mandy Davis, has become an advocate for pro-school choice policies after making the decision to leave her career for homeschooling.
FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., has been in talks with former President Trump about the issue of school choice and parental rights, he told Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday night.
Tuberville said the former president ""understands"" how big of an issue school choice for parents will be in this year's presidential election as public schools continue to ""fail"" students, despite the U.S. spending more money per student than most countries in the world.
""I've talked to President Trump about it, and I think it should be a big focal point in the election,"" Tuberville said.
""He knows it, and that it'll be a big factor,"" he continued. ""And I think parents resonate with that. The last thing I told the parents was: Voices need to be heard. And this needs to be spread, it can't be a dozen parents, and it's got to be parents all over the country.""

Tuberville, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Children and Families, hosted a roundtable Wednesday afternoon with GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Ted Budd of North Carolina and Eric Schmitt of Missouri, along with a dozen parents from across the country.
Topics like ethnic studies and critical race theory (CRT), boys and girls sports, and how test scores have plummeted after the COVID-19 pandemic were discussed during the roundtable that also marked National School Choice Week.
School choice, which provides all families with alternatives to the public schools for which they’re zoned, can be expanded through multiple avenues at the state level, including school voucher programs, tax-credit scholarship programs, individual tuition tax credit programs and deductions, and education savings accounts. These programs can be limited to certain households based on an income threshold or other factors, or they can be expanded universally to all children.
BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS EXPOSES A TOXIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

Tuberville said that despite significant federal funding for public schools, it ""goes into buildings and teachers' unions"" but not into ""the minds of the students."" According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in the 2019-2020 school year, the U.S. spent $870 billion on public elementary and secondary schools.
""Basically, this is about parents in charge of their kids,"" Tuberville said. ""We're not teaching reading, science and history as much as we should be. They're more concerned about a social justice agenda in the school.""
One of the attendees, Sonja Shaw, the president of Chino Valley Unified School Board in Southern California and a mother of three, agreed that school choice will be a big ballot issue for parents casting a vote this year.
""I do because CRT is still a huge issue, and this ties into CRT, it's just packaged differently,"" Shaw told Fox News Digital. ""I think the more awareness that we bring, it's going to bring light, and then just like you've seen with parental rights, I just think it's a matter of parents exposing it.""
California became a battleground state for parental rights and school choice issues in local politics last year. Shaw said this is because California is the blue ""pilot"" for what other state school programs will inevitably follow.

""Whatever's in California, they're going to put it everywhere else, it's just a matter of time,"" she said.
One of the biggest issues that swept several school boards across the Golden State last year was the parental notification policy that requires schools to disclose to parents if their child identifies as transgender. Shaw's district was one of the few to implement the policy, and they received backlash from the governor's office for it.

Following Chino Valley's adoption of the policy, California Attorney General Rob Bonta launched an investigation into the district for ""potential legal violations."" Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom also threatened to sue another Southern California school district for refusing to teach a social studies course that included controversial gay rights activist Harvey Milk.
However, it's not just California in the education fight. Dozens of bills have been introduced in other states — including Arizona, Indiana, Arkansas and others — to establish stronger parental rights policies in public schools.
Popularity for school choice is also on the rise. According to ACE Scholarships, a nonprofit committed to helping parents access better education options for their school-age children through private school partnerships, a record 14,090 scholarships were awarded to K-12 children across the country through its program for the 2023-2024 school year.
Recently, Republican governors made significant inroads in pushing universal school choice legislation, which did not exist anywhere in the country a few years ago.
Nine states have enacted universal school choice, with state Republicans leading the effort.
Trump routinely touted school choice during his presidency, once calling it the civil rights issue of ""all-time in this country,"" and he signed an executive order on Expanding Educational Opportunity Through School Choice toward the end of his term.

A medical student in Wisconsin who supports full-term abortions told a public hearing Monday that she would leave the state if she could not perform abortions or get the proper training to do so.
During a hearing before lawmakers at the state Capitol, pro-life and pro-choice people applauded and criticized, respectively, a bill that would ban abortion after 14 weeks.
Republican State Rep. Amanda Nedweski and Republican State Sen. Mary Felzkowski, who co-authored the bill, said the proposal was made to appease those who wanted either a total abortion ban or no restrictions on abortions.
Critics of the bill took issue with the fact that it does not include exceptions for rape or incest. The only exception for the 14-week proposal is in cases where the mother's life or health may be at risk.

""In the cases of rape or incest, this gives you 14 weeks to figure out what to do,"" Nedweski said of the criticism.
She also said the bill would likely be vetoed by Democrat Gov. Tony Evers, who has previously said he would stop any legislation that would place new restrictions on abortions. The state currently has a 20-week abortion ban.
Medical College of Wisconsin students Madalynn Welch and Maya Seshan told lawmakers they are worried the proposed 14-week ban would push people in the state away from becoming licensed OBGYN practitioners.
""When you put physicians in a gray area every day, their ability to quickly save the lives of the person they're working on makes their lives harder,"" Seshan said.
When Welch approached the microphone, she offered her personal opinions on abortion access and the potential impact on medical students.
""I think abortion should be unrestrictive. And I think when somebody finds out in pregnancy when – how far along that they are – when someone finds out, they should be able to get an abortion if they want to. And for some people, that is full term,"" she said.

Welch then said that if she cannot get abortion training this year, or if she cannot perform abortions in her career, she would not stay in Wisconsin.
""A lot of my colleagues who are on the same track agree,"" she added.
The Medical College of Wisconsin's website notes that a critical aspect of the specialty of obstetrics and gynecologists includes access to contraception as well as safe and legal pregnancy termination.
""Restricting access to reproductive care disproportionately affects our most vulnerable patients, erodes the trust and sanctity of the patient-physician relationship, and criminalizes physicians – all of which negatively impact the health of our community,"" the website says.

""Our Department stands with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and other leading Medical and Healthcare organizations who oppose a ban on abortions. We add our voice to those advocating for access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare for all our patients,"" the website notes.

S11Q8JK6AP_30083KMN0Y7XREQ,"Open-air drug use, overdoses push Democrats to introduce overhaul of first-in-the-nation decriminalization law",By Hannah Ray Lambert Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 10:30am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/open-air-drug-use-overdoses-push-democrats-introduce-overhaul-first-nation-decriminalization-law,"As Portland reckons with an ""explosion"" of open-air drug use, Fox News rode along with the police bureau's bike squad. Here's what we saw in the City of Roses.
Oregon Democrats unveiled their plan to roll back the state's pioneering drug decriminalization law in response to rampant public drug use and rising overdose deaths, immediately drawing criticism from both Republicans and pro-decriminalization advocacy groups.
""We need to urgently expand drug treatment and addiction prevention in our state while stopping drug dealers, confiscating hard drugs, and cleaning up trash and graffiti,"" Senate Majority Leader Kate Lieber said. ""We won't solve this problem overnight, but this plan will get people the help they need, clean up our communities, and save lives.""

‘ENORMOUS MISTAKE': BUSINESS LEADERS, RESIDENTS FED UP WITH BLUE STATE DRUG LAWS ISSUE 2024 ULTIMATUM
Lawmakers on the Joint Committee on Addiction and Community Safety Response propose making drug possession a Class C misdemeanor, reversing the key part of Measure 110, the first-in-the-nation decriminalization law passed by 58% of voters in 2020.
The plan includes higher sentences for drug dealing in certain locations, like near parks or homeless shelters. It would also make it easier for people to get treatment, housing and insurance.
Partnership for Safety and Justice Executive Director Andy Ko criticized the Democrats' plan for re-instituting criminal penalties.
""Treating the tens-of-thousands of Oregonians suffering from addiction as criminals is pointless, irresponsible, and profoundly wasteful,"" he said in a statement. ""Regressive policies of the past half-century too often elevated punishment as if it were health care.""
Republicans, who introduced similar legislation earlier this month, don't think the proposal is tough enough.
A Class C misdemeanor is the lowest crime classification, punishable by up to 30 days in jail, a $1,250 fine, or both. The Democratic proposal also allows people to avoid charges if they complete a behavioral health screening and meet with a caseworker.

‘FENTANYL NEXUS’: PORTLAND POLICE’S BIKE SQUAD FACES ‘EXPLOSION’ OF OPEN-AIR DRUG USE
""Anything short of reclassifying deadly drugs as a Class A misdemeanor crime will be inadequate to effectively steer more people into more treatment more quickly,"" the Coalition to Fix & Improve Measure 110 said in a statement. The coalition of political and business leaders in Oregon lobbied the legislature to reform Measure 110 and promises to send a ballot measure to the voters if lawmakers don't take action.
The Republican bill would make possession of drugs like fentanyl, heroin and meth a Class A misdemeanor and would require treatment to avoid jail. If convicted, drug users could face up to a year in jail, a $6,250 fine, or both.
Lawmakers will meet for a special legislative session beginning Feb. 5 that is expected to last no more than 35 days.
'FAMILY HAS POWER': RECOVERING ADDICT WHO WITNESSED MORE THAN 100 OVERDOSES RESCUED BY LONG LOST SISTER
Measure 110 decriminalized small amounts of all drugs. Police can cite people for possession with a $100 ticket, which drug users can waive by calling a hotline for service. But almost no one calls the hotline or pays the fine, and open-air drug use has surged in some areas.
Addiction rates and overdose deaths have skyrocketed in Oregon and nationwide as fentanyl swept across the country. Numerous polls show Oregonians favor re-criminalizing hard drugs and making treatment required, not voluntary, as a jail alternative.
""The only reason that the current power structure and the political power class in Oregon is even dealing with this right now is because they can read the polls,"" Clackamas County Commissioner Ben West told Fox News on Monday.
West doesn't think the Democrats proposal goes far enough, agreeing that a Class A misdemeanor would have more teeth.
""Stop pandering to special interest groups,"" he said. ""Stop worrying about the next election and worry about the bodies we're stepping over in our cities.""

In Portland, where the effects of Oregon's drug laws are most stark, city officials have been urging the state to act.
""We need to give tools to our first responders so they can take action,"" City Commissioner Dan Ryan previously told Fox News. ""If someone is smoking fentanyl in public and it's causing harm to those who are trying to access the sidewalk, then the police need to be able to respond to that … It's just common sense.""
Portland's City Council unanimously passed an ordinance banning public drug use in September. But city officials said the law couldn't go into effect until state lawmakers pass legislation allowing them to enforce it.

S4D0G44CHF_C0DZQ7688EMC2NC,Trump vs Haley: Where they stand in the GOP primary battle and how they match up with Biden,By Paul Steinhauser Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 9:55am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vs-haley-where-they-stand-gop-primary-battle-how-they-match-up-biden,"GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley tells Fox News Digital her pitch to sway voters who had been supporting Florida Gov Ron DeSantis.
EXETER, N.H. - Nikki Haley reacted to the roar of the crowd in New Hampshire as she walked to the stage at her first rally since Republican presidential nomination rival Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race.
""Can you hear that sound?"" she told her supporters on Sunday night in the historic town in New Hampshire's Seacoast region. ""That’s the sound of a two-person race.""
Haley, the former South Carolina governor who later served as U.N. ambassador in former President Trump's administration, has been framing the GOP nomination battle as a two-candidate showdown between herself and Trump.
With DeSantis suspending his campaign on Sunday, Haley and Trump are now the two remaining major candidates on the eve of the New Hampshire primary.
HALEY REVEALS HER PITCH TO DESANTIS VOTERS

However, most polls indicate that Haley remains double digits behind Trump with hours to go until the polls open in New Hampshire.
Trump, who is running a third straight time for the White House, stands at 57% support in a Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 in Boston daily tracking poll released on Monday morning, with Haley at 38%. Both candidates received two-point bumps with the departure of DeSantis, who was a distant third in New Hampshire in the single digits.
DOWN AND OUT: WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE DESANTIS CAMPAIGN
The poll was conducted on Saturday and Sunday nights, both before and after the Florida governor dropped out and endorsed Trump.
Trump held a similar lead in a Monmouth University/Washington Post survey conducted Jan. 16-20. The former president stood at 52% support, with Haley at 34% and DeSantis at 8%.
Trump was also up by double-digits in a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll that was in the field from Jan. 16-19, with the former president at 50%, Haley at 39%, and DeSantis at 6%.
Trump scored a convincing victory in last Monday night's low-turnout Iowa caucuses, the first contest on the GOP presidential nominating calendar. He grabbed 51% of the vote, 30 points ahead of DeSantis and Haley.
RON DESANTIS ENDORSES DONALD TRUMP AS HE DROPS OUT OF THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
The former president predicted another major win on Tuesday, telling supporters at a rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, on Sunday night that ""I think we're going to have the same kind of result here as we did last week in Iowa.""
However, New Hampshire — where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary — may be fertile ground for Haley.

The latest surveys indicate Trump dominating among registered Republicans, with Haley grabbing majority support among independents. However, there are likely more Republicans than independents who will vote in Tuesday's GOP primary.
Veteran New Hampshire-based Republican consultant Jim Merrill told Fox News that DeSantis' departure from the race ""narrows Haley's margin for error here. Many, if not most, of DeSantis voters are going to migrate over to Trump. And so it’s critical for her to do well in New Hampshire to give her some momentum heading into South Carolina.""
Mike Dennehy, another longtime New Hampshire-based GOP strategist, was more blunt.
""I think it puts a nail in her coffin,"" he said of Haley. ""I don’t think she’ll be able to keep under 50%. And I think there’s a very good chance that Trump hits 60% on Tuesday, which will signal the end of the Haley campaign and virtually seal the deal for the Trump nomination.""

Haley obviously does not see it that way.
In a one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital on Sunday night, Haley said her message to voters who were supporting DeSantis is, ""it’s time for a new generation. It’s time to stop the chaos. It’s time to stop the noise and get America back on track.""
Additionally, she pledged that she would ""absolutely"" be moving on to South Carolina's primary on Feb. 24 regardless of her finish in New Hampshire.
Haley's home state holds the next major contest on the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

In her rally Sunday night, Haley once again touted polls that indicate her defeating President Biden by larger margins than Trump would in hypothetical general election matchups.
A poll released Friday by Marist College indicates Haley performing better against Biden than Trump or DeSantis in hypothetical general election matchups in November in New Hampshire, which is a key battleground state.
The survey indicated Haley edging Biden by three points, while the president tops Trump by seven points.
However, a Real Clear Politics average of all the most recent national polls in a potential Biden-Haley showdown indicates Haley edging the president by 1.1 points.
The same average in a Biden-Trump rematch suggests the former president with a 2-point edge over the incumbent.

S4DR2TJZUV_5AJEJW0LCRY9H4L,Biden reportedly jams brakes on massive energy projects over climate impacts,By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 4:34pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-reportedly-jams-brakes-massive-energy-projects-climate-impacts,"Jimmy Failla joins ‘The Faulkner Focus’ to share his thoughts on a reporter from Australia confronting President Biden's climate czar John Kerry about his massive carbon footprint.
The White House has intervened in the permitting process for 17 large natural gas projects, ordering additional climate impact analyses after activists called on the administration to nix the projects, The New York Times reported.
In a move environmentalists have demanded in recent months, the White House is ordering the Department of Energy (DOE) to consider the impact proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects would have on climate change, three individuals with knowledge of internal deliberations told the Times. The DOE has never before rejected a gas export application on climate grounds.
""It appears that individuals within the White House are trying to force policymaking through leaks to the media. This continues to create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on US LNG for their energy security,"" Shaylyn Hynes, a spokesperson for energy developer Venture Global, said in a statement. ""If this leaked report from anonymous White House sources is true, it appears the Administration may be putting a moratorium on the entire U.S. LNG industry.""
""Such an action would shock the global energy market, having the impact of an economic sanction, and send a devastating signal to our allies that they can no longer rely on the United States,"" Hynes added. ""The true irony is this policy would hurt the climate and lead to increased emissions as it would force the world to pivot to coal.""

The White House declined to comment on the report and the DOE didn't respond to a request for comment.
Among the projects that would be impacted by the DOE's review is the so-called Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2) project, a proposed $10 billion LNG terminal located on a 546-acre site in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which would be the largest export terminal of its kind in the nation.
BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION
According to Venture Global, the facility would have a nameplate export capacity of 20 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG and a peak capacity of about 24 MTPA. In 2023, the U.S. exported 88.9 MT of LNG, according to a FOX Business analysis of tanker tracking data, meaning the CP2 facility would alone increase exports by a staggering 23%.
Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers and fossil fuel industry associations have called for the Biden administration to expeditiously approve pending LNG export terminals, arguing they are key for strengthening the U.S. economy and supporting the energy security of allies in Europe and Asia amid geopolitical turmoil.

John Kennedy, R-La., the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, told Fox News Digital in a statement.
""Our economy and national security can’t afford for President Biden to stay beholden to climate fanatics who are happy to see our country sacrifice jobs and energy independence for nothing,"" Kennedy said.
Fellow Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy argued during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing this month that LNG export facilities in the U.S. would have an ""overwhelmingly"" lower carbon footprint than the alternative of coal-fired power generation in foreign nations.

""This is war on our allies,"" Cassidy told Fox News Digital. ""They depend upon us for their energy and economic security. For apparently political purposes, the Biden administration is deliberately postponing permitting. Putin must have designed this strategy.""
And Marty Durbin, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global Energy Institute, echoed those comments on Wednesday, saying U.S. LNG plays an ""essential role in displacing dirtier Russian gas"" that Europe remains reliant on. ""Any move to restrict or delay our ability to meet our commitments to our allies is deeply disturbing,"" he said.

Earlier this month, international energy organizations Eurogas and the Asia Natural Gas & Energy Association (ANGEA) issued strong statements of support for continued permitting of U.S. LNG export terminals. Eurogas said such exports were critical for ensuring the full phase down of Europe's dependence on Russian natural gas, while ANGEA added U.S. LNG is needed to meet Asia's decarbonization goals.
However, LNG export terminals have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who argue they would create harmful pollution and contribute to global warming. The issue has led to activists posting videos on social media which, over the last two months, have generated tens of millions of views.
REPUBLICANS URGE BIDEN ADMIN TO STOP DELAYING MAJOR GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
Additionally, in December, dozens of environmental groups wrote to DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm, imploring her to reject the CP2 project ""for the sake of our climate and communities."" Days later, 170 scientists penned a letter to President Biden, asking him to determine CP2 is not in the public interest and to reject it and other pending LNG facilities.

""Putting a stop to expanded gas exports is one of the most important moves President Biden could make on addressing the climate crisis. It would mark a bold and historic decision and a major win for communities and advocates that have long spoken out about the dangers of LNG,"" Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous said Wednesday.
""These facilities pollute our communities, make energy more expensive for American families, and exacerbate the climate crisis all for the sake of more gas the world does not need,"" he continued. ""Our movement will not give up, and we will keep working to ensure that this reported groundbreaking step will lead to meaningful change.""

Further, climate activist Bill McKibben announced he was organizing a civil disobedience protest outside the Department of Energy's headquarters in Washington, D.C., over the permitting of new LNG export terminals. He said the action would mimic the protests that helped nationalize the Keystone XL pipeline fight during the Obama administration.

S4RZVDIYS4_HQ0OU1QKQDPAQ6V,Kentucky committee clears mandatory 'moment of silence' bill for schools,Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 7:38pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-committee-clears-mandatory-moment-of-silence-bill-schools,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Kentucky schools would set aside time for a moment of silence at the start of each school day under a bill that won approval from a state House committee on Tuesday.
The moment of silence would last one to two minutes at the start of the first class each day in public schools across the Bluegrass State. Students would decide how to use that time and school personnel would be prohibited from instructing them on their silent reflection. Parents would be notified of the policy and encouraged to offer guidance to their children on how to spend that time.
The measure — House Bill 96 — cleared the Republican-led House Education Committee and advances to the full House. The proposal drew criticism that it seems to set time aside specifically for prayer.
DEMOCRATIC GOV. BESHEAR BLASTS KENTUCKY HOUSE REPUBLICANS' SPENDING PLAN
GOP Rep. Daniel Fister, the bill’s lead sponsor, responded: ""The child is just allowed a time to focus on whatever is important to them — whether it be the dog ate my homework speech or whatever they want to work on. But this allows them that time to settle and get ready for the day.""
Under the bill, every student would remain seated and silent during that time.
Setting aside a brief time for quiet reflection allows students to ""decompress before the school day begins,"" Republican Rep. Killian Timoney said in supporting the bill.

""Where we are in 2024, with technology and this unreal pressure from social media for our kids to be in, they need an intentional time just to catch their breath,"" he said.
Democratic Rep. Tina Bojanowski said she sees the bill as requiring prayer during the school day. She was among three committee members who opposed the measure.
""They (students) have a right to pray at any time during the day,"" Bojanowski said. ""But what this bill creates is a time specifically, I believe, intended to be for prayer, which is a little edgy because we have what's called the ‘establishment clause.'""
Public schools were barred from leading students in classroom prayer following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling decades ago that said it violated a First Amendment clause forbidding the establishment of a government religion.
The committee advanced another bill on Tuesday to bolster disclosure requirements meant to reveal allegations of past misconduct when teachers seek jobs in other school districts.
The measure won bipartisan support and advances to the full House. The bill's sponsor is Republican Rep. James Tipton, the chairman of the House Education Committee.
The bill aims to ensure that Kentucky school administrators are aware when a teacher applying for a job in their district has been accused of sexual misconduct.
""This is a sad reality,"" Tipton told the committee.
It would prevent school districts from entering into nondisclosure agreements related to teacher misconduct involving a student. Applicants for jobs would have to disclose whether they were the subject of any allegation or investigation within the past 12 months,
When considering a job applicant, districts would have to contact each district that previously employed the person for a reference check. Previous employers would have to disclose any allegation, investigation or disciplinary action related to abusive conduct while the applicant worked for that district.

The legislation is a response to a series of stories by the Lexington Herald-Leader that focused on teacher sexual misconduct. The newspaper uncovered instances where teachers who had previously been accused of sexual misconduct moved to other school districts and were accused again of misconduct."
S7CZCOXO8K_2K8NHAYOQPWACD9,Ask a health expert: ‘Should I take Paxlovid if I have COVID?’,By Melissa Rudy Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 5:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/health/ask-health-expert-should-take-paxlovid-have-covid,"Fox News medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses Biden's COVID-19 high-risk diagnosis and the president's possible long-term symptoms on 'Special Report.'
If you’ve tested positive for COVID-19, you might be wondering if it’s necessary to take an antiviral medication, such as Paxlovid.
Pfizer’s Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) gained full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2023.
Another drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir), is authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) — but does not have full approval.
MASK MANDATES RETURN TO HOSPITALS IN NYC, SEVERAL OTHER STATES AMID RISE IN COVID, FLU CASES
As noted on Pfizer's website, Paxlovid is intended for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID symptoms to prevent severe illness, hospitalization or death in high-risk individuals.
Paxlovid, which must be prescribed by a doctor, works best when taken within five days of a COVID diagnosis or when the first symptoms appear, according to Sean Marchese, a registered nurse at The Mesothelioma Center in Florida, who has a background in oncology clinical trials.

""Patients should take the medication as soon as possible if they know or suspect they might have COVID to ensure it is most effective,"" he told Fox News Digital.
For those who do not have significant risk factors for Paxlovid, Marchese said, ""starting treatment as soon as possible is essential, even if you only have mild symptoms.""
COVID DRUG PAXLOVID, WHICH HELPS PREVENT SEVERE SYMPTOMS, WILL DOUBLE IN PRICE AS PANDEMIC EBBS
Similar to some antibiotics, Paxlovid is offered on a ""dose card"" that allows you to punch out 30 pills during treatment, said Marchese. The standard treatment is three pills twice daily over five days.
Some patients may require a second course of Paxlovid if they have a rebound or relapse of COVID-19.
For those who have had COVID for more than a week, Paxlovid may be less effective and could potentially be harmful, Marchese advised.
There is a higher risk of harm from taking Paxlovid for those who have organ damage, such as reduced kidney or liver function, according to Marchese.
Paxlovid works best when taken within five days of a COVID diagnosis or when the first symptoms appear, according to a registered nurse. There are other key facts about it that patients must know.  (REUTERS/Jennifer Lorenzini/File Photo)
""Pediatric patients under 12 years of age or those weighing under 88 pounds should also avoid Paxlovid,"" he said.
People with cancer should discuss potential interactions between their prescribed medications and Paxlovid, the expert advised.
MOST NOTABLE DRUG AND VACCINE APPROVALS OF 2023, ACCORDING TO PHARMACISTS
""Some cancer medications may inhibit the effects of Paxlovid,"" Marchese said.
""Conversely, treatment with Paxlovid may reduce the effectiveness of some cancer medications.""
As Pfizer notes on its website, physicians should ""consider the benefit of Paxlovid treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed.""
""Vaccination efforts continue to be the most effective guard against COVID-19,"" the nurse told Fox News Digital. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
People with HIV-1 infections should consult their provider before taking Paxlovid, the expert said, as the medication could interfere with long-term HIV treatment.
""Other interactions with Paxlovid include cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Lipitor,"" he warned.
Some patients report a ""rebound"" effect with Paxlovid, where they may test positive for COVID-19 after the course of treatment but show no symptoms, noted Marchese.
FAUCI ‘CONCERNED’ PEOPLE WON’T COMPLY IF MASKING RECOMMENDATIONS RETURN: 'I HOPE' THEY 'ABIDE'
""In these cases, reinfection is unlikely, and hospitalization or severe disease is rare,"" he said.
Potential side effects of the antiviral medication include hives or rashes on the skin or trouble breathing.
Those who have had COVID for more than a week should consult a health care provider before taking Paxlovid, the expert advised. (iStock)
""Those with hypersensitivity disorder should be especially cautious and notify their providers immediately if they experience any side effects,"" noted Marchese.
Other potential side effects include diarrhea, increased blood pressure, muscle aches and nausea.
""Vaccination efforts continue to be the most effective guard against COVID-19,"" Marchese said. ""People who have a higher risk of complications or immune deficiency, such as cancer patients, should stay vigilant with the COVID-19 vaccinations and their other recommended vaccines.""

Paxlovid was originally offered for free by the U.S. government. But as of Dec. 15, 2023, it transitioned to commercial distribution, according to the Health & Human Services website.
Pfizer also operates programs to ensure affordable access for patients.

An upstate New York homeowner is facing a possible life sentence after he fatally shot a young woman who drove up the wrong driveway with her friends while on their way to a party last April.
After less than an hour of deliberation, a Washington County jury found Kevin Monahan, 66, guilty of second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence for the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis.
""Obviously it’s a just result, but a very sad time for the family,"" attorney Donald Boyajian, who is representing the Gillis family, said after the jury handed down its verdict Tuesday. ""It doesn’t change what is going to be forever, which is the loss of their beautiful daughter.""
Monahan is scheduled to be sentenced in March and faces 25 years to life for the second-degree murder charge.
BOYFRIEND OF WOMAN KILLED AFTER TURNING INTO WRONG DRIVEWAY DESCRIBES ‘FRANTIC’ MOMENT HOMEOWNER SHOT HER

Gillis, her boyfriend and their friends were driving to what they thought was the correct address for a party in upstate New York near the Vermont border, but they eventually lost the signal for their GPS and daylight, and turned up the wrong driveway. The group pulled up to the Hebron home in two cars and a motorcycle.
When they approached Monahan's property, the 66-year-old shot at the vehicle Gillis and her friends were in twice, hitting Gillis in the neck. After hearing the shots ring out, Gillis' friends noticed that she was slumped over and not responding in the back seat, according to witness testimony.

""People were screaming,"" he testified last week.

(Will Waldron/The Albany Times Union via AP)
Monahan has maintained that the shooting was a ""terrible accident"" due to a misfired gun and that he was scared when he heard the group of people coming up his driveway late at night. The first shot, he said, was supposed to act as a warning, while the second was a misfire after he tripped on an object in the dark.
""When you’re by yourself, you have to figure out the worst-case scenario,"" Monahan said on the stand last week, as the Times Union of Albany reported. ""My only job is to protect my wife.""

Monahan added that the shooting has left ""a hole"" in him.
""It’s indescribable,"" he testified. ""I don’t even know how to respond. I just feel like my soul is dead.""
The group of friends were only able to call for help when they got cell service back several miles down the road after turning around. One of Gillis' friends who testified last week said he held his hand to her neck after the shooting in an attempt to stop the bleeding.

The defense noted that the group did not see private property signs leading up to Monahan's property. Some of them had been either drinking or smoking marijuana before they began driving to the party, according to testimony.
Gillis has been described as a driven young woman with a love for animals and dreams of becoming a veterinarian one day.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Japanese court on Thursday sentenced a man to death after finding him guilty of setting an animation studio on fire, killing 36 people and injuring dozens of others.
The Kyoto District Court found 45-year-old Shinji Aoba guilty of murder and other crimes in the 2019 arson. The court said it found Aoba mentally capable to face punishment for his crimes and announced the sentence of capital punishment.
Aoba stormed into Kyoto Animation's No. 1 studio on July 18, 2019, and set it on fire. Many of the victims were believed to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning, while dozens of others were badly burned or injured.

Aoba himself was severely burned and hospitalized for 10 months before his arrest in May 2020. He appeared in court in a wheelchair. His defense lawyers argued he was mentally unfit to be held criminally responsible.
Prosecutors said Aoba was seeking revenge on the studio, thinking they had stolen novels he had submitted as part of a company contest, according to NHK national television.
The station reported that Aoba had been out of work and struggling financially at the time and had plotted a separate attack on a train station north of Tokyo a month before the arson attack.

The court said Aoba plotted the attack after studying past criminal cases involving arson. The planning was presented as evidence Aoba was mentally capable, as the crimes were premeditated.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the Kyoto Animation attack was ""a highly tragic case"" and that the government has since stepped up restrictions on gasoline sales, including mandatory identification checks of purchasers.

""I'm going to err on the side of more freedom and personal choices of those kinds of things,"" Fetterman told reporters. ""And I made that same argument when I wanted to legalize marijuana.""
Fetterman added he doesn't support ""snuff or chewing tobacco,"" but that substances should be available for adults to freely choose.

A judge on Monday cut off a lawyer for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as he was arguing why his client should not be deposed in a divorce hearing involving special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she hired to handle the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump.
Willis, who is accused of having an affair with Wade, was originally scheduled for a deposition in the case on Tuesday, but Judge Henry Thompson delayed that ruling until after Wade himself is questioned later this month.

During a brief hearing at Cobb County Superior Court Monday, Willis’ lawyer, Cinque Axam, argued that his client shouldn’t be deposed because she is too busy with other legal matters including, most importantly, the election interference case involving former President Trump.
Willis ""manages a staff of 360 plus lawyers and staff. She oversees … 20,000 open cases. She coordinates, on a monthly basis, at least 500 hundred or more cases,"" Axam told the judge. ""Of course, the most recognizable issue is she’s dealing with the Fulton County election interference involving former President Trump.
Before Axam could go on, Judge Thompson cut him off, urging him to narrow his arguments to why Willis would lack ""unique personal knowledge"" in the Wade divorce case, given that she is implicated in the extramarital affair allegations.

""Let me interrupt you. Let me ask you just to focus on the part of the law that says the proposed opponent lacks unique personal knowledge of any matter that’s relevant. Are you saying that your client lacks unique personal knowledge that could not be discovered in some other way?"" Thompson asked.
Axam replied that the case had been underway for more than two years, and the deposition order had only arrived in recent weeks.
""I think there are other means by which that information can be retrieved in the case,"" Axam said.
Willis was served with the subpoena to sit for a deposition in the divorce case the day that defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman, filed a motion alleging the romantic relationship between Willis and Wade.

The affair allegations have roiled the election interference case, which charges Trump and 18 allies of working to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state.

Throughout Biden’s talk, multiple protesters interrupted by shouting critiques of his administration’s handling of Israel's ongoing ground offensive against the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Immediately after beginning his remarks, a male protester with a Palestinian flag shouted, ""How many kids have you killed?"" The protester was drowned out by the crowd chanting ""four more years"" as security escorted the protester out.

MSNBC host Joy Reid compared U.S. lawmakers and their supporters who oppose the illegal immigrant surge at the border to ""old southerners"" who resisted integration ""by any means necessary.""
Reid made the claims during the Wednesday episode of her network show ""The ReidOut,"" while bad-mouthing conservatives and ""MAGA world"" policy proposals for the country to her guest Paola Ramos.
Reid made the comments as the U.S. southern border saw the highest number of illegal immigrants cross in a single month in December.
SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH BIDEN IN TEXAS BORDER WIRE CASE; BORDER PATROL UNION BLASTS THE DECISION
MSNBC host Joy Reid compares those promoting strong southern border protections to ""old southerners"" who were against ""integration.""
Her remarks came as the state of Texas engages in a legal showdown against the federal government over enforcement of the border. The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled to allow the Biden administration to remove razor wire fencing established by Texas at points along the border.
Texas leaders like Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, are continuing to fight the Biden administration despite the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Roy told Fox News on Tuesday, ""It's like, if someone's breaking into your house, and the court says, 'Oh, sorry. You can't defend yourself.' What do you tell the court? You tell the court to go to hell, you defend yourself and then figure it out later.""
Reid ripped these comments specifically, telling Ramos, ""And very quickly, this massive resistance, it sounds like the old Southerners who said that we will resist integration by any means necessary, that Chip Roy language.""
She then asked Ramos, ""How does that read inside of the Latino community?""

Ramos, who works for Vice News and author of the book ""Finding Latinx,"" slammed supposed Republican hypocrisy on this issue, claiming they’re breaking the law all the while calling themselves the party of law and order.
""It's very simple. If you're the Republican Party, you're allegedly the party of laws and order. And you're essentially telling local authorities to break the law. So, I think once again, going into this image of, you know, who is the party of law and order and who is the party for ‘democracy.’""
""I think that’s where we have to highlight the hypocrisy, regardless of the politics. They're essentially telling people to break the law,"" Ramos added.
Earlier in the segment, Reid appeared to paint a harrowing picture of how conservative Trump voters want to remake America, and that included abortion bans and a secure border.
""There is no better example of what MAGA World wants for the rest of America than Texas: A total ban on abortion, failing infrastructure, and draconian measures meant to secure the border – which includes letting migrants, including a mother and her two children, drown, setting up buoys with buzz saws, barring federal agents from assisting with border control, and passing legislation that makes it a state crime to cross the border,"" she said.

SK8IM1FNVV_BTURPAN9PELBU16,"Nikki Haley, Donald Trump and the New Hampshire wild card",By David Marcus Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 12:26pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/nikki-haley-donald-trump-new-hampshire-wild-card,"Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports from Manchester with the latest from the campaign trail following DeSantis' exit from the GOP race.
The New Hampshire primary is supposed to be a beginning, a political starting gun in the race for president, but this time under the cold gray New England skies it might well be a finish line.
That is certainly the hope of Team Donald Trump, as it has been for months, to wrap this all up neat and quick, and thus far, the polls show that might be the case, for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, well, it's now or never.
William Faulkner once referred to a pocket watch as the ""mausoleum of all hope and desire,"" and for those many Americans hoping for a reprieve from a Biden-Trump rematch, it is a very apt description of the Granite State this year. Time is running out.
TRUMP TO BE JOINED BY SCOTT, RAMASWAMY, BURGUM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE RALLY AS A 'SHOW OF FORCE' THE GOP IS 'UNITED'
For the Republicans, the best chance to thwart Trump, some would argue the only chance is for Haley to pull off a shock win in New Hampshire that could dent the former president’s air of invincibility.
It was in that spirit that the former governor of South Carolina held a late morning rally at a middle school in Derry on Sunday, looking for a spark, but also carefully guarding her message.
The rally was well attended with cars forging snowbanked curbs to invent impromptu parking spaces, quite a few emblazoned with Trump or ""Let’s Go Brandon"" bumper stickers.
Did this mean the car owners were willing to give Nikki a shot? Or was it that in this primary season, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis all but absent, her rallies are the only non-Trump game in town? (DeSantis announced on Sunday afternoon that he was dropping out of the race and throwing his support to Trump.)
From the people I talked to, it was a bit of both.
But not everyone was welcome at the Haley rally, as I found out from a group of 5 young adults in their early 20s who had been unceremoniously kicked out of the event before it even began.
FLORIDA GOV. RON DESANTIS DROPS OUT OF 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, ENDORSES TRUMP
One of the group, Evvie, explained to me that they had arrived early, were in front and were hoping to ask Haley about the war in Gaza, which they oppose, when Haley staff approached and told them to leave, because they had experienced problems with hecklers in the past.
It was the opinion of the youthful attendees that they had been targeting both for their age and for not appearing to be a typical Haley voter, though, in all fairness, it's not entirely clear what a typical Haley voter looks like.
HALEY RALLIES SUPPORTERS AGAINST TRUMP AFTER DESANTIS DROPS OUT: 'MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN'
""If politicians like Nikki Haley want to run for president of this country they should not be afraid of young voters,"" Evvie told me, ""they should be excited to see young voters at their events, frankly I think the Nikki Haley staff saw me as a young voter, and thought I would disagree with her about things.""
This comes just days after Haley’s campaign banned the Daily Mail from its events for the outlet’s reporting on a long-standing scandal that Haley has denied.

While it is possible that the young adults booted from the rally might have caused some kind of ruckus, they had not yet done so, they were just there, and it shows the lengths to which the Haley campaign will go to keep on message.
That is a message that has gotten rather sharper in regard to Trump in recent days, with Haley attacking Trump not just on policy, but now also comparing him to Joe Biden in terms of diminished mental capacity.
This comes after Trump appeared to confuse Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a recent rally while talking about the Capitol Riot, Haley for her part argues that this was a clear sign that Trump might be mentally slipping.
""I’m not saying anything derogatory — but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this,"" she implored.

It is a line of attack likely to infuriate Trump supporters, not to mention Trump, but it shows how far Haley is now willing to go, as the clock winds down and she sprints to try to catch Trump by Tuesday.
Should she fail, New Hampshire will be known for something different this time, ending a primary season and ushering in the longest general election in the history of the United States.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Maldives government said Tuesday that it had given clearance to a Chinese ship to dock in its port, a move that could further irk India with whom the tiny archipelago nation is involved in a diplomatic spat.
The Maldives foreign ministry confirmed local media reports that research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3 was headed to the Maldives. It didn't give a date of arrival.
A ministry statement said that ""a diplomatic request was made by the government of China to the government of Maldives, for the necessary clearances to make a port call, for rotation of personnel and replenishment."" It said the ship won't be conducting any research while docked in Male port.
INDIA'S LEADING TRAVEL PLATFORM SUSPENDS BOOKINGS TO MALDIVES IN WAKE OF 'DEROGATORY' SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS
""The Maldives has always been a welcoming destination for vessels of friendly countries, and continues to host both civilian and military vessels making port calls for peaceful purposes,"" it said.

The ship arrives amid a diplomatic dispute between the Maldives and its giant neighbor India. There was no immediate comment from the Indian government.
The spat started when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted pictures on social media of himself walking and snorkeling in Lakshadweep, an Indian archipelago that looks nearly identical to islands in the Maldives. The Indian government believes that the white sand beaches of Lakshadweep have untapped potential for tourism.
However, some in the Maldives saw it as a move by Modi to lure tourists away from its famous beaches and island resorts. Three deputy ministers posted derogatory remarks on social media against Modi, which sparked calls in India for a boycott of the Maldives.
The dispute deepened when Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu visited China, India's regional rival, and on his return, spelled out plans to rid his small nation from dependence on India for health facilities, medicines and import of staples.
The largest number of tourists who came to the Maldives last year were from India, and Muizzu said that Chinese visitors had been leading the way before the COVID-19 pandemic and that steps would be taken to double their numbers.
He also said in an indirect reference to India that his country's smaller size didn't give any other country the license to bully it, and added that China respects Maldives' territorial integrity firmly.
India and China have been vying for influence on the Maldives as part of their competition to control the Indian Ocean. India, the closest neighbor to the Maldives, has considered the country to be in its sphere of influence. China, meanwhile, has enlisted Maldives as its partner in its Belt and Road initiative meant to build ports and highways to expand trade — and China’s influence — across Asia, Africa and Europe.
MALDIVES SWEAR IN NEW, PRO-BEIJING PRESIDENT, WHO VOWS REMOVAL OF INDIAN TROOPS
Pro-China Muizzu was elected to office in November on a platform to evict Indian military personnel stationed in the Maldives. On his return from China, he proposed a meeting with Indian officials that the troops be withdrawn by mid-March.
At least 75 Indian military personnel are said to be stationed in the Maldives, and Muizzu had accused his predecessor of compromising national sovereignty by allowing Indian personnel on Maldivian islands.
The known activities of the Indian military include operating aircraft and assisting in the rescue of people stranded or faced with calamities at sea.
Sri Lanka, another island nation close to India, recently declared a year-long moratorium on research ships docking in its ports. While the official stance of the government has been that it's for the purpose of capacity building of local experts participating in joint research missions, the move is seen as a result of concerns raised by India over a planned visit of a Chinese ship."

Three white men convicted of hate crimes for chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in 2020 will have their appeals heard by a federal court in March.
The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for March 27 in Atlanta. Attorneys for father and son Greg and Travis McMichael and their neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, are asking the court to throw out hate crime convictions returned by a jury in coastal Brunswick in 2022.
Arbery, 25, was chased by pickup trucks and fatally shot in the streets of a subdivision outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. His killing sparked a national outcry when cellphone video Bryan recorded of the shooting leaked online more than two months later.
GA JUDGE ORDERS ARRAIGNMENT FOR EX-DA CHARGED IN ARBERY KILLING'S AFTERMATH
The McMichaels armed themselves with guns and pursued Arbery after he was spotted running past their home. Bryan joined the chase in his own truck and recorded Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range with a shotgun.
The McMichaels and Bryan stood trial on hate crime charges in U.S. District Court less than three months after all three were convicted of murder in a Georgia state court. Federal prosecutors used social media posts, text messages and other evidence of past racist comments by all three men to argue they targeted Arbery because he was Black.
Attorneys for Greg McMichael and Bryan have argued in court filings that they chased Arbery because they mistakenly believed he was a criminal, not because of his race. Travis McMichael's appeal argues a technicality, saying prosecutors failed to prove that Arbery was pursued and killed on public streets as stated in the indictment used to charge the three men.

Prosecutors contend the defendants considered Arbery suspicious in large part because of his race. They say he was shot on a street maintained by the county government, proving it's a public road.
Greg McMichael told police he initiated the chase because he recognized Arbery from security camera videos that in prior months showed the young Black man entering a neighboring home under construction. None of the videos showed him stealing, and Arbery was unarmed and had no stolen property when he was killed.
Bryan joined in after seeing the McMichaels' truck pursuing a running Arbery past his house.

Prosecutors argued at the trial that the McMichaels and Bryan chased and shot Arbery out of ""pent-up racial anger.""
Evidence showed Bryan had used racist slurs in text messages saying he was upset that his daughter was dating a Black man. A witness testified Greg McMichael angrily remarked on the 2015 death of civil rights activist Julian Bond: ""All those Blacks are nothing but trouble."" In 2018, Travis McMichael commented on a Facebook video of a Black man playing a prank on a white person: ""I’d kill that f----ing n----r.""
Both McMichaels received life prison sentences in the hate crimes case, while Bryan was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Also pending are appeals by all three men of their murder convictions in Glynn County Superior Court."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A secretive lab in China has reportedly carried out a simulation in which hypersonic missiles and satellites launched an attack on American warships.
Details about the test – in which Chinese projectiles were launched from about 750 miles away and climbed more than 120 miles into the sky before raining down on the U.S. warships – surfaced in a December paper written in part by Liu Shichang, a scientist working at a facility in Chengdu that has ties to the country’s military, according to the South China Morning Post.
""Commanding height has always been a pivotal tactic in war since ancient times,"" Liu said, according to the news organization. ""With the evolution of the concept of war and the advancement of technology, space has become a new commanding height fiercely contested by the world’s military powers.""
In the computer simulation, the Chinese hypersonic missiles had assistance from numerous low-orbit electronic warfare satellites positioned above American ships, the paper reportedly said.

Those satellites found radar signals coming from the U.S. ships and then fired back similar ones to create background noise and help mask the locations of the missiles, according to the South China Morning Post.
Once the missiles came within 30 miles of their targets, ""the satellites complete their suppression mission, the missile-borne jammers are activated, and the missiles perform terminal maneuvers for further penetration until they destroy the target,"" it quoted the paper as saying.

The paper based the U.S. detection capability on the SPY-1D radar developed by Lockheed Martin that is used in the Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and stated that only two or three low-orbit satellites would be enough to attack an aircraft carrier group, the South China Morning Post reports.
The exact kind of hypersonic missile that was used in the simulation was not identified, but its stated range is similar to China’s YJ-21 missile, the newspaper also reported.

Katrina Smith expresses concerns over a new push from state leaders to make the state a ‘transgender safe haven.’
Republicans and Democrats on Maine’s judiciary committee voted to kill a bill Thursday that would have allowed minors to travel from out of state to Maine to obtain gender-altering medical procedures and even take custody of minors in ""emergency"" situations.
Republicans called bill LD 1375 – or ""An act to safeguard gender-affirming health care"" – ""dangerous,"" while the Democrats who originally supported it admitted the language of the bill needed reworking, according to a report by local outlet CBS-WGME.
Tossed on Thursday, the bill stipulated the state of Maine could allow minors restricted from gender-affirming care in their home state to travel to Maine to receive that care, which it noted includes ""Interventions to align the patient's appearance or physical body with the patient's gender identity,"" and ""Interventions to suppress the development of endogenous secondary sex characteristics.""

Further language in the bill would have allowed the government to take ""emergency jurisdiction"" over any child who has been rendered ""unable to obtain gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care"" even by their siblings and parents.
""A court of this State has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this State and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child or a sibling or parent of the child is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or because the child has been unable to obtain gender-affirming health care or gender-affirming mental health care,"" the bill's text stated.
Republican Maine State Sen. Lisa Keim told WGME that parents from ""around the country have reached out to talk to us about this bill"" and expressed their ""angst"" over it.
She added, ""Parents shouldn’t have their rights threatened in this way, and this is a dangerous bill for children.""

State Rep. Rachel Henderson trashed the proposed bill as well, stating to the local media outlet, ""This gives the state jurisdiction to effectively come into your home and take your kids based on a medical decision you made for the wellbeing and mental wellbeing of your child.""
State Rep. Katrina J. Smith warned about the bill last week in a Fox News Channel interview, stating, ""Maine is going to open the doors to this and open the door to kids who meet someone on TikTok, and they get the idea that they need this surgery or hormone replacement therapy, and they're going to grab a bus or someone is going to come pick them up and bring them to Maine and a parent is not going to do a thing about it.""
The bill’s Democratic Party sponsor, Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orno), expressed to WGME this was never the intent, but instead about giving the proper care to individuals.
She said, ""That’s disrespectful to our care providers. Our care providers are trained, we have certification and licensing in Maine, and they only provide the care that’s needed for their patients.""
Still, all those voting on the bill found it at fault. Republicans found it dangerous, while Democrats admitted that its language was flawed and needed to be altered.
Following the vote Thursday, Osher said, ""We will make sure that people are protected that our care providers are protected. Today was a moment where we’re not getting that done, but we will get that done.""

As Texas faces a potential standoff between state National Guard forces and federal Border Patrol on the border in Eagle Pass, the state's top lawman said the crisis gives the impression President Biden ""cut a deal"" with the cartels controlling parts of the boundary.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News on Thursday he is not entirely sure what Biden's next move will be after the Supreme Court signaled the feds could take down razor wire in state-controlled Shelby Park, while not explicitly prohibiting Gov. Greg Abbott from reinstalling it.
""As far as a showdown, I don't know what Joe Biden is going to do. So far, it seems like every decision he's made has been a bad decision for our country,"" Paxton said.
""He is cooperating — not just cooperating, but he's literally in partnership with these cartels.""
NOEM PLEDGES TO SHIP RAZOR WIRE TO TEXAS IF BIDEN STOPS ABBOTT
Paxton said that under previous presidents, illegal immigrants and cartel smugglers would hide from Border Patrol, fearing consequences including deportation.
But, under Biden, members of transnational criminal organizations actively seek out Border Patrol so that they are put into the veritable pipeline of foreign nationals dispersed into the country, he suggested.
""Joe Biden has cut a deal somehow where these cartels transport people directly to the Border Patrol, and then they move them around the country. So we're in a terrible situation.""
As ""Hannity"" host Sean Hannity previously cited conjecture from former FBI intel and counter-terror officials of the looming terrorism threat from millions of unidentified foreign nationals being allowed in by Biden, Paxton concluded that he fears for the consequences of Biden's decision-making.
CHICAGO DEMOCRAT TORCHES CITY LEADERS AS SCHOOLS USED TO HOUSE MIGRANTS
Paxton also thanked South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem for her support, as she and about two dozen other GOP governors from Alaska to New Hampshire voiced support for how Abbott and Texas are responding to Biden and the impasse in Eagle Pass.
Hannity wondered aloud whether Biden is angling for a ""showdown in Texas"" in that regard.
The last instance of a president usurping state control of a National Guard corps was in 1957 when Arkansas Democratic Gov. Orval Faubus deployed troops to prevent the integration of a high school in Little Rock.
Then-President Eisenhower invoked federal control of the state's guard and the ""Little Rock Nine"" were allowed to attend class at the otherwise all-White school.
In 1794, the administration of then-President Washington federalized the Pennsylvania militia and several other states' troops to quell the ""Whiskey Rebellion"" in the Alleghenies.

In the Keystone State at the time, some civilians began resorting to violence and other aggressive means to prevent the feds from collecting a new excise tax on whiskey that had been the brainchild of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.
Washington reportedly joined the federalized contingent on its way into the region, where ultimately more than 100 people were arrested, but many later acquitted or released.

STMFAIJRT3_MOZIBCWEFTGOMTX,Biden campaign attack ad blames Trump for Dobbs abortion decision,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 7:39am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-attack-ad-blames-trump-dobbs-abortion-decision,"Former President Trump discusses protecting life in America during Fox News townhall.
President Biden’s presidential campaign released a new attack ad on Sunday attempting to blame former President Donald Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, as the Biden-Harris ticket seeks to make the abortion issue front and center.
The ad features Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB/GYN and mother of three in Dallas who says she was forced to leave the state of Texas to get an abortion after at a ""routine ultrasound"" she learned ""that the fetus would have a fatal condition"" and ""that there was absolutely no chance of survival.""
""Having this beautiful, messy, chaotic, but wonderful family, it’s the joy of my life,"" she says. ""I never thought that I would need an abortion for a planned pregnancy. But I did. Two years ago, I became pregnant with a baby I desperately wanted,"" Dennard says. ""In Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy. And that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade. The choice was completely taken away. I was to continue my pregnancy, putting my life at risk. It’s every woman’s worst nightmare, and it was absolutely unbearable. We need leaders that will protect our rights, and not take them away. And that’s Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.""
The ad ends with two still images of Biden and then Biden and Harris, with the president voicing over, ""I’m Joe Biden and I approve this message."" The Biden campaign captioned the ad on X, writing, ""Because of Donald Trump, Dr. Austin Dennard was forced to flee Texas to get the heath care she needed to save her life. It’s simply outrageous.""
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JANUARY 22, 1973, SUPREME COURT ISSUES LANDMARK ROE V. WADE DECISION
Monday marks the 51st anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision on Roe v Wade.

The landmark decision was overturned in June 2022 – during Biden’s term – in the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.
Trump, who claimed responsibility for the overturning of Roe after adding conservative justices to the court during his administration, has described himself as the most ""pro-life president"" but took some criticism from conservatives in September after criticizing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s six-week ban.
Trump vowed to come to a compromise on how long into pregnancy to ban abortion outright, potentially around 15 weeks, and condemned late-term abortions.
The vice president is expected to deliver remarks in Big Bend, Wisconsin, on Monday, as part of her ""Fight for Reproductive Freedoms"" tour, and per Harris’ office, will speak about how she ""will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care."" Biden, meanwhile, will convene the fourth meeting of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, ""where agencies will announce new actions to protect access to reproductive health care,"" the White House said.

PRO-LIFE VOTERS REVEAL HOW THEY REALLY FEEL ABOUT TRUMP'S STANCE ON ABORTION
In a statement released by the White House on Monday, Biden said he and Vice President Kamala Harris ""are fighting to protect women’s reproductive freedom against Republicans officials’ dangerous, extreme, and out-of-touch agenda. We stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose, and continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law once and for all.""
""Fifty-one years ago today, the Supreme Court recognized a woman’s constitutional right to make deeply personal decisions with her doctor—free from the interference of politicians,"" Biden said. ""Then, a year and a half ago, the Court made the extreme decision to overturn Roe and take away a constitutional right. As a result, tens of millions of women now live in states with extreme and dangerous abortion bans. Because of Republican elected officials, women’s health and lives are at risk. In states across the country, women are being turned away from emergency rooms, forced to go to court to seek permission for the medical attention they need, and made to travel hundreds of miles for health care.""

""Even as Americans—from Ohio to Kentucky to Michigan to Kansas to California—have resoundingly rejected attempts to limit reproductive freedom, Republican elected officials continue to push for a national ban and devastating new restrictions across the country,"" the statement added.
Harris on X also wrote, ""We trust women to make decisions about their own body and their own future.""

SWJSC17N6A_1ZQIZ46DBQKYM9U,JESSE WATTERS: Biden treating the border like a turnstile for the third world,By Fox News Staff Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 9:42pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jesse-watters-biden-border-turnstile-third-world,"Fox News host Jesse Watters sounds the alarm over what's at stake in the fight between Texas and the Biden administration over 'self-defense' from a migrant 'invasion' at the southern border.
Fox News host Jesse Watters breaks down the showdown between the Biden White House and Texas as the Lone Star State seeks to defend itself against what critics call a border invasion on ""Jesse Watters Primetime.""
ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS 'RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE' FROM MIGRANT 'INVASION' AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN
JESSE WATTERS: Nearly 250 years ago, our Founding Fathers debated the future of the government. The Federalists wanted a strong, centralized federal government. Anti-Federalists such as Thomas Jefferson believed that government power should be derived from the individual states joining together, and debates between the two schools of thought flourished in town halls and village squares.
The topic was so contentious that oftentimes swords and bayonets were drawn. But ultimately, the Founding Fathers found a compromise. Some powers were assigned to the federal government, like regulating trade. Other powers were assigned to the state governments, like education, and other powers were shared, like the power to tax. The federal government has the power to wage war and under Article Four, Section Four of the Constitution, the United States shall protect each state against invasion.
But what if the federal government fails to protect the states against invasion? Well, the Constitution says the states can protect themselves from invasion when they're actually invaded or face an imminent threat. And the Supreme Courts agreed, in several cases reaffirming the rights of states to use military force in its own defense. You judge with your own eyes if the United States is being invaded. Foreign nationals are breaching our shores by boat and then sprinting through the beaches and just disappearing onto the streets. I mean, these foreigners have no right to break into our country. That's not immigration. What you're seeing on the screen is what every country in the world calls an invasion. They say it's not violent, but drugs, sex and human smuggling and all of the crime and devastation associated with that is violent. That's what violence is.
So why is Biden treating the border like a turnstile for the third world?

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Dueling political factions took to the streets of Venezuela's capital on Tuesday for the first competing rallies of the presidential election year, showcasing their ability to draw people en masse, as voters grapple with political disappointments and uncertainty over the candidate who ultimately will challenge President Nicolás Maduro.
Supporters of Maduro’s ruling party and opposition leader María Corina Machado demonstrated in Caracas a day after Venezuela’s top prosecutor announced the detention of more than 30 people and arrest warrants for a dozen others who allegedly plotted efforts to destabilize the South American country’s government.
US SWAPS MADURO ALLY WITH VENEZUELA FOR 10 AMERICANS, INCLUDING 'FAT LEONARD'
But if either camp had hoped to scare the other in numbers, neither gathered the tens of thousands each were capable of last decade.
Maduro supporters — overwhelmingly a mix of state workers, ruling-party community leaders and loyalists of the late President Hugo Chávez — walked across the city, with dozens of them also concentrating in the same plaza where Machado, the winner of an October presidential primary election, was expected to address her own followers.
The Maduro administration is seeking to rally government supporters amidst a sagging economy and refugee crisis.
More than an hour after Machado was supposed to show up, her supporters left the plaza and stopped traffic, allowing her to address them from a makeshift stage as they waved Venezuelan flags.
""They talk about elections, but they are terrified of elections,"" Machado said, referring to Maduro and his allies. ""But because they know that they do not have votes, they hide... behind threats, persecution, lies, a fabricated sentence, to try to end us. Let them know clearly, no one takes us out of this electoral route.""
Maduro and the opposition faction behind the primary agreed last year to hold a presidential election in the second half of 2024. Maduro will seek to add six more years to his decade-long, crisis-ridden presidency. His challenger's participation in the election remains in doubt even though she won the primary with more than 90% of support.
The government has banned the former lawmaker from running for office, and Attorney General Tarek William Saab has opened criminal investigations against organizers of the primary, which was carried out with no support from Venezuela’s electoral authorities. Authorities have not shown any evidence supporting the ban against Machado, who has continued to campaign, insisting that voters, not ruling-party loyalists, are the rightful decision makers of her candidacy.
The uncertainty is sowing doubts among her supporters.
Digital marketing manager Yeickson Ramos considers Machado ""the most serious and credible option"" that the opposition has ""to challenge the government."" But at Tuesday's rally, Ramos, 33, acknowledged the urgent need for the opposition to determine the steps to follow if the government does not lift Machado’s ban.
""Will she choose (her substitute)?"" said Ramos, who has witnessed the apathy that previous opposition failures have created among voters. ""Or will there be an internal negotiation that concludes it can’t be any of the primary candidates who received minimal support, but we are going to look for an option that is attractive to the population.""
The U.S.-backed opposition stunned its allies and adversaries when more than 2.4 million people, included in neighborhoods long considered strongholds of the ruling party, voted in the primary. The high turnout happened despite numerous setbacks and government efforts to discredit and discourage participation in the contest.
In December, Maduro’s government was stunned again when it held a referendum on claiming part of Guyana and voting centers appeared virtually deserted throughout Election Day. Maduro and his allies insist more than 10 million people voted. Still, the absence of long lines typical of elections called for by the ruling party displayed its growing inability to mobilize supporters, even when some are required to submit proof of participation to keep their jobs or maintain certain government benefits.
Chavistas — supporters of Chávez and his self-described socialist policies — have long been cautious when expressing criticism of Maduro, who was handpicked by Chávez to lead Venezuela shortly before he died in 2013. A complex ten-year crisis that pushed millions into poverty coupled with recent corruption scandals is loosening lips.

Leonard Suarez, a Caracas lawyer, voted for Chávez and Maduro in previous elections. This year, he says he wants to see on the ballot someone other than Maduro representing Chávez's ideals after concluding that ""keeping only one person in power breeds corruption."" In the name of democracy, Suarez said, Machado better make it to the ballot.
""She should participate because it would be an example of the democracy that exists in our country,"" he said near the ruling party's demonstration. ""And not only her, any other candidate who has expressed their intention to participate in a presidential election must participate."""

A 21-year-old Black man has filed a lawsuit accusing officers in the embattled police department of Kentucky's largest city of wrongful arrest and excessive force.
Officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department arrested Jahmael Benedict last year as he walked along a sidewalk in the vicinity of a stolen vehicle, attorneys said in the lawsuit filed this month in Jefferson Circuit Court. The suit asserts that officers had ""no reasonable suspicion or probable cause"" to make the arrest in connection with the stolen vehicle and a stolen gun found nearby.
""Yet they acted in accordance with the custom and practice of LMPD violating the rights of the African-American citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky — especially the African-American males — and ignored all of the reliable information and available sources thereof that was communicated to the said defendant police officers and the other LMPD officers at the location,"" the lawsuit states.
BOY, 2, FATALLY SHOT AT NORTHERN KENTUCKY HOME
The Louisville Metro Police declined to comment on pending litigation but said in a statement that officers are working to make the city a safer place to live and work.
""LMPD is committed to providing fair, equitable, and constitutional police services to the people of Louisville,"" the statement said. ""The public expects our officers to perform trying tasks in tough conditions and maintain a high degree of professionalism. We stand behind those expectations, and meet and/or exceed them daily.""
One officer pulled his unmarked police vehicle on the sidewalk curb and exited with his gun drawn, and despite Benedict's compliance, the officer kept cursing and pointing his gun in a forceful way, making Benedict fearful of being shot, Benedict says in the lawsuit. Another officer made the arrest.

The defendants knew that their actions failed to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause, and they intentionally caused unwanted unreasonable touching, intentional handcuffing and fear of death from being shot, Benedict says in the suit.
At the time of the arrest, police said in a citation that Benedict was observed walking in the proximity of the stolen vehicle and that a witness saw him driving the vehicle before officers arrived. Another witness contradicted the first during a preliminary hearing, and a grand jury declined to indict Benedict. The charges were dismissed.

The California Google engineer accused of pummeling his wife to death last week hosted guests for dinner the night before, including one who told police the host was staring blankly into space at the dinner table, according to court documents.
Liren Chen, 27, faces a murder charge after police found him ""spattered with blood"" near the body of Xuanyi Yu on Jan. 16. Both were Google employees at the time of the incident.
""The [reporting party] had eaten dinner with Chen and [the victim] the previous evening at their home, and he was concerned about a noticeable change in Chen's demeanor,"" detectives wrote in a statement of facts related to the case. ""Chen was quiet and staring blankly for much of the evening.""
The friend who observed Chen's bizarre behavior at dinner tried calling in the morning but no one picked up. He returned to the house to check on the couple, peeked in a window and saw Chen kneeling with his hands up, still ""staring blankly,"" before police had even been called, prosecutors allege.

Police arrived and Chen allegedly remained motionless. A responding officer pronounced Yu dead at the scene.
Yu had blunt-force injuries to her head, and Chen's right hand was ""extremely swollen and purple,"" according to the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office.
His clothes were covered in blood and so were his hands, legs and arms, prosecutors said. He had minor scratches on his left arm, according to investigators.

""However, he did not appear to have any lacerations on his body that would have produced this blood,"" the detective noted.
A bloody pair of sandals nearby led the investigator to conclude, ""I believe Chen was wearing the sandals as he stood or crouched next to [the victim] and struck her repeatedly in the head with his hand.""

Police asked Chen how he injured his hand, according to the filing.
""I punched my wife,"" he allegedly replied. ""Yesterday.""

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cypriot police rescued 60 Syrian migrants from a rickety wooden boat that had been at sea for six days, and five minors had to be hospitalized, three of them in intensive care, authorities said Wednesday.
The migrants were found some 55 kilometers (34 miles) off the island nation's southeastern tip and appeared to have run short of food and water, officials said.
CYPRUS COLLABORATES WITH MOSSAD, THWARTS IRANIAN PLOT TO KILL ISRAELIS
Police and army helicopters initially flew three children and an adult to a hospital after a passing merchant ship notified Cypriot authorities of the boat’s presence off the island’s coast in pre-dawn hours.
Health Services spokesman Charalambos Charilaou told The Associated Press that three minors were in critical condition and two were listed as serious. The adult who was flown to a hospital was treated for hypothermia and released.
Cyprus has seen a major upswing in Syrian migrants, and recently rescued a boat that had been at sea for 6 days.
Three other adults who had broken bones were treated by officers aboard a patrol vessel that intercepted the migrant boat, police said.
The boat was towed to harbor and the remaining migrants received medical care.
Authorities said the boat had set sail from Lebanon on Jan. 18.
A Lebanese lawyer who follows migrant issues in his country said the boat had gone missing since its departure until it reached Cyprus. He said the migrants were in bad shape because they hadn't eaten for days.
Lebanon’s coast is about 168 kilometers (105 miles) from Cyprus.
Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides thanked authorities for their quick response in rescuing the migrants. But he said the Lebanese government needs to take action to curb these departures ""because we know that these are Syrians who come here from Lebanon.""
Although overall migrant arrivals to Cyprus have significantly gone down, arrivals by sea almost quadrupled from 937 in 2022 to 3,889 in 2023, with almost all migrants being Syrian, according to official interior ministry numbers.
In a written statement, Cypriot Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou said the boat's arrival was ""unfortunate proof"" of how people-smuggling rings are endangering lives by forcing migrants to make the journey aboard unsuitable craft.

Ioannou said it's for this reason that he had told European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson during her recent visit to Cyprus about the urgent need for the EU to put together a unit composed of Europol members, Lebanese officials and Cypriot police to partol Lebanon's borders.
He said he would again suggest the EU re-evaluate the safety of certain areas inside Syria to enable the repatriation of Syrian migrants when he meets with fellow EU interior ministers in Brussels on Thursday."

A library recently received a biography written on Clint Eastwood that was borrowed nearly four decades ago.
The 1983 book titled, ""Clint Eastwood"" by Gerald Cole and Peter Williams, was checked out by students attending John Bunyan Upper School (now named Bedford Academy) from the Bedford Central Library in May 1986. It was originally part of the city's Young People’s Library Service collection.
Employees at the Bedford Central Library, located in England, said that a member of the public, who was not the borrower, recently found the book at a house clearance and returned it 13,762 days after it was checked out.

Critics are heaping scorn on a Supreme Court decision Monday allowing Border Patrol agents to cut razor wire that Texas had installed to stem the tide of illegal crossings.
Texas had installed the roughly 30 miles of concertina wire along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border near Eagle Pass. The razor wire had been at the center of an escalating standoff between the Biden administration and the state over immigration enforcement.

The deciding vote was cast by Justice Roberts, while Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh were in the dissent. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, also sided with the majority.
None of the justices provided an explanation for their 5-4 vote.
MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER HIT RECORD 302K IN DECEMBER, SOURCES SAY
The Justice Department has argued the barrier impedes the U.S. government's ability to patrol the border, including coming to the aid of migrants in need of help.
Gov. Abbott said the fight was ""not over.""
""Texas’ razor wire is an effective deterrent to the illegal crossings Biden encourages,"" he said. ""I will continue to defend Texas’ constitutional authority to secure the border and prevent the Biden Administration from destroying our property.""
Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called the SCOTUS ruling ""extremely disappointing and frustrating."" He singled out Chief Justice Roberts for siding ""with the liberals on the Court on this import border issue.""
""Our country is being invaded by millions, including terrorists, dangerous criminals, and smugglers bringing in fentanyl that kills Americans every day. Justice Roberts did not explain his vote.""
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina blamed the Biden administration’s policies for creating the ""illegal immigration crisis.""
""But this is beyond inaction,"" he said. ""President Biden is actively aiding and abetting the largest southern border invasion our country has ever seen.""
TEXAS AG PAXTON PROMISES ‘FIGHT IS NOT OVER’ AFTER SCOTUS RULE ON BIDEN ADMIN'S RAZOR WIRE CUTTING
Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida questioned how there could be ""a ‘border security deal’ with a Biden administration that just went all the way to the Supreme Court to stop border security?""
During a Monday night appearance on the Ingraham Angle, Rubio called for an overhaul of the asylum process, saying it was being ""abused.""
""The laws have to be executed by the executive branch,"" Rubio said. ""The laws have not changed from the time Trump was president to the time Biden became president. What changed was the way the law was applied and executed.""
Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky called on Congress to step in.
""You know who could fix this – literally overrule the Supreme Court and the White House on the Texas v Biden dispute? Congress,"" he said. ""In fact, it was explained to a group of us by Justice Scalia during breakfast at the Capitol Hill Club. He told us to quit funding things we don’t like.""
The Texas GOP, meanwhile, urged Texans to tell Gov. Abbott ""to stand firm and the feds to come and cut it!""
The White House has applauded the Supreme Court’s decision. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández said the razor wire had ""prevented frontline personnel from performing vital federal functions and interfered with their ability to address urgent humanitarian situations and enforce our laws.""

""Texas’ political stunts, like placing razor wire near the border, simply make it harder and more dangerous for frontline personnel to do their jobs. Ultimately, we need adequate resources and policy changes to address our broken immigration system,"" he said.

""That is why on his first day in office, President Biden presented Congress with a comprehensive immigration reform plan and that is why he is working to find a bipartisan agreement with Congress that includes additional resources and meaningful policy reforms.""
A DHS spokesperson said enforcing immigration is a federal responsibility.
""Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the State of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law,"" the spokesperson said. ""We can enforce our laws and administer them safely, humanely, and in an orderly way.""
But the Border Patrol Union rejected the Supreme Court decision.
Gov. Abbott had authorized the wire as part of aggressive measures to curb illegal crossings from Mexico. A federal appeals court last month forced federal agents to stop cutting the concertina wire.

The concertina wire stretches for roughly 30 miles near the border city of Eagle Pass, where earlier this month the Texas Military Department seized control of a city-owned park and began denying access to Border Patrol agents.
Eagle Park has become one of the busiest spots on the southern U.S. border for migrants illegally crossing from Mexico. Abbott has said Texas won't allow Border Patrol agents into Shelby Park anymore, having expressed frustration over what he says are migrants illegally entering through Eagle Pass and then federal agents loading them onto buses.

Abbott also has authorized installing floating barriers in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass and allowed troopers to arrest and jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges. The administration also is challenging those actions in federal court.
In court papers, the administration said the wire impedes Border Patrol agents from reaching migrants as they cross the river and that, in any case, federal immigration law trumps Texas' own efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the country.

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday denied former President Trump's request to toss the gag order on his speech related to Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference case.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan first imposed the partial gag order on Oct. 17, blocking Trump from making statements targeting Special Counsel Jack Smith, his staff, witnesses and court personnel.

Last month, Trump appealed the order altogether to the full Appeals Court but was denied Tuesday.
""Upon consideration of appellant’s petition for panel rehearing filed on December 18, 2023, and the request for administrative stay, it is ordered that the petition be denied,"" the order states. ""It is, further ordered, that the request for administrative stay be denied.""
Trump and his attorneys can now appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
Attorneys for the former president and 2024 GOP front-runner have said that the gag order is a violation of his First Amendment rights, especially as he campaigns for the White House.
TRUMP APPEALS REINSTATED GAG ORDER IN DC FEDERAL ELECTION CASE
""No court in American history has imposed a gag order on a criminal defendant who is actively campaigning for public office — let alone the leading candidate for President of the United States,"" Trump's attorneys wrote in an original filing in November.
""The Gag Order violates the First Amendment rights of President Trump and over 100 million Americans who listen to him,"" they added.
Trump pleaded not guilty in August in federal court to all four federal charges stemming from Smith's investigation into 2020 election interference and the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.
Trump was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights.

U.S. forces launched an airstrike on a terror group in southern Somalia over the weekend, killing three terrorists, officials said.
U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) said its forces carried out a ""self-defense airstrike"" in a remote area of Somalia, approximately 22 miles northeast of Kismayo, on Sunday, Jan. 21, killing three Al-Shabaab members. The forces launched the strike at the request of the Somali government.

FIRST ON FOX — A group of 20 Republican states is weighing in on a Supreme Court legal battle that could sharply alter the landscape of Big Tech’s content moderation.
Next month, the high court is to hear a set of cases that question whether state laws that limit Big Tech companies’ ability to moderate content on their platforms curbs the companies’ First Amendment liberties.
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey – one of the Republican AGs leading the lawsuit against the Biden administration, alleging it engaged in a ""vast censorship enterprise"" – on Monday filed an amicus brief along with 19 of his colleagues in the cases to ask the Supreme Court to rule in favor of the laws meant to limit internet platforms’ ability to moderate content.
""If the Supreme Court lets social media companies silence speech, it will set a devastating anti-free speech precedent at a time when the First Amendment is under widespread attack,"" Bailey told Fox News digital on Monday.
JAN 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024

Separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas and are now challenged in court would require large Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.
A federal appeals court had ruled for the tech industry in the Florida case, saying that as private entities those companies were ""engaged in constitutionally protected expressive activity when they moderate and curate the content that they disseminate on their platforms."" But the Fifth Circuit ruled in favor of a similar law in Texas, creating a circuit split on the issue that's now ripe for the nine justices to take up.
The attorneys general argue in the friend-of-the-court brief that government giving Big Tech the ability to moderate or censor users’ content would be like giving cable or telephone companies permission to cut phone lines on speech at their discretion. The AGs note that under federal ""must-carry requirements,"" those companies are banned from subjugating any speech on their lines.

""The Eleventh Circuit concluded social media companies could censor content because they have ‘historically exercised’ power to refuse transmission of disfavored ideas,"" the AGs noted.
""But telegraph companies have a much longer history of censorship. Social media is less than two decades old. Congress did not impose must-carry requirements on telegraphs until 1888, 50 years after their invention,"" the AGs argue in their brief.
""Yet it is well recognized today that those must-carry regulations were constitutional – even though this Court declared that telegraph companies are ‘not common carriers.’ History thus provides no basis for dismissing the striking similarities between social media companies and telegraph and telephones by dubbing social-media censorship ‘editorial judgment,’"" they said.

""While the earlier laws applied to telegraphs and telephones, it is no different when the companies carrying other people’s speech are digital rather than analog,"" they continued.
""The States thus have a paramount interest in urging this Court to affirm that longstanding, historic authority of States to protect freedom of speech and enable representative government by prohibiting dominant communication networks from censoring,"" they concluded.

Greg Abbott argued the state has a right to defend its border.
Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley told ""America’s Newsroom"" Friday that Texas will have a ""hard time"" mounting a constitutional defense in federal court over their border enforcement efforts, despite the Biden administration's role in creating an ""unprecedented"" migrant crisis in the state. Turley weighed in on Gov. Greg Abbott's contention that the state will prevail before a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court.
ABBOTT INSISTS COURTS WILL SIDE WITH TEXAS IN BORDER DISPUTE WITH BIDEN ADMIN
JONATHAN TURLEY: Well, I certainly agree with the governor [Abbott] that, this is a violation of the understanding between the federal government and the states. The language in Article 1 Section 10 really deals with that agreement that we made with the states and the federal government, to move from the Articles of Confederation to a constitutional system with a strong federal government. I don't think anyone can honestly look at the southern border and say that the federal government has fulfilled its pledge. This is an unprecedented crisis brought about, I believe, by President Biden's policies. So, on all that, I agree.

The problem is that federal courts are unlikely to agree that this is the invasion referenced in the Constitution. There's also a reference to imminent danger. And certainly looking at hundreds of thousands of people crossing and effectively open border presents an imminent danger. But the courts are likely to define that in the context of that provision, in the context of an invasion by it, as with a foreign state. So I think Texas is going to have a hard time making that constitutional argument in court.

The problem for the Biden administration, is that it has really created, an existential crisis here, by effectively having an open border. I think that many judges would be sympathetic to Texas, that they have a right to do something. They're being overwhelmed. Even Democratic mayors are now objecting that this is overwhelming their cities. And so the idea of the federal government removing barriers, at this time is really otherworldly. But it's – you have to keep in mind on this fight, the federal government has the upper hand, legally. They tend to get a lot of deference along the border.
Gov. Abbott is touting a right to ""self-defense"" from a migrant ""invasion"" at the southern border, as the state fights a multi-pronged battle with the Biden administration.
""The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the States,"" a lengthy statement by the Texas Republican says. ""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now. President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""
Abbott is currently fighting multiple legal battles with the administration. The federal government has threatened legal action over Texas’ seizure of Shelby Park near Eagle Pass, while lawsuits are ongoing over the administration’s cutting of razor wire set up by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.
The Supreme Court this week found in the administration's favor when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas along the border. Texas this week published images of it strengthening physical barriers along Eagle Pass.

Ron DeSantis suspends his 2024 presidential campaign after a disappointing Iowa performance and endorses former President Donald Trump. CREDIT: DeSantis Campaign
Despite Gov. Ron DeSantis' departure from the presidential race ahead of the New Hampshire primary, political experts agree the Florida governor likely isn't done pursuing high-profile political office.
""My own personal assessment is that he's got three years left as governor of the third-largest state in the country, and that's a pretty, pretty awesome place to be to drive conservative change,"" Justin Sayfie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s spokesman and a top policy adviser, told Fox News Digital. ""I expect him to focus on governing and governing with his unique conservative populist style.""
DeSantis announced the end to his campaign Sunday afternoon in a video posted to his X account, while also throwing his support behind former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the race to the White House.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome — more campaign stops, more interviews — I would do it,"" DeSantis said in the Sunday video announcement. ""But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""

""It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" he said. ""He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
DeSantis launched his presidential bid in May after his emergence as a celebrated Republican governor during the pandemic, when he reopened schools and businesses while other states shuttered under stay-at-home orders and strict social distancing measures.
RON DESANTIS ENDORSES DONALD TRUMP AS HE DROPS OUT OF THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE
The Florida Republican began his bid for the White House polling strongly against Trump in national and early state polls, but the support soon waned as the 45th president unleashed attack ads against DeSantis.
""Trump’s barrage of attacks was the beginning of the end of DeSantis,"" veteran New Hampshire-based Republican strategist Michael Dennehy previously told Fox News Digital, adding DeSantis ""just didn’t have the charisma to connect with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.""

DeSantis’ campaign was also mired in campaign finance hiccups and woes. The Florida governor’s campaign was bolstered by support from super PAC Never Back Down, which had promised $200 million for the campaign, but headlines in recent months were dominated by reports of in-fighting between the super PAC’s board and the campaign, with several high-profile super PAC leaders quitting.

""His presidential campaign did not go as he and his supporters had hoped. There were so many problems — rookie mistakes, a poor start — and he just wasn't particularly good on his feet,"" GOP pollster Whit Ayres of North Star Opinion Research told Fox News Digital.
Ayres said DeSantis, 45, could make a run for the Senate in the future but likely only if a seat should open up.

""If a Senate seat should open up, which right now doesn't look like it will happen, you never know. I can't see him primarying Marco Rubio or Rick Scott. At this point, you kind of need to wait for another opportunity to open up. He's young,"" he added.
Sayfie, who noted he doesn’t have direct information from the DeSantis camp, said any hiccups in the campaign were a learning moment for the Florida governor, who would likely employ those lessons in a potential future run for political office.

""Every candidate and every campaign finishes the campaign much smarter and much wiser than they did the beginning of the campaign. … The experience that he's gained by running for president this year will serve him well should you ever decide to run again,"" he said.
Sayfie said it wouldn’t come as a surprise if DeSantis made another run for the White House, pointing to the GOP’s history of nominating candidates who had previously performed well in presidential campaigns.

""The Republican Party has a tradition of nominating candidates who have won previously and have done well in previous presidential campaigns. Mitt Romney didn't win in 2008, but he became the nominee in 2012. And there are other examples. Bob Dole, running and then finally becoming the nominee in 1996. So, based on that historical precedent, I wouldn't be surprised to see Gov. DeSantis run for president again,"" he said.
DeSantis assumed his gubernatorial office in 2019 before winning re-election in 2022. He will serve as the Sunshine State’s governor until 2027, which aligns nicely with the 2028 presidential election, Sayfie said.

TD47MC5G86_I67GYWCX43E035I,Top UN court issues preliminary ruling on South Africa's genocide case against Israel,Associated Press,"Published January 26, 2024 7:39am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/top-un-court-issues-preliminary-ruling-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel,"Fox News’ Alex Hogan reports on the latest in the Israel-Hamas war.
The United Nations' top court is set to rule Friday on a call for Israel to halt its military offensive in Gaza, when it issues a preliminary decision in a case accusing Israel of committing genocide in the tiny coastal enclave.
Joan E. Donoghue, president of the International Court of Justice, opened the session to read out the highly anticipated decision made by a panel of 17 judges in a case that goes to the core of one of the world’s most intractable conflicts.
In the ruling, which is expected to take about an hour to read out, Donoghue said the court would not throw out the case.
SOUTH AFRICA'S GENOCIDE CASE AGAINST ISRAEL SETS UP A HIGH-STAKES LEGAL BATTLE AT THE UN'S TOP COURT
""The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering,"" she said.

(AP Photo/Patrick Post)
Friday's decision, however, is only an interim one; it could take years for the full case brought by South Africa to be considered. Israel rejects the genocide accusation and had asked the court to throw the charges out.
While the case winds its way through the court, South Africa has asked the judges ""as a matter of extreme urgency"" to impose so-called provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza.
ISRAEL TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST GENOCIDE ACCUSATIONS FILED BY SOUTH AFRICA AT INTERNATIONAL COURT
Top of the South African list is a request for the court to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza."" It is also asking for Israel to take ""reasonable measures"" to prevent genocide and allow access for desperately needed aid.
In a statement Thursday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said he hoped the decision would ""include immediate action to stop the aggression and genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip ... and a rapid flow of relief aid to save the hungry, wounded and sick from the threat of slow death that threatens them.""
Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said Thursday that Israel expects the court to toss out the ""spurious and specious charges.""
Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But this time, it took the rare step of sending a high-level legal team — a sign of how seriously it regards the case and likely the fear that any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country’s international standing.
An Israeli official said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu huddled with top legal, diplomatic and security officials on Thursday in anticipation of the ruling. He said Israel is confident in its case but discussed ""all scenarios."" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing confidential meetings.
Israel launched its massive air and ground assault on Gaza after Hamas militants stormed through Israeli communities on Oct. 7 killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting another 250.
The offensive has decimated vast swaths of the territory and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.
More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run enclave said on Friday. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll, but has said about two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
The Israeli military claims at least 9,000 of those killed in the nearly four-month conflict are Hamas militants.
U.N. officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Marieke de Hoon, an associate professor of international law at the University of Amsterdam, said she thinks the court is unlikely to throw the case out Friday since the legal bar South Africa has to clear at this early stage is lower than the one that would be applied for ruling on the merits of the accusation.
""The standard ... is not, has there been genocide? But a lower standard,"" she said. ""Is it plausible that there could have been a risk of genocide that would invoke Israel’s responsibility to prevent genocide?""
But De Hoon also does not expect the world court to order an end to Israel's military operation.
""I think that they will shy away from actually calling for a full cease-fire, because I think they will find that beyond their abilities right now,"" she said in a telephone interview.
Provisional measures by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel would comply with any order.
Top Hamas official Osama Hamdan, meanwhile, said his group would abide by a cease-fire if ordered and would be ready to release the hostages it is holding if Israel releases Palestinian prisoners.
FETTERMAN BLASTS SOUTH AFRICA 'GENOCIDE' CASE AGAINST ISRAEL AMID UNREST, CRIME: 'SIT THIS ONE OUT'
How the U.S., Israel's top ally, responds to any order will be key, since it wields veto power at the U.N. Security Council and thus could block measures there aimed at forcing Israel's compliance.
The U.S. has said Israel has the right to defend itself, but also spoken about the need for the country to protect civilians in Gaza and allow more aid in.
The genocide case strikes at the national identity of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.
South Africa’s own identity is key to it bringing the case. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to ""homelands"" before ending in 1994."

Is Arkansas just as magical as Paris? For one man, the answer appears to be ""yes.""
Julien Navas, a resident of Paris, France, ran into some luck as he unearthed a 7.46-carat diamond at the Arkansas Crater of Diamonds State Park earlier this month.
""[The park] is a magical place where the dream of finding a diamond can come true! It was a real great adventure,"" the Parisian said, as reported by Arkansas State Parks.

While in the Big Easy, Navas learned about the Crater of Diamonds State Park and became intrigued.
""The park piqued his interest because he had previously panned for gold and searched for ammonite fossils,"" officials with Arkansas State Parks wrote in a press release.
""So he knew he had to visit the park while he was in the U.S.""

""I got to the park around 9:00 and started to dig,"" Navas said. ""That is back-breaking work, so by the afternoon I was mainly looking on top of the ground for anything that stood out.""
After several hours, he brought his discoveries to the park's Diamond Discovery Center and found out that he was carrying a brown diamond weighing 7.46 carats.
""I am so happy! All I can think about is telling my fiancée what I found,"" Navas said to park officials.

The park got a lot of rain in the days before Navas' visit, which was a reason for the find.

""We periodically plow the search area to loosen the diamond-bearing soil and promote natural erosion,"" Assistant Park Superintendent Waymon Cox said in a press release.
""As rain falls on the field, it washes away the dirt and uncovers heavy rocks, minerals and diamonds near the surface.""
Navas told park officials that he named the gem after his fiancée, Carine. He plans to have the gem cut into two diamonds – one for his fiancée and one for his daughter.

TDUSPPSKPL_UJJ219NROM0NA1J,Attempt by Georgia elections board to investigate secretary of state sparks legal debate,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 7:20am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/attempt-georgia-elections-board-investigate-secretary-state-sparks-legal-debate,"Fox News' Steve Harrigan provides details on the allegations against District Attorney Fani Willis as she faces calls to step down from the election interference case against former President Trump. Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt weighs in.
An attempt to state that Georgia's appointed State Election Board has the legal power to investigate Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's handling of elections blossomed into a constitutional showdown Tuesday, with a lawyer for Raffensperger saying board members can't legally oversee him.
""There is no precedent for an unelected board of political appointees to have oversight over members of the executive branch,"" wrote Charlene McGowan, Raffensperger's general counsel. ""Giving a board of unelected bureaucrats unchecked power over the state’s executive branch is a dangerous policy proposal.""
But the Senate Ethics Committee disagreed, voting to advance Senate Bill 358. The proposal would remove Raffensperger from his nonvoting post on the board, allow the board to hire election investigators instead of solely relying on those working for Raffensperger and clearly give the board power to investigate the secretary of state.

""We’re looking to empower the State Election Board so that they can have oversight responsibility and that there’s no confusion about where that oversight responsibility is vested,"" said Ethics Committee Chairman Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican.
It's only part of a push by Republican lawmakers for changes in how elections are run in Georgia.
Raffensperger's steadfast defense of Georgia's 2020 election, which Democratic President Joe Biden narrowly won, and his rejection of a call by Donald Trump to ""find"" more Republican votes made him a national figure. But Raffensperger is also a pariah among many Republican activists, who continue pushing Trump's false claims that Georgia's 2020 results were marred by fraud and that Trump was the rightful winner. And those activists continue to exert pressure on Republican Georgia lawmakers, who face election this year.

Activists have been pushing the State Election Board to investigate whether Raffensperger mishandled his audit of Fulton County's 2020 results, motivated by unproven claims of fraud. The board deadlocked 2-2 in December on whether it had such authority, and two board members asked lawmakers to clarify the law.
A lawyer who works for the legislature told committee members Tuesday it's ""an open question under Georgia constitutional law"" whether the State Election Board can regulate the secretary of state, but said the measure wouldn't affect Raffensperger's duties as outlined in the constitution. Supporters said they can go forward because most of Raffensperger's election responsibilities are outlined in state law, not the Georgia Constitution.
""They’re all in general law that the Georgia General Assembly has passed over the course of time in our state history,"" said Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican. ""So we can change them, amend them in any way we want, through the legislative process.""
McGowan warned that lawmakers are aiding people who want to overturn legitimate election results and could empower the board to obstruct certification of Georgia's 2024 presidential results.
""In fact, this proposal is being pushed by a small group of activists who continue to seek de-certification of the 2020 presidential election results, with the apparent intent of giving the State Election Board the ability to interfere with or even prevent the secretary from certifying the results of the 2024 presidential election,"" McGowan wrote.
Lawmakers also want Raffensperger to remove computer codes used to count most Georgia ballots, to move more quickly to patch voting machine software vulnerabilities, and include more ballot security features.
Neither Raffensperger nor any of his staff appeared during the Tuesday Senate committee meeting, a contrast with testimony Raffensperger deputy Gabriel Sterling gave to a House Governmental Affairs subcommittee Tuesday on other bills.
Sterling said Raffensperger supports a bill to stamp ballots with a watermark to ensure voters know they aren't forged. He also voiced support for a measure proposing more and stricter after-election audits to guarantee machines count ballots correctly. And Governmental Affairs Chairman John LaHood, a Valdosta Republican, agreed to amend a bill calling for high-resolution scans of ballots to be released for public inspection after Sterling said current scanners only produce lower-resolution images.
LaHood has also proposed a bill backed by Republican House Speaker Jon Burns that would mandate Georgia stop using QR codes to count ballots by July 1. Opponents say voters can’t be sure the computer codes match the choices printed on their ballots.

""Every one of our committee members said their citizens do not trust the QR code. So let’s go ahead and get rid of it,"" Sen Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican, said recently.
Raffensperger told lawmakers last week that he supports a move to scan ""human readable text,"" the names printed on ballots, to count votes. But he said it was impossible to make such a change before the November presidential election.
Eliminating QR codes would cost $15 million to buy more than 32,000 ballot printers statewide, Raffensperger’s office has estimated.
The House subcommittee didn't hear testimony Tuesday on the bill to ban QR codes. LaHood said afterwards he was hopeful Raffensperger's office might propose a new solution using optical character recognition software."

""The Next Revolution"" host Steve Hilton called out Nikki Haley Tuesday night for her response to former President Trump's primary win in New Hampshire and her decision to use her post-race speech to attack the GOP frontrunner ""more aggressively"" than ever before.
TRUMP TOPS HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT DOESN'T DELIVER KNOCKOUT BLOW
STEVE HILTON: Donald Trump, this was a stunning victory for him. This was the state that is of all the Republican primary states, the worst in the whole country for Donald Trump. And he wins a majority. He wins over 50% and looks like a double-digit victory over Nikki Haley. That is a stunning result. Then you look at Nikki Haley and it's also very much the result…. this is exactly what she and the Never Trump Republican establishment dreamed of –  the two-horse race in a state that favors Nikki Haley and is the worst for Donald Trump – and she's defeated by double digits. But the worst thing was that speech, Nikki Haley['s] speech. Stunningly bad judgment. Let's just think about the situation she's in. She wants to go to South Carolina, a state where she's miles behind Donald Trump, currently 20, 30, 40 points behind Donald Trump. She needs to persuade Republicans who currently support Trump to switch to her. So what did she do in that speech tonight? Attack Donald Trump more aggressively than she's ever done before? It is stunningly bad judgment. It makes me think, actually, she knows she's going to lose. She's not interested in even trying to win votes. She's got something else going on. Maybe her head has been turned by all the media adulation she's got in the last couple of days. It's impossible to understand what she's trying to do with that speech tonight.

Fox News projected Trump would win the Granite State primary just a few minutes after the final polls closed in New Hampshire.
The win, however, did not land a knockout blow in the Republican presidential race after Haley vowed to keep on fighting.
""You’ve all heard the chatter among the political class. They’re falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not last in the nation. This race is far from over,"" Haley stressed as she spoke to supporters after the contest was quickly called for Trump.
For Haley, a former two-term South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, New Hampshire was seen as her best and possibly last chance to slow down or derail the former president's march towards renomination.
The race now heads to Haley's home state, which on Feb. 24 holds the next major contest in the Republican nominating calendar.

(Credit: FOX 5 DC)
In an effort to honor the contributions of prominent African American figures in the city’s history, the Alexandria City Council has unanimously voted to rename the first set of streets that honor Confederate leaders.
On Saturday, the city council passed a measure that would change the names of three streets and re-dedicate a fourth.
There are at least 41 streets in Alexandria that are associated with Confederate military members.
Among the streets being renamed is Forrest Street, which is named for Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

Its proposed new name will be Harriett Jacobs Street, after the abolitionist and author of the book ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.""

TL1FKWLJWM_97BBS82KV63BI2F,Trump says he'll get DeSantis voters' support: 'He fought hard',By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 8:07am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-suggests-hell-get-desantis-voters-support-he-fought-hard,"'Fox & Friends' co-host Lawrence Jones previews his interview with former President Trump ahead of the New Hampshire primary
Former President Donald Trump suggested in an interview with Fox News that aired on Monday that he'll get Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' voters' support ahead of the New Hampshire primaries.
Trump, speaking with Fox News' Lawrence Jones, said he was ""honored"" to be endorsed by DeSantis, saying both men had similar platforms.
""I think it sort of magnifies, if I can say that, because he and I – look, I want strong borders, he wanted strong borders. I wanted low taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in history, nobody ever, bigger than the Ronald Reagan tax cut, he wants that. I want a strong military. He wants that. He doesn’t want wars, although I may be a little bit moreso on that, not wanting wars,"" Trump said on Sunday, comparing himself with DeSantis. ""We have wars in places that nobody ever heard of before. And we’re losing, you know you talk about blood and wealth, we lose so stupidly. And a lot of the things he wanted, I wanted. In fact, I noticed people’s commentary, they’re saying well all of those people that would be for him, would be for Trump.""

""And so I was honored that he endorsed me this quickly. It’s not easy. Look, it’s not easy. He fought hard, spent a lot of money, and a lot of people thought he’d do well,"" Trump said of the Florida governor. ""You know I was leading from the beginning, just so you understand. And I did very well in Florida, more votes in Florida than anybody ever got. But he was doing well, and I think he did the right thing. I mean, look, I could talk about somebody else’s campaign. I didn’t see a path. I don’t see a path for her at all.""
""I think those people will all come to me,"" he said, referring to DeSantis supporters.
In his message backing out of the race Sunday, DeSantis deemed, ""Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,"" while also taking a parting swipe at Nikki Haley.
DESANTIS TAKES PARTING SHOT, SAYS HALEY REPRESENTS 'WARMED-OVER CORPORATISM'
""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,"" DeSantis said.

Meanwhile, Haley, who remains in the race against Trump ahead of the New Hampshire primaries Tuesday, told Fox News of DeSantis' supporters, ""I think his supporters are up for grabs. Think about it. His supporters love America, and they wanted a new generational leader. We give them that.""
In the interview, Trump addressed how given he endorsed DeSantis for governor, he was ""disappointed"" when DeSantis first teased he'd enter the 2024 presidential race. Of the prospect of naming DeSantis his vice presidential running mate or to another cabinet position, Trump said, ""Well, it’s probably unlikely, but I have to be honest, everything’s a possibility, but I think it’s highly unlikely. I have a lot of great people, and I have great people who have been with me right from the beginning.""
Jones also asked Trump if he would consider Haley as a potential running mate.

""I don't know, I mean, I just can't say it, but I don't want to rule people out. There's no reason to rule people out, but I think it's highly unlikely. Um, I will say this. A lot of people in the base, MAGA is 90, 95%. You have some RINOs left, but they're like, on a resuscitator, you know what a resuscitator is? You probably don’t, but they're, you know, barely breathing. So we'll see what happens,"" Trump said. ""I think that we're going to have a tremendous Tuesday and we're going to have a great result, just like we did in Iowa.""
""I would say that with Nikki, I haven't done anything. I'm very upset with her. She said ‘I would never run. He was a great president.’ I would know she worked for me, like, for two and a half years. And she was okay, not great. She was okay. But she said to everybody, in fact, when she left, ‘I would never run against the president. He was a great president,’"" Trump added.
Trump also went after President Biden, referencing how Biden recently admitted to Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich that he does not believe the border is secure.

""Isn't amazing that Biden for three years has been trying to justify the invasion of our country, the destruction of our country. And you know what? Yesterday, for the first time, I said, did you see this interview? Because, you know, when he gets up to interview people, he has not too much idea where the hell he is, but he actually said, no, the border is not safe,"" Trump said. ""I couldn't believe it. He finally said that after 15 million people poured into our country. Because I think the real number is probably-- it's going to be 15 million by the time he's finished destroying our country, and we're going to have the largest deportation because you cannot --there's just no way it can be justified, Lawrence. There's no way it's sustainable. It is not a sustainable situation. Our border is the worst border in the history of the world, I believe. I believe it's the most unsafe border. There's never been a border in history for any country, including third world countries and banana republics. So that's again, that's a stage beyond third world, okay, that's been anywhere near this. This is a disaster for our country.""

As the families of three dead Kansas City Chiefs fans await the results of their loved ones' toxicology reports, one victim's father has a ""sinister theory"" about what may have preceded their mysterious deaths. The bodies of Ricky Johnson, 38; Clayton McGeeney, 36; and David Harrington, 37, were discovered on January 9, two days after they had gathered at their friend Jordan Willis' home to watch the Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers. Willis' attorney has said his client had no idea the men were outside, and was only made aware of the bodies when police showed up at the Northwest 83rd Terrace home days later. He said he slept for nearly 48 hours following the party, according to his attorney John Picerno, while family members of the deceased fans tried to contact him and even showed up at his home.
Harrington's father, Jon Harrington, told Fox News Digital that he is ""not buying"" that story and ""doesn't believe anything [Willis'] attorney says.""

""[Harrington's mother] and I are both convinced that Jordan Willis played a part in this somehow,"" the elder Harrington said on Thursday. ""We just haven’t figured out how yet. . . . What else could it be? Perfectly healthy men don’t just drop off the face of the earth.""""There were four of you in the house and now three of them are dead and you’re not. That doesn’t add up,"" the father continued. ""I’m thinking that he, the three of them learned something or saw something that they shouldn’t have seen, and he decided ‘well, I need to get rid of you now.’ Friends or not.""
5TH MAN CONTRADICTS KANSAS CITY CHIEFS FANS' PAL ABOUT MEN'S DEATHS
David Harrington's father described him as a ""rabid"" football fan. His celebration of life, the father said, was an 80-person-strong watch party of the Chiefs game against the Buffalo Bills on January 21. ""Whenever the Chiefs would make a drive, they were all chanting my son’s name. I will never forget that for the rest of my life,"" Jon Harrington said. (Facebook)
After speaking with the Platte County prosecutor's office, Harrington's father said he ""would expect that they will treat this as a drug overdose and go on with their business."" ""But I don’t think it’s as simple as that,"" he said. ""I'm aware that they may have done some substances that were questionable – but the idea was to get high, not dead . . . If they were supposed to be friends, why didn’t [Willis] come find them. I’m sure they have a hundred different answers to that, but that’s my question.""Jennifer Marquez, Harrington's mother, told Fox News Digital that although her son ""smoked cigarettes and drank beers with his friends,"" she doesn't believe he overdosed, and that ""Jordan [is going to] have everything to do with what we find out"" about his death.
""Yes, I believe that something happened that night and that Jordan had something to do with it,"" Marquez said. ""We all believe that Jordan had something to do with that.""
Jennifer Marquez said her son David Harrington, pictured, could ""almost make you pass out laughing"" and that his ""favorite thing in the world was to make other people happy."" (Facebook)
""He sat in that house for two days and had time to get rid of and clean up evidence,"" Marquez said on Thursday. ""He's had no drug test done on him. He's had no alcohol test. He has had nothing to see how he might be included in this – they've given him two weeks to get any evidence completely gone.""""Jordan's not telling the truth,"" Marquez continued. ""When you tell the truth, your story is solid. It's when you're lying that your story changes, and that's what's been happening. I don't understand why the police don't see that.""The Kansas City Police Department has stressed that Willis is not suspected of any wrongdoing and is not facing criminal charges.BROTHER OF CHIEFS FAN WHO WAS FOUND DEAD IN FRIEND'S BACKYARD SPEAKS OUT, SAYS STORY 'NOT ADDING UP'

""There have not been any arrests [or] charges, and no one is in custody. There are no specific threats or concerns for the surrounding community at this time. The resident at the house was cooperative with detectives the day the deceased were discovered.""Police corroborated Picerno's statement that Willis voluntarily let them search his home; the Johnson family attorney, Ross Nigro, told Fox News Digital that a search warrant was carried out two days later.

Willis, who holds a Ph.D., is a senior principal scientist at IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center's Schief Lab in Kansas City, according to the nonprofit's website. IAVI did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. ""Something that comes to my mind: This guy wants to brag about how smart he is, he’s a scientist,"" Norma Chester, Johnson's mother, told Fox News Digital earlier this week.

The Virginia General Assembly on Wednesday elected two experienced attorneys who were nominated a day earlier to fill long-standing vacancies on the state’s powerful regulatory panel that oversees interests ranging from utilities to insurers.
Without opposition, both chambers approved the appointments of Sam Towell and Kelsey Bagot to the State Corporation Commission, an independent state agency with a staff of hundreds. It has a purview that includes the regulation of utilities, insurance, state-chartered financial institutions, railroads, business filings and other matters. Three commissioners — the roles Towell and Bagot are stepping into — oversee the agency’s work.
NORTHERN VIRGINIA COULD GET CASINO AS BILL TO ALLOW FAIRFAX COUNTY REFERENDUM ADVANCES
Both the 2022 and 2023 legislative sessions saw political gridlock over how the then-politically divided General Assembly should fill commissioner vacancies. Democrats opened this session in full control of both chambers after November's elections, giving them the leeway to advance their preferred nominees.

Bagot was most recently employed by Florida-based energy giant NextEra Energy. She previously worked at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as a legal advisor to Commissioner Mark Christie, a former chairman of the State Corporation Commission. Her six-year term will commence April 1.
Towell most recently worked as an in-house attorney for meat producer Smithfield Foods and previously served in the state Office of the Attorney General as deputy attorney general for civil litigation. He will fill an unexpired term of nearly four years.

The Legislature also elected judges to the Court of Appeals, circuit courts, general district courts, juvenile and domestic relations courts, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission and the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, which investigates complaints against judges.

""Our House Republican leaders and a majority of Republican Senators support his reelection, and Republican voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have strongly backed him at the polls. It's now past time for the Republican Party to unite around President Trump so we can focus on ending the disastrous Biden presidency and growing our majority in Congress.""
""If Nikki Haley’s primary goal is to defeat Joe Biden in November, she will drop out tonight and endorse Trump,"" Federalist co-founder Sean Davis posted on X. ""If she continues to stay in a race she cannot win just to attack Trump, then we’ll know she’s fully owned by the left-wing Democrats who are funding her campaign.""
""First time any candidate has won the first two primary states since 1976,"" Eric Trump posted on X.

""I want to congratulate my good friend @realdonaldtrump on another resounding win in New Hampshire tonight,"" the account for former HUD Secretary Ben Carson and his wife Candy posted on X. ""This primary is over, and I pray @NikkiHaley will drop out so we can focus our efforts on defeating Biden in November. We have a country to save and the stakes are too high.""

In a statement, the Biden presidential campaign said that the results ""confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party.""
""Trump is offering Americans the same extreme agenda that has cost Republicans election after election: promising to undermine American democracy, reward the wealthy on the backs of the middle class, and ban abortion nationwide. Joe Biden sees things differently. He’s fighting to grow our economy for the middle-class, strengthen our democracy, and protect the rights of every single American. While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden.""
New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a staunch supporter of Haley's, posted on X that her 2nd place finish ""turned the narrative of the national media on its head and proved this is indeed a two person race.""

""This race is far from over,"" Haley told her supporters after Trump was declared the winner, backing up her previous comments leading up to the election that she intends to stay in the race for the long run.
The Haley campaign sent out a press release late Tuesday night taking a shot at the Trump campaign and pollsters for predicting she would lose by 20 points in New Hampshire.
""The political elites never learn. The same naysayers who said Nikki Haley couldn’t defeat a 30-year incumbent state legislator or win the governor’s race in South Carolina are the same people declaring the presidential race over after only two states have voted,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""Nikki Haley has never taken her cues from the establishment, and she’s not going to start now. Keep underestimating us — that will be fun.""

TOWD2LM5PK_YOLM00L7OK5NOT4,European Union minister calls for Palestinian statehood despite Israeli leader's rejection,Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 12:54pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/european-union-urges-palestinian-statehood-despite-israeli-leaders-rejection,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
European Union foreign ministers argued Monday that the  creation of a Palestinian state is the only credible way to achieve peace in the Middle East, and they expressed concern about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s clear rejection of the idea.
""The declarations of Benjamin Netanyahu are worrying. There will be a need for a Palestinian state with security guarantees for all,"" French Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Sejourne told reporters in Brussels, where ministers met to discuss the war in Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Palestinian counterpart Riad Malki also were in Belgium's capital for the talks. The issue of Gaza’s future has set Israel in opposition to the United States and its Arab allies as well as they work to mediate an end to the fighting in the besieged Palestinian territory.
POLAND'S NEW GOVERNMENT PRAISED BY EUROPEAN UNION FOR EFFORTS TO RESTORE RULE OF LAW
The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 25,000, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Israel said Sunday that another of the hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war had died.

The EU is the world’s top provider of aid to the Palestinians but holds little leverage over Israel, despite being its biggest trading partner. The 27 member countries are also deeply divided in their approach. But as the death toll in Gaza mounts, so do calls for a halt to the fighting.
""Gaza is in a situation of extreme urgency. There is a risk of famine. There is a risk of epidemics. The violence must stop,"" said Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency.
""We demand an immediate cease-fire, the release of the hostages, the respect of international law (and) a return to the peace process, which must lead to the creation of two states living in peace side by side,"" Lahbib said, describing a two-state solution as ""the only way to establish peace in a durable way in the region.""
Israel appears far from achieving its goals of crushing Hamas and freeing the more than 100 remaining hostages. But Netanyahu rejects Palestinian statehood and seeks open-ended military control over Gaza.
The dispute over the territory’s future — with no end in sight to the war — poses a major obstacle to any plans for postwar governance or reconstruction.
The EU invited the foreign ministers of Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt, Jordan and a representative of the Arab League to take part in Monday's talks. The ministers for Israel and the Palestinians were not due to meet each other.
The European ministers wanted to hear about Israel's plans for the future.
""Which are the other solutions they have in mind?,"" asked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting. ""To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill off them?""
Borrell condemned what he described as the atrocities committed by Hamas, but added that Israeli military actions ""are seeding the hate for generations.""
The Palestinian minister said a cease-fire is the most urgent need.
""We have to call collectively for a cease-fire. We cannot accept anything less,"" Malki said.
He also called on the EU ""to start contemplating sanctions against Netanyahu and others who are really destroying the chances for a two state-solution and for peace in the Middle East.""
Spain has pushed for a peace conference on what might happen once the fighting is over. A future meeting in Brussels is in the works, but the timing remains unclear. The plan has the backing of some EU member countries, but others say it can only happen with Israel’s support.
""If Israel is not (at) the table, there is no use to have peace conferences,"" Luxembourg Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel said. He does not believe Israel will be ready for talks as long as it believes that Hamas poses a danger.
UKRAINE’S A STEP CLOSER TO JOINING THE EU. HERE’S WHAT IT MEANS, AND WHY IT MATTERS
The Israeli minister refused to respond when asked about the possibility of Palestinian statehood. Holding up pictures of Israeli hostages, he said he had come to seek support for Israel’s campaign to dismantle Hamas.
""We have to bring back our security. Our brave soldiers are fighting in very hard conditions,"" he told reporters. The Israeli government's aims, Katz said, are clear: ""to bring back our hostages and restore security for the citizens of Israel.""
With regional tensions flaring, the ministers also discussed a planned EU naval mission to help ensure maritime traffic security in the Red Sea, a major trade route. Belgium has committed to send a frigate, and Germany could do the same. Italy also is willing to take part.
For months, Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports. U.S. airstrikes have hit sites of the Iranian-backed Houthis seven times, according to U.S. officials. U.K. forces participated in some strikes."
TQ91AWU8VJ_SZLAH23IAIJGWFY,Saudi Arabia ramps up pressure on Israel to agree to Palestinian state with fresh demand,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 12:11pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/saudi-arabia-ramps-up-pressure-israel-agree-palestinian-state-fresh-demand,"Israeli consulate in NY spokesman Itay Milner tells ‘The Story’ that he agrees with President Biden's theory on why Hamas struck on Oct. 7.
Saudi Arabia said Sunday it would not normalize relations with Israel without an agreement to create a path to a Palestinian state, something that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected.
Saudia Arabia’s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, sat down for an interview that aired on Sunday with CNN’s ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" stating: ""Everybody agrees that the only way to get out of this cycle of violence is to inevitably be on this path to a Palestinian state, and that's absolutely necessary, and that's what we're focused on.""
In the interview, the host asked: ""Are you saying unequivocally that if there is not a credible and irreversible path to a Palestinian state, there will not be normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel?""
""That’s the only way we’re going to get a benefit,"" Prince Faisal replied. ""So, yes.""

Before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the U.S. had been trying to broker a landmark agreement in which Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in exchange for U.S. security guarantees, aid in establishing a civilian nuclear program and progress toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In September, Netanyahu had said Israel was on ""the cusp"" of such a deal.
Earlier in the interview, when asked if oil-rich Saudi Arabia would finance reconstruction in Gaza, Prince Faisal gave a similar answer.
""As long as we’re able to find a pathway to a solution... then we can talk about anything,"" he said. ""But if we are just resetting to the status quo before Oct. 7, in a way that sets us up for another round of this, as we have seen in the past, we’re not interested in that conversation.""
""The key to de-escalation right now is ending the conflict in Gaza because that's feeding all of this instability in the region. We were already a very unstable region unfortunately before, but this continuing conflict and continuing carnage we’re seeing… we’re now at 30,000 civilians dead in Gaza,"" he added. The Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry had the death toll at 25,295 people in Gaza, with more than 60,000 wounded, but does not distinguish between militants and civilians.
Last week, Netanyahu rejected the vision supported by the United States, as well as much of the international community, for a postwar resolution, saying he will never allow a Palestinian state and is seeking open-ended military control over Gaza. On Monday, dozens of family members of hostages held by Hamas stormed a committee meeting in Israel’s parliament, demanding a deal to win their loved ones’ release. Netanyahu has insisted to the Israeli public that pursuing the devastating offensive in Gaza is the only way to bring the hostages home.
European Union foreign ministers also on Monday gathered in Brussels to discuss the war in Gaza, supporting the creation of a Palestinian state as the only credible way to achieve peace in the Middle East and expressing concern about Netanyahu’s clear rejection of the idea.

EU CHIEF SAYS ISRAEL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HAMAS' SURGE TO POWER IN GAZA: 'FINANCED BY THE GOVERNMENT'
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Palestinian counterpart Riad Malki also were in Belgium's capital for the talks. The issue of Gaza's future has set Israel in opposition to the United States and its Arab allies as well as they work to mediate an end to the fighting in the besieged Palestinian territory.
The Palestinians seek a state that would include Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital and the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people. It has built scores of settlements across both territories that are home to hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers. The last of several rounds of peace talks broke down nearly 15 years ago.
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until ""complete victory"" over Hamas and to return all remaining hostages after the Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel that triggered the war. In that attack, some 1,200 people were killed and Hamas and other terrorists abducted around 250 people.

Around 100 hostages were freed under a week-long cease-fire deal in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been confirmed dead. Hamas has said it will free more captives only in exchange for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu has ruled out such an agreement.

The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense residential areas.

TTH4M31WZP_U3I4BUT5XC6ULLK,Florida heads back to court in fight with Biden admin over migrant parole releases,By Adam Shaw Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 12:25pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-heads-back-court-fight-with-biden-admin-over-migrant-parole-releases,"Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody joined Fox & Friends First to discuss the latest on the crisis at the southern border and BlackRock doubling down on ESG investing.
The state of Florida is heading back to court on Friday for oral arguments in another case with potential implications for the handling of the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- after a ruling earlier this year blocked the Biden administration from using parole to release immigrants into the interior in some situations.
The Biden administration and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody’s office will be before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday for oral arguments in a case that stretches back years.
Moody initially filed the case in March 2021 over the release of migrants into the interior, via humanitarian parole into Alternatives to Detention — known as ""Parole + ATD"" —arguing it was unlawful and that parole is to be used on a ""case by case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit"" by statute.
FEDERAL JUDGE RULES BIDEN'S BORDER POLICIES UNLAWFUL, JUST A ‘SPEEDBUMP’ FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

Florida contended that the government was violating statutory mandates that migrants be detained. The administration had argued that there is no ""non-detention policy"" and that it is using its prosecutorial discretion to release migrants into alternatives to detention when necessary. It has also said it cannot detain all illegal immigrants due to capacity issues and the immigration court backlog.
The case resulted in the revelation of multiple pockets of information, including testimony from then Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz and the release of plans for the end of the Title 42 public health order.
The battle culminated in a federal judge in March 2023 issuing a ban on the administration’s use of Parole + ATD. In a scathing opinion Judge T. Kent Wetherell stated the Biden administration had ""effectively turned the Southwest Border into a meaningless line in the sand and little more than a speedbump for aliens flooding into the country.""
That ruling would have additional consequences in May when the same judge would slap an injunction on the use by the administration of a ""parole with conditions"" program, finding it to be materially identical to the parole + ATD program that he had blocked. He said it was ""functionally identical"" to the other policy.
The White House slammed that ruling as ""sabotage, pure and simple"" and hard argued that the releases were needed to reduce overcrowding.
SENATE BORDER BILL TO ALLOW 5,000 MIGRANTS A DAY BEFORE TITLE 42-TYPE LIMIT STARTS; SPARKING CONSERVATIVE FURY
The administration has consistently argued that it is following the laws passed by Congress, but needs more funding and comprehensive immigration reform from Congress in order to deal with what it says is a hemisphere-wide crisis.
It has more recently pointed to an increase in returns since the end of Title 42 in May, saying it has returned more migrants since May than in the entirety of FY 2019. It has also pointed to a record number of fentanyl seizures as a sign its increased technology is working.
Republicans at both state and federal level have accused the administration of fueling the crisis with liberal immigration policies and the release of migrants into the interior. There were a record 302,000 migrant encounters in December after a record 2.4 million in FY 23.
Separately the administration is battling with states over immigration policy. Amid the ongoing fight with Florida, the administration also has multiple legal battles with Texas. This week the Supreme Court overturned a ban on federal officials from cutting razor wire set up by Texas. It also has lawsuits challenging its recent anti-illegal immigration law and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.
""Biden is ignoring the law and the opinion we obtained in federal court regarding his open border policies,"" Moody said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""He is wasting time and resources fighting Florida and Texas instead of doing his job and ending the border crisis. As a result, more than 8 million unvetted immigrants and hundreds of millions of deadly doses of fentanyl have flooded into our country with no signs of stopping as long as Biden is president.""

Meanwhile, Congress is trying to find a deal on a border supplemental deal. The White House had requested $14 billion for aid to communities, expedited removal and more staffing. But Republicans want that tied to tightened asylum rules and more restrictions on the use of parole -- the subject of the battle between Florida and the administration.

A Washington couple experienced a scary situation early Saturday morning as their vehicle plunged into a sinkhole in a Vancouver intersection while they were on their way home, according to a city spokesperson.
Authorities responded to the intersection around 1:15 a.m. on Saturday after reports that a car had gone into a sinkhole.
Katlynn Bicknell and her boyfriend Kevin were out grabbing food and were on their way home when the car became stuck in a huge hole with lots of bubbling water surrounding it, the couple told KPTV.
Bicknell tried to open the door as she pushed against the rushing water.

""It felt like the movies, like being in a movie,"" Bicknell told KPTV. ""We turned right on to Washington, and soon as we turned, it went straight into the hole. It felt like being on a roller coaster when you go down the big dip, and the car just started to fill with water.""

Kate Middleton was admitted to the hospital for a ""planned abdominal surgery"" last week, but it wasn’t known to insiders ahead of Kensington Palace's Jan. 17 announcement, royal experts suggested to Fox News Digital.
""Just days before the announcement I spoke to sources close to the family and they gave no indication that anything was afoot,"" royal expert Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital following a People magazine report that said her surgery came as a surprise to those close to the royal family.
""I believe the report,"" Spence said, adding that the princess is ""essential to the health and wellness of the monarchy. ""On the human side of it, she is the mother to a future king. She is the partner to a future king. Catherine is the stability, normalcy, and warmth of the family for the next two generations. She is also an invaluable tool for the institution, as she is consistently ranked as one of the most popular members.""
Christopher Andersen, author of ""The King: The Life of Charles III,"" suggested that the main reason the Princess of Wales might have kept her impending surgery quiet was for the sake of her three young children.
HOW KING CHARLES, KATE MIDDLETON'S HEALTH WOES EXPOSE HOLLYWOOD INFLUENCE ON THE MONARCHY: EXPERT

""Kate is a very private person to start with, but she certainly is most concerned with how this will all affect her young children,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""She obviously doesn't want to concern or frighten them. When you're the age of George, Charlotte, or Louis, of course, it's a scary thing to see a parent go into the hospital. That is one of the principal reasons, if not the principal reason, Kate has sought to downplay the surgery.""
But, he said, in reality, keeping her health issue a mystery has fueled rumors.
""Unfortunately, the suddenness of the announcement and the mystery shrouding the Princess's condition have only served to fan the flames of speculation and gossip,"" Andersen said. ""It probably would have been better for the Palace to simply describe the nature of Kate's surgery and get it over with. Until they do, the royal rumor mill will just keep churning away. Compare and contrast this with the King's prostate procedure. Had Charles entered the hospital for a ‘planned surgery’ without further explanation, you can be sure there would have been an uproar.""
KATE MIDDLETON IS SELFLESS DESPITE HOSPITALIZATION, CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER PATIENTS AND KING CHARLES: EXPERT
King Charles III is also expected to be admitted to the hospital for a ""corrective"" procedure related to an enlarged prostate.
Royal author and commentator Duncan Larcombe added that Middleton’s husband, Prince William, has been given the OK by Charles to only carry out light duties, so he can take care of his wife and Princes George, 10, Louis, 5, and Princess Charlotte, 8.

Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Middleton was admitted to the London Clinic for the planned surgery and would likely remain there for two weeks.
The princess was last seen in public while walking with her family to Church on Christmas Day in Sandringham and there were no signs then that she was in ill health.
The palace has also been tight-lipped about what kind of surgery she’s having beyond that it’s abdominal.
""I haven’t been able to get anything out of anyone about her surgery or condition,"" Spence added.
Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that the news of Charles' procedure has restarted rumors that the king could abdicate in the same way Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II did earlier this month.
He said with William taking care of Kate and Charles, and Sarah Ferguson having their own health issues — Prince Andrew’s ex underwent breast cancer treatment and was just diagnosed with skin cancer — the royal family is ""now depleted of major members … This would have meant a massive increase in duties for Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.""

He said that many royal observers have been concerned about the effect a ""medical catastrophe"" could have on a ""slimmed down monarchy.""
""Thus, with no Andrew or [Prince] Harry and Meghan [Markle], Princess Anne's similar concern that slimming down would not work has come home to roost,"" he added. ""In reality, it points now to the Firm in disarray and perhaps a major rethink in the Windsor household. At a time of U.K. austerity, spending more money on a potential increase in monarchy size may be frowned upon, but in the long term necessary.""

Anderson believes that the princess’ surgery, due to which the palace says she won’t return to royal duties until after Easter, is clearly more of a ""genuine health crisis"" than a ""minor procedure.""
""Just because surgery was ‘planned’ doesn't mean it's routine,"" he added, suggesting: ""The two-week hospital stay and the long recovery period leave no doubt that this was a major medical issue of some sort.""
Middleton, 42, hasn’t had many serious health issues known to the public in the past, except during her three pregnancies when she suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness, and had to be hospitalized.
Kinsey Schofield, host of the ‘To Di For Daily’ podcast, called Middleton an ""integral part of the future of the monarchy.""

""William and Catherine somehow define this really beautiful and hopeful vision of the future,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""You can't recreate it because it's authentic and natural. It is effortless. That is why they are so important to today's monarchy. They inspire people to look forward instead of backwards."""

A U.S. destroyer intercepted ballistic missiles fired by Houthi terrorists at a U.S.-owned container ship in the Red Sea on Wednesday, a U.S. official told Fox News.
The Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired three anti-ship ballistic missiles at the U.S. flagged and U.S. owned M/V Maersk Detroit Commercial Container ship transiting the Gulf of Aden in the Southern Red Sea, a U.S. defense official told Fox News. The missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.
The USS Gravely, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, intercepted two of the missiles while the third splashed down into the sea, the official said.
The U.S. container ship is continuing its transit and, according to initial reports, there were no injuries and no damage to the ship, the official said.

""What I can tell you and what I do know of what happened today was that there were three Houthi missiles fired at two merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea,"" Kirby said. ""One missile missed by something like 200 kilometers. The other two were shot down by a U.S. Navy destroyer.""

Walling suggested that Trump should be covered ""openly and honestly,"" even if the network’s decision makers don’t agree with his rhetoric.
""I would recommend you take his remarks live, and if you feel so inclined, you fact-check or you point out fallacies in what he's saying. But to just say, ‘We're not going to take his remarks live going forward,’ I think it's problematic,"" Walling said. ""I don't think it's a winning strategy for those networks making that decision.""
Radio host Erick Erickson was among the many critics who ridiculed the decision.
""The smugness of MSNBC, which allows on Joy Reid, Al Sharpton, Mehdi Hasan – although, not anymore with him – and others to say they’re not going to air the former President of the United States’ victory speech in Iowa because he may say untrue things,"" Erickson said. ""Have you people watched Joy Reid’s show? Have you listened to Mehdi Hassan, or the other shows on MSNBC?""
Erickson said MSNBC should ""be honest"" and admit they simply didn’t want to offend its progressive audience by airing Trump’s speech.
""It has nothing to do with him and everything to do with your audience,"" Erickson said. ""Ironically, you help Donald Trump by not broadcasting him… it’s dishonest, but it’s also rather silly.""

CNN host Michael Smerconish said on his radio show that MSNBC erred by not airing Trump’s speech.
""I candidly think they made the wrong decision,"" Smerconish said. ""Ignoring a major party candidate, the leading candidate of the Republican Party, right now is not going to make him go away. And, if anything, you’re helping elect him.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S..C., also scolded MSNBC in a post on X.
""MSNBC’s decision not to carry President Trump’s victory speech was based on the idea that they are just interested in the ‘truth’. This network and all other major networks gave breathless coverage to the Russia hoax and have virtually ignored the disaster called the Biden Administration,"" Graham wrote. ""If you’re looking for the truth, I’d find another channel.""
TRUMP STUNS PUNDITS BY 'DEFYING POLITICAL GRAVITY' AFTER IOWA WIN: 'HE'S THE NOMINEE, GET OVER IT'
Washington Free Beacon reporters Drew Holden and Thaleigha Rampersad published a video of ""untrue"" things that have aired on MSNBC to combat the notion that Trump could hurt the network’s brand.
""Maddow's suggestion that MSNBC eschews falsehoods is itself untrue. She and her network have repeatedly broadcast lies and false accusations as news, in many cases about Trump,"" Holden and Rampersad wrote to accompany a video showing MSNBC host suggesting Trump colluded with Russia and other left-wing talking points.
MSNBC wasn’t the only network to object to Trump’s speech, as CNN host Jake Tapper interrupted the former president to accuse him of spouting ""anti-immigrant rhetoric.""
Author and journalist Michael Shellenberger blasted the move as ""madness,"" especially because both networks aired Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ speech.
""Both CNN and MSNBC carried the entirety of the speech by DeSantis, after openly refusing to carry the speech by Trump, even though Trump won a landslide with 51% against DeSantis’ 21%. It’s madness. CNN and MSNBC are flagrantly embracing their role as propagandists,"" Shellenberger wrote. ""What a sign of petulance, cowardice and idiocy to refuse to air the victory speech of the candidate who won a landslide primary and could be the next president.""
MSNBC could get another shot on Tuesday as New Hampshire voters partake in the nation’s first GOP primary of the cycle.
The network didn't reply to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Shelley Long was spotted out in Los Angeles the day after skipping the ""Cheers"" reunion at the 2024 Emmy Awards.
The 74-year-old actress, who starred as the intellectual graduate student-turned-waitress Diane Chambers on the hit sitcom, was seen walking her Chihuahua near her home in Pacific Palisades, California, last Tuesday.

SHELLEY LONG SEEN OUT AND ABOUT AS ‘CHEERS’ CELEBRATES 40TH ANNIVERSARY
The Indiana native wore large black-framed eyeglasses and kept her hands in her pockets during her outing.
Long's rare sighting comes after her absence from last Monday's Emmys, which featured an onstage cast reunion of former ""Cheers"" co-stars Ted Danson, Kelsey Grammer, Rhea Perlman, John Ratzenberger and George Wendt.

During the awards show, the cast appeared in a recreation of the ""Cheers"" bar set to present the Emmys for best directing for a comedy series and best writing in a comedy series, which were both won by the Hulu series ""The Bear.""
""This feels really nice to be here in front of all of you,"" Danson said.
Ratzenberger noted the gathering felt like a ""long overdue class reunion,"" while Grammer added, ""Being together brings back memories of a show that we are all very proud of.""

Woody Harrelson, who played bartender Woody Boyd, was also notably missing from the reunion. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Emmys Executive Producer Jesse Collins explained Harrelson's absence.
""Woody Harrelson couldn’t make ‘Cheers’ because he’s in a play ['Ulster American' in London],"" Collins said. ""So, there were a few people where there were just logistical challenges. But we were lucky to get so many people who were willing to participate.""
The awards show also paid tribute to late ""Cheers"" actress Kirstie Alley, who died of cancer at the age of 71 in December 2022. Alley was honored during the In Memoriaum segment, which also included tributes to Norman Lear, Suzanne Somers, Barbara Walters and André Braugher, among others.

Long starred on ""Cheers"" from 1982 to 1987 before leaving the show after its fifth season to spend more time with her family. During a 2007 appearance on the Australian show ""Where Are They Now,"" Long explained that she also believed that her storylines were becoming repetitive.

""I didn't want to keep doing the same episode over and over again and the same story,"" she said. ""It had been such a fresh and vital experience for me. I didn't want it to become old and stale.""
In 1993, Long returned for the ""Cheers"" finale and earned an Emmy nomination for her final appearance. The actress received five Emmy nominations for her performance in ""Cheers,"" winning once in 1983. She also won Golden Globe Awards in 1982 and 1983.
Long also reprised her role a number of times in the Cheers"" spin-off series ""Frasier,"" which starred Grammer. In 1996, she was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series after appearing in the ""Frasier"" episode ""The Show Where Diane Comes Back.""
In ""Cheers,"" Long's character Diane dated Grammer's Frasier Crane for a year but jilted him at the altar.
During a recent appearance on ""The Kelly Clarkson Show,"" Grammer revealed he would like Long to return as Diane in the Paramount+ ""Frasier"" revival series.

Grammer explained that Frasier's love for Diane was central to his portrayal of the psychiatrist. The actor played Frasier in ""Cheers"" from 1984 to 1993, in ""Frasier"" from 1993 to 2004 and in the 2023 revival.
""When I first got the role, the key to Frasier for me was that he loved her with his whole heart, that he loved with all of his being,"" Grammer told Clarkson. ""And that actually defined who he is.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Florida man suspected in the separate murders of a missing woman and a man at a homeless camp has been captured after two months on the run, authorities said Tuesday.
Enrique Martinez, 26, was found wandering on a sidewalk near Cooley Road and SR 540 in Winter Haven, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd announced at a news conference.
""He was pretty good at avoiding us for a period of time, but our deputies and detectives, who are the very best, never gave up,"" Judd said.
The search for Martinez began after a man identified as Edil Rodriguez was murdered at a homeless camp on Nov. 8, 2023. Those efforts doubled after he was also suspected in the killing of 20-year-old Sierra Hernandez, who was reported missing on Jan. 14 but believed to have gone missing days earlier.

The sheriff said detectives were shocked when they spotted the wanted man ""casually walking"" on the sidewalk just north of Eagle Lake. Martinez then ran into a wooded line to escape.
Judd said deputies and officers with the Winter Haven Police Department set up a perimeter and searched for Martinez with a K-9. Martinez eventually walked out of the wooded area and surrendered peacefully.

Judd described looking in on the suspect as he was sitting in the back of a police car.
""I looked at him, and he said, ‘Hey, sheriff. How you doing?’ I said, ‘Fine, are you tired?’ He says, ‘I gave myself up.’ Well, that's a pretty easy choice when you're surrounded by 100 deputy sheriffs with guns,"" the sheriff said.
Judd said that Martinez has a violent criminal history, which includes 13 felony arrests, 15 misdemeanor arrests and served five years in prison for stabbing an ex-girlfriend in the face.

Kennedy, Jr., caught waves for his birthday with surfing legend Kelly Slater while campaigning in the Aloha State.
A U.S. prosecutor revealed a possible glimpse into Hawaii's underworld on Monday as he outlined the crimes a Honolulu businessman is accused of orchestrating: the kidnapping of a 72-year-old accountant who owed a debt, the release of a toxic chemical into a rival's nightclubs and the killing of his late son's best friend, among them.
Michael Miske Jr. was arrested in 2020, along with seven people whom prosecutors described as associates. But following a series of guilty pleas by the others — including a plea deal signed by his half-brother on Saturday — the trial opened with Miske as the lone defendant.
""The defendant used fear, violence and intimidation to get what he wanted,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney William Akina said in his opening statement. ""What he wanted was money, control and revenge.""
HAWAII MAHUNT FOR FELON OUT ON BAIL ENDS IN FATAL POLICE SHOOTOUT
Miske's attorney, Michael Kennedy, painted a completely different picture of his client.
Miske, 49, wasn't a crime lord, but rather a ""self-made man"" who, despite growing up ""on the wrong side of the tracks,"" successfully built a family business called Kamaʻaina Termite and Pest Control, Kennedy said in his opening statement.
The company saved iconic Hawaii structures and ""cultural treasures,"" including outdoor theater Waikiki Shell, ʻIolani Palace and the Polynesian Cultural Center, Kennedy said. Miske even fumigated a Honolulu concert hall for free after the city couldn't afford the $200,000 estimate, Kennedy said.

Akina alleged that Miske also owned several nightclubs where disputes over bar tabs would be met with physical assault from his ""thugs."" In addition, he made millions selling illegal commercial-grade aerial fireworks on the black market, Akina said.
The businessman also groomed people from his Waimanalo neighborhood to violently rob drug dealers and carry out other orders, the prosecutor said.
Akina said Miske ordered hits on people, and though many were never carried out, at least one was: the 2016 killing of Johnathan Fraser, best friend to Miske's only son, Caleb. Miske had long thought Fraser was a bad influence on Caleb, and blamed Fraser when the friends got into a car crash in 2015 that led to Caleb's death, Akina said.
HAWAII MAN ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER STEALS CAR AT GUNPOINT, DIES AFTER FIREFIGHT WITH POLICE
""There could be only one price to pay for the death of the defendant’s son,"" Akina said. ""A life for a life.""
An indictment alleges that Miske purchased a boat to dump Fraser’s body into the ocean, though the body has never been found.
Kennedy told jurors on Monday that Miske didn't blame Fraser for the crash and had nothing to do with his disappearance.
The people who will be testifying against Miske have something to gain from authorities, Kennedy said, referring to plea deals made by his alleged associates.
""Lies are going to rain down into this courtroom from that stand,"" he said.

Testimony is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
Opening statements proceeded despite a motion filed Sunday night by Miske's defense team. His attorneys argued that a new jury should be selected because Miske's half-brother John Stancil pleaded guilty after a jury had been assembled and sworn and Miske’s daughter-in-law Delia Fabro Miske pleaded guilty after four days of jury selection.
Defense attorney Lynn Panagakos noted that Stancil pleaded guilty early Monday before the courthouse was even open to the public.
U.S. District Chief Judge Derrick Watson denied the motion."
UKES54CVBD_C2P7RW71BYKTA1E,North Korea attempts first flight test of new nuclear-capable cruise missile,By Lawrence Richard Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 7:21am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-attempts-first-flight-test-new-nuclear-capable-cruise-missile,"Fox News correspondent Stephanie Bennett joins 'Fox News Live' to break down recent evidence tying missile fragments in Russian attacks to North Korea.
North Korea conducted its first flight test of a new cruise missile, it said Thursday, as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un looks to expand his military capabilities amid a deepening rift with South Korea and the United States.
According to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, the launch of the Pulhwasal-3-31 missile did not pose a threat to neighbors as it is still in its development phase. The outlet said the missile could eventually carry nuclear weapons.
Tensions in the region have increased in recent months as Kim continues to accelerate his weapons development and provocative threats to the U.S. and its Asian allies. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been continuing their combined military exercises, which Kim condemns.
The reported single launch came a day after the North fired several cruise missiles into waters off its western coast. South Korea’s military said it detected the missiles and that they caused no damage.
NORTH KOREA FIRES SEVERAL CRUISE MISSILES INTO THE SEA AFTER DESTROYING PEACE SYMBOL, SOUTH KOREA SAYS

Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said flight data showed the missiles flew a shorter distance than previous North Korean cruise missile launches. The cruise missile launches were North Korea’s second known launch event of the year after North Korea launched its first solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile on Jan. 14.
The launches are undoubtedly a show of force to place pressure on rivals, but they may also be indicating a problem within North Korea, according to Yang Uk, an analyst at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

Yang said the North is trying to show off its diversifying arsenal of nuclear-capable weapons but these displays of new weapons systems come amid a slowdown in tests of short-range ballistic missiles. This could indicate North Korea is suffering shortages in its personal inventory as it is allegedly sending arms to Russia, Yang said.

U.S. and South Korean officials have accused North Korea of providing artillery shells, missiles and other supplies to Russia for its war in Ukraine. In return, North Korea is gaining much-needed economic assistance and military technology.

New York City experienced a banner year in the fight against rising violent crime, flooding the streets with new teams of police officers despite fierce resistance from law enforcement reform groups.
New York City murder numbers dropped 12% in 2023 compared to the previous year while shootings fell 25%, according to numbers released by the New York City Police Department, with all five boroughs experiencing a decline in shootings.
The good news was publicized in a recent op-ed by the Wall Street Journal, which noted that New York City Mayor Eric Adams has credited the city's more aggressive approach to policing as being responsible for the enhanced safety.

Much of that increased police presence has come from the city's Neighborhood Safety Teams, a program that Adams launched in 2022 to replace plainclothes teams that were disbanded in the city in the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests. Those officers have been credited with seizing thousands of illegal firearms throughout the city in 2023 through stops of pedestrians the officers suspected of being armed and dangerous, the Wall Street Journal report noted.
The officers are required to have a reasonable suspicion before they approach an individual, which could include a tip from a neighbor or directly witnessing aggressive behavior. They also wear body cameras and are required to question every suspect before conducting a pat down.
But the Neighborhood Safety Teams have also faced fierce criticism from some groups, who accuse the officers of disproportionately targeting minority residents.
But Charles ""Cully"" Stimson, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, argued that many communities plagued by crime would welcome an increase in police presence.
CRISIS IN NEW YORK: 94-YEAR-OLD VET STRUGGLES TO MOVE ON AFTER NURSING HOME EVICTS HIM, REPLACED BY MIGRANTS
""They want more police in their communities, they don't want fewer police,"" Stimson told Fox News Digital. ""They want police who look like them, police who they know, police who they trust, but they want the criminals out.""

One such group calling to roll back the Neighborhood Safety Teams in New York is Communities United for Police Reform, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, cited an independent audit of the teams that showed many stops came with no good reason for suspicion and that the data indicated racial bias, with 97% of stopped suspects being Black or Hispanic.
Stimson argued that citing such statistics can be misleading, noting that the demographics of neighborhoods impacted by rising crime are prone to be populated by minorities.
""It's an uncomfortable but basic reality that Blacks commit a disproportionate number of violent crimes and crimes in general. You'll never hear Communities United for Police Reform admit that, but it's true,"" Stimson said. ""The sad reality is that the other side of that coin is that a disproportionate number of murder victims in the inner city are Black men who are killed by Black men.""
CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS
The Wall Street Journal also pushed back against the notion of bias, noting that the 34 special units operate specifically in New York City's most high-crime neighborhoods, which also are disproportionately Black and Hispanic areas of the city.
""The fact that these neighborhoods are 97%, 95% Black, and 97% of the people they stop temporarily are Black or Hispanic, that makes sense,"" Stimson said.
For his part, Adams won his 2021 bid for mayor largely on a public-safety platform and often cites that some of the city's most crime-ridden areas supplied the bulk of his votes. A two-decade veteran of New York City law enforcement himself, Adams celebrated the city's officers after the release of the 2023 numbers.
""Your officers took nearly 6,500 illegal firearms off our streets in 2023,"" Adams said, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Meanwhile, Stimson took issue with groups attempting to reform American policing, noting New York City's new strategy is yet another example of the constant evolution of tactics and police departments across the country are constantly engaged in voluntarily.

UN0VKL6AQZ_KOYURL186COT6TL,Illegal migrants are sleeping in terminals of Boston airport on ‘daily basis’ as crisis overwhelms shelters,By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 12:04pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-migrants-are-sleeping-in-terminals-of-boston-airport-on-daily-basis-as-crisis-overwhelms-shelters,"Fox New contributor and former acting ICE Director Tom Homan explains how the Biden administration could solve the crisis at the border with two policy changes.
Dozens of illegal migrants are lining the floors of Terminal E at Boston Logan Airport with no light at the end of the tunnel as the crisis overwhelms the state’s shelter system.
""We continue to see migrants at the airport on a daily basis,"" Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan told the Boston Herald. ""They come to Logan a number of ways — some fly in, but the majority do not. They also arrive at Logan at all hours.""
People have been sleeping on the floors lining the lower level of international Terminal E, as shown in images captured by CBS News. Mehigan told the Boston Globe that Massport could not provide an estimate of how many people were sheltering in the terminal per day.
Mehigan told the Herald that the airport has provided staff who speak Haitian Creole and Spanish to assist the people taking shelter in the airport. Logan reportedly coordinates with the state to transport people to ""welcome centers,"" which help direct incoming migrants to resources, services and transportation.

""Frankly, what you’ve seen at Logan has been the situation, and this is why I said months ago that we are reaching capacity here,"" Gov. Maura Healey said in response to questions at a press conference Monday.
She noted that ""no incidents"" have occurred involving the situation at the airport despite the volume of people. The governor said Logan has been a ""wonderful partner"" and thanked the staff and state police — who she noted are working their regular shifts — for ""managing the inflow and outflow of folks.""
Healey added that her administration has processed nearly 3,000 work authorizations for people and opened overflow sites and other housing with community partners like United Way. However, she said the state still needs help from the federal government because the crisis is ""not a problem that Massachusetts created.""

""The bottom line here is that we really are reaching, have reached capacity,"" Healey said. ""I just continue to express in the strongest terms possible, that’s why we need action at the federal government. This is not a problem that Massachusetts created. However, it’s a problem that we’re having to deal with right now.""
Massachusetts has a ""right-to-shelter law,"" which entitles migrant families to taxpayer-funded emergency shelter. The Bay State is the only one in the country with a statewide right-to-shelter law, signed into law in 1983 by Gov. Michael Dukakis.
Healy, a Democrat, said in November that she had hoped the crisis would not devolve into homeless people sleeping at Boston's Logan Airport or in emergency rooms.

""The bottom line here is that we really are reaching, have reached capacity,"" Gov. Maura Healey said. (WBZ)
Just three months later, after she announced the state’s shelter system maxed out at 7,500 families, the situation has since devolved to that scenario.
Massachusetts is on the brink. The migrant crisis comes as Texas is in a standoff with the Biden administration over what Gov. Greg Abbott says is its constitutional duty to protect itself against the ""invasion"" at the southern border.

Several Republican governors on Wednesday night, including Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Brian Kemp of Georgia, announced they stood in solidarity with Abbott and the Lone Star State as the Biden administration insists that it defy Texas’ attempts to use razor wire to prevent illegals from crossing the border.
""The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now,"" Abbott said. ""President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.""

UN34V1W2ME_JQCF290NW3C2SK4,Hawaii Democrat introduces bill to ban Trump from ballot,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 11:59am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawaii-democrat-introduces-bill-ban-trump-ballot,"Criminal defense attorney Lexie Rigden discusses the Supreme Court's decision to hear the Colorado ballot ruling case and the impact to the election.
A Democrat-sponsored bill in Hawaii that could ban former President Trump from the ballot for allegedly inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol advanced in the state legislature Monday.
Hawaii state Sen. Karl Rhoads, a Democrat representing Honolulu who frequently criticizes Trump and Republicans over the Jan. 6 riot online, first introduced SB 2392 last week, which aims to ""specify that election ballots issued by the chief election officer or county clerk shall exclude any candidate who is disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; article XVI, section 3 of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii; or another constitutional or statutory provision.""
The bill does not explicitly name Trump, but Maine's Democratic Secretary of State and Colorado's Supreme Court cited the insurrection clause in barring Trump from their state ballots.
The Hawaii proposal also aims to ""prohibit electors of presidential and vice presidential candidates from voting for any presidential or vice presidential nominee who has been disqualified pursuant to Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as determined by any federal court, or as determined by the state supreme court in an election contest"" and also ""seeks to stop those disqualified by a court based on the constitutional amendment from appearing on party ballots for presidential and vice-presidential nominees.""

""The legislature finds that citizens of this State have the right to expect that public servants be people of integrity, and not people who have committed actions that threaten democracy or undermine the vote of the people,"" the bill says. ""Any challenge to the inclusion or exclusion of any candidate on a ballot issued by the chief election officer or clerk shall be in writing and, no later than the fifty-seventh day prior to the general election, shall be filed with the appropriate district court; provided that for any challenge to the inclusion or exclusion of a presidential candidate on a general election ballot, the appropriate district court shall be the district court of the first circuit. The challenge shall provide notice in a summary manner of the grounds that give rise to the complaint. No later than the fifty-fourth day prior to the general election, the district court shall hold a hearing regarding the challenge. The district court shall assess the validity of the complaint and shall issue findings of fact and conclusions of law no later than the fifty-third day prior to the general election. The party filing the challenge shall have the burden to sustain the challenge by a preponderance of the evidence, unless a higher burden is required by constitutional law.""

HALEY ALLIES ADMIT SHE HAS 'STEEPER ROAD AHEAD' FACING TRUMP IN SOUTH CAROLINA
The bill passed its first reading on Monday. Trump's campaign has repeatedly categorized efforts to block him from the ballot as aiming to disenfranchise American voters.
Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, appealed a judge's ruling on Friday that put on hold her decision to remove Trump from the ballot until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a similar case in Colorado. Bellow, a Democrat, said she also wants to ensure Maine’s highest court has the opportunity to weigh in before ballots are counted in the March 5 primaries.

The timelines are tight as Super Tuesday approaches. The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in the Colorado case on Feb. 8, which likely means there would not be enough time to meet statutory deadlines for Bellows to reissue a ruling on Trump's ballot status and for additional appeals to be filed before Election Day.
Lawsuits in Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona and Oregon aiming to block Trump from the 2024 ballot have already been dismissed on procedural grounds, Newsweek reported.

One of the two inmates who escaped from a jail in Arkansas has been captured by law enforcement.
Noah Roush, one of two detainees who fled the county jail in Pine Bluff on Monday, was discovered hiding out in an abandoned house by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
A captain of the sheriff's office found Roush's hiding spot after a local citizen called 911 to report a man who fit the escapee's description.

The other escaped inmate, Jatonia Bryant, is still on the run from police. Authorities describe him as a black male who is 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighing around 145 pounds.
The two suspects escaped from prison on Monday after making a hole in the shower area, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office says.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The mother of an intellectually disabled girl who was allegedly led from school grounds by three male students and sexually assaulted in a Starbucks bathroom and a nearby empty building filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Starbucks, Pittsburgh Public Schools and a property management company of negligence.
The lawsuit alleges that school personnel at Taylor Allderdice High School failed to provide adequate supervision and care of the girl during school hours and during transportation to and from school. It alleges that both the property management company 101 Kappa Drive Associates #1 and Starbucks managers were aware of the increasing crime issues near their businesses and failed to provide security or training for employees on how to respond to and report criminal activities.
""Pittsburgh Public Schools failed to create a safe environment for my client to go to and from school when it knew that she needed one. And Starbucks and Kappa failed to protect my client from the violence of others when they knew their businesses were causing criminal activity to occur. The painful result was her sexual assault,"" said attorney Alec Wright, who represents the girl and her mother in the lawsuit.
PENNSYLVANIA HIGH SCHOOL TRACK COACH ALLEGEDLY HAD SEX WITH STUDENT FOR YEAR: COPS
The lawsuit alleges that the then 15-year-old girl, whose name was withheld in the lawsuit, was led off campus by three male students in October 2022. The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks employees witnessed the male students taking turns entering the bathroom with the girl and did not intervene. The alleged assailants then took her to an empty building managed by Kappa, where the third boy sexually assaulted the girl, according to the lawsuit filed in Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)
At first, the girl was unable to communicate to her mother what happened to her. But days later the mother said she was notified by the school that the girl was found crying at a lunchroom table alone because of a rumor that three boys had sex with her. The mother said she met with school officials who were then notified that the incident occurred at Starbucks, and not at the school as officials initially suspected.
The mother took the girl for a medical exam that she said showed positive signs of sexual assault. She reported the assault to police, but more than a year later police have not filed charges.
A spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety said the case had been closed and that the county district attorney's office had determined it would not pursue charges.
PHILADELPHIA MURDER SUSPECT FACES MORE COLD-CASE SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGES
A message seeking comment was sent to corporate communications for Seattle-based Starbucks. A phone number was not available for Kappa, but The Associated Press left a message with a real estate company that handles rentals at several Kappa properties.
A spokesperson for Pittsburgh Public Schools said the district does not comment on pending litigation.
Pittsburgh Public Schools provides public transportation bus passes to high schoolers who live within 2 miles of their school and to younger students who live within 1.5 mile of their school. At Taylor Allderdice High School, district officials had negotiated with Pittsburgh's public transportation authority to move the public transit bus stop that many students use to the location in front of the Starbucks.
The girl's mother notified school officials that her daughter would need help adjusting to high school and with taking public transportation to school, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit notes the girl's IQ during evaluation was determined to be around 65, and then below 60 on a second test, placing her in the lowest 1% of students intellectually.
However, the lawsuit alleges that during her first months at the high school, the girl was left unsupervised and allowed to either wander the halls or hide in the bathroom during her classes. The tardy and attendance policy was not enforced because of her disabilities, and staff failed to address her leaving class or provide any safety monitors for her during school hours or en route to and from the bus stop, according to the lawsuit.
""It just makes me feel angry to know that there was such little oversight or protection for my daughter. If she leaves in the morning to go to school, then she should return home from school safe,"" the girl’s mother said. ""Taylor Allderdice let her be lured off campus, and Starbucks let her be attacked in its bathrooms. It’s all just so frustrating and disheartening. It’s just very hard to describe.""
The Associated Press does not name victims of sexual assault or abuse unless they come forward publicly. The names of both the girl and her mother were withheld from the lawsuit to protect the girl's identity.
The lawsuit alleges the male teens were given unrestricted access to the girl when they were able to lead her off campus to the Starbucks bus stop, where school officials did not provide any safety monitors during prime transportation hours despite knowing about increased incidents of student-based violence and other negative activities.
PENNSYLVANIA MIDDLE SCHOOL COUNSELOR ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING 14-YEAR-OLD STUDENT
The month before the sexual assault occurred, a large group of students got into a fight at the bus stop. A police officer was injured while trying to break up the fight and police shocked two students with Tasers during the incident.
Owners of businesses in the same building as the Starbucks have reported harassment of customers, a storefront window being broken, students challenging business owners to fights and other issues with drugs and vandalism. At least one business owner has asked the school district to move the bus stop during school board meetings.
The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks and Kappa failed to respond to the widely known issues with crime, violence and mischief by not creating policies or conducting trainings for employees on how to keep themselves or patrons safe, and by not providing security measures like guards during high traffic times.
The lawsuit alleges that Starbucks employees allowed students largely unrestricted access to its bathrooms partly because the students increased the store's sales."

UT64H0VTEC_SFD91GRO683JPOM,Cameroon begins world's first routine malaria vaccine program,Reuters,"Published January 22, 2024 3:15pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/cameroon-begins-worlds-first-routine-malaria-vaccine-program,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The global fight against malaria took a stride forward on Monday as Cameroon started the world's first routine vaccine program against the mosquito-borne disease, although Reuters journalists witnessed few people in clinics receiving the shot.
Around 40 years in the making, the World Health Organization (WHO)-approved RTS,S vaccine developed by British drugmaker GSK is meant to work alongside existing tools such as bed nets to combat malaria, which in Africa kills nearly half a million children under the age of five each year.
After successful trials, including in Ghana and Kenya, Cameroon is the first country to administer doses through a routine program that 19 other countries aim to roll out this year, according to global vaccine alliance Gavi.
WORST CHOLERA OUTBREAK IN 2 DECADES SWEEPS THROUGH ZAMBIA, KILLING MORE THAN 400
About 6.6 million children in these countries are targeted for malaria vaccination through 2024-25.
""For a long time, we have been waiting for a day like this,"" said Mohammed Abdulaziz of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at a joint online briefing with the WHO, Gavi and other organizations.
Caroline Badefona, manager of Cliniques des Anges hospital in Douala, said five girls and one boy aged six months were vaccinated at her hospital on Monday.

""It went very well,"" she said. ""We are proud to have this program in place because it will eradicate malaria in children aged six to 59 months.""
In a health center in the northern Cameroon district of Datcheka, 12 children were vaccinated early on Monday, according to a Reuters reporter.
But health workers in other centers told Reuters that parents had not been adequately informed about the vaccine, and some were afraid to consent to their children receiving it.
Others were not even aware of the start of the campaign.
""The reason I didn't accept is because I wasn't made aware of it - I didn't know it existed,"" said Audrey Stella, a mother who declined to have her child vaccinated at the Japoma District Hospital in Douala.
Disruption linked to the COVID pandemic and other issues have hindered the fight against malaria in recent years with cases rising by around 5 million year-on-year in 2022, according to the WHO.
Overall, more than 30 countries in Africa have expressed interest in introducing the vaccine and fears of a supply squeeze have eased since a second vaccine completed a key regulatory step in December.
Rolling out the second vaccine ""is expected to result in sufficient vaccine supply to meet the high demand and reach millions more children"", the WHO's director of immunization, Kate O'Brien, said at the briefing.
This R21 vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford and the Serum Institute of India, could be launched in May or June, said Gavi's Chief Programme Officer, Aurelia Nguyen.

""Having two vaccines for malaria will help to close the huge gap between demand and supply and could save tens of thousands of young lives, especially in Africa,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, at a meeting of the U.N. body's executive board on Monday.
Some experts have expressed skepticism about the potential impact of the vaccines, saying attention and funding should not be drawn away from the wider fight against the age-old killer and the use of established preventative tools like bed nets.
Health experts at the briefing said the roll-out was accompanied by extensive community out-reach to combat any vaccine hesitancy and emphasize the importance of continuing to use all protective measures alongside the vaccines."

What's Happening?
-U.S. responds to Russian claims over Alaska
-More Republican Senators rally around Trump after New Hampshire
-Biden's new campaign chair previously referred to republicans as ‘f----ers’
Former President Donald Trump and President Biden each declared victory in Tuesday's New Hampshire primaries, making a general election rematch look even more likely.
From record Republican turnout to intra-party criticism, here are the top five moments from the New Hampshire primaries:

1. Haley vows to stay in the fight
Despite her second loss in a row to Trump and polls suggesting the upcoming contests in Nevada and South Carolina — her home state — would produce similar results, Haley vowed to continue campaigning for the Republican nomination.
2. Trump declares himself the unity candidate
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman following his victory, Trump said he was ""very honored"" by the support he received from voters, and declared that the Republican Party was ""very united"" behind his candidacy.
But some political prognosticators indicate that Haley's second-place finish could be a warning sign for Trump.

3. Biden wins New Hampshire via write-in campaign
Biden won his party's primary despite failing to file as a candidate in the state last year, but did so with a massive write-in campaign that saw him carrying around 60% of the vote. But Democratic primary challenger Rep. Dean Phillips isn't standing down.
4. Big-name Republicans turn on Haley
Following Trump's sizable win, more big-name Republicans began calling on Haley to drop out of the race, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
""Looking at the math and the path going forward, I don't see it for Nikki Haley,"" McDaniel told Fox News.
5. Record turnout
The New Hampshire Republican primary saw record turnout on Tuesday despite some reports that low energy among voters would depress the vote.
With approximately 92% of the vote counted, more than 293,000 ballots had been cast compared to just over 101,000 with approximately 88% of the vote counted in the Democrat primary.

UY4OBUL4GR_DSZTOG5KAPJ923A,Iowa secretary of state introduces bill that could limit 14th Amendment ballot challenges against Trump,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 3:49pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iowa-secretary-state-introduces-bill-could-limit-14th-amendment-ballot-challenges-trump,"Former president gives remarks to supporters after his New Hampshire primary win.
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate introduced a bill that reportedly could limit challenges to former President Trump's eligibility for the 2024 ballot.
The legislative proposal comes amid efforts in several states to challenge Trump's eligibility under Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, which prevents individuals from holding office again if they ""have engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against the United States.
""The Iowa Secretary of State’s Office accepts the recognized political parties’ certifications of their candidates for president and vice president in good faith. This is a technical bill that clarifies which objections the objection panel has jurisdiction to consider but does not prevent anyone from taking legal action or pursuing challenges in court,"" Ashley Hunt, a spokesperson for Pate's office, said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Thursday.
Asked directly if the bill could limit challenges to Trump's eligibility under the 14th Amendment, Hunt said the bill would not bar lawsuits in court that aim to block candidates from the ballot. Rather, the bill places restrictions on Iowans who object to the eligibility of presidential and vice presidential candidates through petitioning the state commissioner of elections.
""This bill does not limit someone’s ability from taking legal action or pursuing challenges in court. It simply clarifies the process for the objection panel,"" Hunt wrote.
According to the pre-filed bill’s text, which has been visible on the Iowa state legislature’s website since Jan. 18, Pate’s proposal seeks to limit the grounds for challenging all federal candidates, including those running for president and Congress, to questions about age, residency, citizenship and whether their nominating papers meet all the legal requirements.
HAWAII DEMOCRAT INTRODUCES BILL TO BAN TRUMP FROM BALLOT
In Iowa, political parties must submit a certificate with the names of their presidential and vice presidential candidates to the secretary of state's office 81 days before the general election.
""The bill limits objections to the eligibility of a candidate for a federal office that may be filled with the state commissioner of elections to objections to the legal sufficiency of the nomination petition or certificate of election, or to the residency, age, or citizenship requirements as described in the Constitution of the United States,"" according to the proposal text. ""With respect to nominations for president or vice president of the United States, the bill allows objections only to the legal sufficiency of the certification of nomination. The certificate of nomination shall be presumed valid.""
The bill also removes the requirement for federal candidates to sign a statement that they are aware they are disqualified from holding office if convicted of a felony. Under current state law, all candidates running for office – local, state and federal – must do so. Currently, Trump is facing 91 felony charges spanning four criminal cases.

""It would pretty clearly foreclose any challenge to a presidential candidate for being not qualified under the United States Constitution,"" Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, told the Des Moines Register of the proposal. ""So, it would be designed to foreclose a challenge like those filed in Colorado in Maine.""
Hunt told the Register that current law presumes the paperwork candidates file to run for office is valid and provides limitations to what issues are eligible for objection.
The new bill, she explained, would further clarify Iowa's process for objections.
""This simply extends that same standard to all candidates explicitly,"" Hunt told the newspaper.

""To the best of our knowledge, in 2015, Mr. Trump met the Constitutional requirements to be president and continues to do so,"" Hunt said. ""Mr. Trump has not been convicted of anything that disqualifies him to be president. This bill simply helps clarify the objection process for Iowa.""

""The U.S. Constitution sets eligibility requirements for Congress and POTUS,"" Hunt added. ""This update ensures affidavits comply with those requirements.""

The Colorado Supreme Court, in a split decision, and Maine's Democrat secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, cited the 14th Amendment in barring Trump from the ballot in their respective states for allegedly inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. More recently, a Hawaii Democrat senator introduced a bill that also aimed to block candidates, citing the insurrection clause.

The timelines are tight as Super Tuesday approaches on March 5. The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in the Colorado case on Feb. 8, which likely means there would not be enough time to meet statutory deadlines for Bellows to reissue a ruling on Trump's ballot status and for additional appeals to be filed before Election Day.
Lawsuits in Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona and Oregon aiming to block Trump from the 2024 ballot have already been dismissed on procedural grounds, Newsweek reported.
The Illinois State Board of Elections is also reportedly weighing a challenge to Trump's eligibility.

V206AXFMC5_AV3RZE6W8RJ6K1H,Mandatory University of Wisconsin Law School seminar tells students ‘there are no exceptional White people’,By Nikolas Lanum Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 6:00pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mandatory-university-wisconsin-law-school-seminar-students-no-exceptional-white-people,"Kali Fontanilla, former California high school teacher, discusses the lucrative industry of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) on college campuses.
A mandatory ""re-orientation"" seminar for first-year students at the University of Wisconsin Law School allegedly instructed them to share racial slurs and claimed ""there are no exceptional White people,"" according to reports.
Students were asked before the Friday presentation to review pamphlets, one of which claimed ""colorblindness"" can negate the life experiences, norms and cultural values of people of color.
""By saying we are not different, that you don't see the color, you are also saying you don't see your whiteness. This denies the people of colors' experience of racism and your experience of privilege,"" the pamphlet read.
The two-hour lecture was held by self-described ""social justice educator"" Joey Oteng, who used it as a ""follow-up to the DEI session"" that students attended at the beginning of the fall semester, according to Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Lauren L. Devine.

""Re-orientation is intended to do just that – reorient you now that you have your first semester of law school behind you and a new semester ahead,"" Devine wrote in an email to students. She also told students to review an article on ""28 Common Racist Attitudes and Behaviors"" and finish a ""Race Timeline Worksheet"" prior to the seminar.
Part of ""The 28 Common Racist Attitudes and Behaviors"" article suggests people of color cannot be racist.
""Let's first define racism with this formula: Racism =racial prejudice + systemic, institutional power. To say people of color can be racist, denies the power imbalance inherent in racism,"" the handout said.
Another section of the pre-activity materials claimed White people benefit from racial oppression regardless of their actions, noting that ""there are no exceptional White people.""
Sources who spoke with The Federalist under the condition of anonymity said Oteng used a real-time interactive survey where students were asked to respond to the phrase ""I understand institutional and systemic racism"" on a scale from ""unsure"" to ""confidently.""
The law school told Fox News Digital the session on diversity, equity, and inclusion for first-year law students was held in partial fulfillment of the American Bar Association Standard 303’s requirement that law schools provide education to their students on ""bias, cross-cultural competency, and racism.""
""A core goal of the session was to prompt a conversation and help students develop their critical thinking skills with respect to these topics while engaging in dialogue with each other. The University of Wisconsin Law School has a responsibility to train students to debate and challenge ideas, whether contained within legal briefs, judicial opinions, professional training or in the classroom,"" the school added.

One attendee said many of the activities felt like a ""confessional"" for White law students in the audience.
Students in attendance were also allegedly asked to share ""words, phrases, stereotypes, slurs, words of bias, etc."" that could be associated with minority groups.  When Oteng asked the audience for a slur to describe White people, someone in attendance allegedly described them as ""boring as f—k.""
""When it came to slurs about Black people, Native Americans, Asians and Middle Eastern people, it was a very serious moment. When it got to White people and the derogatory terms used for White people, [Oteng] was implying that it was okay to laugh at White slurs because White people don't have any problems,"" one participant said.

The seminar was later criticized by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty President and General Counsel Rick Eisenberg.
""The student body is being subject to nonsense that ignores the rule of law and true equality in favor of a racialized way of seeing the world,"" he said in a statement.

Brad Wenstrup, chair of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, joins Americas Newsroom to share details from the closed-door interviews with Dr. Fauci on the pandemic origins, response and mandates.
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the organization’s May deadline for getting a global pandemic treaty agreed to prepare for ""Disease X"" is in jeopardy and any notion that the accord would cede national sovereignty is the result of ""fake news, lies, and conspiracy theories.""
WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus complained that ""several outstanding issues"" still needed to be resolved by governments and that time was ""very short"" to find consensus. World leaders and officials had previously committed to a May deadline but Tedros, who goes by his first name, said he fears that the cutoff date is at risk of not being met.
""I must say that I’m concerned that member states may not make that commitment,"" Tedros said in front of the WHO’s executive board in Geneva on Monday.
""A failure to deliver the pandemic agreement and the IHR (International Health Regulations) amendments will be a missed opportunity for which future generations may not forgive us,"" Tedros said.

WHO DIRECTOR CALLS FOR WORLD PANDEMIC TREATY TO PREPARE FOR DISEASE X
The IHR is a legally binding agreement that requires countries – including the U.S. – to conduct surveillance for potential international health threats of all kinds and report those to the WHO in a timely manner.
Tedros told the World Economic Forum last week that COVID-19 was the first Disease X and called on nations to sign up to the treaty so that there can be a collective response should another pandemic strike.
Disease X is a hypothetical ""placeholder"" virus that has not yet been formed, but scientists say it could be 20 times deadlier than COVID-19. It was added to the WHO’s short list of pathogens for research in 2017 that could cause a ""serious international epidemic,"" according to a 2022 WHO press release.
""Over the past two years, the intergovernmental negotiating body and the working group on amendments to the IHR, have been moving toward a common goal: to build a healthier, safer, and more equitable world,"" Tedros said.
""This is our chance – maybe our only chance – to get this done, because we have the momentum.""
Tedros did not mention Disease X by name in the speech, but warned of ""emerging threats"" and said a treaty was urgently needed to strengthen ""pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.""

Tedros argued that by putting the agreement in place, nations would have timely access to critical response products, such as diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
""This is the only way we can make the world safer for our children, and our children’s children – through working together,"" Tedros said. ""It is difficult to overstate the importance and urgency of this work.""
Critics, including Advancing American Freedom (AAF), argue that the legally binding treaty would cede sovereignty to a global organization and that it amounts to a power grab. The AAF is a non-profit advocacy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence.
""The [WHO] proposal to consolidate power and erode the United States of America of its sovereignty through the WHO Pandemic Preparedness Treaty is untenable and raises serious and significant questions regarding America’s independence of action and ability to respond to global pandemics,"" a letter published by the AAF on Tuesday reads.
Furthermore, the AAF points out that the treaty — ostensibly intended to save lives through international prioritization of the best medical practices — emphasizes race and ""equity"" before almost every other value in its ""general principles and approaches.""

""It presents ‘equity’ as its third general principle, ahead of responsibility, transparency, accountability, and science and evidence – principles that are magnitudes more important than ‘equity’ during a global pandemic,"" the letter reads.
Tedros, in his Monday speech, dismissed suggestions the pact would result in countries losing sovereignty.
""There are those who claim that the pandemic agreement and IHR will cede sovereignty to WHO and give the WHO Secretariat the power to impose lockdowns or vaccine mandates on countries. You know this is fake news, lies, and conspiracy theories,"" Tedros said.
""These claims are completely false. You know that the agreement will give WHO no such powers, because you are writing it.""

V32NEHBDUV_GZDDKNVIWWSTAZQ,'Monster' who fathered his daughter's 7 children in captivity smirks during prison move in push for freedom,By Audrey Conklin Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 12:14pm EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/josef-fritzl-fathered-daughters-7-children-captivity-smirks-prison-move-push-freedom,"Recently released court records show that prior to her disappearance in Washington, Oakley Carlson had been kept in a locked ""cell"" underneath the stairs.
Josef Fritzl, an Austrian man who held his daughter captive in his basement as a sex slave for 24 years, fathering seven of her children, was seen smirking Thursday after a court ruled that he could be transferred from a psychiatric ward to a regular prison.
Fritzl's move to a regular prison reportedly marks the first step of his parole bid. Austrian law allows prisoners sentenced to life in prison to apply for parole after serving 15 years, which Fritzl will mark in March, since he was initially sentenced in 2009.
""In summary, the court has come to the conclusion that it is indeed the case that he is no longer dangerous,"" Fritzl's lawyer Astrid Wagner told The Associated Press.
Fritzl reportedly has dementia, and a psychiatric evaluation suggested that he does not pose any future threats to the public. Thursday's court decision overturned a 2022 ruling rejecting Fritzl's request to be moved to a regular prison.

(News Licensing/Mega)
Dubbed the ""monster of Amstetten,"" Fritzl kidnapped his own 18-year-old daughter, Elisabeth, in 1984 and kept her locked in a sound-proof basement in their Amstetten home, where he fathered seven of her children over more than two decades.
She was found in 2008 after 24 years of captivity and brutal abuse in the windowless basement. Elisabeth's mother was apparently oblivious to her daughter's captivity in her own home, according to Austrian authorities.

When asked about her whereabouts, Fritzl would reportedly say she had run away. In 2008, authorities charged Fritzl with incest, rape, coercion, false imprisonment, enslavement and negligent homicide after he had killed one of the sons he had fathered with his captive daughter soon after the baby was born.
The court agreed to move Fritzl into a regular prison upon the condition that he undergo psychotherapy and psychiatric evaluations over a 10-year probation period, the Austria Press Agency reported.
CELLAR WHERE JOSEF FRITZL HELD DAUGHTER AND FATHERED HER CHILDREN TO BE FILLED WITH CEMENT
Josef Fritzl, who imprisoned his daughter in a cellar for over 24 years and fathered seven children with her, is escorted back to a prison after his hearing at the regional court in Krems an der Donau, Austria, on January 25, 2024. The reginal court in Krems, some 50 miles northwest of Vienna, approved the application of Fritzl to be transferred out of the jail he is currently in for the mentally ill who pose a high degree of danger, to a regular prison. Fritzl, now 88, was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 for the murder by neglect of a newborn baby he fathered with his daughter Elisabeth while holding her in the purpose-built basement of his house.

In a 2009 statement, the St. Poelten provincial prosecutors’ office said that Fritzl had ""forced Elisabeth into slave-like conditions . . . shut her away in the cellar and made her totally dependent on him, forcing her into sexual acts and treating her as if she was his own property,"" according to Reuters.

Byrne Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 12:02am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/this-day-history-jan-24-2003-department-homeland-security-established-cabinet,"Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, says the power of the purse is the key tool in impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas on 'Your World.'
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a far-reaching federal response to the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, on U.S. soil, began operation as a new Cabinet-level agency on this day in history, Jan. 24, 2003.
""Our duties are wide-ranging and our goal is clear — keeping America safe,"" the department states online of its mission.
The creation of DHS enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support amid the fear that followed the 9/11 attacks.
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 23, 1957, WHAM-O PRODUCES FIRST FRISBEES, RESHAPING LEISURE, SPORT
It has engendered widespread criticism in recent years from across the political spectrum for giving a bloated federal agency the ability to pry into the lives of everyday Americans.
In particular, DHS has been found to be at the center of the Biden administration's alleged collusion with tech giants to censor free speech in recent years.

At the same time DHS was allegedly working to censor everyday Americans, it brazenly shirked its most basic security responsibility: protecting the U.S. border.
Calls have grown in recent months to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas amid the department's increasing abuses and ineffectiveness.
""A mistake made in panic would be best fixed by starting over."" — The Brennan Center
DHS is now a bureaucratic behemoth with more than 240,000 employees and a fiscal year 2023 budget of $97 billion — greater than the annual budget of 42 states.
SHOULD SECRETARY MAYORKAS BE FIRED? HEAR WHAT THIS BORDER TOWN SAYS
A frightened nation called for the creation of an umbrella security agency in the aftermath of 9/11.
""We've learned that vast oceans no longer protect us from the dangers of a new era,"" President George W. Bush said on Jan. 24, 2003, as he led a swearing-in ceremony for Tom Ridge as the first secretary of Homeland Security.

""This government has a responsibility to confront the threat of terror wherever it is found.""
An Office of Homeland Security was created within the White House on Oct. 8, 2001, just four weeks after the 9/11 attacks savagely killed nearly 3,000 people in New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania.
""With the passage of the Homeland Security Act by Congress in November 2002, the Department of Homeland Security formally came into being as a stand-alone, cabinet-level department to further coordinate and unify national homeland security efforts,"" DHS states in its online history.
Ridge, the governor of Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, first took over Homeland Security leadership duties in an advisory role on Sept. 20, 2001.
He led DHS until Feb. 1, 2005.
""We've learned that vast oceans no longer protect us from the dangers of a new era."" — President George W. Bush
The department combined 22 different federal departments and agencies into a unified organization to better coordinate responses to threats and attacks.
It became the 15th executive department under the Executive Office. It is the third largest among them.
The Homeland Security Act of November 2002 turned the White House office into the Cabinet-level department known today.

The act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support: a 295-132 vote in the House and a vote of 90-9 in the Senate.
President Bush signed it into law on Nov. 25.
The Homeland Security Act was one in a long list of bipartisan legislative victories for the Bush administration in the aftermath of 9/11.
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SUED FOR WITHHOLDING DOCS DETAILING PROFESSOR'S ALLEGED ROLE IN DHS DISINFO CAMPAIGN
The unified response to the terror attacks contradicts the way media and political opponents soon portrayed President Bush as a cowboy ""going it alone"" — to cite one incessant criticism that grew increasingly savage in the years that followed.
The Iraq War Resolution, for example, passed 296-133 in the House and 77-23 in the Senate.
Then-Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Joe Biden, D-Delaware, all voted in favor of both the Homeland Security Act and the Iraq War Resolution, before becoming vocal critics of the Bush administration.
The Homeland Security Act passed 295-132 in the House and 90-9 in the Senate.
Their dissent from the unity of 9/11 quickly devolved into the deep political divide the nation knows today.
Opposition to the Homeland Security Act that did not exist in 2002 has grown more vocal in recent years.
""Perhaps the most tangible and enduring result of the 9/11 attacks is a large, beleaguered and ill-begotten bureaucracy, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,"" former White House insider Richard A. Clarke wrote for the Brennan Center in 2021.

V6JLZAPBJ4_0LJ9EL7FZFTCCPD,Why DeSantis canceling Sunday shows (including mine) led to his quitting the race,By Howard Kurtz Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 3:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/why-desantis-canceling-sunday-shows-including-mine-led-quitting-race,"Trump censorship, Iowa Caucus, 2024 election
When Ron DeSantis’ campaign press secretary called me on Saturday night to cancel our ""Media Buzz"" interview for the next morning, I had no idea it would trigger a sequence of events that would lead to him dropping out less than 24 hours later.
I was disappointed, and somewhat annoyed, because we had gone to considerable lengths to accommodate the Florida governor.
But it was explained to me that DeSantis was dropping all his Sunday show interviews (including ""Meet the Press"" and ""State of the Union"") so the next morning he could fly to New Hampshire, where he was mired in single digits, for a last stand before Tuesday’s primary.
And I thought to myself, of course he’s got to do what’s best for his campaign. No candidate can, or should, put the media first. Shaking hands with actual voters takes precedence.
BRET BAIER: WORDS BETWEEN TRUMP AND HALEY WILL LIKELY GET ‘UGLIER’
DeSantis suspended his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, and endorsed Trump. (DeSantis 2024)
I tweeted that the governor had canceled our interview, since we had touted it, and figured that was that. I had no clue how his decision would blow up into the day’s top story.
""DeSANTIS DOOMED,"" screamed the banner headline on Drudge.
Was blowing off several Sunday programs really a seismic event? Would the average voter care, as opposed to the self-absorbed media community?
TRUMP ‘VERY HONORED’ BY DESANTIS ENDORSEMENT AFTER FLORIDA GOVERNOR SUSPENDS PRESIDENTIAL RUN
But DeSantis never took off for New Hampshire yesterday morning. And that led me to believe the whole thing had been a head fake.
Here’s what knowledgeable sources say actually happened. The plan was to go to New Hampshire when the DeSantis spokesman was apologetically canceling those interviews with me and others.

But the next morning, with the governor back in Florida, he held a series of conversations with his family and top staff members. A consensus was gradually reached that, as so many pundits had said, DeSantis had no path to victory. It was over. DeSantis started notifying his top donors. Trump had predicted his exit in an interview, that I aired, with Fox’s Bret Baier.
A couple of hours later, DeSantis posted a video saying ""we prayed and deliberated"" on the decision to get out. He said ""a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" and while he’s had ""disagreements"" with the former president, ""he has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear.""
TRUMP TALKS 2024 WITH BRET BAIER, SAYS BIDEN IS ‘VERY DANGEROUS’ AND ‘CAN’T PUT TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER’
That, in case you were wondering, is a clear shot at Nikki Haley. After debates in which they called each other liars, they can’t stand each other. And DeSantis had pledged to back the nominee.
Ironically, his bailing out could help Haley a bit in New Hampshire now that it’s a two-person race.
The former South Carolina governor, pressed by CNN’s Dana Bash as to whether she would eventually back Trump, deflected by saying ""I’m going to finish this so Joe Biden and Donald Trump aren’t an issue at all.""
After months of pummeling the man the candidate called DeSanctimonious, the Trump campaign said ""we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis."" Trump’s two top campaign officials, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, put out a memo titled ""Nikki Haley Must Win in New Hampshire. Just Listen to Her Own Supporters,"" with lots of quotes.""

Now there’s little question that DeSantis and his campaign made many mistakes, somehow blowing through $130 million or so with little to show for it. There was overspending, endless resets and shakeups, and a perpetual tug of war with his Never Back Down Super PAC. Toward the end, some days were managed by the campaign and others by the PAC.
Perhaps the biggest mistake, and I told DeSantis this in a previous Fox interview, was staying in the conservative cocoon too long. From the moment he got in the race, he should have been making the mainstream media rounds, rather than waiting until the last month or two. By that time, DeSantis was way down in the polls.
And he finally acknowledged in a Hugh Hewitt radio interview that he regrets that decision and should have been talking to CNN, MSNBC and other outlets far earlier.

DeSantis was also very restrained in his criticism of Trump, a little tougher toward the end, but that made media analysts wonder how he could beat the front-runner while pulling his punches.
DeSantis worked his butt off in Iowa, finishing a distant second, but it was too little too late.

VBNTX1IS1L_POZZBDZ0YMG1L4H,Taiwan's elections were a big success. Just ask Xi,By Zack Cooper Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 12:30pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/taiwans-elections-big-success-ask-xi,"The Federalist senior contributor Helen Raleigh breaks down the significance of Taiwan’s election amid China tensions.
The people of Taiwan elected Lai Ching-te as president earlier this month, giving the Democratic Progressive Party another four years in control of Taiwan’s executive branch. Many of the headlines about this result focused on China’s response. But observers should take a moment to appreciate both Taiwan’s successful exercise of democracy and the smart messaging from officials in Taipei and Washington before, during, and after the elections.
Taiwanese and American leaders played election night wisely. Lai Ching-te struck exactly the right tone in his victory speech. He steadfastly committed to ""maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" but also offered to ""pursue exchanges and cooperation with China."" This was hardly the flamethrowing language of which Chinese officials have accused Lai. If anything, his comments signaled a willingness to chart a new path for cross-Strait relations (even if remains unlikely that Beijing will reciprocate).
Before the election, officials back in Washington emphasized that they supported Taiwan’s democratic processes and took no position on Taiwan’s choice of leaders. A White House staffer noted that ""regardless of whom is elected, our policy toward Taiwan will remain the same."" To reinforce this point, a bipartisan group of former officials landed in Taipei to congratulate the president-elect and also meet with other political leaders who had contested the election. After all, Taiwan’s Nationalist Party (KMT) and Taiwan People’s Party will remain important political actors in the years ahead as they together account for a majority in Taiwan’s legislature.
WHAT TAIWAN'S ELECTION TELLS US ABOUT CHINA AND 2024
That is not to say that everything went exactly according to plan. President Joe Biden, who has said four times that he would defend Taiwan, only stated after the election that ""we do not support independence."" Biden’s statement was consistent with administration policy, but this is only one piece of a larger puzzle. It was important therefore that his administration had already put out clear talking points that placed this remark in a broader context.
The basic bargain that American leaders must embrace is making clear that the United States intends to uphold deterrence to ""maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" yet ""does not take a position on the ultimate resolution of cross-Strait differences, provided they are resolved peacefully."" This is a fine line to walk, but it is the right message for China, Taiwan, and the rest of the world. By getting out ahead of the election with a clear message, officials avoided Biden’s remarks distracting too much from the successful exercise of democracy in Taiwan.

Unfortunately, while Taiwan and the United States avoided steps that would increase cross-Strait tensions, China sought to increase the pressure on Taiwan. Beijing reportedly offered $100 million to Nauru in order to peel the island nation away from the list of Taiwan’s dozen remaining diplomatic allies. American and Taiwanese leaders will have to be on the lookout for additional Chinese steps, such as conducting military exercises or putting on more economic pressure.
The fact that China pulled out its usual playbook of pressure tactics on Taiwan, despite Lai’s restrained victory speech, only highlights the failure of its recent policies. Chinese leaders can continue to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, threaten it militarily, and coerce it economically. But these policies have not brought about the political changes that Chinese leaders seek in Taiwan – instead, they have likely inhibited them. Continuing to do the same thing and hoping for different results is not a recipe for success.

With the election over, attention now turns to Lai’s inauguration in four months on May 20. China has reacted badly to a number of recent inauguration speeches, including those of Taiwan’s current president, Tsai Ing-wen. As a result, experts will be alert to this date as the next potential hurdle that all sides will have to manage responsibly to get through 2024 without another cross-Strait crisis.
As we look forward to Lai Ching-te’s inauguration we should not lose sight of the fact that Taipei and Washington have just shown that they can be good stewards of cross-Strait relations. The year ahead will contain many challenges, but at least events earlier this month proved to be a dog that didn’t bark.

Andrew Cuomo criticized President Biden on the migrant crisis following the expiration of the Title 42 border policy on Thursday.
Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo subjected at least 13 female state employees to a ""sexually hostile work environment,"" according to a settlement agreement reached between the Justice Department and New York State Executive Chamber.
The agreement resolves claims of sexual harassment and retaliation against Cuomo, a Democrat, according to a DOJ release on Friday.
The nine-page agreement said Cuomo subjected the female employees to unwelcome, non-consensual sexual contact, ""ogling"" and gender-based nicknames. His senior staff was aware of the then-governor's behavior and retaliated against four women,"" the settlement states.

""The Executive Chamber’s response was designed only to protect Cuomo from further accusations, rather than to protect employees from sexual harassment,"" the settlement states.
In a statement, Cuomo's attorney, Rita Glavin, said he didn't harass anyone and that the DOJ investigation was based on a ""deeply flawed, inaccurate, biased, and misleading report"" by New York State Attorney General Letitia James.
""This is nothing more than a political settlement with no investigation,"" Glavin said.
Cuomo is suing James for documents related to her 2021 investigation into alleged sexual harassment that led to his resignation in August 2021 following her bombshell report of his alleged misdeeds.

In a separate statement, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said the DOJ's investigation ""isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.""
Mariann Wang, an attorney for two women who alleged Cuomo harassed them, said: ""We are pleased the US Attorney’s office and the Executive Chamber have taken serious steps to ensure nothing like the abuse Cuomo engaged in will happen again.""
""We hope these measures have real impact and prevent the kind of repeated abuse of power that resulted in so much harm to so many women,"" she added.
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, criticized Cuomo and his denial of the sexual harassment allegations.
""While Cuomo and his deranged sycophant enforcers are desperately trying to resurrect and rewrite their heinous legacy of lies, innocent lives lost, and rampant abuse, even the DOJ confirms that Andrew Cuomo is a corrupt criminal who illegally harassed women and retaliated against them while Governor.""

Under the terms of the settlement, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office will create a new process for complaints against senior officials and will have to create an ""anti-retaliation monitoring policy.""

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., teased a potential third-party presidential bid after Super Tuesday March 5.
""Super Tuesday pretty much confirms whatever is going to happen, what we believe will happen, and we'll see where we go from there,"" Manchin told reporters Tuesday, the day of the New Hampshire primary.
""But people are looking for options, and we're going to be looking at that, too. Whether it's me or whoever it may be, I think there's going to be options available if it goes down the way it's going down.""
MANCHIN ON 2024 PROSPECTS: ‘I'D NEVER BE A SPOILER’

Manchin announced he would not seek re-election for his Senate seat last year, creating speculation about whether he'd make a bid in the 2024 presidential race. Manchin, a Democrat, started a nationwide campaign called ""Americans Together,"" aiming to unite the country's moderate voters away from the ""extremes"" of the left and right.
""We stand against extremism in politics. It has taken over our political system and taken away our voice,"" the Americans Together campaign website states. ""As proud Americans, we agree on more than we disagree. We demand that our politicians put country before party to get things done. Enough is enough.""

Manchin also told reporters he thinks former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley should stay in the race despite a growing choir of GOP lawmakers calling on her to drop out and unite the party behind former President Donald Trump.
Over the weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.
""I cannot believe the other ones bowled over the way they did. I just can't believe it because it's hard for me to fathom that. The country is divided. We don't need to be divided anymore,"" Manchin said Tuesday.

Creating even more speculation that he may announce a run was his return to the New Hampshire Institute of Politics Jan. 12 to headline Politics and Eggs, a must stop for potential and current presidential contenders.
Manchin has plenty of fellow Democrats terrified the moderate from West Virginia will unintentionally hand the White House over to Trump if he runs.
But Manchin dismisses such warnings, rejecting claims from fellow Democrats that a third-party run would hurt President Biden's chances of re-election in a likely rematch next year with Trump, who remains the commanding frontrunner for the GOP nomination.
""I would never be a spoiler for anybody, and I don't agree with … the analysis that they've come up with,"" Manchin told Fox News' host Brett Baier on ""Special Report"" in November.

Ex-MSNBC host Keith Olbermann and CNN host Abby Phillip had an unusually sharp exchange Wednesday after Phillip said ""nobody"" wants President Biden or former President Trump ahead of a likely 2024 rematch.
Phillip was bashed online by some pro-Biden commentators for her comments, and the far-left Olbermann was particularly incensed.
""CNN has to address the reality that [Phillip] has been an absolute disaster and that this foot-in-mouth editorial is the first thing she's gotten noticed for since her show debuted,"" Olbermann wrote.

""As Nikki Haley put it — and I think it's actually such a smart way to put it — I think the first party to let go of their 80-year-old might be the victor, but who's going to be the one to move first?"" Phillip said Tuesday on CNN. ""I think that's where we are as a country and that's why this is kind of an intractable problem.""
""Nobody wants Trump, nobody wants Biden, but nobody wants to be the first to walk away from either [candidate],"" she added of the two parties.
Phillip shot back at Olbermann, who left MSNBC in 2011.
""Or, you can come to terms with the reality of your irrelevance and stop being a nasty social media troll,"" Phillip told Olbermann. ""But that’s entirely up to you.""
Another commentator, Joanne Carducci, torched Phillip for her comments.
""You’re a journalist — and you said that the reality is that ‘nobody’ wants Biden? Nobody? What’s your metric for defining 'nobody'? Because I know a great many people who do in fact want Biden,"" Carducci, who posts under the handle ""@JoJoFromJerz,"" wrote.
""And if you’re going to throw polling at me I will counter with the fact that any percentage of people who favor Biden disputes your ridiculous claim. Why can’t you be held accountable for your words?"" Carducci added.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., got into a heated exchange with FBI Director Christopher Wray over the infamous FBI memo that categorized certain Catholics as potential domestic terrorists.
FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is introducing a bill — called the Ending DHS Funding for Liberal Propaganda Act — that would slash Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant funding from going toward entities that discriminate against conservative viewpoints.
""The Biden Administration has time and again demonstrated its willingness to weaponize its power against conservatives,"" Hawley told Fox News Digital. ""My bill simply bars Secretary Mayorkas from funneling taxpayer dollars to programs dedicated to targeting this Administration’s political opponents.""
According to the bill's text, the legislation would bar taxpayer dollars from going toward the development of ""any programming relating to countering narratives or views on political topics, including COVID-19, vaccination, media bias, immigration, and crime.""

Last year, the Biden administration doled out taxpayer money through an anti-terrorism grant initiative to a university program that has explicitly lumped the Republican Party, as well as Christian and conservative groups, into the same category as the Nazis, according to documents shared exclusively with Fox News Digital at the time.
The Media Research Center (MRC), a conservative watchdog group, obtained documents through Freedom of Information Act requests showing a DHS program meant to fight terrorism is funding a group whose work has explicitly targeted the American political right. The MRC outlined its findings in a report, arguing what the group found warrants criminal prosecution.

Another example cited by Hawley includes a grant to the University of Rhode Island's Media Education Lab, funded through the administration's Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program, to create ""counter-propaganda"" against conservative viewpoints, the Daily Wire reported this month.
The $700,000 grant was used to address ""propaganda and misinformation concerning topics including immigration, racial justice, the coronavirus, and vaccination"" and ""build on top of concerns about so-called ‘fake news’ and ‘cancel culture.’""
""This is an outrageous use of federal funds and abuse of power,"" Hawley wrote in a letter to Mayorkas last week. ""All these funds should be clawed back by the federal government immediately, and anyone involved in making this grant should be fired.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a DHS spokesperson said the department ""does not profile, target, or discriminate against any individual or organization for exercising their constitutional rights. Our mission is to safeguard the American people and when individual expression is connected to an intent to commit violent acts, we are obligated to take action. We are committed to respecting and protecting Americans’ freedom of speech, civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy.""

VLOYG32G1H_5XUJDH194L1NQ50,Cher accused of 'abusive behavior' in conservatorship battle over son Elijah Blue's estate,By Tracy Wright Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 6:34pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cher-accused-abusive-behavior-conservatorship-battle-son-elijah-blues-estate,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Cher's son, Elijah Blue Allman, claimed in court documents filed Tuesday that he's ""fully capable"" of managing his own obligations despite his mother's conservatorship petition.
In documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Allman filed an opposition to Cher's proposed court order, and said that since the initial hearing earlier this month, he's refrained from the use of illicit substances that ""have historically caused the incidents that have given rise to my mother's concern.""
Elijah and his estranged wife Marieangela King are now on the path toward reconciliation, and King claimed in her own declaration that Cher is ""categorically unfit to serve as conservator"" and to have ""witnessed and experienced abusive behavior coming mostly from Elijah's mother.""

Allman is the son of Cher and late musician Gregg Allman. Cher married Gregg Allman days after her divorce from Sonny Bono in 1975.
Cher argued in the initial conservatorship petition, ""Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from a trust established by his father for his benefit, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues, Petitioner is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will immediately be spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself, and putting Elijah’s life at risk.""
CHER FILES FOR CONSERVATORSHIP OF SON, CLAIMS ELIJAH BLUE ALLMAN'S LIFE IS ‘AT RISK’
Documents stated that Cher had worked ""tirelessly"" to help Elijah get ""into treatment."" She also claimed that King was ""not supportive"" of his recovery and was actively working against keeping Elijah from ""getting clean and sober.""
King filed a declaration Tuesday stating that Cher used her ""wealth, fame, and power to cut me out from any decisionmaking"" regarding the process of helping Elijah with his recovery process as he sought assistance with mental health and addiction treatment.

She claimed, ""I was either not told of his whereabouts or the facilities to which he was (in my view forcibly) admitted or told after he was admitted.""
King said that Elijah was at one point ""brought to Mexico"" for ""holisitic alternative therapy,"" but upon arrival was told he ""could not leave."" She attempted to rescue her husband ""from the captivity his mother arranged,"" but was not allowed on the property, according to documents.
""With the help of the United States and Mexican governments, on December 15, 2023 – two months after Elijah was held captive - the Mexican federal agents escorted Elijah out of the makeshift prison-type facility known as the ‘Baja Rehab’ where he was being held against his will,"" King claimed.
Cher claimed that Elijah was suffering from ""severe mental health and substance abuse issues."" (Ron Davis)
She noted that Elijah has since attended AA meetings and maintains a sober lifestyle. For her part, she's supporting her husband by reading the ""12 Steps and the Alcoholics Anonymous"" books.

""I am also learning about what the sober community call ‘triggers.’ I believe that people in Elijah’s family are emotional triggers for him,"" she claimed. ""I have witnessed and experienced abusive behavior coming mostly from Elijah’s mother – the petitioner herein - but also from his siblings - Chaz and Devon - and (of course) Ms. Ruiz (Cher's personal assistant.)""
Elijah also noted, ""There was no emergency giving rise to a conservatorship at the last hearing and there is certainly none now. More than two weeks have passed since the last hearing, and I’ve continued to take steps to secure my property, meet my obligations, and resist the temptations that have caused me harm in the past,"" Elijah noted in his own objection.
""I have been living a sober life, reconciling with my spouse, paying my bills, and paying attorneys to secure my ability to maintain independent of my mother’s control. I remain free of illicit substances, capable of and committed to managing the money I receive quarterly from the trust left by my late father.""

VNPHC0WAPI_CO5BLI2Z086RG8K,Squatter pirates flushed from vacation spot as authorities crack down on ‘disgusting’ water pollution,By Emma Colton Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/squatter-pirates-flushed-vacation-spot-authorities-crack-down-disgusting-water-pollution,"The Martin County Sheriff’s Office is working to remove derelict boats off its coast, which have increasingly been targeted by squatters.
Vagrants in South Florida this winter are increasingly moving aboard derelict boats sitting along the coast, in a new squatter ""phenomenon"" that only surfaced for the local sheriff’s office in the last year, Fox News Digital has learned.
""This is a 2023 epiphany. We have had homeless, vagrant population here in Martin County for quite some time. Not a large one, but we have had people that are transient moving through. And we've had the derelict vessel issue. These were two separate problems,"" Chief Deputy John Budensiek told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this week.
""But as our marine deputy started citing, tagging and removing these vessels, they learned last year that a lot of these vessels were inhabited by vagrants,"" he continued.
Late last year, local media began reporting on the increases in vagrants moving into derelict boats and how the Martin County Sheriff’s Office was working to remove the boats and squatters, or bring some of the derelict boats up to code. Derelict boats are defined as vessels found in waterways with at least two violations, which can range from not having a motor to leaking fuel. Dumping derelict boats is a state crime that could lead to jail time or fines.

Martin County is located in South Florida on the state’s eastern coast, roughly 40 miles north of Palm Beach. Budensiek explained to Fox News Digital that the area is a hot spot for boaters, fisherman and tourists, with many sail boats traveling from the area to the Bahamas and back.

""One of the byproducts of having a lot of vessels in our area, is some of these vessels tend to get rundown hard and become inoperable. And because they become an operable, some of these owners will abandon them or they'll sell them to someone who doesn't re-register the vessel. Those people in turn, stay on these boats or run these vessels until they are completely unusable. And they sink or they leak fuel, if they have the capacity to carry fuel, or they leak human waste and they become a real danger to us environmentally,"" he said.
""Unfortunately with South Florida, vagrants come from the northern communities where it's cold this time of year down here.""
Though derelict boats have long been an issue in the area, the deputy chief said that in the last year, the number of derelict boats has only increased. He said that as 2023 drew to a close, the sheriff’s office tallied at least 50 boats that were abandoned in the last year, all of them consequently cited by authorities. Twenty-nine of the 50 boats were removed and destroyed, while the remainder were brought into compliance.

Budensiek clarified that the individuals squatting on the boats are overwhelmingly not homeless people who are working to find jobs and get off the streets. Instead, they are described by the deputy chief as vagrants, who are often people addicted to drugs, who suffer from mental illness and are not making attempts to get out of squalor.
""The vagrant population as a whole seems to be transient. Unfortunately with South Florida, vagrants come from the northern communities where it's cold this time of year down here. We get an influx of them and we do our best, but they have rights ... to do certain things. So we want them to succeed, but we don't want them to come and ruin the quality of life for people that are working hard and paying taxes and trying to keep, especially in this case, our waterways safe and clean,"" he said.
Differentiating a rundown boat that is in compliance from a derelict boat inhabited by squatters, however, is a difficult task, Budensiek explained.

""It's hard to differentiate. There's a lot of vessels that are functional that people living on, that you and I may not stay on, but they are inhabitable,"" he said.
SQUATTERS TURNING FLORIDA NEIGHBORHOOD INTO 'NIGHTMARE' AS COPS LEFT 'HANDCUFFED': REPORT
The sheriff’s office is on a mission to dispose of the derelict boats, or bring them up to code, and works in conjunction with the U.S. Coast Guard to test boats anchored outside the area’s water channels to see if they are up to code.
Chief Deputy John Budensiek, of the Martin County Sheriff's Office, speaks to Fox News Digital. (Fox News Digital )
""We're going around and testing these boats that are anchored to just outside of our channels, and testing means going and making sure that their lighting functions, so you can see them at night if you're trying to move through our waterways,"" he said.
One sure-fire tell if a boat is derelict, Budensiek said, is testing if a vessel is leaking sewage into the water.
SQUATTERS TURNING FLORIDA NEIGHBORHOOD INTO 'NIGHTMARE' AS COPS LEFT 'HANDCUFFED': REPORT
""Really what's of concern us environmentally is most of them don't have functional bathrooms. So what we find happening here in our county, we have these vagrants that are squatting on the boats, and using the facilities. And the facilities within the boat are just draining right into our estuaries, right into our ocean and our rivers here,"" he said.
""Environmentally, it's a disgusting problem that we're dealing with, and we are doing everything we can to identify who these people are, which vessels they are, cite them, remove them and get them off of our beaches, off of our shores,"" he said.
Authorities drop dye into suspected derelict boats' toilets, to see if it leaks into the water, he explained.
""They're also testing them with dye ... They're running this dye through the toilet system in the boats. And if the dye comes out in the water, then we know that that boat is not sound and is in fact leaking sewage into our estuary,"" he said.
Reports of people squatting in homes across the U.S. have increased since the pandemic, including in Florida, though Budensiek said that issue has not affected his community as it has others. Instead, the office is dealing with boat squatters as well as people moving to Martin County in RVs.
SQUATTERS TAKE OVER FLORIDA ‘METH ISLAND,’ BUILD ELABORATE TREE HOUSE AND INSTALL TRAMPOLINE
""We have not, we've only had a few cases of that,"" he said when asked if typical squatting issues on land have increased in recent months.""But what we have had here is individuals coming into our county with RVs. Again, it's kind of the same thing we're dealing with with these vessels, where they stay in the RV until the RV is not functional anymore. Then they leave it on the side of the road,"" he said, adding that squatters taking over derelict boats is a ""new phenomenon.""
Removing and destroying the derelict boats comes at a hefty price: anywhere between $7,000 and $40,000. The funds paying for the removals aren’t taken from the resident’s tax base, but from boater registration fees, Budensiek said. A portion of boater registration fees is set aside explicitly for the purpose of removing derelict boats ""in order to make our waterways an appealing place for our residents and people that come here to enjoy our waterways,"" he said.
The Martin County Sheriff's Office is cracking down on derelict boats. (Martin County Sheriff's Office )
Budensiek said that his office is working with state agencies and the Coast Guard to identify and ensure derelict boats are removed or brought up to code, highlighting that local authorities are committed to making Martin County ""a safer and more beautiful place to boat.""

""They use our local ordinances to combat the issue that we're having. We don't do it alone. We do it with our state resources, DEP, the Department of Environmental protection, they help us with some of these environmental issues. The Coast Guard is always available to come beside us. So we're working locally, on the state level, and then on the federal level to combat this issue and make our community a safer and more beautiful place to boat,"" he said."

Family members of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza stormed into an Israeli parliament panel to demand action on Monday.
Roughly 20 protesters burst into the Knesset Finance Committee meeting, with many holding pictures of their loved ones. Roughly 130 hostages are believed to remain in Hamas custody.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced growing demands from relatives of hostages to cut a deal with Hamas. One lawmaker inside the committee meeting on Monday argued that disrupting Netanyahu's government would not be helpful.
""Redeeming captives is the most important precept in Judaism, especially in this case, where there is an urgency to preserving life,"" he said. ""Quitting the coalition would not achieve anything.""

(via Miami-Dade Police)
A 73-year-old grandmother was seen in new video footage being arrested in Miami, Florida, in connection with an alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill her former son-in-law.
Body camera video from November shows police taking Donna Adelson into custody at Miami International Airport as she and her husband were attempting to board a one-way flight to Vietnam. Donna was seen being escorted by police through the airport and into a patrol car.
""I didn't know there was a warrant,"" Donna was heard saying in the video.
She is charged with first-degree murder and solicitation of murder over accusations she conspired with her son and several others to have her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel, killed in his driveway in 2014.

Markel had been in a court battle during that time with his ex-wife, Wendi Adelson – the daughter of Donna Adelson. Wendi wanted to take her two sons she shared with Markel to South Florida to be closer to her mother and other family members, ABC 7 reported.
But when Markel refused the proposed arrangement, the Adelson family attempted to remove him from the picture, according to prosecutors.
""Who did it appear to have a motive to want Dan Markel dead? His own family,"" Prosecutor Georgia Cappleman said.
Prosecutors accused Donna of playing a crucial role in the scheme. Her son, Charlie, was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving a mandatory life sentence.

""If there is extradition from Vietnam, because we've looked at all the places, I mean, I could go to Korea and China, but there's no extradition,"" Donna said in a jail call with Charlie about a week before allegedly attempting to flee the country.
Prosecutors say Donna was attempting to flee the country and that it could be used as evidence against her in court.
Her attorney claimed to ABC News that she is innocent and that they ""look forward to proving it at trial."" She is scheduled to appear in court on Monday."

Comedian Rob Schneider put United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby on notice, Sunday, telling the business executive he and his family will ""no longer"" fly on the airline because it is sacrificing safety in its fixation on pushing diversity.
In an X post, Schneider brought up a near-fatal accident during one of United’s flights in late 2022, insinuating it could have been avoided if Kirby’s business wasn’t prioritizing diverse hires and, rather, focused on competent hires.
Schneider also dinged Kirby on allegations that he performs in drag shows following prominent conservatives sharing video of someone in a drag show they claimed was the CEO.

Schneider wrote, ""Dear Scott Kirby CEO @UnitedAirlines and Drag Queen practitioner, I regret to inform you that I will no longer allow my family to fly on your airline as you have clearly placed ‘diversity’ of pilot hiring above safety of passengers and crew.""
Though he was off by a year on when it occurred, the comedian brought up the 2022 UA1722 flight during which the company’s Boeing 777-200 plummeted around 1500 feet shortly after take-off before leveling out only 775 feet above the Pacific Ocean.
He said, ""As evidenced by the near aviation catastrophe of UA Boeing 777 flight 1722 from Maui to San Francisco Dec 18th 2023, where your diverse but incompetent flight crew didn’t know which flaps were causing its near disastrous dissent, coming within 750 feet of killing every one aboard your United Airline.""
A United Airlines spokesman told FOX Business shortly after the incident that an investigation revealed the pilots involved needed ""additional training"" to prevent such situations.
""I cannot tell you how many @UnitedAirlines employees have personally thanked me for my valid criticism of your careless and life-threatening leadership,"" Schneider wrote, adding, ""I look forward to your swift dismissal by UA’s board of directors before your inane actions cause the deaths of hundreds of men, women and children.""ELON MUSK DINGS BOEING AFTER ALASKA AIRLINES SCARE: 'PRIORITIZED DEI HIRING'
He concluded his post with a final dig at the CEO, saying, ""After your inevitable firing you can get back to your true passion, your Drag Queen performance. Sincerely yours, Rob Schneider. Former 1K United Airline frequent flyer.""

Schneider isn’t the only prominent figure that has been trashing Kirby over how he runs his business. X owner Elon Musk ripped Kirby after a 2021 Axios interview featuring him touting his company’s commitment to diverse hiring resurfaced online.
In the interview, Kirby committed to ensuring 50% of their graduating pilot classes will be women or people of color. As of 2023, that rate is still only 19%.
The CEO added, ""One of the things we do is, for every job, when we do an interview, we require women and people of color to be involved in the interview process, bringing people in early in their careers as well and giving them those opportunities, uh, and creating a stronger bench.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
After watching the clip, Musk commented on his platform, ""This is messed up.""
Scheider criticized this interview as well in a stand-up special from June 2023 that was released exclusively on Fox Nation.
""What? Diversity? Not the best pilots you could find?"" he asked during the Fox Nation performance, adding, ""The ones with the most hours and experience? The ones who’ve done it before? Nope, diversity.""
""I don’t know about you, but I am sick and tired of flying all the time with these White pilots landing safely and on time. Boring!"" he quipped.

The moment came as former President Donald Trump celebrated his victory in the Granite State's Republican primary, and said Scott ""must really hate"" Haley, who served as governor of South Carolina and appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012 to fill a vacancy.
""We do go to South Carolina, where we have done really well, where I've done well. We have a great governor and lieutenant governor, great everything because almost every one of them have endorsed me — Two great senators, which is hard. I mean, did you ever think that she would actually appoint you, Tim?"" Trump said as Scott stood behind him on the stage.

Jack Keane discusses tensions in the Middle East, including the Israel-Hamas war.
The United Nations’ top court announced a preliminary ruling Friday on a case filed by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide for its ground invasion against Hamas in Gaza.
In the ruling, the International Court of Justice refused to order Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza but said that the Israeli military must take all steps to prevent civilian deaths and remain in adherence with the Genocide Convention.
ICJ president Joan E. Donoghue, who read out the highly anticipated decision, said Israel must continue to let in aid to Gaza while seeking more opportunities to help Palestinian civilians.
""Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's said in response to the ICJ's preliminary ruling. ""Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself. The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected.""

According to the Dutch newspaper 'De Telegraaf, the ICJ ordered Hamas to immediately free all remaining hostages. It is not immediately clear whether Hamas will comply.
The court also gave Israel one month to provide the ICJ with a plan to ensure prevention of deaths in Gaza.
Lastly, the court confirmed that it has jurisdiction over South Africa's genocide case against Israel and will allow it to continue.

The case is likely to take years before the 17 judges on the panel make a final decision.
SOUTH AFRICA'S GENOCIDE CASE AGAINST ISRAEL SETS UP A HIGH-STAKES LEGAL BATTLE AT THE UN'S TOP COURT
Israel has vehemently denied that its campaign in Gaza, where it is seeking to eradicate the Hamas terror group, amounts to genocide and has asked the court to throw the case out.
Netanyahu reiterated those comments on Friday.
""The charge of genocide leveled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it,"" the prime minister said. ""On the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I again pledge as Prime Minister of Israel - Never Again. Israel will continue to defend itself against Hamas, a genocidal terror organization.""
He added: 'On October 7th, Hamas perpetrated the most horrific atrocities against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, and it vows to repeat these atrocities again and again and again. Our war is against Hamas terrorists, not against Palestinian civilians. We will continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and to do our utmost to keep civilians out of harm's way, even as Hamas uses civilians as human shields. We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people.""
Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust told Fox News Digital that Friday's ruling reflected the latest effort by the U.N. to undermine Israel.
""Hamas is congratulating the Court on its decision. That tells you a lot,"" she said. ""The UN Court relied entirely on allegations from the rest of the United Nations - it turned itself into an echo chamber of the UN’s political mob. It relied on a Secretary-General who claimed a mere two days after October 7th that the worst atrocities committed against Jews since the Holocaust had to be contextualized.""
""This case was an extension of the massive UN effort from the very start to undermine the ability of Israel to exercise its right of self-defense – against Hamas’s genocide targeting Jews. It turns logic, reason and justice on its head,"" Bayefsky continued. ""One stark example: The Court quotes the UN number that there are ""25,000 killed"" in Gaza without saying the source of that number is Hamas – the genocidal terrorist organization itself, or that a huge proportion of those killed are the terrorists themselves. Remember that the UN has no definition of terrorism – because the controlling majority don’t think butchering Israelis is terrorism. When those who commit genocide can pervert the law to serve their genocidal ends, every decent human being loses.""
""The Court had a number of ways to refuse to entertain South Africa's desecration of law and morality, period, and chose not to do so,"" she argued.

Ahead of Friday’s preliminary ruling, an Israeli official told the Associated Press that Israeli officials were prepared for ""all scenarios.""
Netanyahu joined top legal, diplomatic and security officials on Thursday to discuss the ruling. He also met with his war council later in the day.
Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy has said that Israel expects the court to toss the case before reaching a verdict.
""We expect the ICJ to throw out these spurious and specious charges,"" Levy said Thursday.
In its case filing, South Africa claimed that the high death toll among Palestinians in Gaza and the intensity of Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide and asked the judges to issue the preliminary hearing ""as a matter of extreme urgency"" to impose provisional measures to protect civilian lives. South Africa also requested the court to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.""

On Thursday, South Africa’s foreign ministry said it was seeking an interim ruling from the court that ""Israel immediately cease its military operations in Gaza, take reasonable measures to prevent the genocide of Palestinians, ensure that the displaced return to their homes and have access to humanitarian assistance, including adequate food, water, fuel, medical and hygiene supplies, shelter and clothing.""

Israel first invaded Gaza after Hamas, the terror group that governs the territory, launched a deadly surprise attack on Israeli border communities, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250 on October 7.
According to the Health Ministry, more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war. The ministry, which is run by Hamas, does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll.

""Vice President Harris has had three years to secure the border and stop the open flow of illegal immigrants into our country,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital.
""Yet, when asked about her solutions, she recommended that Congress grant mass amnesty and spend taxpayer dollars to process – not stop – more illegals. Her ‘solution’ is to spend billions of additional taxpayer dollars and incentivize the lawlessness and chaos.""

He was responding to a CNN interview Harris gave on Monday, when she urged negotiators working on a border security and immigration deal in Congress to focus on ""solutions."" When discussing what those solutions could be, she suggested ""meaningful"" pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers, as well as ""putting resources"" toward helping ""process people effectively.""
""This answer from President Biden’s ‘border czar’ is exactly why the administration can’t be trusted to solve the catastrophe they, themselves, created,"" Johnson said. ""Their idea is to attract millions more aliens, cause more pain, and further surrender America’s national and economic security.""

Early on in the Biden administration, Harris was given the task of finding long-term solutions to the worsening border crisis, specifically the root causes of mass migration from Central America.
However, she has not been seen with Senate and White House negotiators on Capitol Hill in recent weeks, as they work to find a bipartisan compromise.

Harris declined to directly discuss the current state of those talks. However, when asked about why border security reform has proved evasive for Washington for so many years, she admitted the immigration system is ""broken"" and pointed out one of the Biden administration's first bills sent to Congress ""included what we must do to create a pathway to citizenship and to put the resources that are needed into the border.""
""But sadly, people on the other side of the aisle have been playing politics with this issue,"" she said.

When pressed about those solutions, she said, ""The solutions include putting resources at the border to do what we can to process people effectively, and putting in place laws that actually allow for a…meaningful pathway to citizenship.""
""I will tell you that the negotiations that are happening right now, I hope are going to be directed at solutions that are genuinely focused on fixing the problem,"" Harris said.

Johnson has so far advocated for policies similar to H.R.2, the border bill that House Republicans passed in May, which include severe restrictions on asylum, and would reimpose Trump administration-era policies like Remain In Mexico. However, the Democrats who control the White House and Senate have panned the bill as a ""nonstarter.""
The number of people encountered at the border between the U.S. and Mexico last month is expected to have exceeded 300,000, an all-time historic high.

FIRST ON FOX: The White House intervened in the process for selecting which groups would oversee a federal climate reporting initiative, drawing conflict of interest accusations, according to the preliminary findings of a House Republican investigation.
In an internal GOP memo circulated Monday morning and shared with Fox News Digital, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee's oversight subcommittee highlighted how the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) ""inappropriately"" influenced federal acquisition regulations to unfairly benefit environmental activist groups with significant ties to Democrat donors and CEQ staff.
According to evidence obtained by the committee, CEQ succesfully lobbied the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council to outsource the Biden administration's climate reporting and disclosure initiative to two U.K. environmental groups: the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).
""This preliminary investigation report has turned up disturbing evidence that calls into question the entire rulemaking process for these disclosure requirements,"" House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital. ""The White House Council on Environmental Quality clearly exerted inappropriate influence during the development of this rule.""

""And we’ve turned up evidence of conflicts of interest where CEQ staff were advocating for regulations that would clearly benefit their friends and former employers,"" Lucas continued. ""I have significant concerns about making U.S. contractors disclose their emissions to a private foreign entity that has no accountability to Congress or the American people. The findings in this report make those concerns all the more urgent.""
He added that the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee would continue to pursue its investigation until it received ""satisfactory answers"" from the White House.
The issue dates back to May 2021 when, just months into his term, President Biden ordered the FAR Council — which is led by the White House Office of Management and Budget and includes members from other agencies — to craft regulations for requiring federal contractors to both publicly disclose greenhouse gas emissions and to set ""science-based reduction targets"" for reducing their carbon footprint.

Then, in November 2022, the FAR Council published a proposal requiring all federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and contractors with contracts valued at over $50 million to set ""science-based reduction targets."" However, the regulations specifically require all emissions disclosures to be made through CDP and all targets to be validated by SBTi, effectively outsourcing policy to foreign nonprofits.

""The federal government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers,"" House Science, Space, and Technology Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., said during a hearing on the topic in September. ""However, that is exactly the case in this instance.""
According to the memo Monday, in December 2021, just months after Biden ordered the FAR Council to develop the regulations, CEQ, OMB and the Office of Climate Policy within the White House crafted a message sent to department heads, imploring the council to ""leverage existing third-party standards and systems,"" specifically naming both CDP and SBTi.

But, referencing additional documents and communications obtained by the committee, the GOP memo states CEQ went even further despite under-oath testimony from CEQ Chief Sustainability Officer Andrew Mayock stating that his office's role in the selection of CDP and SBTi stopped at its December 2021 message to department heads.

""Documents obtained by the Committee contradict this narrative by showing that CEQ worked closely with CDP to tailor its message to the FAR Council in order to guarantee its inclusion in the proposed rule,"" the memo states.
""Emails obtained by the Committee show that a senior CEQ staffer had previously held a senior role at CDP and may have gone to work at CEQ with the intent of funneling money, influence, and regulatory authority to CDP/SBTi,"" it continues. ""The close relationship between CEQ and CDP/SBTi and the Biden Administration was evident from the beginning.""
Betty Cremmins, the director for Sustainable Supply Chains at CEQ, ultimately spearheaded the office's work on the FAR Council proposal throughout 2022 and stayed in regular contact with officials at both CDP and SBTi. However, in an apparent conflict of interest, Cremmins previously worked at CDP as the director of its West Coast office.
WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO REVEAL HOW COSTLY POTENTIAL BILLION-DOLLAR CLIMATE PROGRAM COULD BE FOR TAXPAYERS
Cremmins appears to have even coordinated CDP's messaging while at CEQ to ensure it aligned with FAR Council priorities. In one email, CDP's general counsel even went as far as telling Cremmins, ""[w]hen I first met you, you said your goal was to make CDP the law – and you did!""
SBTi's funding is tied to a massive dark money network which fuels a variety of progressive social and economic causes worldwide. The group states that it was developed as a collaboration of multiple non-governmental organizations including the We Mean Business Coalition, a project of the New Venture Fund, a massive left-wing group that raised nearly $1 billion in 2021, a large portion of which it doled out to a wide array of progressive groups. (Getty Images)
Further evidence shows that, despite its role in crafting the climate disclosure regulations, the FAR Council had little involvement in the process. Instead, according to the memo Monday, CEQ conducted the vast majority of vetting for the rulemaking.
""The Committee’s primary concern is maintaining the integrity of the scientific and rulemaking process,"" the memo concludes. ""The decision to select CDP and SBTi appears to not have been based on either a meritorious process or generally accepted science, but on arbitrary rulemaking.""
""After a nine-month investigation, the evidence presented shows that the decision to include CDP and SBTi in the proposed rule was based on a desire to steer power, influence, and regulatory authority to favored special interest environmental activist groups,"" it states. ""The evidence shows that the FAR Council was minimally involved in the vetting of CDP and SBTi.""
""The proposed regulation lacks a coherent goal, or a method of achieving it. The evidence suggests that it was never about greenhouse gas disclosures, it was always about making 'CDP the law.'""

Cornell University is facing mounting pressure to end its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and for the school’s president to resign, following a top donor’s fiery letter to the school's board of trustees, Fox News Digital has learned.
""Replace the President and the Provost,"" Cornell major donor and trustee emeritus Jon A. Lindseth wrote in a letter Tuesday as the top item Cornell’s board of trustees should address.
""Eliminate DEI staffing and programming. Revert to Open Inquiry, Academic Freedom, Free Expression, and Viewpoint Diversity on campus,"" Lindseth wrote as the second item that needs to be addressed by the board.
Fox News Digital learned that as of Thursday, the letter was mailed to each trustee, and will likely be fresh in their minds as they head into an emergency board meeting on Friday, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital. The trustees’ calendar shows they are scheduled to hold a meeting on Friday in New York City.

Lindseth is requesting the board include calls for Cornell President Martha Pollack to resign as part of their meeting agenda on Friday.
The letter was also sent directly to the trustees' chairman, Kraig Kayser, who is reportedly having conversations about it, but has not responded to Lindseth, the source said.
""For nearly seven years, I have strongly supported President Pollack, and that support remains strong today,"" Kayser said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital on Thursday. ""The board is working effectively with the administration to respond to various challenges facing higher education and opportunities to advance the university’s mission.""
The lengthy letter goes into detail how Lindseth, who has been one of the school's largest donors for several decades, is ""alarmed"" by the university’s embrace of DEI initiatives across all academic fields. He cited reports that the school is ""hiring faculty based on race rather than academic merit,"" as well as reports of ""failures to support faculty members choosing to exercise free expression and academic freedom.""
TRUCK BILLBOARDS CALLING FOR PENN PRESIDENT'S FIRING CIRCLE CAMPUS AFTER ISRAEL REMARKS
""I am proud to count myself one of several generations of Lindseths who are Cornell alumni and invested donors, but I am alarmed by the diminished quality of education offered lately by my alma mater because of its disastrous involvement with DEI policies that have infiltrated every part of the university,"" he wrote.

""Today, the instruction Cornell offers is in DEI groupthink applied to every field of study. The result is a moral decay, some call it ‘rot,’ that falls in line with prevailing ideology and dishonors basic principles of justice and free speech,"" Lindseth added.
Lindseth has halted donations to the school ""until the university reformulates its approach to education by replacing DEI groupthink.""
The source told Fox News Digital that since the letter was sent, and subsequently reported on by numerous media outlets, Lindseth has received an outpouring of support. Students, professors and parents have reached out to thank him for sounding the alarm on DEI initiatives to the board, adding that they didn’t feel like their concerns were being heard until he weighed in.
Lindseth took issue with a handful of initiatives the university has rolled out in recent years, which has led to a ""toxic"" school environment.
STEFANIK APPLAUDS RESIGNATION OF UPENN PRESIDENT LIZ MAGILL: 'ONE DOWN. TWO TO GO'
""A new campus ‘bias reporting system’ fosters a hostile Orwellian environment among neighbors, classmates and colleagues reporting on one another. The elimination of grades and SATs has created a system in which equal outcomes rather than proven merit has become the objective. This is disastrous for a research university that is built upon academic achievement and aims to educate and train some of our country’s leading scientists, architects and engineers,"" he wrote.

Lindseth also criticized Pollack’s leadership following the killing of George Floyd in 2020 compared with her response to the attacks on Israel in October that have since spiraled into war between Israel and Hamas.

""President Pollack’s shameful recent response to clear acts of terrorism and antisemitism compared with her swift and strong response to the George Floyd tragedy demonstrates that Cornell is no longer concerned with discovering and disseminating knowledge, but rather with adhering to DEI groupthink policies and racialization,"" he wrote.
Joel M. Malina, vice president for university relations, confirmed in comment provided to Fox News Digital that the letter was received by the school and provided to the board of trustees.
""We have received the letter, which has been forwarded to the chair of the Cornell University Board of Trustees. Cornell’s trustees are gathering in New York this week as part of a regularly scheduled series of meetings to discuss university affairs. Board meetings are scheduled many years in advance,"" Malina said, referring to the board meeting on Friday.
Lindseth’s letter to the board this week is supported by the Cornell Free Speech Alliance, a group of alumni, professors and students promoting the First Amendment on campus, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The letter comes after two other Ivy League presidents — Harvard’s Claudine Gay and the University of Pennsylvania’s Liz Magill — resigned in recent weeks after delivering controversial remarks to Congress on whether calls for the genocide of Jews break their schools' codes of conduct.

Lindseth’s letter was first published by the Ivy Excellence Initiative, a new effort launched by nonprofit educational network the Common Sense Society. The Ivy Excellence Initiative was rolled out just last week, and works to bring ""together alumni groups, dissident faculty, and frustrated donors to hold their universities accountable to pursuing true academic excellence and open inquiry,"" according to its press release.
The Ivy Excellence Initiative also added a section on its website on Thursday afternoon where people can send notes of encouragement to Lindseth amid his fight to end DEI curricula and initiatives at Cornell.

A long-serving New Jersey sheriff died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a restaurant restroom on Tuesday, according to multiple reports.
Passaic County Sheriff Richard Berdnik walked into a restroom at Toros, a well-known Turkish restaurant located on Hazel Street in Clifton, at around 3:30 p.m., shortly before other patrons heard a gunshot, Paterson Press and NorthJersey.com both reported.
A few minutes later, a call went out over the Passaic County Sheriff's Office radio system and several siren-flashing police vehicles descended on the scene, the outlets reported.

NEW JERSEY MAN SHOOTS 3 OF HIS RELATIVES DEAD: POLICE
The county’s sheriff’s office declined to comment on the incident. Passaic County is the eighth-largest county in New Jersey and is located in the northern part of the state.
He was in his mid-60s and was married to his wife, Monica. The couple had four adult children.
The incident came just days after three Passaic County sheriff’s officers were arrested on charges involving an alleged beating of a detainee at the county jail. Berdnik had also planned on laying off 29 correctional officers.
Berdnik had been sheriff of the county since 2011 and was re-elected in 2022 for a fifth term, according to the Passaic County Sheriff’s Office website.

The website credits him with reforming and streamlining all aspects of the sheriff’s office, where Berdnik focused on improving technology, training and overall operations of the agency, resulting in an increase in enforcement of criminal activity.
Prior to becoming sheriff, Berdnik had a distinctive 28-year career with the Clifton Police Department, where he served as the commander of the juvenile division and the SWAT team, receiving numerous citations for exceptional service and many certifications in various law enforcement functions.
Governor Phil Murphy said in a post on X that he was deeply saddened to hear of Berdnik’s passing.

""For more than four decades, Sheriff Berdnik served the people of New Jersey – from his days as a police officer on the streets of Clifton to his five consecutive terms as the 49th Sheriff of Passaic County,"" Murphy said via a statement attached to the post.
""Every single day, Sheriff Berdnik earned the trust of his constituents in Passiac County, and worked exhaustively to combat criminal activity, modernize the operations of the Sheriff’s Office, and meet the high standard of service we expect frm member of law enforcement.""

Meanwhile, former Woodland Park Mayor Keith Kazmark told NorthJersey.com that he was stunned to learn of Berdnik’s death.
""Rich always had a laid-back demeanor, truly cared about law enforcement, but was kind and caring at the same time,"" Kazmark said. ""He was so even-tempered. I think that makes this even harder to understand.""
""We never truly know how people feel inside, what is going on that could tragically impact them. It puts everything in perspective and shows we need to be kind and care about one another even more,"" Kazmark added. ""We lost a great sheriff and a really good man.""

Los Angeles Times’ letters editor Paul Thornton implored Californians leaving the state to stop criticizing it on the way out.
""To the people leaving California: May the road rise to meet you as you seek better lives in new places. Now, can you please extend some goodwill to those of us who remain?"" Thornton asked in a Saturday piece headlined, ""Commentary: If you want to leave, fine. But don’t insult California on the way out.""
He went on to describe how staggering numbers of Californians are fleeing to other states.
""More than 800,000 Californians moved away in 2022, and many thousands more left last year. Often, the departees, cash in hand from the sale of their $1-million bungalows, feel the need to express disdain for their home state, and even some anger too,"" he wrote.

CALIFORNIA FACES ‘SEVERE REVENUE DECLINE,' RECORD $68 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT AS MASS EXODUS CONTINUES
Thornton went on to describe a relative of his who told him about having relocated to a small town in another state far away, but being warned against bringing ""those weird California ways"" to his new neighborhood.
""And which ways would those be?"" Thornton asked rhetorically. ""Perhaps it’s our embrace of LGBTQ+ Californians. Or it’s our liberal politics, with the state Republican Party shrunk to irrelevance after its vicious attempt in 1994 to marginalize immigrants with Proposition 187.""
Proposition 187, which passed by almost 60% but blocked by the courts from ever going into effect, proposed denying state social services to illegal immigrants. Since then, California has expanded access to government benefits and services to illegal immigrants.
The Golden State started the new year by granting illegal immigrants free healthcare, despite the state's looming $68 billion deficit. This new healthcare policy will cover sex change surgeries for California residents without regard for their citizenship status.

WEALTHY CALIFORNIANS ARE FLEEING THE STATE, PUTTING TAX REVENUE AT RISK
""Perhaps I’m sensitive because California — and especially Los Angeles — used to be the place people would come,"" Thornton wrote. ""And plenty still move here, especially immigrants. I come from an immigrant family blessed by the working-class riches our state once offered.""
He touted California again as a place where putting ""progressive ideals"" in political practice remains a key goal.

""California is big, powerful and therefore tempting to disparage. We have 39 million people, Hollywood and Shohei Ohtani. This state is a haven for reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights, but income disparity and the housing crunch are critical problems we have to fix for progressive ideals to match the reality on the ground,"" he said.
""If you must leave California for Texas, Arizona, New England or anywhere else, don’t be a person who trash-talks the home of 39 million people,"" he pleaded.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, California lost a net of 75,423 people in 2023.

WA93TQUTWC_LZS15BWTQIXPX1A,Pianist who went viral over clash with Chinese nationals speaks out: 'Knickers in a twist',By Hannah Grossman Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 5:00am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pianist-gets-culture-war-brawl-chinese-nationals-enraged-filmed-knickers-twist,"Brendan Kavanagh, a British pianist, explains his clash with Chinese nationals who were outraged about being captured in his live stream as he was playing piano. (YouTube: Brendan Kavanagh @DrKBoogieWoogie).
When Chinese nationals confronted a British man over the right to use their images in public, he had no idea the exchange would become a viral video that fascinated millions.
""You're obviously not used to democracy,"" Brendan Kavanagh, the British man in the video, said at one particularly hot moment during the clash at St. Pancras train station in London. The fight ultimately ended with threats of legal action and the police getting involved to deescalate.
Kavanagh, a British pianist with 2.2 million followers on YouTube (@DrKBoogieWoogie), was live-streaming a public performance of his piano riffs when the group was incidentally captured in the background. The Chinese nationals asked him not to record them, insisting they did not want their images online. That's when things got heated.

Chinese nationals get into a heated argument with British pianist Brendan Kavanagh over whether they had a right not to be captured in his livestream. (YouTube: Brendan Kavanagh @DrKBoogieWoogie)
""We're appreciating the music, and they are filming us and were nicely coming here saying please don't - don't film us. Don't use that image. That's all we're trying to say,"" one of the members of the group complained.
""Just make sure that we are very, very secure. We don't want our voice or picture being filmed. That's just the relationship between you and me,"" another member, who shortly after threatened ""legal action,"" said. ""All of us, we cannot share our images online. That's our choice, that's our right.""
The Chinese nationals claimed to work for an entity with tight restrictions on having their images released on social media, according to a Metro police officer who spoke to Kavanagh on the video.
Under Chinese law, no party is entitled to use an image of another person without that person's consent. However, to the Chinese nationals' surprise, a British police officer sided with the pianist.
The Brit piano player noted they were not in ""communist China"" – they were in the United Kingdom, where there is ""freedom.""

""We're in a free country,"" Kavanagh said. ""We're not in communist China.""
For this remark, he was called ""racist"" by one of the nationals.
""When in Rome, do as the Romans do,"" he said.
The video of the exchange quickly went viral. Kavanagh believes the confrontation showcased the cultural clash between the West and East, democracy and communism.
Kavanagh told Fox News Digital he was shocked by the authoritarian tone the Chinese nationals used after getting their ""knickers in a twist"" over his video. Members of the group demanded he speak to them in a certain way and to not be filmed or voice recorded. They also demanded that the pianist apologize and said he needed to ""educate"" himself about China.

In the viral video, Kavanagh commented about the group holding the ""communist flag"" – the Chinese flag – which led to him being called ""racist"" and ""discriminating.""
""All I said was you got a communist flag. You're telling me what to do. We're in Britain now,"" the pianist said.
Then, another Brit got involved. The Chinese nationals began to argue with him, too, about their purported ""rights.""
This Brit told the Chinese nationals they should get lost if they didn't want to be filmed in someone's public livestream.
""Listen, if you don't like it, f--k off then,"" the Brit said.
One of the Chinese nationals, a female, then claimed the man couldn't say that.
""You cannot say like this,"" she said. ""You cannot say like this way. Who are you?""

""Who are you?"" the Brit responded before bustling off.
The pianist, reflecting on the clash, said, ""Put the situation in reverse.""
""Imagine if myself and some friends had gone over to China, found the piano, started waving around Union Jacks, and started bossing around the Chinese at the piano, telling them what to do, shouting at them and instructing them,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Would that have been appropriate behavior on my part? And I think the vast majority of people would say, absolutely not.""
Kavauagh called one of the members the ""shouty guy"" and said when he got involved ""it turned into a pantomime.""
At one point, the ""shouty guy"" exhibited particularly ""peculiar behavior,"" Kavanagh said. He loudly shouted at Kavanagh not to touch one of the girls as the pianist was reaching his hand to point out that she was holding a Chinese flag, as the video footage showed.
""Why are you touching her? Stop touching her! Don't touch her! …You are not the same age. Please do not touch her,"" he said.

The pianist jumped back and looked shocked by how loud the man screamed, then denied he tried to touch the woman.
The ""shouty guy"" said, ""You're approaching her with your hand,"" and demanded an apology.
The pianist said, ""You're getting a bit aggressive,"" and demanded an apology as well.
The ""shouty guy"" then repeatedly said, ""Do not touch her.""
""Do you want to keep saying that?"" responded the pianist, who then added a dance to the repeated words.

""Wait for it,"" the Chinese national responded.
""Yeah, I'm waiting for it,"" Kavanagh retorted.

WE79I3DBNY_CJHPCU9RQ8EFE9K,Migrant crime a 'real problem' in Chicago suburb after six more charged in Macy's retail thefts: police chief,By Stephen Sorace Fox News,"Published January 25, 2024 2:35pm EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/migrant-crime-real-problem-chicago-suburb-6-more-charged-macys-retail-thefts-police-chief,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Six migrants from Venezuela and Chile stole over $10,000 from a Macy’s in a suburb of Chicago in two separate retail theft incidents on Tuesday, authorities said.
The retail thefts occurred at the Macy’s department store located at 1 Oakbrook Center in Oak Brook, a store that has been plagued with a string of thefts and burglaries by migrants in recent months.
""I believe that six felony arrests in one day illustrates that migrant criminal activity is a real problem,"" Oak Brook Chief of Police Brian Strockis said in a written statement on Wednesday.
In one case that occurred just before 6:30 p.m., 20-year-old Nicolas Paillacan-Bravo and 34-year-old David Saez-Vega allegedly removed anti-theft devices from merchandise with a magnet they had taken into the store, the DuPage County State’s Attorney’s Office said.
STRING OF RETIAL THEFTS, BURGLARIES BY MIGRANTS PLAGUING CHICAGO SUBURB: AUTHORITIES
Nicolas Paillacan-Bravo, 20, and David Saez-Vega, 34, were charged with burglary and retail theft. Both men are from Chile and currently residing in Chicago, police said. (DuPage County State's Attorney's Office)
The men, who are from Chile and staying in Chicago, allegedly stuffed 54 items into two suitcases they had taken from the luggage department. Officials said the cost of the items totaled approximately $10,155.
Police were waiting outside the store when the two men exited without paying for the merchandise, according to authorities.
Officers had earlier responded to another retail theft at the store involving four Venezuelan migrants, all of whom were staying in Countryside, Illinois, just outside of Chicago.
Elvis Rodriguez-Rubio, 28, and Gabriela Salzar-Vasquez, 30, were charged with burglary and retail theft. Both migrants are from Venezuela and currently residing in Countryside, Illinois, police said. (DuPage County State's Attorney's Office)
The suspects were identified as Elvis Rodriguez-Rubio, 28, Gabriela Salzar-Vasquez, 30, Victor Sevilla-Arteaga, 33, and 27-year-old Danielis Vasquez-Arteaga.
The group went to the store’s Tommy Hilfiger section, where they took merchandise from the racks into a fitting room on the second floor, where the women exited wearing all of the items, officials said.

When the four left the store wearing the merchandise, authorities said that a loss prevention officer intercepted them outside. The items totaled approximately $927.
All six migrants were charged with one count of burglary, a class two felony, and one count of retail theft, a class three felony.

During their first court appearance Wednesday, prosecutors said a judge denied the state’s motion to detain the defendants.
In late October, Oak Brook Deputy Chief of Police Reid Foltyniewicz warned the public of ""the increase in criminal activity from the migrant community coming from Chicago.""
From Octtober 23 to January 17, a total of 47 migrants were arrested in Oak Brook, Illinois, most of whom were charged with retail theft and burglary, Strockis told Fox New Digital last week.
Strockis said on Wednesday that the sheer number of these types of arrests in the past few months is ""significant"" and that the department was prepared to continue enforcing the law.

Gen. Patrick Ryder discusses the U.S. and U.K. striking Houthi targets in Yemen on 'Your World.'
The Houthis have demanded that British and American aid workers, including Yemeni citizens who hold dual citizenship, leave the country within 30 days as action between the Iran-backed group and Western nations continues to escalate.
""The ministry would like to emphasize the necessity of informing all officials and workers who hold American and British citizenship of their preparation to leave the country within a maximum period of 30 days from the date of this determination,"" a letter from the Yemen Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
""The ministry also calls upon [the humanitarian organizations] not to recruit any employees with dual nationalities from those countries mentioned above during this period,"" the ministry added.
The Houthis, which the U.S. recently relisted as a terrorist group – though not a Foreign Terrorist Organization – have controlled the foreign affairs ministry since taking control of Yemen’s capital in 2015 after capturing the presidential palace. The group dissolved parliament and placed its own committee in control of the government.

The British Embassy said staff had not yet been told to leave, and the mission was in close contact with the U.N. on the issue.
""The U.N. provides vital assistance to the Yemeni people ... via the very sea routes that the Houthis are jeopardizing,"" the British mission in Yemen said in a statement. ""Nothing should be done that hinders their ability to deliver.""

The letter, which applies to staff of the United Nations and Sanaa-based humanitarian organizations, follows strikes from U.S. and U.K.-led coalition of allies in retaliation for raids and attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea.
The coalition’s first strike hit over 60 targets in 16 locations, and the latest strike, carried out overnight into Wednesday, prompted the Houthis to seek the expulsion of foreign nationals from the responsible nations, Sky News reported.

British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps praised the strikes as a ""success,"" hailing the ""dedication, professionalism and skill"" of those involved. He claimed that the strikes ended up ""degrading the capabilities that the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners.""
The U.S. said the strikes destroyed two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were preparing to strike at commercial ships in the Southern Red Sea.

The Houthis insisted that their raids only target vessels tied to Israeli trade interests to stymie Israeli operations in the Gaza Strip, but Washington and London have instead argued that the attacks have impacted wider global trade.
The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Jan. 10 demanding the Houthis end their attacks on the shipping lanes after the Houthis ignored a formal statement from the U.S.-led coalition demanding the same.

WHDTWG23T5_XDV49TTJLKSJGFG,Pentagon can’t say when Secretary Austin will resume working in person following secretive hospitalization,By Greg Wehner Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 5:59pm EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-cant-say-when-secretary-austin-will-resume-working-person-following-secretive-hospitalization,"Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on Pentagon briefs following U.S.-led strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen on 'America Reports.'
The Pentagon said Tuesday that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin continues to recuperate at home following a medical procedure earlier this month, though there was no expected time frame provided for his return to the office.
Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters during a press briefing that Austin is performing his duties from home, including participating in the 18th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Tuesday.
The group consists of 50 plus countries who gather monthly to coordinate security assistance for Ukraine.
In Austin’s opening comments during the meeting, he reaffirmed U.S. support to Ukraine, adding that the U.S. will collaborate with international allies and partners to ensure Ukraine gets the capabilities it needs to protect its citizens and sovereignty from Russian attacks during the winter and beyond.

Austin did not address his health or hospitalization during his comments.
When asked why Austin did not mention anything about his health as he attended the meeting from his home, Ryder said it was the secretary’s prerogative to steer clear from such comments in his prepared remarks.
Ryder also told reporters upon questioning that he did not have anything to announce in terms of Austin’s return to the Pentagon.

""The secretary continues to recuperate from home,"" Ryder said. ""He’s recovering well. As I highlighted last week, part of his care at home continues to be physical therapy. But again, we’ll keep you updated on his return date to the Pentagon.""
Austin, 70, and the Pentagon have come under heavy scrutiny for not being more transparent about the secretary's hospitalization and communication gaps that left senior officials and the White House unaware of his condition or whereabouts for several days.
Austin was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Dec. 22 and underwent prostate cancer surgery. He developed an infection a week later and was readmitted to the hospital.

President Biden and other senior administration officials were not told for days about his hospitalization or his cancer.
Despite being admitted to Walter Reed upon Jan.1, the Pentagon didn't inform the public, press or Congress until Jan. 5.
Officials also acknowledged that the White House had not been informed about Austin's hospitalization until Jan. 4.
According to the doctors, the cancer was detected when Austin had a regular screening in early December.

They said his prostate cancer was detected early, and his prognosis was excellent.
Austin has been called to testify before congressional lawmakers to explain why his hospitalization was kept secret.
The Pentagon is conducting an internal review into the communication lapse.

WIRVWZFME0_EB7U95BI30ZZODQ,GOP senator urges SCOTUS to rein in Big Tech's content censorship that defies 'logic',By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 6:48pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senator-urges-scotus-to-rein-in-big-techs-content-censorship-defies-logic,"Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., discusses a hearing in which a Meta whistleblower alleged a toxic culture at the company and how the platform could be harming children on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’
FIRST ON FOX — Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is urging the Supreme Court not to buy into arguments from Big Tech platforms that they should have First Amendment freedom to censor user content while simultaneously demanding legal protection from content posted on their platforms.
Next month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a set of cases that question whether state laws that limit Big Tech companies’ ability to moderate content on their platforms curbs the companies’ First Amendment liberties.
The Missouri Republican filed a brief in the cases Tuesday, arguing the platforms want to keep liability protections granted by Congress for content on their sites, while simultaneously asking for unfettered ability to censor content, citing their First Amendment liberties.
The court ""should not bless the platforms’ contradictory positions, much less constitutionalize them,"" Hawley argued, adding that ""doing so would effectively immunize the platforms from both civil liability in tort and regulatory oversight by legislators.""
GOP AGS ASKS SUPREME COURT TO PEEL BACK CONTENT MODERATION FROM BIG TECH IN LANDMARK FIRST AMENDMENT CASE
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)
The cases before the high court originate from separate laws that passed in Florida and Texas that would require large Big Tech companies like X, formerly Twitter, and Facebook to host third-party communications but prevent those businesses from blocking or removing users' posts based on political viewpoints.
A federal appeals court had ruled for the tech industry in the Florida case, saying, as private entities, those companies were ""engaged in constitutionally protected expressive activity when they moderate and curate the content that they disseminate on their platforms."" But the Fifth Circuit ruled in favor of a similar law in Texas, creating a circuit split on the issue ripe for the nine justices to take up.
JAN 6 RIOTERS, ABORTION, GUN RIGHTS: A LOOK AHEAD AT LANDMARK CASES SCOTUS WILL HEAR IN 2024
Hawley in his brief explains that, in the 1990s, following the advent of the internet, Congress and the courts needed to square the longstanding principle in American publication law that ""individuals who play an active role in disseminating others’ speech are liable for any unlawful harm that speech causes.""
The result was Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which broadly insulates platforms from civil liability for hosting user-generated content.
""At the time, Section 230 was justified on the theory that platforms could not exercise publisher-level control over the speech generated by third-party users,"" Hawley said.
""Despite decades arguing for this position, today the tech platforms take precisely the opposite line. They claim that their content hosting and curation decisions are in fact expressive — expressive enough that they enjoy First Amendment protection,"" the lawmaker’s brief states.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Hawley charged that the social media giants ""always have some excuse as to why the law doesn't apply to them.""
""It doesn't matter that they've made exactly opposing arguments in court. They don't care about that. All they care about is preserving their ability to control speech and censor at will,"" he said.
The platforms told the Supreme Court state laws in Florida and Texas ""openly abridge"" their ""First Amendment right to exercise editorial judgment over what content to disseminate on their websites via requirements that are speaker-based, content-based, and viewpoint-discriminatory.""
SUPREME COURT APPEARS READY TO REEL IN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN LANDMARK CHALLENGE FROM EAST COAST FISHERMEN
But Hawley says the platforms’ argument ""completely undercuts the logic of Section 230,"" which the platforms have long sought to keep in place despite bipartisan pressure to repeal all if not some of that statute.
""Extending an historical blanket immunity to this sector will have real-world consequences. To invoke a frighteningly realistic hypothetical, nothing could stop a web platform’s algorithm from promoting content designed to addict and harm young people,"" Hawley wrote in his brief.

""Take, as an example, content promoting eating disorders (a shockingly common phenomenon on modern social media). Companies could choose to affirmatively undermine the mental and physical health of America’s youth, while enjoying the protections of Section 230. While teens starved and parents looked on, no private action would lie. And then, when the government stepped in, the platforms could simply invoke their First Amendment immunity. Promoting eating disorders could be, after all, an editorial choice,"" he argues.

""Nestled in a comfortable fissure between legal doctrines, the platforms could look on as their algorithms — or affirmative curation decisions — devastated a generation,"" he added.
The court will hear arguments in the cases, Moody v. NetChoice, LLC and NetChoice LLC v. Paxton Feb. 26.

WIWRQA6SYX_5Y38VJZDA60D2HL,"LA Times endorses Gascón for re-election, claims backlash to crime policies is a MAGA 'fairy tale'",By Nikolas Lanum Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 2:22pm EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/la-times-endorses-gascon-re-election-backlash-crime-policies-maga-fairy-tale,"'The Five’ co-hosts discusses Los Angeles DA George Gascon’s new chief of staff and her background of allegedly hating cops.
The Los Angeles Times endorsed District Attorney George Gascón for re-election on Sunday despite controversy surrounding his progressive crime policies.
The paper's editorial board claimed Gascón, who was elected to Los Angeles County in 2020, is doing what he promised and ""doing it well"" despite ""dishonest"" backlash from members of his own office and right-wing politicians and pundits.
""L.A. County voters would be wise to reject the nonsense and keep Gascón on the job and criminal justice reform in place,"" the editorial board said.
The paper suggested that ""falsehoods"" about Gascón and the ""apocalyptic landscape"" of Los Angeles may have led voters to forget why they had voted for him in the first place.

Prior to his role as district attorney, Gascón served as the district attorney of San Francisco and the chief of the San Francisco Police Department. As a former police officer, he also served as the LAPD assistant chief and the chief of police in Mesa, California.
The paper claimed this experience has enabled Gascón to understand how police and prosecutors can work together to serve and ""occasionally distort"" the criminal justice system.
""Other prosecutors may know the courtroom; Gascón knows the system,"" The LA Times said.
The editorial also surmised that Gascón has helped to stem ""multigenerational racial inequalities"" through his understanding of just punishment, which, if not properly ""dosed,"" can lead prisoners to be ""broken"" rather than ""corrected.""
""Gascón's policies seek the most fitting rather than the longest possible sentences. This smart approach was such a departure from older, failed strategies that the MAGA right promptly distorted it into the false narrative that Gascón refuses to prosecute misdemeanors at all, and generally avoids prosecuting felonies,"" the paper added.
The LA Times then claimed Gascón's willingness to avoid prosecution for various crimes is a ""fairy tale.""

""The argument that Gascón is lax or lenient on crime simply does not hold up to the facts. The various crime surges in the last few years — wrongly attributed to Gascón — occurred nationwide and have largely abated. Prosecutorial policies have no short-term effect on crime,"" the paper said.
Gascón has faced substantial criticism from not only challengers and right-wing politicians but also those who served close to him.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami told Fox News Digital in August 2022 that Gascón's policies are creating a ""ticking time bomb,"" and eventually, a released murderer is going to victimize someone else.
Due to Proposition 57, approved by the voters of California in 2016, every minor convicted in adult court must receive an additional transfer hearing in juvenile court to determine if the individual should be tried as an adult.
In many cases, however, Gascón's office chose not to participate in transfer hearings and the inmate would be released.

In a lengthy letter to Gascón and his top aides, veteran Los Angeles County prosecutor Mark Burnley aired a number of grievances on his last day with the office in December 2022. He claimed at the time that the DA's progressive reforms and management style had alienated his colleagues and turned the nation's largest district attorney's office into a ""managerial dumpster fire.""
Gascón has repeatedly defended his record on crime.
He told KTLA-TV in June 2022 that he knows ""how to keep communities safe"" and blamed rising violence in the county on the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gascón explained that he believes his Community Violence Intervention Unit has been successfully locating repeat offenders and making ""good arrests"" and bringing in ""a lot of guns"" off the streets. Gascón also said that his office has increased the number of prosecutions of sexual assaults, which is an area he says his administration has done ""really well"" on.
He also said that his team has improved the ""filing system"" to make the process more efficient and that he has been successfully pushing for more ""integrity"" in the legal system.

WLF6Q6AWOV_TFH55JZBPU1C1FO,University of California board delays vote on allowing illegal immigrant students to work on campus,Associated Press,"Published January 26, 2024 6:59am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/university-california-board-delays-vote-allowing-illegal-immigrant-students-work-campus,"Tracy Rojas lives near the caves and she joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how she discovered the caves and what the city is doing to ensure public safety.
The University of California’s governing board on Thursday punted a decision of whether to allow immigrant students without legal status to apply for jobs on its 10 campuses, with the system’s president warning doing so would carry ""significant risk"" for the institution and students, including possible criminal prosecution.
The Board of Regents voted 9-6 to delay considering the plan until 2025 amid shouts of ""Cowards!"" from some in the audience.
Before the vote, University of California President Michael Drake told the board that the proposed legal pathway for the student work plan was ""not viable right now"" and said implementing such a plan would carry ""significant risk for the institution and for those we serve.""
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOARD TO VOTE ON ALLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STUDENTS TO WORK ON CAMPUS
Drake said the policy could put immigrant students at risk of criminal prosecution and then deportation for working while lacking legal status. That, in turn, would put the university system at risk of fines and criminal penalties for employing them, and pose a potential threat to grants and other funding. He said the university system will continue to explore its options.

Regents who opposed delaying the plan shared their disappointment and called it a missed opportunity for the university system to lead in the fight for the rights of immigrant students who don't have legal status.
""We are taking a pause at a crucial moment on an issue that requires our commitment,"" said California Assembly Speaker Emeritus and UC Regent John A. Pérez. ""If you stand and say this is the time for us to actually be bold, and take individual and institutional risks then you speak to a different sense of moral authority.""
The prestigious university system has more than 295,000 students. The policy could benefit as many as 4,000 immigrant students who would previously have been allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
The federal policy implemented by former President Barack Obama prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. It was declared illegal by a federal judge in Texas in September. The judge’s ruling is ultimately expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, sending the program’s fate before the high court for a third time.
UC's policy would also challenge a 1986 federal law prohibiting people without immigration status from legally working.
For years, students without legal immigration status have attended University of California schools while paying in-state tuition.
Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond to a request for comment on the proposal considered by the board of regents.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGENTS MOVES TOWARD ALLOWING HIRING OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STUDENTS
""I’m deeply disappointed that the UC Regents and President Drake shirked their duties to the students they are supposed to protect and support,"" Jeffry Umaña Muñoz, UCLA student and leader at Undocumented Student-Led Network, said in a statement.
Ahilan Arulanantham, faculty co-director at the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law called it ""deeply shameful"" that the regents refused to adopt the policy now.
""Our legal theory, which we presented to the regents in October 2022, makes clear: the University of California has the legal right to authorize the hiring of undocumented students today,"" Arulanantham said. ""I have had the immense privilege of working with these students for the past couple of years, and I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to simultaneously pursue their studies and fight for their right to survive at the UC."""

Sources at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Fox News on Wednesday that there have been more than 96,000 ""known gotaways"" at the southern border since the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.
Agents reported seeing or detecting the migrants but were not able to take them into custody.
The figure indicates that more than 800 individuals per day illegally crossed the border and then disappeared into the U.S.
The numbers come after CBP sources told Fox News Digital at the start of January that migrant encounters hit a staggering 300,000 incidents in the last month of 2023.

Between Dec. 1 and 31, more than 302,000 migrants were documented attempting to cross the U.S. southern border.
It is the highest total for a single month ever recorded. It is also the first time migrant encounters have exceeded 300,000.

Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, is also warning fellow Democrats, including President Biden, to prepare for border security to be a top election issue in the 2024 cycle.
Standing along the Rio Grande in Hidalgo, Texas, on Saturday, Cuellar told Fox News Digital the situation at the southern border will ""absolutely"" be on voters’ minds this year.
He traveled to the border this weekend as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation that also included Reps. Monica De La Cruz, R-Texas, Randy Weber, R-Texas, and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas.
""If they're looking at the same polls I've been looking at, the American public doesn't like what's happening,"" Cuellar said of fellow Democrats.

- GOP moves to defund sanctuary cities
- Biden approval rating hits rock bottom
- Dem calls out soft-on-crime prosecutors
Former President Trump was ordered to pay over $83 million in damages to E. Jean Carroll after she sued him for what she called defamatory statements following her accusation that he sexually assaulted her.
The trial was not about whether Trump sexually assaulted Carroll – a jury in a Manhattan civil trial last year already found Trump liable for the alleged assault, which Trump vehemently denies.
""Absolutely ridiculous!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social after the verdict came down. ""I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party,"" Trump posted on his TRUTH Social shortly after the verdict was read. ""Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights.""
Trump added: ""THIS IS NOT AMERICA!""

When asked if Vergara has an active ""Modern Family"" group chat, she jokingly revealed that O’Neill struggled to participate in conversations.

The actress reflected on her favorite ""Modern Family"" episode she’s worked on.
Vergara explained it was a Halloween episode in Season 2, where O’Neill was dressed as a gargoyle, while she was a witch.
""The producers and directors wanted to kill us because we could not hold it together,"" she recalled. ""We would laugh… we couldn’t do a scene looking at Ed f---ing… dressed as a gargoyle.""

O’Neill explained an on-set feud with a longtime co-star for another hit family show he was on for 11 seasons, ""Married… with Children.""
""It was also kind of a show that no one wanted to admit that they liked,"" he told Ferguson on the podcast regarding the sometimes-controversial series.

O’Neill reflected on his tenure on the show, admitting his feud with actress Amanda Bearse was something he regretted: ""We didn’t get along, and we did for a long time. We were great friends. And I could guess, I don’t want to speak for her… it started when we got the cover of TV Guide.""
O'Neill said Bearse and David Garrison, who played supporting characters Marcy D'Arcy and Steve Rhoades, were not to be featured. ""They were told they could not be on the cover. Because they had a rule: there's only so many [that] can be on the cover,"" he said of TV Guide's restrictions. ""Now, they violated that for, like, two shows, I think it was ‘M*A*S*H’ and ‘Dallas,'"" he explained.
""That was an exception. They weren’t doing it for us. And we were lucky to get it. It was like the sixth year in or something,"" he said of the July-August 1989 cover. The show premiered in 1987. ""We were thrilled to get the cover of TV Guide. It was big. And Amanda and David came out in unison from their dressing room. We were on the soundstage, and she said, ‘We expect you to go to [co-creator] Ron Leavitt and tell him this doesn’t work. We’re all on the cover.'""

""If I was diplomatic, I should have said, ‘Fine. I’ll talk to him about it,'"" O'Neill suggested.
""But instead, I said, ‘No. I’m not doing that. I'm sorry you guys aren't on the cover. I really am! I wish you were! But we can't do anything about it. What do you want me to do, lie to you, and tell you that, you know, I'm going to go to bat for you? I'm not,'"" he remembered thinking.
""That's my regret,"" O'Neill told Ferguson, admitting he would have done things differently in retrospect.

Tim Scott got engaged in and effort to be Donald Trump's vice president.
Some left-leaning media personalities attacked Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., over his engagement and connected the announcement to him ""working hard"" to be Donald Trump's vice president.
Scott announced his engagement on Sunday to Mindy Noce in South Carolina. Media personalities such as ""The View"" co-hosts Ana Navarro and Sunny Hostin took aim at the engagement and suggested it was part of him working towards being Trump's vice president.
Navarro posted to Instagram and said Scott was ""working hard for that VP spot,"" and suggested his engagement was part of his work.
""Pretty amazing to see Tim Scott WHO WAS APPOINTED TO THE US SENATE -the BIGGEST gift a Governor can bestow- by then-Governor Nikki Haley, standing behind Trump grinning like a Cheshire cat as Trump trashes her. Damn, he working hard for that VP spot. Man even got engaged!"" Navarro wrote on social media.

TIM SCOTT ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP LATEST SIGN GOP IS CONSOLIDATING AROUND FORMER PRESIDENT
""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin also took a shot at Scott during the show on Wednesday, suggesting his engagement was a sign he wanted to be VP.
Hostin said he looked uncomfortable behind Trump, and said, ""you know he's running for vice president.""
""He endorses Trump on a Friday and then gets engaged on a Saturday, and announces his engagement on a Sunday, because it's like, ‘pick me I’m getting married this year,' and no other vice president has been unmarried and has been successful,"" Hostin said. ""It just screams ‘I want to be your vice president! I love you!'""
Boston Globe columnist Renée Graham wrote in a column published on Tuesday titled, ""Hoping to be Trump's VP Pick, Tim Scott puts a ring on it,"" that the senator's ""sudden engagement signals that he doesn’t want innuendo about his life to keep getting in the way of his ambitions.""

Graham seemed to express skepticism that the engagement was ""the real thing, not an act of political prestidigitation conceived to allay the queasiness of Republicans hung up on Scott’s sexual identity.""
""He even released a photo of himself, down on one knee, proposing to Noce on a South Carolina beach in a shot that could have been plucked from a season finale of ""The Bachelor,"" the columnist continued. ""But with a woman by his side as a banner of Scott’s heterosexuality, perhaps those whispers won’t be as prominent as he vies to be Trump’s running mate.""
""CBS Mornings"" host Gayle King pressed Scott on whether he was hoping for the VP position on Wednesday, and asked about people who thought the timing was ""suspicious.""
""I would say, anyone who says it's suspicious timing, it's a lie from the pit of hell, you know how that goes in church,"" Scott said. ""You meet the person where you spend the most time, I was fortunate enough to meet her at church.""
He said they both enjoy doing the same things and have a lot in common.

The South Carolina senator told Fox News Digital that he knew his fiancé was the one about two weeks into his relationship.
""To be honest with you, it was probably two weeks in, we were in the kitchen area, and I said to myself, everyone says you’ll know, and I thought that was the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.

""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin accused GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley of being a ""hypocrite"" and an ""ageist"" on Thursday while defending Don Lemon's past her ""prime"" comments.
Hostin, who has repeatedly criticized Haley and once accused her of being a ""chameleon,"" for not using her birth name, claimed Haley was an enigma, and argued they didn't know if she would be ""worse than Trump"" or not.
""The other thing that I find her to be hypocritical about is she went off because Don Lemon said that she was older, that she was past her prime,"" she said, referencing Haley's comments about her parents while in New Hampshire.
""Then she starts attacking Joe Biden and Donald Trump on their age. She's an ageist, yet she was offended when someone talked about her age. Hypocrite!"" Hostin said.

Hostin pushed back and said Haley was still being hypocritical. Co-host Joy Behar jumped in and said she ""had to defend"" Lemon.
""I have to defend Don Lemon a little bit, because I don't think he meant that he thinks a woman is over the hill,"" she said. ""A woman is perceived as over the hill.""

CREDIT: DeSantis Campaign
Florida’s move to cut sociology as a core requirement in the State University System prompted outrage from parts of the academic community and sociologists.
The Florida Board of Governors on Wednesday approved an amendment to replace Principles of Sociology with the Introductory Survey to 1877 in ""core course options.""
The Board stated that students will have the opportunity to take a ""factual history course that focuses on the forces that shaped America as part of their general education course requirements.""
They added that the course teaches a ""historically accurate account of America’s founding, the horrors of slavery, the resulting Civil War, and the Reconstruction era.""

However, the move prompted a backlash from academics, including the American Sociological Association [ASA].
ASA told Common Dreams that the move lacked an ""evidentiary basis.""
""There was no evidentiary basis for making this decision. In fact, the board rejected a proposal from one of the governors to table the vote while relevant data could be gathered,"" the ASA told Common Dreams.
They continued, ""This decision seems to be coming not from an informed perspective, but rather from a gross misunderstanding of sociology as an illegitimate discipline driven by 'radical' and 'woke' ideology.""
""To the contrary, sociology is the scientific study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behavior, which are at the core of civic literacy and are essential to a broad range of careers,"" the association said. ""Failure to prioritize the scientific study of the causes and consequences of human behavior is a failure of Florida's commitment to providing high-quality civics education and workforce readiness.""
DESANTIS BANS STATE FUNDING FOR DIVERSITY, INCLUSION PROGRAMS AT FLORIDA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES
The American Association of University Professors posted on X that the ""decision to remove sociology from Florida's core curriculum is a tragic blow to students’ intellectual freedom.""
""It will prevent generations of students from being introduced to subject matter that is uniquely suited to address complex challenges,"" they said.
Academics responded to the Board’s move and one of them commented on Common Dreams.
""It's not surprising that people in power would actively suppress efforts to question their power and expose the dynamics underlying it,"" Heather Gautney told Common Dreams.

Gautney, a sociology professor at Fordham University, added that the Board’s move came at a time when society is ""in such dire need of what sociology has to bring—systematic analysis, understanding, and policy solutions.""
""What's surprising is the ease through which that suppression is happening today, apparently with the help of sociologists themselves in cities like Detroit,"" she continued.
Elizabeth Aranda, a Sociology professor at the University of South Florida, posted on X that the move would impact enrollment.
""Well, it’s done. Now all state colleges AND universities will be removing #sociology from the gen ed curriculum. Summer intro courses are now on hold anticipating tanking enrollments & grad student instructors are the first to be axed. Thanks #Florida.""

The Board released a statement about the decision, saying it will have a ""positive impact"" on students' education.
""Florida’s students of our State University System will have the opportunity to learn about the creation and development of our nation as part of the core course options,"" said Chancellor Ray Rodrigues.

This is the latest move under Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in his effort to address ""woke"" education.

A South Korean governing party lawmaker was treated for lacerations at a Seoul hospital after being attacked Thursday by an unidentified man who struck her head with a rock-like object, South Korean police and fire officials said.
A police official in Seoul’s Apgujeong district said a suspect was arrested at the scene of the attack on lawmaker Bae Hyunjin in southern Seoul.
The attack, which came weeks after a man stabbed opposition leader Lee Jae-myung in the neck in the southern city of Busan, raises further concerns about the country’s intensely polarized politics.
SOUTH KOREA OPPOSITION LEADER STABBED IN NECK DURING VISIT TO BUSAN
South Korean media, citing Bae’s aides, said the suspect approached her and asked whether she was really the lawmaker before striking her with what appeared to be a rock. Calls to Bae’s office weren’t immediately answered.

Bae, a former television news presenter, was elected in 2020 and is seen as a close confident of President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Park Sukh Que, a neurosurgeon at the Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital, said Bae sustained minor injuries to the head, including scratches and a cut, and was hospitalized in stable condition.
The force of the attack caused Bae to fall on the back of her head, but there were no signs of a concussion or internal bleeding, Park said.
""Fortunately, the bleeding wasn’t very serious,"" Park said at a news conference. ""She does have a headache and she's showing a bit of anxiousness after being shaken by the attack.""

The man who attacked opposition leader Lee told investigators after his arrest that he wanted to kill him to prevent him from becoming a future president. Lee was released from the hospital after eight days of treatment.
""My scar is aching again after this unbelievable incident,"" Lee said of the attack on Bae, describing it as an act of ""political terrorism"" that must not be tolerated.
""There needs to be a thorough and decisive response. We pray for a speedy recovery for lawmaker Bae and our hearts go out to her family,"" Lee said in a statement.
Han Dong-hoon, leader of the governing People Power Party, called for a thorough investigation and for the attacker to be ""sternly punished.""
Thae Yong Ho, another lawmaker from the People Power Party, described the attack as a ""serious challenge"" to South Korea’s democracy.
""Politics of hate, anger and violence must be put to an end,"" Thae, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to South Korea in 2016, said in Facebook post."

Gun owners in Maryland would be required to buy at least $300,000 in liability insurance or forfeit their ability to carry a firearm under a new bill.
The controversial legislation, introduced by Delegate Terri Hill, D-Howard County, would prohibit the ""wear or carry"" of a gun anywhere in the state unless the individual has obtained a liability insurance policy of at least $300,000.
""A person may not wear or carry a firearm unless the person has obtained it and is covered by liability insurance issued by an insurer authorized to do business in the State under the Insurance Article to cover claims for property damage, bodily injury, or death arising from an accident resulting from the person’s use or storage of a firearm or up to $300,000 for damages arising from the same incident, in addition to interest and costs,"" the proposed Maryland legislation said.

Jack Keane discusses tensions in the Middle East including the Israel-Hamas war.
Senate Democrats have put forward a measure that endorses the creation of a Palestinian state backed by every member of their conference — with two notable exceptions.
The proposed amendment to a pending national security supplemental package reaffirms that the U.S. supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and ""that such a solution must ensure the state of Israel's survival as a secure, democratic and Jewish state, and fulfill the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own.""
""The U.S. government has long supported a two-state solution as a path to a just and lasting peace in the region, and our amendment reaffirms our continued commitment to that vision,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, who sponsored the amendment.
""The horrors of the war on and since October 7th have underscored the fundamental reality that in order for both Israelis and Palestinians to live in safety and with dignity, they need to have distinct, inalienable, and mutually-recognized states that coexist side-by-side in peace,"" he said.
GOP LEADER THUNE SAYS REPUBLICANS AIMING FOR ‘DETAIN AND DEPORT’ BORDER POLICY

The amendment comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected U.S. calls for a Palestinian state after the Israel-Hamas war. President Biden has urged Netanyahu to scale back the military offensive in Gaza, but the prime minister insisted the war will not end until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining 130 hostages held captive by the terrorist group are freed.
Netanyahu said last week a Palestinian state would become a launching pad for attacks on Israel. He insisted that Israel must have ""security control"" over Gaza and the West Bank and warned America not to ""coerce us to a reality that would endanger the state of Israel.""

The Schatz amendment is supported by 49 senators from every ideological wing of the Senate Democratic conference, including independents Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who caucus with Democrats.
However, centrist Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and vocal Israel supporter Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., have not signed on.

Schatz hopes to tie his amendment to a forthcoming $110 billion national security supplemental package that would deliver military aid to Israel and Ukraine, as well as funds for border security.
However, Republicans and Democrats have been unable to reach a deal that would pass the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-led House, with border security policies being the sticking point in negotiations.

A commission investigating a mass shooting that killed 18 people in Maine last year is scheduled to hear Thursday from a police agency that had contact with the shooter before he committed the killings.
Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and state Attorney General Aaron Frey assembled the commission to review the events that led up to the shootings at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston on Oct. 25. Commissioners, who are holding their second meeting Thursday, are also tasked with reviewing the police response.
The meeting will be public and will allow commissioners to speak to members of the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Department, a spokesperson for the commission said.
MAINE SHOOTING: LEWISTON POLICE WERE WARNED ABOUT ROBERT CARD WEEKS BEFORE MASSACRE
Lawyers for some of the victims' families have pointed to missed opportunities to prevent Army reservist Robert Card, 40, from committing the shootings and was found dead afterward from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, file)
Police videos obtained by The Associated Press and other news agencies showed that police declined to confront Card in the weeks beforehand, fearing it would worsen an already volatile situation. Card's declining mental health was known to police, Army officials and family members, according to numerous interviews.
Mills and Frey said Wednesday that they have introduced legislation to grant subpoena authority to the commission as it investigates, a power that commissioners have said they will need.
""This legislation, which comes at the request of the Independent Commission, will ensure that the commission has the tools it needs to fully and effectively discharge its critical mission of determining the facts of the tragedy in Lewiston,"" Mills and Frey said in a statement.
Thursday's commission meeting is the first of four in which there will be an open forum for comments. Meetings with victims, Maine State Police and the Army are also scheduled.
The commission has said it ""will conduct its work in public to the greatest extent possible and issue a formal public report detailing its findings upon the conclusion of its investigation."" Members have said they hope to produce a full report by early summer.
MAINE AUTHORITIES THOUGHT CONFRONTING ROBERT CARD WOULD INFLAME SITUATION IN WEEKS BEFORE SHOOTING: VIDEO
Police were alerted last September by Army Reserves officials about Card, who had been hospitalized in July after exhibiting erratic behavior during training. Officials warned police that he had access to weapons and had threatened to ""shoot up"" an Army Reserve center in Saco.
An independent report by the Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Office after the shooting found that local law enforcement knew Card's mental health was declining and that he was hearing voices and experiencing psychotic episodes. The report cleared the agency's response to concerns about Card, but several legal experts have said it revealed missed opportunities to intervene.
The commission meeting Thursday is chaired by Daniel Wathen, former chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Other members include Debra Baeder, the former chief forensic psychologist for the state, and Paula Silsby, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Maine."

Five firefighters were injured, two by falling through a roof, while battling a blaze at three buildings in a Pittsburgh neighborhood over the weekend, authorities said.
Fire crews were called just before 9:30 a.m. Saturday to the Homewood neighborhood where the fire started in one home and spread to two adjacent buildings that contained apartments.

Authorities said two firefighters fell through the roof of one of the homes while battling the flames. The roofs of at least two of the houses collapsed. All five injured firefighters were taken to hospitals with injuries said not to be life-threatening, officials said.

Matt Brown, chief of Allegheny County Emergency Services, said fire crews were hampered by temperatures in the teens and winds up to 20 mph. The cold froze one truck's water pumps and tanks and also froze the closest fire hydrant, and a ladder on one truck also wasn't working properly due to the cold, he said.
At one point, firefighters used a chainsaw to cut away a second-floor wall to reach the flames inside one of the apartment buildings.

Brown said nearly 100 firefighters, many of them volunteers from surrounding communities, responded to the fire, which was declared under control at about 1 p.m. Saturday. The county fire marshal’s office will investigate the cause."

Police in Arkansas have launched a manhunt after an inmate being held on a murder charge and another detainee who is a ""suspect in a homicide"" vanished from a jail.
The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said Monday that Noah Roush and Jatonia Bryant ""may have escaped"" the Dub Brassell Adult Detention Center in Pine Bluff ""within the last 48 hours.""
The Sheriff’s Office said around 10:30 a.m. Monday, it ""discovered two of its detainees were missing"" from the jail outside of Little Rock.
""Both individuals are to be considered dangerous and should only be approached [by] law enforcement personnel,"" authorities warned. ""All efforts are being made at this moment to apprehend these suspects.

Roush, 22, was being held on ""probable cause for residential burglary and theft of property,"" according to police. The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said he is ""also a suspect in a homicide,"" without elaborating, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter by Fox News Digital.

""We had a head count this morning and they were missing, but it’s really just a guess as we don’t know at what point they were not in the facility,"" Jefferson County Maj.

Actor Ed O'Neill is explaining a stifling on-set feud with his longtime co-star.
O'Neill starred as Al Bundy in the sometimes controversial ""Married… with Children"" for 11 seasons. ""It was also kind of a show that no one wanted to admit that they liked,"" he told his pal Jesse Tyler Ferguson on his podcast, whom he starred alongside in another 11-season sitcom, ""Modern Family.""
O'Neill, now 77, reflected on his tenure on the show, admitting his feud with Amanda Bearse was something he regretted. ""We didn’t get along, and we did for a long time. We were great friends. And I could guess, I don’t want to speak for her… It started when we got the cover of TV Guide.""

O'Neill says Bearse and David Garrison, who played supporting characters Marcy D'Arcy and Steve Rhoades, were not to be featured. ""They were told they could not be on the cover. Because they had a rule: there's only so many [that] can be on the cover,"" he said of TV Guide's restrictions. ""Now they violated that for like two shows, I think it was ‘M*A*S*H’ and ‘Dallas,'"" he explained.
""That was an exception. They weren’t doing it for us. And we were lucky to get it. It was like the sixth year in or something,"" he said of the July-August 1989 cover. The show premiered in 1987. ""We were thrilled to get the cover of TV Guide. It was big. And Amanda and David came out in unison from their dressing room. We were on the soundstage, and she said, ‘We expect you to go to [co-creator] Ron Leavitt and tell him this doesn’t work. We’re all on the cover.'""
""If I was diplomatic, I should have said, ‘Fine. I’ll talk to him about it,'"" O'Neill suggested.

""That's my regret,"" O'Neill told Ferguson, admitting he would have done things differently in retrospect.

EXCLUSIVE -- Nonprofit organization Do No Harm voluntarily dropped its lawsuit against Health Affairs, a prominent health policy journal, without prejudice after racial requirements in their Health Equity Fellowship were eliminated.
Do No Harm Chairman Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, who has said his organization is ""opposed to discrimination in all of its manifestations,"" complained that Health Affairs ran a ""race-segregated health journal fellowship"" called Health Equity Fellowship for Trainees. Since his 2022 complaint, Health Affairs scrapped the ""racially discriminatory"" requirement.
""We are pleased that Health Affairs has decided to drop its racially discriminatory requirements for their fellowship. Segregation based on race is illegal and Health Affairs has recognized that. Do No Harm will continue to fight divisive and discriminatory ideology healthcare wherever we can find it,"" Dr. Goldfarb told Fox News Digital.
LAWSUIT CLAIMS FELLOWSHIP FOR MINORITIES IS ILLEGAL FOR BANNING WHITE APPLICANTS: ‘BLATANT DISCRIMINATION’

Health Affairs and its parent company are happy to put this behind them.
""Health Affairs and PROJECT HOPE are pleased that this lawsuit has been dismissed,"" a Health Affairs spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
Fox News Digital first reported that Do No Harm filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2022 which alleged that applicants to the Health Affairs fellowship needed to identify as ""American/Alaskan Indian, African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic/Latino"" to be eligible for a wide range of benefits including mentorship with published researchers.
""According to Defendants, however, White applicants need not apply,"" the 2022 complaint said.
Do No Harm, which fights what it considers undermining healthcare in pursuit of a political agenda, called the original requirements ""blatant discrimination"" against White applicants.
DO NO HARM AIMS TO KEEP LIBERAL IDEOLOGY OUT OF HEALTHCARE: ‘PHYSICIANS ARE BEING PUSHED TO DISCRIMINATE’
Nonprofit organization Do No Harm voluntarily dropped their lawsuit against Health Affairs, a prominent health policy journal, without prejudice after racial requirements in their Health Equity Fellowship were eliminated.
The Health Affair’s website previously stated the Health Equity Fellowship for Trainees (HEFT) is designed to ""increase the quantity and quality of manuscripts published by researchers of color, while cultivating future health equity research leaders.""
Now, HEFT ""helps to increase the quantity and quality of manuscripts published on the topic of health equity, while cultivating future health equity research leaders. HEFT currently focuses on manuscripts focused on the topic of health equity along the dimensions of race and ethnicity. We hope to expand to other dimensions of equity in the future,"" according to the Health Affairs website.
As a result of the changes, Do No Harm dismissed its lawsuit voluntarily against the journal and parent Project HOPE, without prejudice to filing it again should Health Affairs discriminate in the future.
""Defendants removed the race requirement that Do No Harm alleged was unlawful,"" Do No Harm counsel wrote in a notice of voluntary dismissal that has been obtained by Fox News Digital. ""Because Defendants appear to no longer consider race, and because Defendants have not yet filed an answer or a summary-judgment motion, Do No Harm voluntarily dismisses this action without prejudice.""

Health Affairs bills itself as ""the leading journal of health policy thought and research"" with a mission to ""serve as a high-level, nonpartisan forum to promote analysis and discussion on improving health and health care, and to address such issues as cost, quality, and access.""

XBYXMP3RK3_FSNCGAXPTWI9MKW,Fox News ‘Antisemitism Exposed’ Newsletter: Joe Lieberman's exclusive take on rising anti-Jewish hate,By Fox News Staff Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 7:53am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/fox-news-antisemitism-exposed-newsletter-former-democrat-senator-says-jew-hatred-reached-fever-pitch,"Harvard law student Jonathan Frieden weighs in after a professor who previously signed a letter accusing Israel of wanting to ethically cleanse Gaza was picked for the university's antisemitism task force.
Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.
IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER:
- OPINION: First Jewish-American VP nominee explains why antisemitism isn't just another headline- Antisemitism is getting worse as more 'shocking' and 'scary' incidents are exposed, DC residents say- Israeli-American chef from Turkish family battles antisemitism, is labeled a 'Nazi' after Oct. 7 terror attack
TOP STORY: Former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who made history as the first Jewish American to run for vice president, says he is shocked by the ""previously unimaginable events"" he has seen unfold in the United States since Hamas' terror attack on Israel on October 7. In an op-ed exclusively for Fox News Digital he reflects on the recent uptick of antisemitism in America. ""I was selected by Al Gore to be his running mate in 2000. I did not face antisemitism in public life. But since the 10/7 attacks, antisemitism has reached a fever pitch in America,"" Lieberman writes.
VIDEO: Americans in the nation's capital weighed in on antisemitism in the U.S. since Hamas attacked Israel, with most telling Fox News that hate against Jews has gotten worse in recent months. ""It's rather shocking, actually, how many people side with antisemitism and just hating people,"" Cori, of Washington, D.C., told Fox News. ""It's gotten much worse."" Between the attack and Jan. 7, there have been nearly 3,300 antisemitic incidents across the U.S. — an average of 34 a day and more than quadruple the number over the same period the year prior, according to preliminary Anti-Defamation League data published Jan. 9.
‘COMPLETE IGNORANCE’: First-generation Israeli-American Avi Shemtov, a multi-ethnic chef, has confronted racism, antisemitism and shocking charges of White supremacy ever since speaking out against the Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, he told Fox News Digital. ""People have basically called me a White supremacist,"" Shemtov said in an interview — despite the fact that his late father’s family is from Asia. ""There is complete ignorance about Israeli culture and background that leads people to believe this is very much a black-and-white racial cause,"" said Shemtov.
‘WORST CHOICE’: Yale Law School dean Heather Gerken is now reportedly one of the top candidates to take over as Yale's president despite a series of scandals, according to a recent report. ""She would be the worst choice out of all the current faculty,"" one student told The Washington Free Beacon. ""Her handling of campus politics has been abysmal."" Gerken has faced a series of controversies throughout her career, including when her chief of staff, Debra Kroszner, told Jewish students to seek counseling after Hamas' terror attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.
MEDIA BIAS: A progressive activist drew attention on social media after she argued the suffering of Jews isn't ""exceptional"" as she explained her support for Palestinians in light of the Israel-Hamas war. There have been ""so many similar genocides,"" Nicole Carty told The New York Times Magazine last week. She said at another point that it's ""so weird"" that the Jewish holiday of Passover is solely about ""Jewish subjugation.""
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: ""[I have] lost confidence in the determination and ability of the Harvard Corporation and Harvard leadership to maintain Harvard as a place where Jews and Israelis can flourish,"" former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers said.

XC0CKG214W_OQ1JS05UK1TFLZ6,Founder of Haitian orphanage arrested on federal charges of sexually abusing minors,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 10:28am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/founder-haitian-orphanage-arrested-federal-charges-sexually-abusing-minors,"New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu discusses the border crisis facing northern states and campaigning with GOP candidates in his state.
An orphanage founder in Haiti who faced past accusations of abusing boys in his care is facing criminal charges in the U.S. after an investigation revealed that he traveled to the Caribbean country to sexually abuse minors, federal officials said Tuesday.
Michael Geilenfeld, 71, previously sued a Maine activist over accusations he abused boys in Haiti, calling the claims ""vicious, vile lies,"" before an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI led to an indictment contending he traveled from Miami to the island nation ""for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person under 18.""
Geilenfeld, who was arrested in Colorado, is expected to have a detention hearing in Denver on Thursday before being flown to Miami, where the case originated, officials said. His Massachusetts lawyer, Robert Oberkoetter, declined to comment.
MILWAUKEE MAN INDICTED IN SEX TRAFFICKING CASE USED 'BIN LADEN' ALIAS: DOJ
Geilenfeld and North Carolina-based Hearts with Haiti sued the activist, Paul Kendrick, who accused Geilenfeld of being a serial pedophile after speaking to young men who claimed they were abused by Geilenfeld as boys in Port-au-Prince, where Geilenfeld founded the St. Joseph’s Home for Boys in 1985.
In a federal civil lawsuit in Maine, Geilenfeld and the charity blamed Kendrick for Geilenfeld's 237-day imprisonment in Haiti, damage to his reputation and the loss of millions of dollars in donations.
The activist's insurance companies ended the lawsuit in 2019 by paying $3 million to Hearts with Haiti, but nothing to Geilenfeld.

Kendrick had praise Tuesday for those who stood up to the man who held the purse strings to their education, food, shelter and clothing.
""It took an unbelievable amount of courage for them to come forward and report their abuse,"" he said.
The conduct cited by the grand jury happened between November 2006 and December 2010, when Geilenfeld was operating the orphanage.

The charge of traveling in foreign commerce for illicit sexual conduct has a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
Authorities in Haiti have long investigated sex abuse allegations against Geilenfeld, who was arrested in the Caribbean country in September 2014 but released a year later after his case was dismissed.
The alleged victims, who did not appear in court in Haiti, were granted an appeal, but the case has yet to go to trial as Haiti’s judicial system continues to crumble amid widespread corruption and a spike in gang violence."

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was lampooned Thursday after calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war when many pointed out that his own city could use one.
Chicago has become infamous for its crime crisis. Fox News analyst Gianno Caldwell, who lost his 18-year-old brother to a 2022 shooting incident in Chicago, has called his hometown an ""active war zone.""
Johnson has joined other progressives in calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, saying ""the killings need to stop,"" but his remarks didn’t go over well with conservatives when Chicago PBS reporter Heather Cherone shared them on social media.
Author Tim Murtaugh sarcastically responded, ""Has he achieved a cease-fire in Chicago and moved on to international diplomacy now?""
Journalist David Harsanyi joked, ""Netanyahu should call for a cease-fire in Chicago.""
One person wrote, ""Let's cease-fire Chicago first, champ,"" while another added, ""Would someone tell this guy about the crime and slaughter on Chicago's streets? These people are tone-deaf. That's not your job or your responsibility, Mayor.""

STRING OF RETAIL THEFTS, BURGLARIES BY MIGRANTS PLAGUING CHICAGO SUBURB: AUTHORITIES
New York Post reporter Jon Levine also asked if we could first have a cease-fire in Chicago, linking to a report about horrific summer violence in the Windy City.
A yearslong gang conflict between factions of the Black Disciples and Gangster Disciples on Chicago's South Side has contributed to the violence. Morris Pasqual, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago, recently said his office will continue working with law enforcement ""to prioritize combating the unacceptable level of gang violence in Chicago.""
Chicago also has a problem with car theft, as the number of vehicle thefts reported last year is the highest in 23 years, according to the Illinois Policy Institute. The arrest rate for car theft fall to 2.6%, but data collected through the Chicago Data Portal showed that it was the lowest level since the city started tracking crime online in 2001.
The Illinois Policy Institute's report also blames the city's ""on-going police officer shortage"" for not improving ""the city’s chances of catching offenders,"" citing Mayor Johnson's 2024 budget that eliminated 833 police positions.

CHICAGO MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON CALLS FOR REPARATIONS FUNDING TO REDUCE VIOLENT CRIME
The House Judiciary GOP's social media account also weighed in, saying, ""what we really need is a ceasefire in Chicago.""
Cities across the U.S. have passed proclamations calling for a cease-fire in the Middle East.
Attendees of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors went viral this month for dancing in celebration over the resolution they passed calling for one. There has been no indication Israel has taken heed of any American progressive calls for it to stop its military operations in Gaza.

The United States has temporarily paused ""additional"" funding for a key United Nations agency in the Gaza Strip over allegations that some of its members were ""involved"" in the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack in Israel.
""UNRWA can read the Beltway press well enough to know that Congress is moving to cut off U.S. funding,"" Richard Goldberg, former National Security Council (NSC) advisor during the Trump Administration, told Fox News Digital.
""This is a PR move designed to preempt congressional action. It does nothing to change the fact that UNRWA is complicit in Hamas war crimes and remains a key obstacle to peace,"" Goldberg, currently a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, added.
Twelve United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East employees were allegedly ""involved"" in the attack, and the U.S. funding will resume subject to an investigation from the United Nations.
UN'S TOP COURT ALLOWS ISRAEL TO KEEP FIGHTING IN GAZA, ORDERS IT TO ‘ADHERE TO THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION’
UNRWA, citing information provided by Israeli authorities, terminated the contract with the accused employees on Friday and announced an investigation ""to protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance"" and ""establish the truth without delay,"" Reuters reported.
The U.S. State Department in a press release said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres regarding the investigation, which will be ""comprehensive and independent."" The U.S. insisted that it must see ""complete accountability for anyone who participated in the heinous attacks of Oct. 7.""

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant praised the U.S. decision as ""an important step in holding UNRWA accountable.""
""At least a dozen UNRWA employees participated in the horrific attack conducted on Oct. 7: These are ‘humanitarian workers,’ with salaries paid for by international donations, with blood on their hands,"" Gallant said in a press release following the State Department's announcement.
UN APPEALS FOR $7.9 BILLION TO HELP MILLIONS OF MIGRANTS FLEE CLIMATE CHANGE, CONFLICT
""Major changes need to take place so that international efforts, funds, and humanitarian initiatives don’t fuel Hamas terrorism and the murder of Israelis,"" Gallant wrote. ""Terrorism under the guise of humanitarian work is a disgrace to the U.N. and the principles it claims to represent.""

The decision follows growing allegations that started in Dec. 2023 when an Israeli citizen taken hostage by Hamas said upon release that they had remained captive in the attic of a UNRWA teacher. Another hostage claimed that a Gazan doctor – allegedly a pediatrician – helped hold another hostage captive for Hamas.
UNRWA pushed back on the claim, calling it ""unsubstantiated"" after the Israeli journalist did not immediately respond to their requests for additional information, saying in an official statement, ""UNRWA and other entities in the United Nations have asked the journalist to provide more information on what we consider to be a very serious allegation. Despite repeated demands, the journalist has not responded,"" it was claimed.

UNRWA has faced several allegations, including corruption and directly helping Hamas, as documented in an X community note. Reuters reported on a former headmaster at a UNRWA school who helped build rockets for Islamic Jihad while employed by the agency, as well as posts from several UNRWA teachers and administrators celebrating the Oct. 7 attack.

The State Department under former President Trump cut ties with UNRWA in 2018, but President Biden resumed the relationship shortly after taking office. He continued to improve spending for the organization, with funds exceeding $1 billion.

Blinken also visited UNRWA HQ in November following his visit to Jordan during a visit to the Middle East. During that visit he praised the organization's humanitarian work in Gaza even as reports of UNRWA workers' involvement in the Hamas attack swirled.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee announced around Christmas 2023 that it would launch its own investigation into UNRWA and the alleged ties to Hamas: Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., insisted that there was ""extensive evidence of a troubling connection between UNRWA and Hamas, and it is far deeper than was known.""
Goldberg compared the recent decision to that of the Biden administration’s approach to the Iran assets following the Hamas attack, with many pressuring the White House to refreeze assets for Tehran due to its direct ties to the terrorist group.

""This looks a lot like the administration’s response to outcries over the $6 billion for Iran after Oct. 7,"" Goldberg argued. ""In the face of imminent legislation, the administration claimed it had frozen the money - but no law exists to enforce that temporary freeze.""
""Here, too, I fear the administration wants to get ahead of Congress prohibiting the aid in law, only to turn the spigot on once the supplemental has passed,"" he said.

""I’ve been trying now for this entire case to wrap my mind around how somebody could do something so horrific, not only to another human being but to their own child,"" Judge Matthew Kacel said. ""... You intentionally and systematically tortured this child. Let’s call it what it is: It’s torture. You tortured this child.""
A Michigan woman has been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the death of her 15-year-old son.
Timothy Ferguson had some mental disabilities, prosecutors have said.
Nolan Ferguson, the victim's brother, testified ""if I can’t have my brother back"" his mother ""shouldn’t have her freedom back.""
Vander Ark, wearing orange jail togs, declined to speak when given the chance and instead shook her head to indicate ""no.""
Vander Ark’s attorney, Fred Johnson, said his client brought Timothy into her home while working as a single mother who was putting herself through school and the difficulties that came with it.
""This is a survivor. A person who pulled herself up by her bootstraps,"" Johnson said. ""We’re not looking at evil, we’re looking at sick.""

Paul Ferguson, another brother of the victim, was also charged with first-degree child abuse in the case. He pleaded guilty in December 2023 and is expected to be sentenced in late February."
XJNB9W0124_47JRI4AD6AMYFPG,Hunter Biden lawyer testifies that 1st Trump impeachment created 'emergency' to file unpaid taxes,By Brooke Singman Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 9:01am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-lawyer-testifies-first-trump-impeachment-created-emergency-file-unpaid-taxes,"Co-hosts discuss the Hunter Biden investigation as he's to appear for closed-door House depositions on Feb. 28.
Hunter Biden’s lawyer, Kevin Morris, told congressional investigators that it was the first impeachment of then-President Trump in February 2020 that made it an ""emergency"" for the president’s son to file his tax returns, according to a transcript of his testimony reviewed by Fox News Digital.
Morris testified behind closed doors at the House Oversight Committee last week as part of the House impeachment inquiry against President Biden.
Congressional investigators had discovered an email from Morris in February 2020 that cited ""political risk"" amid the election cycle, when then-former Vice President Biden was a candidate in the Democrat primary.

KEVIN MORRIS GAVE 'MASSIVE' FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO HUNTER BIDEN, RAISING CAMPAIGN FINANCE CONCERNS: COMER
The email, which was shown to Morris during his interview, was dated Feb. 7, 2020, and said, ""[E]mergency is off for today. Still need to file Monday – we are under considerable risk personally and politically to get the [tax] returns in.""
When asked what the emergency was, Morris pointed to the Trump impeachment in which Republicans had threatened to call Hunter Biden to testify.
""You know, I believe that, you know, remember that the Trump impeachment process was going on at this time,"" Morris said. ""And they were [waving] around the possibility of calling Hunter … right until the very end. I believe that it wrapped up. I believe that was the … thing prompting us – you know, this is about preparing his tax returns.""
Morris explained that he had just started working with Hunter Biden, a client who was coming in ""from addiction stuff."" Morris said ""taxes are the most important thing,"" adding that it is his ""custom and practice to get the taxes straight.""
""It’s a part of – that’s part of recovery, making amends,"" he said. ""It's critical.""
FLASHBACK: DEMOCRATS CLASH WITH REPUBLICANS OVER PROSPECT OF CALLING HUNTER BIDEN IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
When pressed on whether the ""political"" concerns were due to Biden’s candidacy for office, Morris pushed back by saying ""[T]here’s no cardinality between these two things.""
""Personally, he hadn’t filed his taxes, OK? That’s his personal problem,"" Morris said of Hunter Biden. ""And then, politically … look, there was an impeachment proceeding going on. His name was and face was everywhere in the world.""
Morris, though, said the ""political risk"" had nothing to do with Joe Biden’s candidacy for the White House.
Morris testified that he loaned Hunter Biden at least $5 million and began paying his tax liability.

However, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said that was a move to ""insulate then-presidential candidate Joe Biden from political liability.""
Morris also told the committee that the ""loans"" he provided to Hunter Biden do not have to be repaid until 2025 – after the next presidential election – and could be forgiven, the committee said.
Trump was acquitted on Feb. 5, 2020, on both articles of impeachment against him – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – after being impeached by the House of Representatives in December 2019.
BIDENS ALLEGEDLY 'COERCED' BURISMA CEO TO PAY THEM MILLIONS TO HELP GET UKRAINE PROSECUTOR FIRED: FBI FORM
Trump was impeached after a July 2019 phone call in which he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch investigations into the Biden family’s actions and business dealings in Ukraine, specifically Hunter Biden’s ventures with Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings and Joe Biden’s successful effort to have former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin ousted.
Hunter Biden was quietly under federal investigation, beginning in 2018, at the time of the call, a probe prompted by suspicious foreign transactions.
Trump's request was regarded by Democrats as a quid pro quo because millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen. Democrats also said Trump was meddling in the 2020 presidential election by asking a foreign leader to look into a Democrat political opponent.
Republicans had been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings, specifically with regard to Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. House Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, made several requests to subpoena Hunter Biden for testimony and documents related to the impeachment of Trump and his business dealings that fell at the center of the proceedings.

Biden has acknowledged that when he was vice president, he successfully pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin. At the time, Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings and Hunter had a highly lucrative role on the board, receiving thousands of dollars per month. The then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion of critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired.
""I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.' … I looked at them and said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money,’"" Biden recalled telling then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Biden recollected the conversation during an event for the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.
""Well, son of a b----, he got fired,"" Biden said during the event. ""And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.""

Biden allies maintain the then-vice president pushed for Shokin's firing due to concerns the Ukrainian prosecutor went easy on corruption, and they say that his firing, at the time, was the policy position of the U.S. and international community.
Now, as part of the impeachment inquiry, Republicans are investigating any involvement Biden had in his son’s business dealings.
Republicans obtained an FBI FD-1023 form with a confidential human source detailing allegations made by Burisma CEO Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky alleged that he was ""coerced"" into paying Joe Biden and Hunter Biden millions of dollars to get Shokin fired amid the investigation into his firm.
Meanwhile, Hunter Biden has been under federal investigation since 2018.

Special Counsel David Weiss charged Biden with nine federal tax charges, which break down to three felonies and six misdemeanors for $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid.

Weiss charged Hunter in December, alleging a ""four-year scheme"" in which the president's son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.
Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Weiss also indicted the first son on federal gun charges in Delaware last year. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges as well. His attorneys are attempting to have that case dismissed.

She joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how she discovered the caves and what the city is doing to ensure public safety.
Another shanty town community has been found in central California, where homeless people have dug into a riverbank and live out of caves.
Residents of Riverbank, California, say that efforts to clean up a homeless camp on the banks of the Stanislaus River have been unsuccessful. The city is located about 10 miles north of Modesto, where a similar situation made national headlines after homeless people were found living in caves along the Tuolumne River.
""As soon as they get kicked out, the night after they get kicked out, they just start digging,"" Riverbank resident Eddie Eagleton told KOVR in an interview. ""Doesn't seem like anyone can slow them down or stop them.""
Eagleton, who frequently fishes in the Stanislaus River, said he has witnessed the homeless living out of caves dug into the banks below Highways 108 and 120.

""It's pretty amazing what 15 to 20 people can do in a night or two,"" Eagleton told the local news station. ""They got generators down there. They got power, water pumps.""
City officials have tried to clean up the area, warning that the encampments pollute the area and cause erosion along the river. But the people who've made it their home will not leave.
""It's a very high priority. First off, it's pollution. It's a danger to themselves or others if that river happens to rise rapidly,"" Riverbank Mayor Richard O'Brien told KOVR.
The mayor said his city remains in search of a solution that doesn't infringe on anyone's rights but also protects the environment and public health.
LOS ANGELES RECRUITS UP TO 6K VOLUNTEERS TO COUNT CITY'S HOMELESS POPULATION AS CRISIS WORSENS
Volunteers with Operation 2-9-99 and the Modesto Police Department participated in a joint clean-up operation along the Tuolumne River in Modesto, California, on January 23, 2024. Homeless people had set up an encampment near the river there, and a similar encampment was found about 10 miles north in Riverbank.  (Modesto Police Department)
""They have the right to live on public property, according to the courts. The Supreme Court is going to take that, so we'll see there,"" O'Brien said.
Complaints about the homelessness situation in Riverbank follow the discovery of at least eight caves in nearby Modesto that were inhabited by the homeless there.
Volunteers with Operation 9-2-99 and the Tuolumne River Trust worked with the Modesto Police Department to clear the caves out over the weekend, removing some 7,600 pounds of garbage from the area, authorities said.
""This particular area has been plagued by vagrancy and illegal camps, which have raised concerns due to the fact that these camps were actually caves dug into the riverbanks,"" the Modesto Police Department said in a statement.

The cleared debris filled two truckloads and a trailer, police added.
A KOVR camera crew sent to explore the Modesto caves reported finding bedding, belongings, food, items on a makeshift mantel, drugs and weapons inside. Tracy Rojas, a Modesto resident who lives near the caves, said it is dangerous for people to take up residence underground.

""If one of these were to collapse, it would be devastating,"" she told KOVR. ""This whole thing would come down and go into the water.""
Officials have since installed temporary barricades to keep people out of the caves.

A 76-year-old reformed mobster explained what compelled him to steal Dorothy's ruby red slippers from ""The Wizard of Oz"" in a final letter to the court ahead of his sentencing.
Terry Martin gave into the temptation of ""one last score"" and went ahead with the 2005 theft, his lawyer wrote in court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. He was allegedly approached by an ""old mob associate"" who asked Martin if he would steal the shoes worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film.
""At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a ‘final score’ kept him up at night,"" Dane DeKrey wrote. ""After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse and decided to participate in the theft.""

When Martin stole the slippers in 2005 from a museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, he did not realize the rubies affixed to the shoes were not real.
""Unaware of the cultural significance and value of the slippers themselves, Terry angrily decided to simply cut his losses and move on,"" according to DeKrey. ""He gave the slippers to the associate who had recruited him for the job and told the man that he never wanted to see them again.""
At the time of the theft, the slippers were insured for $1 million and the fair market appraisal value of the slippers in May 2023 was $3.5 million, the Department of Justice wrote in a press release.

""The ruby slippers, which were recovered by the FBI and Grand Rapids Police Department in July 2018, are one of the four remaining pairs and are widely viewed as among the most recognizable memorabilia in American film history,"" the press release stated.

Martin had the slippers in his possession for less than 48 hours before handing them over to the unnamed associate, according to the memo.
Martin's memo, filed Jan. 19, is Martin's request to be sentenced to time served due to his failing health. According to his lawyer, Martin is ""at death's door"" and has qualified for hospice care.
""Terry Martin never meant to be a criminal celebrity. He happened upon it when he broke two panes of glass in a museum and stole a pair of red sequined slippers,"" his lawyer said. ""He deeply regrets this decision and is ready to accept his punishment. But he’s no monster. He’s a dying man ready to meet his maker. He asks the Court to accept the parties’ joint plea agreement and sentence him to time served.""

The former mobster's lawyers and federal prosecutors have both recommended the judge sentence him to time served due to his health.

XPDY1Y0H1K_7ZRPHVAIJF8S8VA,Minnesota lawmakers initiate debate on physician-assisted suicide bill,Associated Press,"Published January 26, 2024 11:03am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-lawmakers-initiate-debate-physician-assisted-suicide-bill,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Minnesota Legislature kicked off debate Thursday on whether the state should join the list of those that allow physician-assisted suicide.
A House health committee took the unusual step of giving the bill a hearing even before the legislative session formally convenes Feb. 12. The lead sponsor, Democratic Rep. Mike Freiberg, of Golden Valley, who first introduced a similar proposal in 2015, said at a news conference beforehand that he was confident it will pass at least the House this year. Years of experience in states with similar laws such as Oregon and Washington, show that they work as intended, and they are used only by a narrow group of patients with terminal illnesses, he said.
Nancy Unde, of Corcoran, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in late 2022, told reporters that she wants the right to choose a peaceful, painless death on her own terms.

""This bill has been in front of the Minnesota legislature for 10 years already. It’s time to act,"" Unde said. ""As I imagine the end of my life, I would like to be able to say my goodbyes and go peacefully. I’m thankful that we have hospice as an option. I will use it for the maximum comfort I can. But if it’s not enough, in the end, I want the option to die gently in my sleep.""

Ten states and the District of Columbia already allow some form of physician-assisted suicide, while proponents are planning fresh pushes to pass it this year in several other states. Oregon became the first state to legalize it in 1994. Vermont dropped its residency requirement last May, while Oregon did so in 2022.
While a New York bill has stalled for years, it is slowly gaining momentum with more lawmakers signing on as sponsors. Supporters in Connecticut held a news conference two weeks ago to announce a renewed effort after it passed one committee last year but stalled in another. A terminally ill Connecticut woman made news earlier this month by traveling to Vermont to end her life.
The Minnesota bill would allow patients age 18 and older who are suffering terminal illnesses and have less than six months to live obtain drugs they could take to end their own lives. The safeguards include a requirement that two providers, one of whom must be a physician, would have to certify that the patient meets the criteria. Patients would have to have the mental capacity to make their own health care decisions and provide informed consent, so those with dementia would not qualify. They would have to take the drugs themselves. The bill does not require that patients be Minnesota residents.
Freiberg said he is optimistic because his bill already has around 25 cosponsors, and that it's ""consistent with legislation that advances bodily autonomy"" — abortion and trans rights bills — that became law last year. But its prospects are less clear in the Senate, where Democrats hold just a one-seat majority and one Democratic senator, John Hoffman, of Champlin, has already come out against the proposal.
Freiberg said he was hopeful of getting some Republican support. But no GOP lawmakers on the committee were present at the start of the hearing, which drew an overflow crowd and a long list of testifiers, though they arrived later and offered amendments aimed at softening the impact of the bill.
ASSISTED DEATHS MAY SOON BE A REALITY FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS IN CANADA
""Intentionally ending a human life is wrong. It doesn’t matter what name we call it,"" testified Chris Massoglia, of Blaine, representing Americans United for Life. ""Suicide is not health care. And it’s completely unnecessary due to the advances in palliative and end-of-life care.""
Nancy Utoft, president of the Minnesota Alliance for Ethical Healthcare, said at a news conference beforehand that the legislation lacks sufficient safeguards to protect the elderly, disabled and other vulnerable people. Current law already gives people the right to make legally binding end-of-care health care directives, the right to hospice and palliative care, and the right to refuse care, she said.
""If these rights were better known and executed, we wouldn’t hear the heartbreaking stories of over-treatment often shared by assisted suicide proponents,"" Utoft said. ""Let’s prioritize policies that promote better care for everyone."""

Merapi erupts, displacing thousands",Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 10:19am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/indonesias-mt-merapi-erupts-displacing-thousands,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Indonesia’s Mount Merapi erupted Sunday, spreading searing gas clouds and avalanches of lava down its slopes as other active volcanoes flared up across the country, forcing the evacuation of thousands.
On the densely populated island of Java, Merapi unleashed clouds of hot ash and a mixture of rock, and lava that traveled up to 1.2 miles down its slopes, said Agus Budi Santoso, the head of Indonesia's Geological Disaster Technology Research and Development Center. A column of hot clouds blasted about 109 yards into the air as ash blanketed several villages without casualties, he added.
Merapi is the most active out of more than 120 volcanoes across the country. Sunday's eruption is the latest since authorities raised its alert level to the second-highest in November 2020 after sensors picked up increasing activity. Residents living on the slopes were advised to stay 4.3 miles away from the crater’s mouth and be aware of possible threats from flowing lava.

In 2010, an eruption killed 347 people and displaced 20,000 villagers.
The 9,737-foot mountain is about 18 miles from Yogyakarta, an ancient center of Javanese culture and the seat of royal dynasties going back centuries. About a quarter million people live within 6 miles of the volcano.
Several other active volcanoes also blew up this weekend, prompting authorities to evacuate thousands of residents, said Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation in a statement released on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. No casualties were reported, it said.

The agency said Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in East Nusa Tenggara province spewed hot clouds as high as 2,300 feet into the air on Sunday, as more than 6,500 people fled to shelters.
Also on Sunday, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province erupted again, its third biggest flare-up this month, albeit without discharging lava. About 500 residents living near it were evacuated. Last month, it erupted, killing 23 climbers and injuring several others.
Mount Semeru in East Java province released searing gas clouds and rivers of lava on Saturday, as did Mount Ibu on Halmahera island in North Maluku province which shot a column of hot ashes as high as 4,265 feet into the air.
In December 2021, Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Java island, erupted, leaving 48 people dead and 36 missing.

An Obama-appointed judge ruled in favor of a Pennsylvania college professor who sued his employer over critical race theory trainings he alleged were anti-White, including one that said ""White Teachers are a Problem,"" according to a lawsuit.
A former professor at Penn State Abington, Zack De Piero, sued for race discrimination after he was allegedly subjected to training that the English language is racist and the embodiment of ""White supremacy,"" along with additional tirades against White people in professional development sessions and meetings, according to a lawsuit.
He explained to Fox News Digital in an interview Wednesday that the trainings were traumatic since he can't get them out of his head.

Judge Wendy Beetlestone of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania rules against Penn State Abington's request to dismiss the racial discrimination case.  (Screenshot/YouTube )
""There's a constant ticker tape, like a newsreel. I see, I hear that disgusting evil phrase. ‘White teachers are a problem,'"" he said. ""I wish I could get it out of my head, but I can't.""
""I still wake up with this stuff. I still go to bed with this stuff. It still bothers me. It's changed me in a lot of ways. You often hear that hardship leads to greater character. While that might be true, it certainly comes at a cost,"" he said.
Judge Wendy Beetlestone of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled on Jan. 11 that Professor De Piero had solid grounds to proceed in his race discrimination lawsuit despite Penn State's request for it to be dismissed.
Beetlestone said that discussing the ""influence of racism on our society does not violate federal law."" But when considering whether to allow the professor's suit to progress, she considered the type of CRT training used at Penn State Abington.

NEVADA MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER CALLS WHITE PEOPLE 'PROBLEMATIC,' CLAIMS EDUCATION IS RACIST: 'START A RIOT'
""Training on concepts such as… critical race theory can contribute positively… to form a healthy and inclusive working environment,"" she said. ""But the way these conversations are carried out in the workplace matters: When employers talk about race — any race — with a constant drumbeat of essentialist, deterministic, and negative language, they risk liability under federal law.""
De Piero ""was individually singled out for ridicule and humiliation because of the color of his skin,"" according to the original lawsuit filed by the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism (FAIR).
When he complained about ""the continuous stream of racial insult directed at White faculty,"" he was told by the director of the Affirmative Action office that ""There is a problem with the White race."" The administrator went on to say that the professor should attend ""antiracist"" workshops ""until you get it.""
Some of the workshops included a presentation captioned ""White Teachers are a Problem,"" according to the lawsuit.
""I see this as an ideological mob that is hostile to free speech, civil discourse, true debate, empirical data,"" the professor said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion agendas have frequently been enmeshed with concepts from critical race theory in education.  (Adobe Stock)
His direct report in the English department, Liliana Naydan, ""expressed her view that racism practiced against White faculty and students is legitimate,"" according to the lawsuit. Naydan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit alleged Naydan tried to coerce faculty to introduce equity into the grading process to ensure there weren't disparities by ""penaliz[ing] students academically on the basis of race.""
An equity administrator named in the suit, Alina Wong, engaged in breathing exercises in one session and suggested White staff needed to hold their breath longer than people of color in order to ""'feel the pain’ that George Floyd endured,"" according to the lawsuit.
""De Piero and other faculty were thus singled out, caused to experience discomfort, and feel ‘the pain’ on the basis of their skin color,"" the lawsuit said. Wong no longer works at Penn State.
Another professional development video said that ""White English… kills people of color,"" according to the suit.

Penn State also officially warned De Piero that ""dissenting from Penn State’s race-based dogma"" would result in ""disciplinary action,"" the lawsuit said.
The professor ended up leaving his position.
""Penn State actively treated De Piero as the problem, suggesting mental health treatment and disciplining him for bullying when he dared to complain. As a result, De Piero’s only option to escape the hostile environment was to leave Penn State. This constructive termination occurred on August 2, 2022,"" the lawsuit said.

The Supreme Court blocked the latest effort to execute Glossip in early May.
Despite Drummond's doubts about the trial, an Oklahoma appeals court upheld Glossip’s conviction, and the state’s pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency.
But Drummond also has said he does not believe Glossip is innocent of the murder-for-hire killing of his former boss, Barry Van Treese, in 1997. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing and killing Van Treese after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.
OKLAHOMA DEATH ROW INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP DENIED CLEMENCY AS HE FACES 9TH EXECUTION DATE
Two separate independent investigations have revealed problems with the prosecution’s case.
Drummond said that Sneed lied on the witness stand about his psychiatric condition and his reason for taking the mood-stabilizing drug lithium and that prosecutors knew Sneed was lying.
Also, evidence was destroyed, Drummond said.
Some Republican state lawmakers who support the death penalty have joined the growing chorus of Glossip supporters who are seeking to overturn his conviction.
Glossip’s case has been to the Supreme Court before. He was given a reprieve in 2015, although the court later ruled 5-4 against him in a case involving the drugs used in lethal executions.
Glossip has been just hours away from being executed three times. His last scheduled execution, in September 2015, was halted just moments before he was to be led to the death chamber when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. That mix-up helped prompt a nearly seven-year moratorium on the death penalty in Oklahoma.
Glossip’s case attracted international attention after actor Susan Sarandon — who won an Academy Award for her portrayal of death penalty opponent Sister Helen Prejean in the 1995 movie ""Dead Man Walking"" — took up his cause in real life. Prejean herself has served as Glossip’s spiritual adviser and frequently visited him in prison. His case also was featured in the 2017 documentary film ""Killing Richard Glossip.""
OKLAHOMA AG INTERVENES TO STOP DEATH ROW INMATE RICHARD GLOSSIP'S 9TH EXECUTION DATE
It's exceedingly rare for a prosecutor to argue against executing a death row inmate. In a similar situation to Glossip’s a year ago, the justices ordered a Texas appeals court to look again at the case of a death row inmate who also had the backing of prosecutors. The inmate, Areli Escobar, had been convicted and sentenced to death based on forensic evidence that a judge later found to be flawed.
But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the judge’s order for a new trial, even though the newly elected prosecutor in Travis County, Texas, was no longer standing behind the conviction. When Escobar appealed to the Supreme Court, the prosecutor supported his bid. Escobar was not facing imminent execution.
The Supreme Court will hear Glossip's case with only eight justices. Justice Neil Gorsuch is not taking part, presumably because he was involved at an earlier stage of the case when he was an appeals court judge.
The high court had been weighing Glossip's appeal since late September. The reason for the delay in acting on it is unclear."

Gen Keith Kellogg on growing concerns of conflict in the Middle East against U.S. troops.
Fox News contributor Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg joined ""America Reports"" on Monday to discuss the Iran-backed militants striking an air base in Iraq, leaving several U.S. personnel under evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. Kellogg said the Biden administration ""normalized"" these kinds of attacks.
US NAVY CONFIRMS IRAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN YEMEN HOUTHI REBEL SHIP ATTACKS
LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG: Here's the problem you've got with this [Biden] administration. They've normalized this activity. What I mean by that, you know, what happens if the Iranians, Iranian proxy forces, attack? We really don't do anything. Uh, we have limited attacks into Yemen after attacks on the vessels in the Red Sea. We look at our allies, who really don't believe what we're doing with our Operation Prosperity Guardian, where they did, the Italians and the Spanish. The French have kind of gone their own way. You look at what's happening in the Middle East with the Chinese brokering a deal with the Iranians in the shot, and all this built into deterrence. And people just don't believe us anymore, that we're really serious about deterrence. And it's going to take something super hard to bring this all back and put it back into a box. The Iranians don't believe it. The proxy forces don't believe it. So we've got a major problem, this administration does right now.
US PERSONNEL INJURED IN LATEST MILITANT BASE ATTACK IN IRAQU.S. personnel were injured during an attack on the Al-Asad Airbase in Iraq Saturday, and a member of Iraq's security forces was seriously wounded, according to reports.
The base came under a tactical missile attack, and more than 15 U.S. Patriot missiles were launched to intercept. But some missiles got through, according to Charles Lister, a senior fellow and director of the Middle East Institute Syria Program and the Middle East Institute Countering Terrorism and Extremism Program.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants, claimed responsibility, Lister wrote.

Greg Abbott and the Biden administration and new social media legislation that could affect children under 16 years old.
Billionaire Bill Ackman is calling on President Biden to secure the border as Texas battles with the federal government over its authority to defend itself from illegal border crossings.
Ackman was responding to a letter from former FBI agents who told leaders in Congress that low security at the border is one of the most ""pernicious"" threats to Americans.
""Military aged men from across the globe, many from countries or regions not friendly to the United States, are landing in waves on our soil by the thousands,"" the former FBI agents wrote.

""I find the [FBI] agents’ message irrefutable and extremely concerning,"" Ackman wrote. ""It is shocking that [Biden] is fighting Texas’ attempt to protect our southern border. Why aren’t Federal agents protecting our border rather than fighting to keep the border open to millions of unaccountable masses entering illegally at a time of great geopolitical uncertainty and heightened terrorism risk?""
""How does this make any sense for the safety and security of our country?"" he asked. ""What is Biden or, perhaps better said, the people behind Biden thinking?""
Ackman also wrote that the debate over the border makes it almost a ""certainty"" that Biden will ""lose the election"" in a post on X Friday.
TEXAS SLAMS BIDEN ADMIN, PROMISES TOUGH BORDER MEASURES AFTER SCOTUS RAZOR WIRE RULING
The latest Supreme Court decision in Texas’ battle with the Biden White House has sparked a showdown over the Lone Star State’s constitutional authority to defend itself with the federal government seemingly getting in its way.
On Monday, in a 5-4 decision on an emergency appeal, the Supreme Court ruled to temporarily overturn a lower court’s injunction that banned the federal government from cutting razor fencing Texas had installed along the border near Eagle Pass while litigation continues.
Late Wednesday night, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared his constitutional authority to reserve the right of his state to self-defense against an invasion, adding that the executive branch had broken its constitutional pact with the states by failing to enforce federal immigration laws.

MANCHESTER, N.H. - Former President Donald Trump did it again.
Eight days after he crushed the competition in Iowa's low-turnout Republican presidential caucuses, Trump quickly defeated Nikki Haley - his final remaining major rival for the GOP nomination - in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
Fox News projected Trump would win the primary just a few minutes after the final polls closed in New Hampshire.
""I’m very honored by the result,"" Trump told Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman in a statement.
Haley said in a speech to supporters in Concord, New Hampshire after the race was called that ""I want to congratulate Donald Trump on his victory tonight. He earned it and I want to acknowledge that.""
FOX DIGITAL EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP REACTS AFTER NEW HAMPSHIRE VICTORY
When asked if he felt Haley would suspend her campaign, Trump told Fox News Digital that he didn't know but ""she should.""
But as the votes continued to be tabulated late on Tuesday night, the former president's lead over Haley hovered roughly at a ten to eleven point margin, below what most of the final public opinion surveys conducted ahead of the primary had suggested.
And Haley emphasized her campaign would continue.
""Now you’ve all heard the chatter among the political class. They’re falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not last in the nation. This race is far from over.""
CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
Trump, speaking to supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire about an hour later, argued that Haley ""ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely"" and delivered ""a speech like she won. She didn’t’ win. She lost.""
""Let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night. She had a very bad night,"" Trump emphasized.

For Haley, a former two-term South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, the New Hampshire primary was seen as her best and possibly last chance to slow down or derail the former president's march towards renomination.
New Hampshire – where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary – was considered fertile ground for Haley. And Haley spent plenty of time and resources in the state, and secured the influential endorsement of popular Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.
With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropping out of the race on Sunday, a GOP presidential field that topped a dozen candidates last summer is now down to two major candidates.
""Now we’re the last one standing next to Donald Trump. And today we got close to half the vote. We still have ways to go, but we still keep moving up,"" Haley emphasized.

Haley's home state of South Carolina holds the next major contest in the Republican calendar - but the primary isn't until Feb. 24. Haley repeatedly insisted in recent days that she would be marching on to South Carolina.
And Haley on Tuesday night stressed that ""there are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.""
A source in Haley's political orbit told Fox News that there are ""now two states where Trump got barely half the vote. That's incredibly weak for an incumbent.""

For Trump, the victory in New Hampshire following his big win in Iowa moves him another step closer to his goal of winning back the White House.
At the dawn of 2023, the former president was the only declared candidate in the race for the Republican nomination, but he was far from a sure thing.
A year later, the former president once again holds massive sway over the party. Helping to boost his standing - Trump's legal difficulties.
Trump made history last year as the first former or current president to be indicted for a crime. But his four indictments, including charges he tried to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to President Biden, have only fueled his support among Republican voters.

The network’s chief political analyst spoke with MSNBC anchor Katy Tur on Tuesday about Trump’s hold over the GOP just hours ahead of his primary showdown with Nikki Haley in New Hampshire.
Both Todd and Tur discussed how Haley is having a hard time breaking through to voters with her vision for the party as Trump has completely transformed it since he first ran for president in 2015.

The NBC News analyst explained the influence Trump has, saying, ""He hasn’t changed, but now whatever he says is conservative is now the definition of conservative.""
Todd went on to describe Trump remaking the party into one akin to the Democratic Party nearly a century ago. ""He’s making today’s Republican Party what the Democratic Party was in the 30s and 40s: populist, working class.""
Tur interjected, ""Isolationist,"" with which Todd agreed while adding one more description. ""A little isolationist, a little segregationist,"" he said.

He continued, ""I am also mindful – political parties change. There was a time when Republicans were the party of McCarthy. They weeded that out. There was a time when Democrats were the party of segregationists. They weeded that out.""
Noting how parties ""can evolve,"" he mentioned that ""the Cheneys and the Romneys – they’ve been shoved out of this version of the party.""
Todd added that Nikki Haley’s candidacy represents that non-Trumpian wing of the party that is ""dissenting"" by competing against the former president.

James Comer, R-Ky., joins ""Hannity"" to discuss the ongoing probe into President Biden's alleged connection to Hunter Biden's business dealings.
Hunter Biden’s business associate involved in his dealings with Chinese energy company CEFC is expected to appear for a closed-door transcribed interview Thursday morning before the House Oversight and Judiciary committees.
Mervyn Yan, who worked with the first son on deals with Chinese energy company CEFC, was subpoenaed last November to appear as part of the House impeachment inquiry against President Biden.
He is expected to appear at 10 a.m. on Capitol Hill.
JOE BIDEN RECEIVED $40K IN 'LAUNDERED CHINA MONEY' FROM BROTHER IN 2017, COMER SAYS
House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer and Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan notified Yan of his subpoena and explained the reason for compelling his appearance.
""President Biden has received money originating from China via James and Hunter Biden, individuals with whom your client has previously engaged in business,"" Comer and Jordan wrote to Yan's attorney. ""James Biden maintained a business relationship with Hunter Biden, and the two engaged in several business deals, including a deal with Chinese energy company CEFC China Energy (CEFC), which is closely ties to the Chinese Communist Party through its founder, Chairman Ye Jianming.""

Fox News Digital first reported on the funds transferred to Joe Biden in November.
Comer said the ""money trail"" began in July 2017 when Hunter Biden demanded a $10 million payment from a CEFC associate. In a WhatsApp message, Hunter Biden ""was sitting with his father and that the Biden network would turn on his associate if he didn’t pony up the money,"" Comer said.
Hunter Biden in the WhatsApp message allegedly told a Chinese business associate from Chinese energy company CEFC that he and his father would ensure ""you will regret not following my direction.""
Hunter requested the $10 million wire for his joint-venture with CEFC called SinoHawk Holdings.
""I am sitting here with my father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled,"" Hunter Biden told Henry Zhao, the director of Chinese asset management firm Harvest Fund Management. ""And, Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction.""
Zhao responded, in part, ""CEFC is willing to cooperate with the family.""
HUNTER BIDEN REQUESTED KEYS FOR NEW 'OFFICE MATES' JOE BIDEN, CHINESE 'EMISSARY' TO CEFC CHAIRMAN, EMAILS SHOW
The Oversight Committee then obtained bank records that showed on Aug. 8, 2017, the $5 million in funds were sent to Hudson West III, a joint venture established by Hunter Biden and CEFC associate Gongwen Dong. The same day, Hudson West III sent $400,000 to Owasco PC — a separate entity controlled and owned by Hunter Biden, Comer said.
Days later, on Aug. 14, 2017, the records show Hunter Biden wired $150,000 to Lion Hall Group, a company owned by James Biden and his wife, Sara Biden. By Aug. 28, 2017, Comer said Sara Biden withdrew $50,000 in cash from Lion Hall Group and later deposited it into her and James Biden’s personal checking account.
Sara Biden wrote a check to Joe Biden a few days later for $40,000, with a memo line of the check reading ""loan repayment.""

While President Biden has maintained he was never in business with his son, text messages obtained by Fox News Digital in 2020 revealed that in May 2017 he met with Hunter's business associates for the Sinohawk venture, specifically Tony Bobulinski. The meeting on May 2, 2017, would have taken place just 11 days before a May 13, 2017, email obtained by Fox News in 2020 that included a discussion of ""remuneration packages"" for six people in the business deal with CEFC.

The email includes a note that ""Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate."" A proposed equity split references ""20"" for ""H"" and ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" with no further details.
The ""big guy"" has been said to be a reference to President Biden.

Also, Fox News Digital in December 2020 reported that Hunter Biden, his CEFC associate, Gongwen Dong, and Joe Biden shared office space in Washington, D.C., in September 2017.
Meanwhile, Comer and Jordan, in demanding Yan’s testimony, said they expect he will ""provide evidence that is relevant to the impeachment inquiry,"" specifically related to his ""knowledge of how James Biden and Hunter Biden operated their businesses and structured their financial transactions, and your client may also know whether and how President Biden has been involved in his family’s business dealings.""

Comer and Jordan also said Yan could be in a position to provide information on whether Joe Biden, as vice president or as president, ""took any official action or effected any change in government policy because of money or other things of value provided to himself or his family, including whether concerns that Chinese sources may release additional evidence about their business relationships with the Biden family have had any impact on official acts performed by President Biden or U.S. foreign policy.""

They also said he may provide evidence of whether Joe Biden ""abused his office of public trust by providing foreign interests with access to him and his office in exchange for payments to his family or him"" or ""abused his office of public trust by knowingly participating in a scheme to enrich himself or his family by giving foreign interests the impression that they would receive access to him and his office in exchange for payments to his family or him.""

Yan’s transcribed interview is expected to take place a day before Hunter Biden business associate Rob Walker appears for testimony and weeks before Hunter Biden appears for his deposition.
Biden defied his subpoena to appear for a deposition on Dec. 13 and was at risk of being held in contempt of Congress.
His attorneys and the committees came to an agreement last week that the first son will appear for a closed-door deposition on Feb. 28.

Evers secures federal funding for historic land conservation deal despite GOP opposition,Associated Press,"Published January 24, 2024 6:39am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-gov-evers-secures-federal-funding-historic-land-conservation-deal-gop-opposition,"Bret Baier showcases how both parties are vying for voters in Wisconsin and how past candidates have performed in the state on ‘Special Report.’
Gov. Tony Evers announced Tuesday that he has secured federal money to complete the largest land conservation purchase in Wisconsin history, going around Republicans in the Legislature who had blocked the project.
The state Department of Natural Resources planned last year to spend about $4 million from the state’s Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program to help finance the purchase of the nearly 70,000 acre property east of Rhinelander in northern Wisconsin known as the Pelican River Forest. The U.S. Forestry Service had agreed to pay the remaining 75% of the easement.
Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee in April blocked spending stewardship dollars on the project. Sen. Mary Felzkowski, one of the lawmakers who objected to the project, said she was worried about the effect removing that much land from future potential development would have on northern Wisconsin’s economy. The GOP has long criticized the stewardship program because it removes blocks of private land from local tax rolls and prevents development.

Evers announced Tuesday in his State of the State address that the U.S. Forestry Service’s Forest Legacy Program would fund the state’s share of the easement, thereby getting around the Legislature's budget committee.

The rejection of that project was cited by Evers in his lawsuit filed with the Wisconsin Supreme Court in October arguing that the Legislature is obstructing basic government functions.

YNSK9OAWXB_DVQ1UK13LS1JJCG,Dean Phillips says he's 'resisting the delusional DNC' by primary challenging 'unelectable' Biden,By Paul Steinhauser Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 4:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dean-phillips-touts-hes-resisting-delusional-dnc-by-primary-challenging-unelectable-biden,"Democrat Rep. Dean Phillips, who's primary challenging President Biden, predicts New Hampshire voters ""will show that he’s unelectable.""
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota says President Biden should be on the ballot in Tuesday's New Hampshire Democrat presidential primary.
And Phillips, who in October launched a long-shot primary challenge against the president, is taking aim at the Democratic Party for keeping him off the ballot in some upcoming primaries.
Phillips, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, launched his campaign for the White House in late October and is focusing most of his time and resources on New Hampshire, where the president's name won't be on the ballot Tuesday in the state's unsanctioned Democrat primary. Top Democrats in the state have launched a write-in campaign on the president's behalf.
Phillips says he's invested $5 million of his own money in his White House bid.
""A lot more than I intended,"" he noted in an interview with Fox News Digital. But he said his investment may be starting to pay off as ""grassroots donors are really starting to pop up.""
His ads are playing on New Hampshire airwaves in an effort to improve his name recognition.
Asked where he needs to finish in New Hampshire's primary, Phillips said, ""[W]e started at zero just 10 weeks ago. My name is not yet well known. And I think getting in the 20s would be an extraordinary accomplishment.""
PHILLIPS SAYS IT WILL BE ‘GAME ON’ WITH BIDEN IF HE SURPRISES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

That appears to be a lowering of expectations from a few weeks earlier, but the latest poll in the Granite State's Democrat primary indicates Phillips is far short of that goal. He stands at 10% in a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll conducted Jan. 16-19, a point ahead of bestselling author and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, who is making her second straight White House run.
Sixty-three percent of those questioned in the survey said they'd write in Biden's name.
""I think what people should really be paying attention to is how strong is the incumbent president. When Bill Clinton was reelected as the incumbent in New Hampshire, he got 84%. When Barack Obama was reelected, he got 81%. So, I think those should be the benchmarks. What does Joe Biden earn in New Hampshire?"" Phillips said.
And he argued that ""if I get in the 20s, and he’s somewhere in the 50s or something, that is an extraordinary challenge for an incumbent to overcome. And I think that’s really the story here. I believe he’s unelectable. Polls are showing he’s unelectable. Now I think voters will show that he’s unelectable.""
PHILLIPS TAKES AIM AT BIDEN ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL
While the president is the commanding front-runner for his party’s 2024 nomination, polls indicate that many Americans – including plenty of Democrats – don't want the president to seek a second term in the White House. Those same surveys spotlight that voters are not thrilled with the likely prospect of a rematch between Biden and the candidate he defeated in 2020: former President Trump.
The president more than a year ago proposed a nominating calendar for the 2024 election cycle that booted New Hampshire from its traditional leadoff primary position and replaced it with South Carolina, a much more diverse state where Black voters play an outsized role in Democrat politics.

Biden came in a dismal fifth in the 2020 New Hampshire primary, but a few weeks later he won South Carolina in a landslide. The victory boosted the former vice president toward the Democrat nomination and eventually the White House.
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) a year ago overwhelmingly approved the calendar change proposed by the president. But New Hampshire leapfrogged South Carolina to honor a longtime state law that mandates the state holds the first primary. With the state holding an unsanctioned Democrat contest, the president's reelection campaign last autumn announced that Biden wouldn't file to place his name on the New Hampshire ballot.
Phillips, interviewed by Fox News on Friday at his New Hampshire campaign headquarters in Manchester, said, ""I’m better positioned to beat Donald Trump, and over the coming weeks and months, I’ll demonstrate that.""
""If it is Joe Biden – somehow he recovers, which I do not think is possible – of course I would support him. And I think it’s not unlikely that perhaps someone else appears that might be in a position to win. But right now, I intend to be that person. I believe that we must stop a very dangerous man from returning to the White House.""

Trump, at the start of his large rally Saturday night in Manchester, urged New Hampshire Democrats to vote for Phillips to send a signal to Biden that ""you don’t abandon us.""
The former president bragged that due to his comment, Phillips ""probably just picked up a lot of votes.""
Phillips has been taking aim at his party over the move by the Florida and North Carolina Democrats to keep him off the primary ballot in their states, as they listed only Biden's name.
Some Republican state parties made similar moves in the 2020 cycle when Trump, as the incumbent president, was running for reelection.
""The state of Florida Democratic Party decided that Joe Biden won the primary election and that there did not need to be any votes cast, disenfranchising 4 million voters or so. The state of North Carolina did the same thing. The state of Massachusetts Democrats attempted the same thing, but the secretary of state intervened,"" Phillips told Fox News.
And he argued that ""when you’re trying to suppress voters, suppress candidates, and not even agree to debate, yeah, I think we have a problem with democracy, so I would ask of the president before I condemn him specifically: answer the questions. Why don’t you ask him that question?""
Asked if he had proof that Biden was actively involved in the efforts to keep Phillips off the ballot in certain states, the candidate responded, ""I have no proof of that. I also have not seen one member of the media ask him that question, and that is exactly my contention. If you’re the president, or if you’re seeking the presidency, you should stand before the press and answer those questions. Until somebody does, I don’t know the answer, but I think it’s pretty evident that something’s going on.""
The Biden campaign has not commented on the controversy. But at a news conference in Des Moines, Iowa, last week ahead of that state's caucuses, Biden campaign co-chair and former Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg said, ""I don't know,"" when asked by Fox News about Phillips' ballot access.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, another top Biden reelection campaign surrogate, quickly interjected that ""the Supreme Court's going to decide that. That's not something, that's not a Democratic Party position. It's just in various states, people, individuals, have taken this issue up, and we'll hear from the Supreme Court shortly.""

Phillips has been crisscrossing New Hampshire in recent weeks, reiterating his argument that Biden is ""not electable.""
""Mark my words, I would not be standing in front of you and have given up my career in Congress and taken on this risk … if it wasn't the truth,"" he told voters Sunday in Rochester, New Hampshire. ""So, I just want you to all know I am in this with you. I'm your friend, I'm your advocate. I'm a Democrat – been so my whole life.""

""Look, it's no secret that people here were upset with the DNC, but people in New Hampshire take their responsibility very, very seriously,"" Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Sunday in Dover, New Hampshire.
And Khanna said his message to voters is: ""I don't think you're going to get any change with Nikki Haley, and Donald Trump's going to win here. Trump is going to be the nominee. Nikki Haley is soon going to be endorsing him. So, you know, it's not really a vote for a different direction.""
In recent weeks, another write-in effort also sprang up as progressives opposed to Biden's support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza urged voters to write in ""cease-fire.""
Most of the action Tuesday will be in the Republican race. But the Democrat primary won't be void of voters.
As of Friday, New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan was predicting a turnout of 322,000 in the state’s GOP presidential primary and 88,000 in the Democrat contest.

President Biden's newly anointed campaign chair previously had a few choice words about Republicans, calling them a ""bunch of fu--ers"" while praising Biden's calls for unity.
Biden's team announced on Tuesday that Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, Biden's deputy chief of staff, would pivot from her White House role to his re-election campaign to help steer its operations. The team also said Mike Donilon, a senior White House adviser, would shift to his political arm as its chief strategist.
O'Malley Dillon was not shy about her thoughts on Republicans during a December 2020 interview with Glamour after coming off her stint as Biden's campaign manager.

""The president-elect was able to connect with people over this sense of unity,"" O'Malley Dillon said at the time. ""In the primary, people would mock him, like, 'You think you can work with Republicans?' I'm not saying they're not a bunch of f---ers. Mitch McConnell is terrible. But this sense that you couldn't wish for that, you couldn't wish for this bipartisan ideal? He rejected that.""
""From start to finish, he set out with this idea that unity was possible, that together we are stronger, that we, as a country, need healing, and our politics needs that too,"" she continued.

O'Malley Dillon has also projected extreme views on firearms on social media, previously saying all guns should be taken off the street while responding to a tweet from failed Texas senatorial, gubernatorial and presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke regarding a baby shot in the face.
""My son is 17 months old, which shouldn't fu--ing matter,"" she wrote in September 2019. ""But thinking of that baby with shrapnel is his face almost broke me. GET EVERY ONE OF THOSE G--DAMN GUNS OFF OUR STREETS.""
DEMOCRAT LAWMAKERS SOUND THE ALARM OVER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN: 'NOT REAL COMFORTABLE'
The announcement comes as former President Trump has firmly positioned himself as the dominant GOP force after his showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The moves, however, are unlikely to receive fanfare from Democrat strategists who have been openly critical of Biden's campaign operations. O'Malley Dillon has overlooked the campaign's path from D.C. for months, while Donilon has been involved with its strategy, according to the New York Times, which first reported the news and expressed the actions are more formal than anything.

""I'm thankful to Mike and Jen both for their service in the White House these last three years, and I am grateful that in rejoining the campaign, they are stepping up one more time to ensure we finish the job for the American people,"" Biden told the Times.

Security video shows Pryor was able to go in and out of a few buildings in the area, said Deputy Commissioner of Investigations Frank Vanore. He also was seen talking to people, ""asking for a phone ... whatever he could do to leave the area,"" he said.
Investigators believe he called an accomplice within an hour of escaping, who then picked him up in a car. Police stopped the vehicle in the city on Wednesday night, Vanore said, but Pryor was not in the car. Two people who were in the vehicle were being questioned by police, but no charges had been filed against either person as of Thursday.

Pryor was 14 when he was charged in an October 2020 homicide and has been in a juvenile facility ever since. He faces charges including murder, conspiracy and firearms crimes. He was described as 5 feet 7 inches tall and 180 pounds and was wearing a blue sweatsuit and sandal-type footwear with socks.

An Indiana state trooper was helping a stranded motorist change a flat tire on the interstate Saturday night when a suspected drunken driver struck and critically injured him, authorities said.
Trooper Azariah Keith had stopped to help a vehicle disabled along a curved part of I-65 in Indianapolis around 8:45 p.m., Indiana State Police said. A second trooper responded to help block traffic in the left lane since the car was stopped on a bend in the narrow left shoulder of the roadway.
As Keith finished changing the tire and was putting away the equipment in his trunk, police said that a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox believed to be traveling at a high rate of speed swerved around the second trooper’s vehicle as it was blocking traffic.
The SUV driver lost control and crashed into the concrete median barrier before striking Keith and the rear of his police car, according to authorities.

Kristi Noem, R-S.D., discusses supporting Texas in fighting the border crisis on 'The Story.'
A Republican governor of an interior state pledged to drive in razor wire on the border herself if Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is stopped by President Biden or federal forces from retaining operational control of a park in Eagle Pass.
Meanwhile, the U.S. congressman who represents the area warned Biden would be an ""idiot"" to commence a standoff or worse with Texas National Guard members now using the park, as parallels were drawn to the last instance of National Guard federalization 67 years ago.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem told Fox News that Abbott is doing the right thing by standing firm after a Supreme Court ruling in which two conservative justices sided with the liberals to vacate a lower court's order preventing U.S. Border Patrol agents from accessing the park, which has reportedly been a high-traffic illegal migrant arcade. The court’s decision allows Border Patrol agents to cut concertina wire that Texas had installed along the border near Eagle Pass while litigation continues.
""I'll drive in more razor wire from South Dakota if I have to, for [Abbott] to do his job,"" Noem told ""America Reports.""
CHICAGO DEMOCRAT TORCHES CITY LEADERS AS SCHOOLS USED TO HOUSE MIGRANTS
""What people forget is that governors are commanders-in-chief. We're responsible for the men and women of our National Guard. It's a heavy responsibility that weighs on our shoulders, and so we never engage our National Guard soldiers and those men and women unless it's incredibly important.""
In defying the order, Abbott said earlier this week the federal executive branch has a constitutional duty to enforce laws protecting states, and that the Founders intended for states not to be victim to the whims of a ""lawless president.""
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt also indicated they stand with Abbott.
Noem said that, despite being hundreds of miles north of Mexico, she long ago declared the border a ""war zone,"" and has sent her state's guard to deployments at the border multiple times to do the Biden administration's job.
She added that the agents under Biden's control similarly don't support their own boss' lax handling of the crisis.
SPEAKER JOHNSON CONFRONTS BIDEN ON MULTIPLE ISSUES: ‘DO YOUR JOB’
""[Biden] is so out of touch. He is remaking this country. We will be Europe within a year or two if we allow President Biden to continue this invasion of our country,"" Noem said. ""Over 6 million people have come here illegally. It is time to stand our ground, and we'll be down there standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Gov. Abbott.""
As Abbott stands firm, Democrats, including at least two federal lawmakers from Texas, are calling on Biden to federalize — or assume federal control of — the state's National Guard troops currently overseen by Abbott's administration.
Rep. Greg Casar of Austin tweeted that if Abbott doesn't relent, Biden must take action.
""The Story"" anchor Martha MacCallum further reported Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio echoed Casar's calls.
But the congressman representing Eagle Pass told Fox News that any federal action would be foolhardy.
""[Biden] better not — you know he may be a fool, but I hope he's not an idiot,"" Rep. Tony Gonzales responded after MacCallum noted the last such federalization action was initiated by former President Dwight Eisenhower.
In 1957, Arkansas Democratic Gov. Orval Faubus refused to allow Black children to attend the central high school in Little Rock.
After nine African-American students were enrolled at the school, Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to ensure ""peace"" and prevent ""tumult"" from integration at the then-all-White school.
Eisenhower, a Republican, objected and usurped control of Faubus' guard to let the students attend class.
""If we go down that route… talk about lighting a match to a very already delicate situation,"" Gonzales said Thursday.
""How many Americans have to die before this Biden border crisis comes to an end, not to mention the number of migrants that are drowning every single week?""
Gonzales added he was recently in Mexico City, where he said the Mexican government must also team up with the Americans in order to secure the border and protect the vulnerable being affected by the crisis.
Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Biden ""deliberately broke the border"" and dismissed any contention that more federal money is needed at all to properly secure it, as both Democrats and Republicans have claimed.

Cruz noted Biden reversed every major Trump border security policy and retains the ability to enforce laws he thus far refuses to, which he tacitly indicated doesn't require such funding.
""Biden could solve this problem tomorrow — he doesn't want to,"" Cruz said.
He said both Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., both view migrants and illegal immigrants as future Democratic voters for life, and that both are willing to ""overlook the death, suffering [and] women and children being brutalized"" as the crisis intensifies.
""All of those are acceptable prices to pay for Democrats to stay in power,"" he said.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia’s government declared a disaster Thursday and asked for international help to combat raging wildfires that are expected to worsen in coming days due to warm, dry conditions associated with the El Niño weather phenomenon.
Officials raised the number of fires from 25 to 31, and said nine of them were under control. They did not order mandatory evacuations despite some fires burning in the mountains that surround some municipalities.
COLOMBIA ELECTS FORMER REBEL GUSTAVO PETRO TO BECOME COUNTRY'S FIRST LEFTIST PRESIDENT
President Gustavo Petro said Chile, the United States, Peru and Canada have already responded to the call for help, without specifying when the assistance will arrive to the South American country.
The government also asked for aid from the United Nations and European Union.
Diminished rainfall has aided an explosion in wildfires in Colombia, currently numbering 31.
""To the extent that we know that in the coming days and weeks crisis events are going to increase, we want to make sure that we have the physical capacity to address and mitigate them,"" Petro said.
Colombia’s Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies reported that roughly half of the country’s municipalities are on maximum alert due to fire risk. But about a third of all municipalities do not have a fire department, according to the National Fire Department of Colombia.
The decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures that are worsening the fire situation are attributed to El Nino, which is a temporary warming of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather worldwide.
The disaster declaration allows the government to reallocate funds to tackle the wildfires.

The army has deployed more than 600 soldiers as well as aircraft and vehicles to emergency areas.

YWC7L7QXF4_YETCYCCLB8HDZC4,Fox News Voter Analysis: Trump tops Haley in New Hampshire,By Fox News Polling Unit Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 4:33am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-voter-analysis-trump-tops-haley-new-hampshire,"Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume and former Trump senior counselor Kellyanne Conway provide voter analysis and examine factors driving ballot decision on 'Special Report.'
Former President Trump won New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary by 10 points over Nikki Haley. Trump is the first Republican candidate to win competitive elections in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary since 1976.
Ron DeSantis ended his campaign two days before the primary, effectively making it a head-to-head race between Trump and Haley, who vowed to continue her campaign through the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24.
The results of the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of nearly 2,000 New Hampshire Republican primary voters, show the contours of a race that was notably closer than last week’s Iowa caucuses, which Trump won by 30 points.
In New Hampshire, unaffiliated voters – those not registered with a partisan affiliation – can participate in primary elections, and these voters were the main reason the race in the Granite State was tighter than in Iowa. Unaffiliated voters made up slightly less than half of the electorate (47%), and broke for Haley by 26 points.

Just over half of unaffiliated voters (54%) considered themselves Republicans; the remainder generally identified as independents (26%) or Democrats (20%).
Trump easily outpaced Haley among registered Republicans (+42 points).
Haley won political moderates by 24 points, while Trump won self-described ""somewhat conservatives"" by the same margin (+24 points). He ran up the score among very conservative voters (+68 points).
In the end, much of Haley’s support came from voters outside the GOP mainstream. Just over half of her supporters (52%) backed Joe Biden in the 2020 election, while 32% voted for Trump. The vast majority (90%) of Trump’s backers in the primary voted for him four years ago.
Those who considered themselves part of the Make America Great Again movement went overwhelmingly for Trump (+77 points), while non-MAGA voters backed Haley by 52 points. Both candidates benefited from DeSantis dropping out, as he ran second in Iowa among both MAGA and non-MAGA voters.

Beyond ideology, education was a major fault line in the New Hampshire GOP electorate – to an even greater degree than in Iowa. Haley won college-educated voters by 22 points (after Trump won them by 2 points in Iowa), but Trump dominated among those without a college degree in both states (+30 in New Hampshire and +45 in Iowa).
Haley won suburban voters – a group that broke for Trump by 6 points in Iowa – by a single point. Rural voters were once again a major source of strength for Trump.
Despite millions of dollars in campaign spending and a flurry of candidate events across the state, in some ways the race was over before it began. Fully 42% of voters knew who they would support all along, and almost all of them backed Trump.
Far fewer (16%) decided after the Iowa caucuses, but these voters broke for Haley.
Haley supporters headed to the ballot box knowing they were fighting an uphill battle as most voters expect Trump to be the eventual nominee.
If Trump is the eventual nominee, he has work to do to unify the party. While just over half (53%) of primary voters would be satisfied with Trump as the GOP nominee, one-third (35%) would be dissatisfied enough that they would not vote for him in November. Fewer would be satisfied with Haley as the nominee (39%), while 32% would be dissatisfied enough that they would not back her in the fall.
All told, three-quarters (77%) of Haley voters said they would not vote for Trump in November; 51% of his voters felt the same way about her.
Some of the dissatisfaction with Trump as the nominee may be due to concerns he is too extreme to win the general election. Half of voters worried he is too extreme to win, including 37% who were very concerned.
Far fewer (35%) were concerned Haley is too extreme.

For some, however, an extreme candidate may be just what the country needs. Three-in-ten would like to see complete and total upheaval in the way the country is run, and the vast majority of them backed Trump. His 68-point margin among these voters was even larger than his 55-point advantage with this group in Iowa.
Half wanted substantial change in the country’s governance, and they broke for Trump by a much narrower 6-point margin.
The desire for major change did not mean New Hampshire Republican voters were looking for a candidate who would break the rules to get things done – just 17% said that was a very important quality in their nominee.
Instead, almost all voters said having the mental fitness to serve as president was a very important quality for the Republican nominee. Being a strong leader, having the best policy ideas, being able to win in November and caring about people like you were second-tier priorities.
Haley won voters who felt it was very important for the nominee to work in a bipartisan manner, while Trump won on the other traits.
WATCH: TRUMP ADDRESSES SUPPORTERS ALONGSIDE FORMER RIVALS
Meanwhile, immigration was the top issue on primary voters’ minds – just as it was in Iowa. The economy placed second and no other issues were close.
Eight-in-ten voters (79%) supported building a wall along the southern border, with just 21% opposed to Trump’s signature immigration policy. By more than two to one, voters felt immigrants do more to hurt the country (68%) than help it (28%). All told, Trump won immigration voters by 47 points.
The margin was closer among those who felt the economy was the most important issue, though Trump still held a 9-point advantage over Haley.
Six-in-ten voters (60%) said they were holding steady financially, but nearly 3 in 10 (27%) felt they were falling behind. These voters backed Trump by a massive margin (+58 points), while he and Haley split those who were breaking even (Haley +1 point). In Iowa, Trump won those who said they were holding steady by 22 points.
While far from the top of voters’ priority lists, foreign policy (8% most important issue) did create some fireworks on the campaign trail. Haley, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, sought to attack his relationships with dictators and draw a contrast with Trump’s ""America First"" foreign policy. A majority of New Hampshire voters, however, preferred the U.S. take a less active role in world affairs.
Those who wanted the U.S. to be less active (Trump +40 points) and more active (Trump +14 points) in solving the world’s problems backed Trump, while those who felt the current U.S. stance was about right backed Haley by 43 points.
On the hot-button questions of foreign aid, half favored aid to Ukraine and two-thirds supported aid to Israel.
Voters who favored aid to both countries backed Haley by 34 points. Trump’s margins among those who would send aid to Israel but not Ukraine (+76 points) and those who opposed aid to both (+46 points) were much greater.
FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS: WHAT NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS WANT IN A GOP NOMINEE
New Hampshire GOP primary voters are more moderate on abortion than their Iowa counterparts: slightly more than half said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared to 31% of Iowa caucusgoers. That helped Haley, as she won those who felt abortion should be legal by 22 points. Still, Trump won those who would outlaw abortion by a much wider 50-point spread.
Relatively few primary voters thought Trump has done something illegal with the classified documents found at his Florida home (32%), his alleged attempts to interfere with the 2020 election vote count (32%) or the events at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 (27%).
Four-in-ten (39%) thought Trump had done something illegal in at least one of those cases, compared to 26% of Iowa Republicans who felt that way. Most of those backed Haley (+79 points), but Trump had a similar margin (+67) among the larger group saying he hadn’t broken the law.
Two-thirds of voters (64%) felt the cases were political attempts to undermine Trump rather than legitimate investigations into important issues (34%). Reflecting Trump’s view that the justice system is out to get him, half (52%) said they lacked confidence in the integrity of the U.S. legal system.

A similar number were not confident in U.S. democracy in general (46%) and slightly fewer lacked confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections (42%). Most expressed confidence in New Hampshire’s elections (86%).
Voters’ mistrust of U.S. elections extends to questioning the results of the 2020 election, as 51% say Biden was not legitimately elected. Trump won these voters by 77 points, while Haley won those who felt Biden won fair and square by a slightly narrower 61 points.

YWG7LT3ROQ_JB9JK6U4UNN7L5X,NYC Mayor Adams praised by police union for 'taking a stand' against bill to log every police encounter,By Kyle Morris Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-mayor-adams-praised-police-union-taking-stand-against-bill-log-every-police-encounter,"Bodega & Small Business Association's Frank Marte on NYC business owners taking matters in their own hands and feeling a lack of support from city leaders as crime continues to be an issue.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams is receiving praise from the self-described ""largest municipal police union in the world"" after he vetoed a controversial city council bill that would require officers in the Big Apple to document every ""investigative encounter"" with members of the public.
""We opposed the bill and support the Mayor's veto,"" a spokesperson for the New York City Police Benevolent Association (NYC PBA) told Fox News Digital.
The proposed legislation — Intro. 586-A, better known as the ""How Many Stops Act"" — could slow NYPD response times, undermine community-oriented policing and add tens of millions of dollars in overtime to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) budget, Adams said at a Friday press conference.
Adams took issue with how the proposed legislation would force NYPD officers to spend more time filling out reports after Level 1 interactions with the public instead of patrolling the street and keeping the public safe.

Adams' resistance to the bill is something that is shared by a few members of the city council, some of whom he said wish they could vote their ""conscience"" and support his efforts to abandon the measure.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Adams said, ""I know when I have communicated with some of the City Council members, some of them have shared, my constituency don’t believe this. My constituency believe that this is a harmful bill. Some of them have said that, you know, if they were able to vote with their conscience, they would not vote for this bill.""
""Some of them have indicated that they’re afraid to vote with their conscience, and I said we should be more fearful of our safety in this city than any other item,"" he added.
In announcing the veto last week, Adams was joined by PBA President Patrick Hendry, who said the bill ""is not about better policing, it's about less policing.""
""I wanna thank Mayor Adams for taking a stand and vetoing this bill,"" Hendry said. ""At the end of the day, this isn't about politics. It's about public safety. We want every New Yorker to understand how hard your police officers are working every single day, helping your community, all of us together, making a safer community.""
""It's about our police officers doing more paperwork and less work,"" Hendry added of the measure. ""And we hear from the community all the time. We know what they want. They want more of a police presence on the streets. They want faster response times.""
Hendry said the NYPD officers will continue to rely on ""leaders who are gonna help us accomplish those goals.""
""I want to thank Mayor Adams for showing that true leadership here today,"" Hendry added.

The bill originally passed the council in December. It would require the NYPD to log and report basic information on level one, two and three investigative encounters between the police and civilians. Officers would report on the race, age and gender of the person approached, any factors leading to the interaction and its outcomes.
Prior to Adams' decision, the PBA created a video showing how long it takes officers to fill out the interaction forms amid a string of constant calls to 911 in the city.
Shared on social media, the video used audio from a busy 911 dispatcher in the city and placed it alongside footage of an officer filling out one of the forms that would be required under the proposed legislation. The video showed the dispatcher receiving numerous calls, all while the officer worked to finish filling out the form related to one incident.
In the caption for the video, the PBA wrote, ""911 response times to critical crimes in progress have already increased by almost 2 minutes. How much will they increase if cops spend 25 MILLION MINUTES per year buried in new paperwork?""
""As young men, my brother and I were beaten by the police in the basement of a local precinct, but I turned my pain into purpose and joined the police force to effect change from within the system. And, in my time as a police officer and throughout my career in public service, I have fought for transparency and against abusive policing tactics that targeted communities of color. While Intro. 586 has good intentions behind it, the bill is misguided and compromises our public safety,"" Adams said in a statement regarding his veto.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement last week, ""While Intro. 586 has good intentions behind it, the bill is misguided and compromises our public safety,"" (NYC Mayor's Office)
""Our administration supports efforts to make law enforcement more transparent, more just, and more accountable, but this bill will handcuff our police by drowning officers in unnecessary paperwork that will saddle taxpayers with tens of millions of dollars in additional NYPD overtime each year, while simultaneously taking officers away from policing our streets and engaging with the community,"" he said. ""That is why I am vetoing this legislation today. I ask my colleagues in government to please work with our administration to improve public safety because New Yorkers want their police out on patrol — taking criminals off our streets and keeping them safe.""
Adams cited serial stabbing suspect 27-year-old Jermain Rigueur, accused of at least five stabbings within about a week, arguing the bill would impede such quick arrests, FOX 5 reported.
In support of the mayor's decision, NYPD Commissioner Edward A. Caban said the NYPD is already the country’s ""most intently watched, deeply scrutinized, and openly transparent law enforcement agency"" and said the proposed measure ""is an overreach that would result in the unintended consequence of literally slowing down the city’s progress.""
""Each day and night, NYPD officers carry on the dangerous, critical work of fighting crime on the streets. Terrorist plots have also been thwarted, and there is a renewed commitment among our rank and file to further build trust and strengthen relationships in every community,"" Caban said in a statement. ""These vital efforts will continue — and must continue, unimpeded by bureaucratic time-wasting tasks — because that is what New Yorkers expect and deserve.""

New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, a co-sponsor of the measure, reportedly accused Adams and the NYPD of being ""fearmongers who mislead the public"" while speaking from a press conference of his own about the matter. He and other councilmembers say the bill is meant to address the ""longstanding inequities"" faced by Black New Yorkers.

""The fact that Mayor Adams is getting his Trump on right now makes this even more difficult than it has to be,"" Williams said, according to FOX 5.
Adams also vetoed this week a separate city council bill aimed at banning solitary confinement.

YZWJULCT54_D4RVUUOXUFPSQ4C,"Trump, Biden agree on one thing about the Republican primary",By Chris Pandolfo Fox News,"Published January 24, 2024 9:56am EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-biden-agree-one-thing-republican-primary,"Washington Examiner reporter Samantha-Jo Roth on Nikki Haley's campaign after Trump wins the New Hampshire primary and polls put her behind the former president in South Carolina
Former President Donald Trump and President Biden don't agree on much — but both say their election rematch is set after convincing wins in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
Trump, who faces one remaining primary challenger in former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, claimed an 11-point victory in the Granite State on Tuesday night. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Trump said he was ""very honored by the result"" and is ""looking forward to going against the worst president in the history of our country.""
Biden said Tuesday the ""stakes could not be higher"" after winning the New Hampshire primary as a write-in candidate, trouncing Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who launched a long-shot bid against the incumbent president by arguing Biden is too old and unpopular to win in November.
""It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee,"" Biden declared in a statement. ""And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher. Our Democracy. Our personal freedoms — from the right to choose to the right to vote. Our economy — which has seen the strongest recovery in the world since COVID. All are at stake.""

Though Trump and Biden may think the race is over, Haley has vowed to stay in and battle Trump in her home state of South Carolina, and perhaps beyond.
""You’ve all heard the chatter among the political class. They’re falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not last in the nation. This race is far from over,"" Nikki Haley told supporters Tuesday at her election night watch party in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, is not going down without a fight. She will travel to Charleston on Wednesday for the first in a series of campaign stops in the Palmetto State ahead of the Feb. 24 primary. The campaign announced a new $4 million ad blitz in the state this week, showing every intention of fighting Trump for each delegate.
Speaking to Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman, Trump argued it was time for Haley to suspend her campaign so he could begin targeting Biden with an eye towards the general election in November.

""She should because, otherwise, we have to keep wasting money instead of spending on Biden,"" the former president emphasized. ""If she doesn’t drop out, we have to waste money instead of spending it on Biden, which is our focus.""
Trump's victory in New Hampshire came eight days after he captured a majority of the vote and crushed the competition in Iowa's low-turnout Republican presidential caucuses. And it came two days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign, making the race a two-candidate contest between Trump and Haley.

New Hampshire — where independent voters who make up roughly 40% of the electorate can vote in either major party's contest and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary — was widely seen as Haley's best chance to stop Trump.
But Haley came up short, a fact Trump hammered over and over in his victory speech.
He said Haley ""ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely"" and delivered ""a speech like she won. She didn't. She lost.""

""Let’s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night. She had a very bad night,"" Trump said.
When asked for a response, a Haley campaign spokesperson referred to her remarks Tuesday night and recent public polling, which suggested Trump would win by as much as 22 points.
""The political elites never learn. The same naysayers who said Nikki Haley couldn’t defeat a 30-year incumbent state legislator or win the governor’s race in South Carolina are the same people declaring the presidential race over after only two states have voted,"" said Haley communications director Nachama Soloveichik. ""Nikki Haley has never taken her cues from the establishment, and she’s not going to start now. Keep underestimating us — that will be fun.""

Z20OPPW83X_AM8F7PUW3LGCVVU,Colorado father convicted of child abuse after his toddler ingests fentanyl and dies,By Greg Wehner Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 8:06pm EST",20240124,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/colorado-father-convicted-child-abuse-toddler-ingests-fentanyl-dies,"The country singer known as Jelly Roll spoke to Fox News' Griff Jenkins Thursday after testifying about fentanyl at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.
A Colorado jury found a 33-year-old father guilty of child abuse after his 22-month-old daughter died from ingesting fentanyl.
Colorado 17th Judicial District Attorney Brian Mason's office announced the conviction of Alonzo Montoya, who was found guilty of child abuse resulting in death, as well as racketeering.
Montoya’s 22-month-old daughter, Aviyana Montoya, died on Jan. 2, 2022, inside her home in Brighton after ingesting 10 times the amount of fentanyl that it would take to kill an adult user, police said.
At about midnight on Jan. 2, the toddler was placed in her crib, the DA’s office said, and no one checked on her for 14 hours.

When Aviyana’s parents finally went to check on her, she was unresponsive, and when paramedics arrived, they pronounced her dead at the scene.
An investigation conducted by the Brighton Police Department and North Metro Task Force found Alonzo Montoya was running drugs out of his home, and video surveillance captured drug dealing and drug usage at the residence, before, during and after his daughter’s death.
Police said on the night of Aviyana’s death, surveillance showed the toddler in the master bedroom and playing on a bed where individuals were using drugs.

Police also said the toddler was placing objects in and around her mouth as she was teething.
Montoya was indicted by an Adams County Grand Jury on Sept. 22, 2022 on charges of first-degree murder, pattern of racketeering, conspiracy to commit a pattern of racketeering, child abuse resulting in death, child abuse involving exposure of controlled substance manufacturing activities, and child abuse in connection with another child of his.
On Dec. 11, 2022, though, a county judge dismissed the murder charge, claiming Montoya did not ""knowingly"" kill the toddler.

Still, Montoya’s trial commenced and on Jan. 8, 2024, a jury listened to testimony from police officers, members of the task force, toxicology experts and doctors before deliberating for two days and finding him guilty on all remaining charges.
""This defendant ran a large-scale drug operation while two children were present and now one of them is dead,"" Mason said. ""This helpless child – who was teething at the time of her death – ingested fentanyl, which the defendant was selling, and had prolonged exposure to methamphetamines and other dangerous narcotics. It is one of the most outrageous cases I have seen.
""My heart breaks for this little girl, who truly never had a chance,"" the DA added.

Montoya is scheduled to be sentenced on April 4.
Aviyana's mother, 32-year-old Nicole Casias, was also indicted on the same charges and is set to go to trial on March 11.

Z2FPN38MEG_MPCKC12JDDDH1DB,Hear 911 calls after South Carolina college student fatally shot trying to enter wrong house,By Audrey Conklin Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 4:00am EST",20240126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/hear-911-calls-south-carolina-college-student-fatally-shot-trying-enter-wrong-house,"A woman called 911 after her boyfriend allegedly shot at a South Carolina college student who tried to enter the wrong house in August 2023.
Two 911 calls reveal what happened in the moments before and directly after a South Carolina college student was fatally shot last August after trying to enter the wrong house.
Nicholas Donofrio, a 20-year-old University of South Carolina student originally from Madison, Connecticut, died after being shot in the early morning hours of Aug. 26, 2023, when he ""mistakenly went to the wrong home"" on South Holly Street in Columbia ""and attempted to enter by repeatedly knocking, banging, and kicking at the front door while manipulating the door handle,"" police said in a press release last year.
Donofrio also lived on South Holly Street at the time.
""Hi, somebody's trying to break into our house. They're trying to break in the front door. They're banging on it,"" a woman can be heard telling dispatchers in a 911 call made around 2 a.m. on Aug. 26.
""They just broke the window. My boyfriend just shot through the door,"" the woman says in a recording of the call obtained by Fox News Digital. ""… Please get here fast.""
SHOOTING OF SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE STUDENT WHO TRIED TO ENTER WRONG HOUSE WAS JUSTIFIED, POLICE SAY

The woman adds that she thinks her boyfriend ""hit"" the person, later identified as Donofrio. She can be heard crying during the call and telling police that the person broke through a ""frosted"" glass panel on their front door.
The dispatcher tells the woman that police will be arriving at her home shortly, and she thanks him.

Days after the fatal shooting, the Columbia Police Department (CPD) determined that the shooting was justified under the state's stand your ground law, which allows residents to defend themselves and their property with firearms, after consulting with the Fifth Circuit Solicitor’s Office. CPD ultimately decided not to file charges against the unnamed resident who shot Donofrio.

Surveillance video footage taken outside the home on South Holly Street where the shooting took place shows Donofrio initially walking past the residence. More footage shows Donofrio banging on the front door later on.
Donofrio allegedly broke through a glass window on the front door and attempted to unlock the doorknob through the broken window, at which point the male resident fired a single shot, fatally hitting the 20-year-old man in the chest.
UPSTATE NEW YORK HOMEOWNER CONVICTED AFTER FATALLY SHOOTING WOMAN WHO TURNED UP WRONG DRIVEWAY
Police found Donofrio dead on the front porch.
In another 911 call made around 3 a.m. on Aug. 26 obtained by Fox News Digital, Donofrio's friends tell dispatchers that they put him in an Uber after a night out, but he never arrived at home.
""We haven't heard from him in hours. [The Uber driver] was supposed to drop him off at home, and he never made it, and I have no idea where he is, and we are all incredibly worried,"" the friend says, adding that the Uber driver saw him ""passed out on the front porch,"" but his roommates did not see him at home.
The caller told police not to do a welfare check at Donofrio's home because the 20-year-old was not there and filed a missing person report instead. The caller gave the dispatcher Donofrio's information and said the 20-year-old was drunk when the group of friends sent him home in an Uber.
Police said they determined that Donofrio's death was a justifiable homicide under the Protection of Persons and Property Act, based on evidence recovered from the scene, including surveillance video, audio evidence and witness statements.

Z2OAMLPNWQ_IEROMJBHQ71HYCK,Dr. Jordan Peterson defiant after court mandates social media training: 'The goal is to take my license',By Kristine Parks Fox News,"Published January 26, 2024 12:09pm EST",20230126,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-jordan-peterson-defiant-court-mandates-social-media-training-goal-take-license,"Author and psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson argues on 'Fox & Friends' that the goal of the ruling is to take his license to practice clinical psychology and share details about his upcoming online university.
Canadian psychologist and author Dr. Jordan Peterson described his ongoing court battle over free speech on Friday, after he was ordered to take social media training because of past controversial posts.
Peterson, a professor emeritus of the University of Toronto psychology department, was sentenced to mandatory social media training by the Ontario College of Psychologists last year. He was forced to comply with the order after three Ontario Divisional Court judges dismissed his legal complaint against the administrative board.
On ""Fox & Friends"" Friday, Peterson was doubtful that social media training would change things.
""I'm in their hands at the moment fundamentally because they've already sentenced me, so to speak, to an indefinite period of social media retraining, with some social media expert, whatever the hell that is,"" Peterson bluntly remarked. ""So I'm obliged to undertake that training, at my own expense, for an indefinite period of time until they in their wisdom presume that I've learned whatever it is I'm supposed to learn. Which, given my nature, strikes me as highly unlikely.""
CANADIAN COURT UPHOLDS JORDAN PETERSON FORCED TO UNDERGO ‘SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING’ OVER CONTROVERSIAL POSTS
Dr. Jordan Peterson explained his court battle over academic freedom after he was ordered to take mandatory social media training because of his dissenting views.
The academic has generated controversy in recent years with several posts calling out transgender ideology, politicians, and climate change. The psychologist was suspended from Twitter in 2022 for rebuking transgender actor Elliot Page.
Peterson said the goal of the board was to ""take his license.""
All professionals in Canada under a regulatory board are at risk of losing their livelihoods, the psychologist argued.
The academic board is ""making an example of me,"" he said, as one of the most well-known dissenting voices on gender ideology.
""It's definitely the case that the goal is to take my license,"" he said. ""Because what they'll claim after dragging me through, whatever this re-education is going to be, is that I can't be taught, that I'm ungovernable… that he's a disgrace to his profession and ungovernable.""
Peterson previously pledged to be transparent with the public on whatever training he is forced to take.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A Southern California man was sentenced Friday to two concurrent life sentences, plus 30 years, for blowing up his ex-girlfriend’s spa business with a package bomb in 2018, killing her and seriously injuring two others.
Friday’s hearing concluded a case against Stephen Beal, 64, that was fraught with missteps for investigators and prosecutors since the May 15, 2018 bombing in an Aliso Viejo spa, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Los Angeles.
Ildiko Krajnyak, 48, was killed in the fiery blast when she opened a box with a homemade bomb inside that Beal had slipped into the spa while she was in Hungary visiting family. Two clients she had just treated — a mother and daughter — were knocked off their feet. The blast destroyed the business and tore a large hunk from the building. Body parts were found in the parking lot.
LAS VEGAS OFFICER'S WIFE POSED AS ATTORNEY, FILED FAKE DOCUMENTS FOR YEARS: POLICE
""Mr. Beal will never be able to get out to harm innocent victims again,"" said E. Martin Estrada, the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, at a news conference after the sentencing.
A federal judge sentenced Beal to two concurrent life sentences for the charges of use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of a building resulting in death.
Beal also received a 30-year sentence for the use of a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, which will run consecutively, and a 10-year concurrent sentence for possession of an unregistered destructive device.

Beal’s federal public defender, Craig Harbaugh, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""After five years of waiting and wondering, our family and friends have peace knowing that Mr. Beal will spend his remaining days in prison,"" Eva Boni, Krajnyak’s cousin, said at the news conference.
Beal, a partner in the business, was jealous Krajnyak had been dating someone else after their 18-month relationship ended, prosecutors said.
""She was a shining light,"" Nicole Barrett, her best friend, said at the news conference. ""She was an amazing human being.""
Beal was arrested shortly after the explosion on a single charge of possessing an unregistered destructive device but was never officially named as a suspect in the blast in the days that followed. The charge was dropped after prosecutors questioned whether material found at his Long Beach home constituted a ""destructive device."" Beal claimed that explosive material found at his house was for his model rockets.
He was free for nearly 10 months before being re-arrested following a painstaking analysis of the evidence.

Beal's first trial in 2022 ultimately ended in a mistrial after the federal jury deadlocked. He was retried in 2023 and the second jury convicted him of four felonies including the use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death.
""Our justice system can sometimes take time,"" Estrada said on Friday. ""The end result is what matters.""
Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes said Beal maintained his innocence during Friday’s hearing.
""I could not think of anything more insulting,"" Barnes said during the news conference."
Z425WKX8VD_XZL65T1MNPM26MO,"Energy developer axing key coal power plants to meet eco goals, jeopardizing power for millions",By Thomas Catenacci Fox News,"Published January 22, 2024 4:00am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/energy-developer-axing-key-coal-power-plants-meet-eco-goals-jeopardizing-power-millions,"Jimmy Failla joins ""The Faulkner Focus"" to share his thoughts on a reporter from Australia confronting President Biden's climate czar John Kerry about his massive carbon footprint.
A major U.S. energy developer has initiated the process of shuttering two major coal-fired power plants serving more than a million homes in the upper Midwest, helping the company meet its corporate climate commitments.
Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy announced this month that it closed one of three coal units at Sherburne County Generating Plant, Minnesota’s largest power plant, as part of its plans to deliver 100% carbon-free electricity to customers and shut down all of its remaining coal facilities. The company is planning to retire the two remaining units at the plant and another coal plant in Minnesota, the Allen S. King plant, by 2030.
In response to Xcel Energy's shutdown of the unit at Sherburne County Generating Plant and plans to shutter all remaining coal generation, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) fired off a letter urging the company to reconsider those plans. The company — which has pledged to replace the plants with electricity generation from green energy like solar — provides power to customers in both Minnesota and South Dakota.
""The North American Electric Reliability Corporation recently released a long-term risk assessment that showed the MISO region as having a high reliability risk around the time period the plants are planned to be closed,"" SDPUC Chair Kristie Fiegen told Fox News Digital. ""One of the main contributors to that reliability risk is the premature retirement of dispatchable baseload generation before the appropriate replacement resources are added to the system.""

""While Xcel may have plans to replace part of the lost capacity from the early retirements with new solar and storage, the Commission is concerned that the replacement resources will not be dispatchable and, thereby, not as dependable as the Sherco and King plants have been for South Dakota’s customers over the years,"" Fiegen continued.
In December, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation — a nonprofit organization that makes periodic recommendations to boost reliability — published its annual Long-Term Reliability Assessment. According to the report, the region managed by Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which oversees much of the Midwest including Minnesota and South Dakota, faces some of the highest grid risks as a result of coal generation retirements that are projected to outpace new green energy development at certain points in the future.
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RIGGED INTERNAL ANALYSIS, SOFTENING BLOW OF POWER PLANT REGULATIONS: REPORT
Xcel's shutdown of the Sherburne County Generating Plant and Allen S. King Generating Plant would account for a sizable share of that existing coal generation scheduled to soon be taken offline. The two plants have a total capacity of nearly 3,000 megawatts, enough to power more than a million homes.
MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris, though, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that the grid operator is both fuel agnostic and policy neutral and would continue to support the clean energy goals of its states and member utilities ""across a diverse and complex system undergoing an energy transition while also maintaining system reliability.""

Under Xcel's plans, it will build a 710-megawatt solar farm at the site of the Sherburne County Generating Plant and solar projects with a total capacity of 650 megawatts to replace the Allen S. King Generating Plant. However, those plans wouldn't produce enough power to replace the electricity generation of the two retiring coal facilities and would further represent intermittent forms of power that are dependent on weather conditions.
""Being in a northern climate, the Commission’s main concern is that there are enough dispatchable resources on the system to meet South Dakotans’ winter heating loads during long cold spells when there is a chance that renewable resources are not producing energy,"" Fiegen added. ""Keeping the lights on and making sure we have a reliable, affordable electric grid is one of our greatest priorities at the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission.""
""Premature closure of reliable baseload energy could put lives at risk if the electric system isn’t ready to absorb those retirements,"" she said. ""To this Commission, the NERC risk assessment is a flashing, bright-red warning light that there is good chance this could be the case.""
MICHIGAN DEMS, GRETCHEN WHITMER ARE PURSUING A GREEN NEW DEAL, THREATENING FUTURE GRID STABILITY
Energy experts have long warned that replacing fossil fuel power generation with green energy could present risks, since those alternatives produce a smaller share of their listed capacity.
Solar panels, for example, produce just 25% and wind turbines produce 34% of their listed capacity, according to federal data. Coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants, meanwhile, produce 49%, 54% and 93% of their listed capacity, respectively.

""You have people in hospitals, you have low-income people who are affected. You have farmers, you have small businesses,"" Michelle Bloodworth, the president and CEO of America’s Power, a coal power trade group, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""They certainly, obviously, rely upon electricity, whether that's for health and human safety.""
""But, also, coal provides an insurance policy when either other resources, like intermittent, are not available, or natural gas prices. We saw a lot of high natural gas prices. Consumers can put food on the table instead of having to spend a significant portion of their income — which they really can't afford to — on their electricity bill which, as we are seeing, continue to climb across the United States.""
CONSUMER GROUP LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TARGETING ENERGY COMPANY PUSHING ESG MEASURES
Overall, Xcel — whose largest shareholders include BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, massive asset managers which have forwarded so-called environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives — has issued some of the most aggressive corporate sustainability goals of any developer in the nation, vowing to lower its electricity emissions 80% by 2030 and fully decarbonize its electricity generation by 2040.
Those goals, according to Xcel, are based on United Nations climate projections and targets. And to achieve its goals, Xcel has pledged to shutter fossil fuel power generation and vastly expand its green energy development while maintaining the size of its existing nuclear power fleet.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Xcel Energy spokesperson Theo Keith said the company appreciated the SDPUC's feedback, but that it is in alignment with the commission’s ""priority to ensure reliability throughout the clean energy transition and ensure South Dakotans have a dependable supply of electricity at all times, including periods of extreme weather and high demand.""
BLACKROCK TURNED DOWN RECORD NUMBER OF CLIMATE PROPOSALS AMID INFLATION, ESG PUSHBACK
""As we retire our coal plants, we plan to add 2,150 megawatts of wind and 2,500 megawatts of solar onto our Upper Midwest system by 2032, with another 1,100 megawatts of wind and solar capacity slated for beyond 2032,"" Keith said. ""While the power generated by these resources is variable, we will complement it with ‘dispatchable’ generation — power we can supply at any time it’s needed — to reinforce the reliability of the grid.""
""Ensuring a reliable, clean and affordable energy future is a complex task, and the knowledge and perspective of the commission will contribute to our shared success,"" he added. ""We look forward to continuing to meet with the commission and discuss the path forward.""
According to Keith, Xcel's nuclear fleet will continue to provide dispatchable power generation, the company plans to build new dispatchable generation, mainly hydrogen-ready combustion turbines, and Xcel will also construct up to 700 miles of new transmission lines.
""Utility companies are becoming increasingly aggressive in their pursuit of so-called ‘sustainability efforts.’ As part of their ESG priorities, Xcel is claiming to be a leader in the ‘energy transition’ and to provide consumers with ‘safe’ and ‘reliable’ energy at a competitive price,"" Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumer's Research, told Fox News Digital.
""Yet, their plan to close the King and Sherco generating plants would not only hike energy costs in the MISO area but threaten reliable energy for consumers in an area that is already at high-risk,"" Hild continued. ""Just like other ESG advocates, Xcel claims to protect the consumers they serve while pulling the rug right from beneath them.""
""Unsurprisingly, Xcel's largest shareholders are made up of the biggest champions of the ESG cult: BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street.""

ZBBF9NNGDF_6RMAAR199EO87Y1,Millions in India celebrate as new Hindu temple is built on ruins of historic mosque,Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 10:30am EST",20240122,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/millions-india-celebrate-new-hindu-temple-built-ruins-historic-mosque,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday opened a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya, in a political triumph for the populist leader who is seeking to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu state.
The temple is dedicated to Hinduism’s Lord Ram and fulfills a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus who worship the revered deity and extoll him for the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance. Modi’s party and other Hindu nationalist groups who seized on the demand have portrayed the temple as central to their vision of reclaiming Hindu pride, which they say was suppressed by centuries of Mughal rule and British colonialism.
Modi and his governing Bharatiya Janata Party hope that opening the temple will help catapult the prime minister to a record third successive term in elections expected this spring. But with the temple still under construction, critics accuse Modi of a hurried opening to woo voters.
INDIA’S RELIGIOUS DIVIDE CONTINUES TO WIDEN BETWEEN MUSLIM, HINDU COMMUNITY
Modi, dressed in a traditional kurta tunic, led the opening ceremony as Hindu priests chanted hymns inside the temple’s inner sanctum, where a 1.3-meter (4.3-foot) stone sculpture of Lord Ram was installed last week. A conch was blown by a priest to mark the temple’s opening and Modi placed a lotus flower in front of the black stone idol, decked in intricate gold ornaments and holding a golden bow and arrow. He later prostrated before the idol.
An audience is seen during the opening of a temple dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Ram in Ayodhya, India, on Jan. 22, 2024. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has opened a Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the holy city of Ayodhya, aiming to rally voters in an upcoming election.
Nearly 7,500 people, including elite industrialists, politicians and movie stars, witnessed the ritual on a giant screen outside the temple as a military helicopter showered flower petals.
""Our Lord Ram has arrived after centuries of wait,"" Modi said in a speech after the ceremony, receiving a resounding applause from thousands of attendees. He said the temple was built after ""countless sacrifices"" and is testament to a rising India ""breaking the shackles of slave mentality.""
""Jan. 22, 2024, is not merely a date but marks the dawn of a new era,"" Modi said.
RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS LEAD TO CONSERVATION EFFORTS FOR SACRED FORESTS IN INDIA
Modi's government turned the event into a national occasion by organizing live screenings across the country and closing offices for half a day. Saffron flags — the color of Hinduism — adorned the streets of various cities where government party workers had gone door to door handing out religious pamphlets.
Television news channels ran non-stop coverage of the event, portrayed as a religious spectacle. Some movie theaters broadcast the event live with complimentary popcorn. Many states declared the day a public holiday. In a rare step, stock and money markets were closed for the day.
""Ram Rajya (rule) begins,"" a TV news headline said. Ram Rajya is a Sankrit phrase that means just and ethical governance in Hinduism but has also been used by Hindu nationalists to signify Hindu domination in an officially secular India.
Modi has been the face of an unprecedented and unapologetic fusion of religion and politics in India. Ahead of the temple opening, he set the tone by visiting numerous Ram temples over 11 days as part of a Hindu ritual.
Analysts and critics see Monday’s ceremony as the start of the election campaign for Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist and one of India’s most consequential leaders. They say the pomp-filled display led by the government shows the extent to which the line between religion and state has eroded under Modi.
""Prime ministers prior to Modi have also been to temples, been to other places of worship, but they went there as devotees. This is the first time that he went there as somebody who performed the ritual,"" said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an expert in Hindu nationalism and author of a book on Modi.
The temple, located at one of India’s most vexed religious sites, is expected to embolden Modi’s chances of returning to power by drawing on the religious sentiments of Hindus, who make up 80% of India’s population of 1.4 billion.
Ayodhya, once crowded with tightly packed houses and rundown stalls, has undergone an elaborate makeover in the lead up to the temple's inauguration. Narrow roads have been turned into a four-lane pilgrimage route leading to the temple, tourists are arriving at a new airport and sprawling railway station, and major hotel chains are building new properties.
Jubilant devotees from across the country have arrived to celebrate the opening, with groups of them dancing to religious songs that blare from speakers on roads bedecked with flowers. Huge cut-outs of Lord Ram and billboards of Modi are ubiquitous across Ayodhya, where the borders have been sealed to prevent more people from coming in. Some 20,000 security personnel and more than 10,000 security cameras have been deployed.
The moment will be remembered as momentous and historic by many of the country’s Hindu citizens.
""I am here to see history unfolding before our eyes. For centuries, the story of Lord Ram has resonated in the hearts of millions,"" said Harish Joshi who arrived in Ayodhya from Uttarakhand state four days before the ceremony.
Built at an estimated cost of $217 million and spread over nearly 3 hectares (7.4 acres), the temple lies atop the debris of the 16th-century Babri Mosque, which was razed to the ground in 1992 by Hindu mobs who believed it was built on temple ruins marking the birthplace of Lord Ram.
The site has long been a religious flashpoint for the two communities, with the demolition of the mosque triggering bloody riots across India that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.
The dispute ended in 2019 when, in a controversial decision, India’s Supreme Court called the mosque’s destruction ""an egregious violation"" of the law but granted the site to Hindus while giving Muslims a different plot of land.
The fraught history is still an open wound for many Muslims, who have increasingly come under attack in recent years by Hindu nationalist groups and see the construction of the temple as a testament to Modi’s Hindu-first politics.
Officials say the temple, a three-story structure made of pink sandstone, will open to the public after the ceremony and they expect 100,000 devotees to visit daily. Builders are still working to finish 46 elaborate doors and intricate wall carvings.
NEW JERSEY OPENS LARGEST HINDU TEMPLE OUTSIDE INDIA
But not all are rejoicing. Four key Hindu religious authorities refused to attend, saying consecrating an unfinished temple goes against Hindu scriptures. Some top leaders from India’s main opposition Congress party also boycotted the event, with many opposition lawmakers accusing Modi of exploiting the temple for political points.
Neighboring Pakistan condemned the consecration, saying a temple built on the site of a demolished mosque would remain a blot on India’s democracy.
""There is a growing list of mosques (in India) facing a similar threat of desecration and destruction,"" Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It urged the international community to help save Islamic heritage sites in India from ""extremist groups"" and ensure that minority rights are protected.
At least three historical mosques in northern India are embroiled in court disputes overclaims by Hindu nationalists who say they were built over temple ruins. Hindu nationalists have also filed cases in Indian courts seeking ownership of hundreds of historic mosques."
ZCCZ8KL7M8_IG0IPBV8YOERUIT,Kamala Harris and the awful truth about her White House amateur hour,By Charlie Spiering Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 8:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-awful-truth-white-house-amateur-hour,"Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she was ""scared as heck"" going into 2024.
After three years of her chaos, countless reboots, and word salads, Americans in 2024 face the choice of whether Vice President Kamala Harris deserves another four years – and maybe not just as vice president. For the first time in recent history, there’s a real possibility that 81-year-old President Joe Biden, the oldest president to ever hold the job, might not make it through a second term if re-elected.
That’s right. Kamala Harris might be your next president — without ever running a successful presidential campaign on her own.
Despite running in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, voters never got the chance to offer a verdict on whether she was ready for the top job. She ended her campaign before the caucuses even began in Iowa.
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ADMITS SHE'S 'SCARED AS HECK' ABOUT A TRUMP WIN IN 2024
Her national political ambitions might have ended there, but Biden chose to resurrect her career, even though she attacked him during the primary for being a racist. She wasn’t his first choice for V.P., but his advisors – and even his old boss Barack Obama – convinced him that she was the right one.
In one of the last primary debates with Bernie Sanders, Biden had vowed to choose a woman running mate. He really liked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But the summer of 2020 brought a new problem for Democrats. The rancor and riots that ensued after the death of George Floyd raged on while Biden was considering his running mate, and Democrats knew choosing a black vice president was critical to their success in the general election. Biden confessed to Rep. James Clyburn he was ""having a little war between my head and my heart"" during the vetting process.
Biden had already angered Black voters by talking about the good old days when he worked with segregationists in the Senate and asserting that ""poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids."" Did you have a problem with that? Well, he argued, ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.’""
Biden’s team of advisors knew they needed a Black woman on the ticket to talk about racial issues if they had any hope of reassembling the voting coalition that carried Obama to victory.
BIDEN APPROVAL RATING NUMBERS DISMAL COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MODERN PRESIDENTS, GALLUP FINDSBut why Kamala Harris? Biden’s family resented the idea of picking Harris, the one person who stabbed him in the back during the primaries. Jill Biden was furious that day, telling donors on a phone call that Harris could ""Go f–k yourself."" Biden’s sister Valerie, a close advisor, was also not a fan of Harris.
This is why Biden seriously considered Susan Rice, despite her embarrassing attempt to cover up the motivations behind the Benghazi terrorist attack, and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., even though she was on the record praising and supporting communist dictator Fidel Castro. Biden was ultimately convinced to choose Harris. Jill Biden and the family could forgive her, but they would never forget her deeply personal attack against Joe.
The Harris pick made history, but once the bright lights of the inauguration dimmed, Team Biden pushed her in the background. At events at the White House, Harris was literally masked (due to the pandemic) and silent, standing in the background, as Biden took the lead. Despite Biden’s assurance that Harris would be a ""true partner"" in the White House, she was sidelined and isolated from political issues that mattered. In response, Harris became protective of her political future, reluctant to step in and help the president with politically difficult issues.

When Team Biden asked Harris to take on the immigration and border crisis she insisted she would only focus on the ""root causes"" of why migrants were leaving their home countries and flooding into the United States. ""Do not come!"" Harris told migrants during her trip to Guatemala in June 2021, but they came anyway, storming the border in record numbers.
Voters watched her incomprehensible ""word salads"" go viral, and despite multiple attempts at brand reboots and on-the-job media training, her approval ratings cratered. Staffers in her office fled in droves as Washington, D.C. insiders marveled at the wreckage. In the first 18 months, at least 13 staffers quit, clearly burdened by the tumultuous tornado surrounding Harris.
The first and second families are not close. First Lady Jill Biden has not invited Harris and her Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff for dinner in the residence of the White House, and the two couples rarely spend extended time in the same room.

The vice presidency was never meant to be a place for on-the-job training, but that has not stopped Harris and her rotating staff from trying to fix problems on the fly, often in public view.
It’s a popular parlor game in Washington, D.C. How do you solve a problem like Harris? Throughout my reporting, I was surprised that few in Washington, DC even like Harris, let alone feel like defending her. Washington can be cruel. Once a politician disappoints, that person is quietly sidelined until they go away.
As I investigated her career, it was clear all the signs were there. Harris and her allies scorn anyone who brings up her relationship with Willie Brown. But Brown was no ordinary political mentor and no ordinary boyfriend. He opened up important doors for Harris’ political career. Brown gifted her lucrative appointments on state boards and the keys to a BMW, completing her dramatic entry into his world. She dazzled the elites as she rose through the political ranks despite a lackluster performance as district attorney and as California attorney general.

Harris was eager to seize the leadership mantle of the next generation of the Democratic Party, after winning her Senate race as Hillary Clinton lost to Trump. Not content to stay in the Senate for a full term, Harris leveraged her position for the maximum sensational moments to fuel her ambitions for the ultimate prize: the White House.
Why not?
After all, President Obama only served in the Senate three years before launching his presidential campaign, challenging the Clinton establishment for the ultimate prize. But Harris was no Barack Obama. The darling of the California elite failed to impress Democrat voters — even in her home state.
Harris made history as the nation’s first Black and first female vice president, but as is often the case with history-making Democrats, they do not receive as much scrutiny from the press. Their past is wiped clean, they are hailed as change makers. Any criticism is dismissed as racist or sexist or both.

Americans of both political sides know that something is wrong with Harris, and that’s OK. In a free society, you are allowed to talk about politicians’ problems and point out her failings, and you are not a bad person for doing so, despite what Democrats and the media may tell you.
Failing to fully investigate, vet and scrutinize our public figures is the real danger to democracy. Before voters cast a ballot for Kamala Harris in 2024, they deserve to know who they’re really dealing with.

(YouTube: Brendan Kavanagh @DrKBoogieWoogie).
A British musician who got into a heated confrontation with Chinese nationals in a viral video spoke out about being shocked by the ""authoritarianism"" in their tone of speech.
Brendan Kavanagh, a British pianist with 2.2 million followers on YouTube (@DrKBoogieWoogie), was live-streaming a public performance of his piano riffs when the group of Chinese nationals was incidentally captured in the background. The Chinese nationals asked him not to record them, insisting he did not have the right to share their images online.
Kavanagh refused and that's when things got heated. The fight ultimately ended with threats of legal action and the police getting involved to deescalate.
Kavanagh told Fox News Digital in an interview that the clash at St. Pancras train station in London showcased ""a clash of cultures,"" which is why he thinks it ""caught the imagination of the world.""

""So, basically, the problem started when I disagreed with the ‘shouty guy.’ And then he started acting in a very peculiar manner,"" Kavanagh told Fox News Digital. ""They all had communist flags (the Chinese flag). And I said, ‘Are you communist?’ And… that was gasoline to the fire. He was prevaricating.""
Kavanagh said he then tried to gesture towards one of the women who was holding the Chinese flag in the U.K. station.
""I put my hand down to take it because I wanted to get the flag to show it to the camera. I put my hand down like you would just say, give me the flag. And then he said, 'Don't touch her.' Basically, [in my view] he tries to make out [that I was doing] some kind of assault.""
Kavanagh said he thought the ""shouty guy"" wanted a testy response, but he didn't give in.
""I didn't give him the reaction he wanted. He's not used to, kind of, cool, calm Western reaction, but I think he wanted me to sort of go into hysterics. I just thought the guy was ridiculous,"" he said.

He continued, ""They were constantly telling me what they were allowed to do, which I thought ironic, and they were constantly telling me what I was not allowed to do. And I thought, come on, for goodness sake, you are here shouting at me.""
Kavanagh said the incident is a stark example of the differences of values between the West and Communist China.
""So I think the authoritarianism [stood out]. The paradox of this situation is that they enjoy [being] here in the West, but they retain the authoritarian mentality of the Communist Party. And they brought up the St. Pancras station,"" he said. ""So their mindset was firmly based in China, and it did not work on me. And I think the whole world, the whole free world has shown them up for what they were, it's badly backfired on them.""

The musician said he learned a lot from the incident.
""They were the ones being aggressive, but they were painting themselves as the victim. So it is classic gaslighting. The whole communist system is narcissistic, perhaps. We could do some psychoanalysis on that, you know? … It gave me an insight.""
""I'm glad I'm not in China,"" he added.

ZGRFSBM8UV_B5HKZB60KY7TWYO,"Hearing loss more likely to affect rural Americans and men, new study shows",Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 7:19am EST",20240125,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/hearing-loss-more-likely-affect-rural-americans-men-new-study-shows,"A four-year-old child named Emily from Goole, East Yorkshire, England, is deaf and had been unable to share her Christmas list with Santa. Holly the Elf recently helped by using British Sign Language to communicate the wish list.
A new estimate shows hearing loss affects approximately 37.9 million Americans and is more common in rural areas than urban ones and in men than women.
The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet Regional Health-Americas Journal, is the first to estimate hearing loss rates at the state and county level, and was led by NORC at the University of Chicago. The estimates are for 2019 and only include people who have hearing loss in both ears.
While the study could not explain the reason for the geographic divide, experts who treat hearing loss say there are two factors to consider: how loud noises are and how often people hear them.
CHILDREN WITH INHERITED DEAFNESS HEAR FOR FIRST TIME THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPY
A person who rides the subway in a bustling city could, in theory, go six to eight hours before being at risk of hearing loss, said audiologist Nicholas Reed, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University who co-authored the study. On the other hand, hunters who don’t wear protection can damage their hearing with just a few pulls of the trigger.
Experts say rural Americans need better access to hearing screenings and specialists. Many jobs in rural areas may use loud machinery. Popular leisure activities in these areas, like hunting, woodworking and riding all-terrain vehicles, also put hearing at risk.
The study also found men were more likely than women to have hearing loss, starting at 35, which is in line with previous estimates. The highest rates were among non-Hispanic white people and those 65 and older.

""The number one risk factor for hearing loss is age,"" said David Rein, director of NORC's public health analytics program and the paper's lead author.
Audiologist Melanie Buhr-Lawler, a clinical professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said she saw the threats to hearing health growing up on a farm in rural Wisconsin and later researching hearing loss in rural residents.

""People who live in rural areas have a hearing health double-whammy,"" said Buhr-Lawler, who was not involved with the study. ""So they’re more exposed to high noise levels through their work, be it mining or farming or other rural occupations, but also through leisure activities.""
For years, her research team handed out thousands of ear plugs at a tractor pull in Tomah, Wisconsin, to raise awareness.

Democratic presidential candidate Dean Phillips, who secured around 20% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, described his experience attending a Trump rally in the Granite State.
When ""FOX & Friends"" co-host Steve Doocy asked him about his decision to connect with Trump supporters ahead of the vote, Phillips highlighted the importance of bipartisanship in the 2024 election, noting it was his ""responsibility"" to reach out to the other side.
""That's my responsibility, and I'm sick of this political culture that only rewards dividers,"" Phillips, D-Minn., said Wednesday.
""I flipped a district that had been Republican for 60 years in 2018. I didn't do so by just pandering to Democrats. I invited independents and Republicans. I'm the second-most bipartisan member of Congress for a reason.""

""I have great friendships with both sides of the aisle. Any leader of the free world should show up and the other side's rally and say hello and greet people, and I got to tell you, I spoke with 50,"" he continued.
""They were the most hospitable, thoughtful, kind people I've interacted with in a long time. Yesterday at the polls, I said hello to everybody holding signs. Biden signs, Williamson signs, my signs. Trump signs, Haley signs. People were so decent and I would call it ‘anger-tainment.’ ‘Anger-tainment’ would have us believe we are so much more divided than we are.""
Biden won the New Hampshire primary election decisively against Phillips and Marianne Williamson on Tuesday night. Biden secured more than 50% of the vote in a write-in campaign since his name did not appear on the ballot.
Phillips came in a distant second place with around 20% of the vote, and Williamson came in third place with more than 4% of the vote.
He reiterated the importance of phasing out elderly politicians, arguing Americans are ready for a Dean Phillips-Nikki Haley matchup in November, despite the fact both candidates have been accused of embarking on long-shot campaigns.

""I don't think these two men are the ones to do it. It's time for a new generation,"" Phillips said, urging viewers to connect with their fellow Americans face-to-face.
""Go out in the country, meet people, give some high-fives, handshakes and hugs, and let's get our act back together… That's my proposition, and I do think the country is ready for it. I just think that political duopoly is preventing what most Americans want,"" he continued.
BIDEN WINS NEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRAT PRIMARY AFTER WRITE-IN CAMPAIGN
Earlier this week, Phillips shut down the idea that he would launch a third-party run, scolding reporters for pressing him on the possibility.
""Well, we're in a primary, so there's no splitting the votes. I don't know what that means,"" he retorted in a video shared by Forbes. He reiterated that ""under no condition"" would he run on a third-party ticket, so he wouldn't be taking votes away from Biden in the general election and would oppose any third-party effort to take votes away from Biden if he doesn't secure the Democratic nomination.
""Couldn't be more clear. I don't understand why there's confusion,"" he told the group of reporters. Afterward, the Democrat grew frustrated when asked if he would ""dissuade"" a third-party challenger to Biden.
""First of all, I just hope one of you asks a question about what people really care [about] right now. That's just a simple request,"" Phillips lectured the reporters. ""I've been here for 90 days and you know how many people have asked me any of the questions that you have so far? Not one.""

Meanwhile, Biden warned the ""stakes could not be higher"" after he and Trump both secured resounding victories in the Granite State.
""It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher. Our democracy. Our personal freedoms — from the right to choose to the right to vote. Our economy — which has seen the strongest recovery in the world since COVID. All are at stake,"" Biden said in a statement.
""I want to thank all those who wrote my name in this evening in New Hampshire. It was a historic demonstration of commitment to our democratic process. And I want to say to all those Independents and Republicans who share our commitment to core values of our nation — our democracy, our personal freedoms, an economy that gives everyone a fair shot — to join us as Americans.""

President Biden’s younger brother, James Biden, is in active negotiations to appear for a deposition before House Republicans, Fox News has learned.
The younger Biden was subpoenaed as part of the investigation into Hunter Biden and President Biden in November.
House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry into President Biden believe that James has knowledge of Hunter’s business deals and whether the president was involved.
The president’s brother was scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition in early December, but that date came and went. Conversations continue between the House Oversight Committee and Biden’s legal team.

""I'm going to hold off criticism of the president's brother. He obviously has due process and we have heard from his attorney. We're trying to make that work and I feel like that'll happen soon,"" House Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said last month.
The Washington Post reported in December that James Biden’s conversations were swept up in an FBI investigation, though he was not the target.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
An Arkansas group trying to make access to public documents and meetings a constitutionally protected right sued the state's attorney attorney general on Tuesday for rejecting the language of their proposed ballot measure.
Arkansas Citizens for Transparency asked the state Supreme Court in a 14-page filing to order Attorney General Tim Griffin to either approve the language of their proposal or substitute it with more suitable language.
Griffin's approval is needed before the group can begin gathering the 90,704 signatures from registered voters required to qualify. The group faces a July 5 deadline to turn in signatures to get their proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot.
AR ATTORNEY GENERAL BLOCKS PROPOSED AMENDMENT PROTECTING ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT RECORDS
The group argued that Griffin overstepped his authority in rejecting the measure, saying under law he either must approve the measure's language or substitute language.

""The attorney general’s rejection of the ballot title and popular name demonstrates that he has either a complete lack of understanding of his role in the initiative process or he is intentionally thwarting the effort of the petitioner to get this amendment approved for the ballot so that the voters of the state can decide its merits,"" the group said in its filing.
Griffin in December rejected the wording of the proposed ballot measure, citing a ""lack of clarity"" on key terms in the measure. Griffin in January rejected four revised versions of the measure the group had submitted, saying they failed to resolve the problems he cited earlier.

""I am confident in our review and analysis of ballot submissions and look forward to the Arkansas Supreme Court’s review in this case,"" the Republican attorney general said in a statement released by his office.

Sanders had initially proposed broader exemptions limiting the public’s access to records about her administration, but that proposal faced a backlash that included media groups and some conservatives."

Ron DeSantis suspending his bid for the nomination and why she would be poised to win in a head-to-head against President Biden.
Nikki Haley believes she can attract some of Gov. Ron DeSantis' supporters even though the Florida Republican endorsed former President Trump after withdrawing from the race for the GOP nomination.
""I think his supporters are up for grabs,"" the former U.N. ambassador told Steve Doocy in an exclusive ""Fox & Friends"" interview that aired Monday.
""Think about it. His supporters love America and they wanted a new generational leader. We give them that.""

DeSantis suspended his struggling bid for the nomination on Sunday after coming in second in the Iowa caucuses, leaving Haley as the only alternative to former President Trump left in the race.
Ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, DeSantis failed to reach 10% of the expected vote. Trump, meanwhile, still holds a massive lead over Haley in the race, with many speculating DeSantis' endorsement could lead his supporters to gravitate toward Trump in the Granite State and beyond.
Haley said she ""know[s]"" she's ""getting to"" Trump at this point in the race, pointing to his attacks slamming her as a ""losing candidate who puts America last.""

""I have said head-to-head, Trump loses to Biden. I win by double digits. This is about how do we win in November? And you know you can't win with Donald Trump. We're going to make sure you win with Nikki Haley.""
The former South Carolina governor has support from many independent voters, including some Doocy questioned at campaign events in New Hampshire on Sunday.
""I'm glad to see her here. And I think she's got a really good chance,"" one said.
TRUMP ADDRESSES ENTHUSIASTIC NEW HAMPSHIRE VOLUNTEERS, ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT OF ‘DESANCTIMONIOUS’ NICKNAME
Another said, as an independent voter, his support for Haley stems from an eagerness to get rid of President Biden while also preventing a second term for Trump.
""I think a lot of people are looking for a change in approach, and they're not comfortable with either major candidate,"" he said.
Some recognizable names have also thrown their support behind Haley, including New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and popular TV personality and former Manhattan family court judge Judy Sheindlin.
""It's not just the electability that she brings as the presidency, but we win everything up and down the ballot and that's what we want as Republicans. We're tired of losers. We're tired of losing. Nikki brings a winning attitude to the entire team,"" Sununu said.

When it comes to family, many might assume ""the more, the merrier"" — but for some, that might not be the case, according to a recent study.
Researchers from The Ohio State University found that teens with a greater number of siblings reported poorer mental health than those who came from smaller families.
""The association between the number of siblings and mental health was negative in two large datasets in different countries (U.S. and China),"" Doug Downey, lead author of the study and professor of sociology at The Ohio State University, told Fox News Digital.
HEART DISEASE RISK INCREASES FOR YOUNG ADULTS WHO HAVE LOST A SIBLING, STUDY FINDS
The large-scale study, published last month in the Journal of Family Issues, included more than 9,400 eighth graders in China and more than 9,100 children of the same age in the U.S.
The participants in both countries answered various questions about their mental health.
Researchers from The Ohio State University found that teens with a greater number of siblings reported poorer mental health than those with smaller families. (iStock)
Based on the responses, among the Chinese teens, the ones with no siblings were found to have the best mental health.
In the U.S., teens with no siblings or just one sibling had the best mental health.
SPIKE IN TEEN DEPRESSION ALIGNS WITH RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA, NEW POLL SUGGESTS: ‘IT’S NOT GOING ANYWHERE’
The age differences between siblings also appeared to be a factor, the study found.
Those who had older siblings and siblings who were born within a year of one another were shown to have the worst mental well-being.
One theory about the study's findings is what Downey calls the ""resource dilution"" explanation.
""But when you add more siblings, each child gets fewer resources and [less] attention from the parents, and that may have an impact on their mental health,"" said one of the study researchers. (iStock)
""If you think of parental resources like a pie, one child means they get all the pie — all the attention and resources of the parents,"" he said in an OSU press release.
""But when you add more siblings, each child gets fewer resources and [less] attention from the parents, and that may have an impact on their mental health.""
""If you think of parental resources like a pie, one child means they get all the pie – all the attention and resources of the parents.""
The researchers were surprised by the findings, given that previous research had shown hints of positive outcomes related to siblings, such as better social skills and lower probability of divorce, noted Downey.
The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.
""We found an association between [the] number of siblings and poorer mental health — but we cannot be sure that it is causal,"" Downey said.
The researchers also did not analyze the quality of sibling relationships, which could have a direct impact on mental health.
The researchers were surprised by the findings, as previous research had shown hints of positive outcomes related to siblings. However, they noted the study's limitations. They did not analyze the quality of sibling relationships, for instance. (iStock)
At this point, Downey said, it is too early to recommend any changes in human behavior based on these findings.
""Scholars are only beginning to understand the consequences of fertility change,"" he told Fox News Digital.
""As fertility decline continues, understanding the consequences of growing up with fewer siblings becomes increasingly important,"" he added. ""In this case, the evidence appears to be positive.""
TEACHING VALUES TO OUR KIDS CAN ONLY HELP THEM FLOURISH AND SOUTH CAROLINA IS LEADING THE WAY
Kim Arrington, a clinical psychologist at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, was not involved in the study but offered her input on the findings.
""With this study, we are witnessing the results of the evolution of modern societies away from agrarian societies where having multiple children could be an asset to working farms,"" she told Fox News Digital.
""In psychology, ‘resource dilution’ suggests that the availability of parental resources, such as time, attention and finances, decreases as the number of children in a family increases,"" a psychologist told Fox News Digital.  (iStock)
""Now, with greater specialization in jobs and higher economic demands in our culture resulting in many households requiring two working parents, there are fewer resources in the form of attention from parents to go around, no doubt having an effect on child development.""
In Arrington’s opinion, modern cultures are also less likely to have multi-generational households and communities that, in the past, served as additional sources of childcare, when it was easier for families to pool resources.
""Prior studies showed advantages to having more siblings, so overall the data is mixed.""
Alex Dimitriu, M.D., a psychiatrist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine in California, also was not part of the OSU research, but he shared his thoughts on the concept of ""research dilution.""

Dimitriu said he would expect there to be a ""sweet spot"" for the number of siblings.

Spain’s Supreme Court ruled Monday that authorities acted illegally when they sent unaccompanied child migrants back to Morocco after thousands of people forced their way from the North African country onto Spanish soil in 2021.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors were among a surge of around 10,000 people who tried to enter Ceuta, a Spanish enclave in North Africa, by scaling a border fence or swimming around it.
Many were believed to be sub-Saharan migrants seeking a better life in Europe. Morocco later took back most of the migrants.

Spain’s Interior Ministry defended sending the unaccompanied children back across the border, arguing that they wanted to go home. Spanish officials denied accusations by rights groups that the returns breached international law.

Spain is legally obliged to care for young migrants until their relatives can be located or until they turn 18, but officials said that a 2007 agreement between Spain and Morocco for assisted returns once children’s cases had been considered.
The Supreme Court judges rejected arguments that the 2007 agreement superseded Spanish law and said the mass return contravened the European Convention on Human Rights.
OVER 500 MIGRANTS ARRIVE AT SPANISH CANARY ISLANDS IN 24 HOURS
Tens of thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan countries try to reach Spain each year in large open boats launched from northwest Africa. Most go to the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, while others try to cross the Mediterranean Sea to mainland Spain or scale Ceuta’s fence.
Several thousand are known to die making the hazardous sea journeys."
ZUZDIF20WX_N9IT6VVQ2ALTKX1,Biden abandons his own judicial nominee who once released man later involved in murder of 10-year-old,By Brianna Herlihy Fox News,"Published January 23, 2024 4:00am EST",20240123,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-abandons-his-own-judicial-nominee-once-released-man-later-involved-murder-10-year-old,"A nominee for a district judgeship in Oklahoma struggled during her nomination hearing on Wednesday after Sen. John Kennedy asked her to define basic terms for orders issued regularly by judges.
President Biden’s nomination of a judge who once released a man later involved in the murder of a 10-year-old, was not renewed after mounting pressure from Republicans in the senate, despite a Democrat majority.
President Biden originally nominated Judge Todd Edelman in 2022 to serve on the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C. Edelman currently sits on the district's Superior Court, where he presided over a case involving Christian Wingfield.
Wingfield was awaiting trial for illegal possession of a firearm when Edelman released Wingfield with a GPS monitoring ankle bracelet. Shortly after his release, Wingfield was involved in the murder of a 10-year-old boy, Davon McNeal, July 4, 2020, while attending a ""stop the violence"" cookout.
""Crime in DC and across the country is skyrocketing, thanks in large part to radical, activist judges like Judge Edelman,"" Senator Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and opposed Edelman, told Fox News Digital.

""A child died because Judge Edelman didn’t do his job, but President Biden wanted to give him a promotion. I am pleased to see that the White House has backed down from its reckless decision to nominate Edelman to the federal bench,"" she said.
The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the matter.
In an op-ed published by the Washington Post, author Dana Milbank, who is reportedly a friend of Edelman, said he was ""an important pick for progressives."" Milbank lamented Democrats’ inability to overwhelm Republican criticisms of Edelman, saying Democrats ""cowered.""
""[I]f Democrats are so cowardly that they won’t fight back and won’t answer the lies with truth, then the battle to preserve our democracy is already lost no matter who wins at the polls,"" said Milbank.

In November of 2022, Edelman was questioned about his decision to release Wingfield in his nomination hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""When you made the choice to release Mr. Wingfield, you knew these following facts,"" Senator Blackburn told Edelman at the hearing. ""You knew that he had multiple arrests for illegally possessing a firearm.""
""And you know that he had been identified as the person who, on another occasion, had been shooting a gun in the street at 1 p.m. in broad daylight,"" she pressed.

Blackburn added that a week prior to Edelman’s decision to release Wingfield, another judge denied Wingfield’s request for pre-trial release because he posed a ""safety risk"" to the community.

Edelman said he recalled ""virtually all the facts"" and defended his decision by calling the charge of illegal gun possession ""non-violent.""
Edelman also stated that Wingfield pleaded guilty to ""a lesser charge"" of associating with the group that killed McNeal and was not the person who fired the gun. Wingfield eventually pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.
Edelman failed to earn enough votes in the committee to proceed to a full senate confirmation, which let his confirmation expire at the end of the 117th Congress. With Democrats in the majority, his failure to earn enough committee votes indicates that at least one Democrat was unwilling to back him for the judgeship.
President Biden did not renew is nomination.
