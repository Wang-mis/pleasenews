US President Joe Biden had harsh words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas in the aftermath of the terror group’s execution of six hostages held in Gaza, including Israel-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin.Biden spoke with reporters prior to his meeting with members of his negotiating team at the White House on Monday.He appeared to confirm reports that the US would soon present a final hostage deal to Israel and Hamas.“We’re very close to that,” he said when asked about that report. He was also quizzed as to why this effort would be successful when past initiatives had failed, he said, “Hope springs eternal.”He added “We're not giving up. We're going to continue to push as hard as we can.”Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, told Reuters that Biden’s comments were an acknowledgment that Netanyahu was undermining efforts.Zuhri added that any proposal for a permanent ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal would be received positively.  Biden spoke as Hersh, 23, was laid to rest in Jerusalem. Hamas released a video just before the funeral of the six hostages making short statements while in captivity. The other hostages were Eden Yerushalmi, Carmel Gat, Almog Sarusi, Alexander Lobanov and Ori Danino.It was expected that four of the six, including Hersh would be freed in the first phase of a three-part deal that has been on the table since May 31.Israelis rally in Tel Aviv calling for a release of all hostages in the Gaza Strip, September 2 (credit: TOMER NEUBERG/FLASH90)With their death, there are 101 remaining hostages in Gaza, of which 66 are presumed to be alive.Although it was Labor Day weekend, Biden met in the White House’s Situation Room on Monday morning with Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and US Special Envoy Brett McGurk.Biden presses NetanyahuBiden, Harris and Sullivan have all spoken with Hersh’s parents Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg.At the meeting Biden “expressed his devastation and outrage at the murder, and reaffirmed the importance of holding Hamas’s leaders accountable,” the White House said.
