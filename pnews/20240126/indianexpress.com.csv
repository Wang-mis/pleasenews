With the success of Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s 12th Fail highlighting the struggle of an aspirant to become a police officer, the title of Rohit Shetty’s first OTT experiment — Indian Police Force may also act as a first move tactic to immediately capture the audience’s imagination, but there is a problem — Indian police of independent India are not a ‘force’ but a ‘service’.
Police as a ‘Force’
In the colonial era, under the British, the police were regarded as an instrument of force, oppression and a tool to strike fear among the common men. Vikram Singh, former DGP, Uttar Pradesh in his earlier interview told The Indian Express, “Let me take you back to the year 1861. The Police Act of 1861 was programmed and designed to make the police an instrument of exploitation of the masses. The legacy of being repressive and extortionist was accompanied by lower salaries. So, corruption, unfortunately, got associated with the police service. It is often said, ‘Bad acha, Badnaam bura’ (A bad man is better than a bad name). We have inherited that reputation.”
IPS Renuka Mishra, DG/Chairperson of UP Police Recruitment and Promotion Board in an earlier interview spoke about the police uniform as a symbol of force. “It is true, due to historical reasons, that the Indian police have always been seen as a symbol of power, force, coerciveness, and essentially the strong arm of the state instead of the strong arm of the law. Kings were replaced by the British and then in a democracy by the state. During British rule, barring the Superintendent of Police, who was British, the rest were Indians and were used by the British Raj to keep the public in check and in forced compliance with their directives, many of which were detrimental to the person, property, and dignity of the public. Some of the extreme sections of law being questioned today as colonial legacy were used by Indians in the police against fellow Indians at the behest of the British rulers. This laid the foundation for the police ethos and subculture. It will need considerable reform to shed this. Hence the khaki suffers from this legacy and was able to create a positive image in the minds of citizens of independent India possibly only in crises like disasters and pandemics”, says Mishra.
Police as a ‘Service’
The Indian Police Service or IPS, is one of the three All India Services of the Government of India. In 1948, a year after India gained independence from Britain, the Indian (Imperial) Police was replaced by the Indian Police Service. It was created under Article 312 (2) in part XIV of the Constitution of India.
The value of ‘service’ in both letter and spirit is best expressed on the website of the Indian Police Services (Central) Association: “The Indian Police Service is not a force itself but a service…”. Most importantly, the motto of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad reads, “Satya, Seva, Suraksha.” (Truth, Service, Security).
‘Service’ here is a shift from the colonial legacy of ‘force’ which is a reminder to the Indian police that they can discharge their duties with integrity if they have the spirit of ‘service’ to their nation and its people.
So what…
Film titles like books make an unavoidable impression which may directly affect the emotions and psychology of viewers. Hence it becomes important to choose them correctly especially if there is a evolutionary history to them and if the title is a job or career that inspires many young minds to join it, especially in a country like India where lakhs of aspirants dream to be an IPS officer every year. So, films that are seen as a source of inspiration, have to be ethically right, even with their titles.
Retired IPS Vikram Singh says, “The images of police officers portrayed in cinemas including in Dabbang and Singham are not the real images of a police officer. Nor are they what some officers on social media show it to you. That shouldn’t inspire you.”
So, to cut a story short, while Rohit Shetty’s idea to add the word ‘force’ in the title of his new series might suit his brand of filmmaking, it is not in line with the ethos of the Indian Police ‘Services’."

Fadnavis also posted a video on Bal Thackeray saying, “Balasaheb Thackeray was not just a powerful leader but also an ardent cartoonist whose impactful views resonated through his art. Salutations to the founder of Shiv Sena, Balasaheb Thackeray, on his birth anniversary. Late Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray was and will remain our inspiration.”
In the video posted by Fadnavis, there were images of Bal Thackeray with BJP leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
हिंदूहृदयसम्राट, वंदनीय शिवसेनाप्रमुख स्व. बाळासाहेब ठाकरे यांना जयंतीदिनी कोटी कोटी प्रणाम!#BalasahebThackeray #HinduHridaySamrat #Maharashtra #Hindutva pic.twitter.com/aCLeQV0Byg
— Devendra Fadnavis (@Dev_Fadnavis) January 23, 2024
The video showed old clippings of Bal Thackeray where he was heard saying in an interview, “To me, Hindutva is Rashtravad (nationalism). And if Rashtravad is a crime, I will commit it repeatedly.”
Fadnavis said in the video, “Today, the Ram temple at Ayodhya has been consecrated under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. I wish Balasaheb Thackeray were alive to witness the historic moment.”
Fadnavis added, “When Babri Mosque was demolished, the media asked Bal Thackeray for his comments. In response, Balasaheb Thackeray said, ‘If my Sainiks did the Babri Masjid demolition, I will be proud’.”
It is no secret that the BJP central and state leaders had always maintained cordial relations with Bal Thackeray, who died in 2012. Despite differences with Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Bal Thackeray’s son Uddhav, BJP leaders at both centre and state have always exercised caution not to distance themselves from Bal Thackeray. In fact, the BJP leaders always go the extra mile to appropriate Thackeray senior and his Hindutva legacy.
A senior BJP functionary said, “We admit Bal Thackeray was and will remain our inspiration. Offering tribute on his birth anniversary is natural. It is a social decorum.”
On Monday, when BJP celebrated the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Shiv Sena (UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray, along with family and party leaders, offered prayers at the famous Kalaram temple at Nashik and he is set to address a public rally at Nashik on Tuesday.
Fadnavis and the BJP have been accusing Shiv Sena (UBT) of compromising on the Hindutva agenda by allying with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).
On every public platform, Uddhav Thackeray has been attacking the BJP, saying that his Shiv Sena’s Hindutva is inclusive and does not subscribe to the dogmas and narrow-mindedness of the BJP.
Earlier, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut questioned Fadnavis’s role as kar sevak for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, “Fadnavis must have gone to Nagpur railway station for a walk.”
The remarks invited sharp rebuke from the deputy chief minister, who quipped, “I don’t respond to fools.”"

Of the 14 people aboard the plane, including the pilot, eight sustained minor injuries and were treated in a local health centre, they said.
The plane had come to take back 92 Myanmarese soldiers who crossed over to India last week, following gunfights with an ethnic insurgent group, they said.
Officials said the Myanmar air force Y-8 cargo plane overshot the tabletop runway of the Mizoram government-run airport around 10.20 am and crash-landed into a nearby bush, splitting the bottom of the fuselage.
The injured were taken to Lengpui primary health centre for treatment, they added. The runway is closed for the time being and all flights have been cancelled for today, an official said.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered an investigation into the accident, a state government official said.
“All flights have been cancelled. Hoping passengers would be able to either fly in or fly out as soon as possible, especially people with medical emergency,” she said.
In all, 276 Myanmarese soldiers had entered Mizoram last week and 184 were sent back on Monday, officials said, adding the remaining 92 soldiers were to be repatriated in batches, they said.
The plane was supposed to take them to Sittwe in Myanmar’s Rakhine state.
The Myanmarese soldiers entered Bandukbanga village in Mizoram’s Lawngtlai district with their weapons on January 17 and approached the Assam Rifles. They had fled to the northeastern state after their camp was overrun and captured by ‘Arakan Army’ fighters.
The soldiers were taken to the nearby Assam Rifles camp at Parva, and later majority of them were shifted to Lunglei, the official said.
They have been under the supervision of the Assam Rifles since then, the official said. These soldiers were brought to Aizawl over Saturday and Sunday to be sent to Myanmar from Lengpui airport.
The group, headed by a colonel, has 36 officers and 240 lower-rank personnel, officials said.
With the 276 soldiers who entered last week, as many as 635 Myanmar soldiers have fled to Mizoram after their camps were overrun and captured by ethnic armed organisations and pro-democratic forces over the last few months, officials said.
In November, 104 Myanmar army personnel were sent to the border town of Moreh in Manipur from different places in Mizoram by Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters, and then repatriated.
Earlier this month, 255 soldiers were sent back via the Lengpui airport by Myanmar air force planes.
Mizoram shares a 510-km-long border with Myanmar."

Parakram Diwas aims to instill fearlessness and patriotism, especially among the youth, inspiring them to stand strong in the face of challenges. Netaji’s unmatched courage and charm served as a guiding light, motivating Indians to fearlessly oppose colonial rule.
Schools and colleges nationwide organise cultural events on Subhash Chandra Bose Jayanti. The Indian national flag is raised ceremoniously, and monuments like Netaji Museum, Netaji Bhawan, and INA Museum are adorned with garlands. Students take the stage to deliver speeches, reflecting on Netaji’s inspiring legacy and that of other freedom fighters.

06NTHV7VOQ_YB75K4CPHOY176V,‘Starbucks’ franchise application: Delhi HC orders Google to immediately suspend 15 URLs of Google forms,Malavika Prasad,"Updated: January 24, 2024 20:18 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/starbucks-franchise-application-delhi-hc-google-immediately-suspend-15-urls-google-forms-9125496/,"The Delhi High Court has directed Google LLC to “immediately suspend” within a week at least 15 URLs of various Google forms inviting the public to apply for ‘Starbucks’ franchise.
The order was passed after the Starbucks Corporation moved an application in its pending lawsuit seeking decree of permanent injunction for infringement of their ‘STARBUCKS’ mark and copyright in its logos and other reliefs. The application sought a direction to Google to suspend the URLs of Google forms mentioned in Starbucks’ application.
A single judge bench of Justice Anish Dayal in its January 22 order noted, “Perusal of the said Google Forms would bear out that the heading of the said form is ‘StarBucks franchise’ and states that one can apply on the form to get more information about taking franchise of Starbucks. The said Google form also has a picture of the Starbucks storefront”.
The court directed Google to provide Starbucks the user details of the registrants of these Google forms within two weeks, adding that the information will be subject to “their own internal policy and regulation”.
Starbucks argued that the “imposters are seeking information from the general public to apply for Starbucks Franchise opportunities” which do not exist in India.
Justice Dayal, thereafter, opined that Starbucks Corporation would be entitled to the relief they seek in its application, since the Google Forms are being posted by imposters “to elicit information relating to Starbucks franchise (which do not exist in India) as well as seeking private information and data from the general public, which cannot be countenanced”.
Google submitted that it has no issue with the relief sought, as long as the URLs which are pointed out by Starbucks in the application relates to the subject matter of their main lawsuit.
Starbucks submitted that URLs mentioned relate only to Google Forms which are eliciting information for Starbucks franchise (which do not exist in India) and their relief is restricted to the same.
Justice Dayal also said that Starbucks will be at liberty to file an affidavit listing out other similar URLs linking to Google forms related to inviting information from the public for Starbucks franchise and also through written or email communication to Google who may suspend them.
The HC further said that if Google has any reservation with respect to a particular URL, it may inform Starbucks. Starbucks may in turn approach the court for further adjudication, the High Court said."
0B3E2SZXMU_1FVN0OWY0U24J6Z,"INDIA alliance in Bengal hangs on Congress demand for more than 2 seats, but why numbers an eyeopener",Anjishnu Das,"Updated: January 25, 2024 18:23 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/india-alliance-bengal-congress-seats-9127505/,"On Wednesday, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee said seat-sharing with the Congress in the state’s Lok Sabha seats was off the table. The dispute arose over the number of seats the TMC was ready to give to the Congress as part of the INDIA alliance, with the Congress rejecting the offer of the 2 Lok Sabha seats that it had won in the previous polls.
Seat-sharing talks in Bengal were always going to be difficult, particularly given the hesitance of the state units of the Congress and CPI(M) towards an alliance with the TMC. As the Congress central leadership remains hopeful of achieving a breakthrough, here is why it has few cards in its hands:
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, which the TMC has been citing as proof of the Congress’s weakness in the state, the Congress contested 40 of the state’s 42 seats and won 2, with 5.7% of the vote share. It was the party’s second worst Lok Sabha performance in the state since 1998.
While the TMC won 22 seats with 43.7% of the vote share, the BJP emerged as the primary opposition for the first time in a Lok Sabha election in the state, displacing the Congress and CPI(M) to win 18 seats and 40.6% of the vote share.
While the Congress won comfortably in Baharampur, with its state chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury getting 45.5% of the vote share, it faced a much tougher fight in Maldaha Dakshin, where Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury’s 35.1% vote share was just 0.7% points ahead of the BJP runner-up.
In the rest of the state, the party’s performance was dismal, with the Congress finishing as the runner-up in just 1 seat, third in 5 seats, and fifth in 1 seat. In as many as 31 of the 42 seats, it came fourth.
The Congress’s 2014 Lok Sabha poll performance had been only slightly better – winning four of the 42 seats it contested, with 9.7% of the vote share. Besides Baharampur and Maldaha Dakshin, which it had won with the same candidates as in 2019, the Congress had won Maldaha Uttar and Jangipur.
In the other seats, the party was the runner-up in only 2 seats, while finishing third or lower in as many as 36 seats.
Historically, the Congress hasn’t been a major player in the state’s Lok Sabha polls since the 1960s. It hasn’t crossed the 10-seat mark since 1984 and its vote share has been declining consistently since then. In the first 11 Lok Sabha elections till 1998 though, the Congress had won more than 35% of the votes in all but two polls.
Then came the formation of the TMC by Mamata as a breakaway faction of the Congress. In 1998, the Congress saw its vote share fall to 15.2% from 40.1% in 1996. The party’s vote share hasn’t exceeded 15% since then and dropped to less than 10% in the last two polls.
In terms of seats, the Congress won a majority of the state’s Lok Sabha constituencies in 1952, 1957 and 1962, but has been the single largest party just once since then, in 1967. After the CPI(M) emerged as the dominant player in Bengal in the early 1970s, the Congress was relegated to playing second fiddle. Since 1998 and the TMC’s formation, the Congress has been the second largest party twice and finished as the third largest party thrice.
The Congress hasn’t fared much better in the recent Assembly polls either. In 2021, it won none of the 92 seats it contested in an alliance with the CPI(M) and Indian Secular Front (ISF), securing just 3% of the vote share. The party was the runner-up in just 6 seats, finishing third or lower in the remaining 86 seats.
Ally CPI(M) failed to win a single seat, garnering just 4.8% of the votes in the 138 seats it contested. The ISF, floated just ahead of the elections, fared better, with 1 seat.
The TMC won in a landslide in the 2021 elections, with 213 of the 294 Assembly seats and 48.5% of the vote share, while the BJP continued its 2019 Lok Sabha run in Bengal by recording its best ever performance in the state, winning 77 seats and 38.5% of the vote share.
The Congress’s 2016 Assembly poll performance was considerably better – it had won 44 seats from the 92 it contested, and secured 12.3% of the vote share. Not only was it the second largest party overall, it finished as the runner-up in 39 seats and third or lower in nine seats.
The CPI(M), too, had fared better, but despite getting 19.8% of the vote share, it had finished behind the Congress, winning 26 of the 148 seats it contested.
The TMC was the dominant party in 2016 too, winning 211 seats and 44.9% of the vote share. The BJP at the time had won just three seats from the 291 contested, but was close to the Congress in terms of vote share at 10.2%.
Historically, the Congress hasn’t been at the forefront of state politics since the early 1970s. It won its last Assembly election in 1972, after which the CPI(M) won seven consecutive state polls until losing to the TMC in 2011. After that, the TMC has been the dominant state party.
Since 1972, when it recorded its highest ever seat tally of 216 seats in what was then a 280-member Assembly, the Congress has not won more than 82 seats in the state (in 1996). After the TMC was founded in 1998, the Congress’s seat tally hasn’t exceeded 44.
In terms of vote share, the Congress has crossed the 40%-mark just once since 1972. Since 2001, its vote share has been below 15% in every poll."

Patel was seeking temporary relief on the ground of him suffering from “rapid palpitations and chest discomfort”.
The court of principal district and sessions judge D M Vyas of Ahmedabad rural court rejected the plea while directing the jail authority to send Patel to UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre for medical check-up for his complaint of chest pain and produce medical check-up report within 10 days.
Patel in July 2023 mowed down nine people and injured 13 others while driving his Jaguar car at a speed of over 140 kmph on the flyover. He faces charges of culpable homicide and rash driving, among others
Patel submitted before the court that he had undergone electrophysiology in February 2023 and was experiencing discomfort and high palpitations again and is thus required to undergo medical check up and treatment, seeking release on temporary bail for four weeks.
.The prosecution and the investigating officer had opposed his plea, submitting that UNMICRC is capable of providing all treatment and check-up.
The court, while rejecting his plea, also took into account that when Patel had complained of left side chest pain on September 12, 2023, a physician from UNMICRC had examined him and the ECG result was normal."

The farmers also raised their voice against alleged pro-corporate farm policies.
Tractor parades were held in several districts of Uttar Pradesh besides other states after the official Republic Day function.
“On this 74th anniversary of the People of India having given to themselves the Constitution of India, we solemnly resolve to struggle to defend our right to a dignified life and livelihood as guaranteed by the Constitution and which is threatened today by the brazen and shameless pro-corporate farm policies of the BJP-controlled Union government,” said farmer organisation Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) in a statement.
“We pledge to resist corporate attempt to control and sell costly inputs, including electricity and machinery, to change the cropping pattern to suit their markets, to wind up farm subsidies and assured pricing and procurement of crops, to control food storage and thereby control food supply for profiteering, to take over food processing and food markets, to undermine PDS security for the poor, and to take over and commercialise farm land, forest and water resources,” it added.
SKM is an umbrella organisation of farmer unions across the country. It had urged farmers and associated unions to take out a tractor parade over several long-pending demands.
“There were around 300 tractors in our parade today, from Chilla border to Pari Chowk. The protest went on for around three hours. We raised our demands peacefully and this was our message to the government: This is just a rehearsal; actual show will take place in Delhi if the demands of the farmers are not accepted. This is everybody’s Republic Day and people celebrate it in their own way. So, we took out a tractor parade. The government should listen to the farmers in place of defaming them for raising their voice for their demands,” said Pawan Khatana, the Western UP Chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), who led the parade on behalf of SKM.
He further said that the farmers have resolved for a Bharat Bandh on February 16 and Kisan Mahapanchayat on March 14 in New Delhi. “We will not let our Tricolour fall. We will also not let the government benefit capitalists from agriculture. It is the farmers who have played the biggest role in the nation’s development. It is the son of the farmer who stands guard at the border to protect the country. Who is a bigger deshbhakt than us?” Khatana said.
Notably, the parade comes exactly three years after January 26, 2021, when thousands of farmers had allegedly clashed with the police in Delhi during a large rally during which many had reached the Red Fort.
“The parade was part of the second phase of the farmers’ struggle to force the Central government to implement the written assurance of December 9, 2021, and provide legal guarantee of MSP at C2+50% formula with guaranteed procurement for all crops to farmers, comprehensive loan waiver, stopping of privatisation of the power sector and pre-paid meters, reducing input costs, ensuring simple and universal crop insurance controlled by the government, etc.,” said SKM in a statement on Friday’s tractor parade."

Tendering his resignation to the Speaker, Vaghela said that he resigned as per the wish of his voters “to strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.
Vaghela is the fourth MLA to have resigned from the Gujarat Assembly recently. The strength of the Assembly formed in December 2022 has now been reduced to 178.
The three other MLAs who have resigned include AAP Visavadar MLA Bhupendra Bhayani as well as Congress MLAs Chirag Patel and C J Chavda from Khambhat and Vijapur constituencies, respectively.
Speaking to the media after tendering his resignation, Vaghela said, “I have resigned as per the wish of my voters who wanted to strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” He added that he does not have any grievances towards BJP and will join the party soon.
Vaghela was one of the three Independent candidates elected to the 15th Gujarat Assembly in December 2022. Dhavalsinh Zala from Bayad in Aravalli district and Mavji Desai from Dhanera in Banaskantha were the other MLAs. All the three Independent MLAs have already declared their support to the BJP in Gujarat.
In the 2022 elections, Vaghela had contested as an Independent candidate after BJP denied him a ticket and defeated BJP’s Ashwin Patel by over 14,000 votes.
Senior Congress leader Mukul Wasnik, meanwhile, said in Ahmedabad that the “BJP’s tactics of buying Opposition MLAs was damaging democracy and harming politics”.
His comments came days after three-time Congress MLA CJ Chavda resigned from the Assembly. On Thursday, While Vaghela quit on Thursday, AAP MLA Bhupendra Bhayani had resigned last month.
“We all saw how the BJP indulged in buying MLAs across the country. This is not good for the country’s politics. To have such a party in power in Gujarat and the Centre poses a challenge not just to other political parties but to democracy itself,” the Congress’ general secretary in charge of Gujarat told mediapersons on Thursday.
“What the BJP is doing is harmful to politics and democracy. The BJP’s tactics of pressuring and buying legislators is damaging our democracy. Congress is devoted to ideology and we will continue to fight on that basis. The BJP’s claim of winning all 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat shows its arrogance,” he added. He further said the party will talk to disgruntled leaders and find a way to ensure they don’t leave.
Wasnik is in Ahmedabad to attend a meeting of the Gujarat Pradesh Election Committee for discussions on probable Lok Sabha candidates. The meeting was attended by state unit chief Shatkisinh Gohil and screening committee chairperson Rajani Patil, among others.

The Dediapada MLA has been in judicial custody since December 18 after he was arrested on December 14. The AAP leader had evaded arrest for more than a month before he finally surrendered in the presence of supporters.
The court, however, has prohibited Chaitar — who has been declared the AAP’s Lok Sabha candidate from Bharuch– from entering the Narmada district until the end of the trial– Chaitar’s assembly constituency of Dediapada in Narmada district is a part of Bharuch Lok Sabha seat. The MLA will have to reside at an alternate residence “outside Narmada and Bharuch”, the court underlined. Chaitar will leave the Rajpipla sub-jail on Tuesday, “if he is not needed in any other case”, the court has said.
The 12-page bail order of the Narmada Sessions Judge NR Joshi has 13 bail conditions, including the MLA’s consent to the “trial proceeding in his absence” at the Narmada court.
He has also been asked to furnish a bond of Rs 1 lakh as well as two guarantors to present a surety of Rs 1 lakh each. “Merely at the time of framing charges or during special depositions, wherever the presence of the petitioner (Chaitar) is required in court, he may remain present. Otherwise, the petitioner has to remain present only through his advocate and furnish an undertaking that he has no objection to the trial proceeding in his absence. Whenever the trial court asks him to be present, he has to comply,” the order states.
The court has also directed Chaitar to present himself before the Dediapada police station, where the FIR was lodged on November 2, through WhatsApp or any other virtual medium as his “physical attendance” is not mandatory. “Until the chargesheet is filed in the case, the petitioner (Chaitar) must appear before the police station concerned between 10 am and 2 pm on the first day of every month, through WhatsApp or any other medium to fulfill the condition of the bail. However, it is not necessary to be present physically at the police station,” the order states.
The court has also asked the police to approach the court with a fresh petition in case Chaitar’s presence is essential.
The court has also barred Chaitar from leaving Gujarat till the completion of trial without prior permission. “Until the trial is complete, the petitioner can stay at any address other than in Narmada and Bharuch district and the details of the address and the phone number have to be provided. Until the completion of the trial, the petitioner may not leave the territory of Gujarat state without the permission of the investigating officer or the trial court,” the court said.
The court has also stated that Chaitar will not be able to “change his alternate address” without the prior permission of the trial court.
As per the bail conditions, Chaitar must also furnish an undertaking that he would not indulge in any criminal act in the future and also surrender his passport or file an affidavit to the effect in case he does not hold a valid passport. The bail conditions also specify that the bail would be null and void if the MLA fails to comply with the conditions. The court has also permitted Chaitar to move the court to expedite the trial against him.
The order came after the court heard the arguments of both the prosecutor as well as defence advocates SK Joshi, HJ Vasava and VS Patil. The court observed that it was “fit to release the accused on conditional bail” as the police had completed its investigation, all the accused were arrested, the police recovered the extortion money and also invoked the penal section for the destruction of evidence after not being able to find the weapon that Chaitar had allegedly used to fire rounds in the air to intimidate the forest officials.
A local court in Dediapada in Narmada district on December 18 had sent Chaitar to judicial custody at the end of the three days police remand in the case of extortion and assault of forest officials. Chaitar, who had evaded arrest for over a month and surrendered on December 14, moved a bail plea in the court on December 18, which was rejected.
As per the FIR lodged at Dediapada police station, Chaitar and his family allegedly abused five forest officials and assaulted one of them on October 30, where he also allegedly fired a round in the air to intimidate the forest officer. The FIR, based on the complaint by the forest officer, has named seven other accused– Shakuntala, Jitendra, farmer Ramesh Vasava and his wife from Jhadoli village and three villagers from Bogaj village including two daughters and a son-in-law of a man named Dungarji Vasava as well as two other unidentified men.
The AAP had slammed the BJP over the case against Chaitar, terming it as politically motivated."

The roadmap, said Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra, underlined that the will identify opportunities in co-design, co-development and co-production in the defence industrial sector and it will cover a range of domains: air and space technology, maritime tech, underwater domain awareness, land warfare, robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and cyber defence.
Defence and security has been one of the key pillars of the strategic partnership between India and France established on Jan 26, 1998. This year’s Republic Day celebrations also cap the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Indo-French strategic partnership forged during then French President Jacques Chirac’s visit, also as Chief Guest for the Republic Day celebrations.
“The whole idea… building the defence supply chains between two countries so that they can not only fulfil the defence needs in India but also can be a useful contributor for the security partnership with other countries,” said Kwatra. “The focus of conversation is on defence production.”
He added that the two sides also agreed on a roadmap on space and a pact between Tata and Airbus on making H-125 single-engine helicopters.
Both also agreed on cooperation in healthcare, which would include education, training and research, and the use of AI in healthcare.
The year, 2026, was declared as the year of India-France innovation with the two sides announcing a Young Professionals scheme for people between 18 to 35 years of age.
Kwatra said an MoU was sealed between New Space India Ltd and France’s Arianespace for cooperation in satellite launches.
He said that cooperation in space will involve space situational awareness, collision avoidance, earth monitoring, communications and broadcasting, and satellite launching services.
Modi and Macron also discussed the conflict in Gaza and its various dimensions including that terrorism and humanitarian aid, Kwatra said.
The two leaders also exchanged perspectives on the evolving security situation in the Red Sea including potential disruptions, he said.
Macron began his two-day trip to India with a visit to Jaipur Thursday, where he visited the Amer Fort, Jantar Mantar and Hawa Mahal. Modi accompanied Macron during the roadshow between Jantar Mantar and Hawa Mahal.
The French president is the sixth French leader to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations at Kartavya Path Friday, the most by any country, a testament to the breadth and depth of bilateral ties that encompass key strategic areas.
Launched on January 26, 1998, this strategic partnership was the first-ever for India with a country in the West and a first for France outside EU.
“The partnership draws strength, trust and consistency from a shared sense of strategic autonomy and sovereignty, a quest for the multi-polar world, and a natural affinity for democratic values and rule of law,” an official said.
The partnership now includes a strong Indo-Pacific component. “The salience of the partnership is growing in the changing world, complex geo-political environment and in pursuit of respective national ambitions,” the official said.
Macron also attended the At Home reception hosted by President Droupadi Murmu and will be hosted for a state banquet at Rashtrapati Bhawan, officials said."

“They have totally blocked the entire road… They are shouting slogans, at times some that are very communally provocative, but police have been mute spectators,” Nagaon MP Prodyut Bordoloi told The Indian Express.
“I spoke to the District Collector and the Superintendent of Police, and they gave me assurances. But in terms of action, I have not seen anything. They (the flag-wielding crowd) have totally blocked the road and are shouting communally provocative slogans. They are actually trying to create some problems.”
He said he had assured the local administration that Rahul Gandhi, who is leading the yatra, would not get down from the bus and that the yatra would pass through peacefully. “We have no intention of accosting them (the crowd),” he said.
The yatra is scheduled to pass through this area en route to Jorabat on the Assam-Meghalaya border.
On Sunday, a crowd wielding BJP flags gathered at a point in Sonitpur’s Jamugurihat through which the yatra was passing and allegedly attempted to attack vehicles travelling in the convoy. Assam Congress chief Bhupen Borah suffered injuries to his face while confronting the crowd, and other party leaders alleged that their car windows were rattled and stickers torn.

Upon his arrival in the city, the French President was greeted at the airport by External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar, Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma and Governor Kalraj Mishra.
He then visited some of the city’s iconic sites, including the historic Amber Fort, one of the six hill forts in Rajasthan recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On the way there, he was greeted by thousands of school children and local residents who had lined the sides of the road.
At Amber, Macron, who was accompanied by Jaishankar and deputy CM Diya Kumari, was welcomed with a red carpet, decorated elephants, and Kachhi Ghodi folk dancers. While there, he interacted with students, including some who spoke French, as well as local artists.
After spending about two hours at Amber, Macron then left for Jaipur’s Jantar Mantar, where PM Modi greeted him with a hug. Modi had arrived in Jaipur from Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr about two hours after Macron landed in the city. At Jantar Mantar, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the two leaders were given a tour of the astronomical observatory established by 18th-century ruler Sawai Jai Singh.
Taking to X, Modi said in a post that Jantar Mantar “stands as a testament to India’s rich heritage in astronomy. It also symbolises the blend of ancient wisdom and modern science, a shared value that both India and France appreciate.”
From there, Macron and Modi took out a roadshow that passed through some parts of the old walled city, where they were welcomed by people in large numbers. The walled city was specially decorated for the occasion, and also had massive cutouts and hoardings of the two leaders. Many onlookers held banners saying “Bienvenue” – French for welcome. The two also clicked a selfie during the roadshow.
Modi and Macron also stopped by Hawa Mahal and visited some shops in the old city. Modi bought a replica of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya as a gift for Macron, and paid for it through UPI. In visuals from the shop, Modi could be seen explaining the BHIM UPI payment app to Macron.
They also stopped to have tea in earthen cups at the famous Sahu tea stall. In a video, Macron can be heard talking about the distinctiveness of the earthen cup, and Modi responding that it was “most environment friendly”, and that it also gave a “special taste of earth”. Here, too, the PM paid for the tea through UPI.
The road show continued until Sanganeri Gate. After that, the two had dinner at Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, before leaving for New Delhi."

Gayatri, a student at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, wells up as she remembers her father, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Shambhu Dayal, who died on duty last year.
On January 26, he will be posthumously awarded the President’s medal for gallantry.
Narrating the difficulties her family faced after Dayal’s death, Gayatri said, “My sister couldn’t clear her police exams due to the stress and my younger brother, Deepak, was suddenly inducted into the police. We are still scared that he might be unsafe. I am very thankful to the department but I miss papa every day.”
On January 4 last year, Dayal was taking a snatching case accused to the police station when the man stabbed him 13 times. The incident was captured on CCTV camera. Dayal’s family said he was brutally injured and couldn’t survive the attack.
“Papa was going to be a sub-inspector. His name had come in the list. We were all very excited. My younger sister had also cleared her pre-exam. However, his death changed everything. He was the sole breadwinner. Now, we are all trying to help the family. The government has been kind to compensate us and give my brother the same post my father got,” said Gayatri.
While Gayatri is pursuing a nursing course, Deepak is busy with training at the Delhi Police training center. Their sister is also preparing for certain entrance exams.
The family, which hails from Rajasthan, said Dayal was a progressive man who wanted all his kids to do well in life.  “We would hear his tales of bravery and policing and get excited. He was a caring father. He wanted me to join the medical field,” said Gayatri. Deepak, now a sub-inspector, said he is “proud” of his father and “works day and night” to prove himself.

According to Inspector Gayatri Rajput, Mukesh Makwana, was suspended on Tuesday and “has been absconding for the past couple of days”. When asked if murder charges will be added following the death of the Dalit man, Harshil Jadav, Rajput said, “We will see. The FIR was lodged yesterday when he was alive and preliminary investigation is ongoing.”
The FIR has charged Makwana under Indian Penal Code sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 331 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to extort confession).
According to Harshil’s elder brother Brijesh Jadav, the former had gone to the Bodakdev police station in Ahmedabad on January 9 to file a complaint when he was informed that he was an accused in a Junagadh FIR registered on charges of cheating (IPC section 420) and criminal breach of trust (section 406) in relation to a tour package.
Rajput, however, said the Junagadh police had received the complaint against Harshil nearly four months before and summoned him multiple times but he had remained untraceable. The Junagadh police took Harshil into custody on the same night from the Bodakdev police station.
‘Police sub-inspector asked for Rs 3 lakh bribe’
Harshil was presented before a Junagadh magistrate court on the evening of January 10 and remanded in police custody until January 12. It is alleged that Makwana later called Harshil’s relatives to his office and demanded a bribe of Rs 5 lakh in exchange for “making it an easy case and not even hitting” him. He then allegedly brought the figure down to Rs 3 lakh.
As per Brijesh’s complaint, the family members refused to pay the bribe saying “the amount is beyond their means” and left the police station. On January 11, the FIR records, the police did not allow Harshil’s family members to meet him. They later received around three calls from Harshil from an unknown number, where he pleaded that they “pay the police what they are demanding, or else I’ll be in trouble”.
On January 12, when he was to be presented before the magistrate court again, Harshil was brought in an autorickshaw. His head was bandaged and he had difficulty in walking, according to the FIR.
As Harshil submitted before the court that he was assaulted by Makwana with sticks, the magistrate recorded a complaint to this effect. He was then taken to jail first and later to the Junagadh Civil Hospital, from where he was discharged and later released on bail on January 15.
As he returned to Ahmedabad along with his family members, Harshil complained of pain on both his legs. He was taken to the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital on January 16, where he was diagnosed with ligament tears on both his legs.
On January 21, while on his way to a lawyer’s office, Harshil collapsed and he was further diagnosed to have a ligament tear on one leg and a fracture on the other. A day later he was admitted to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, where he died on Wednesday morning.
Harshil is survived by his wife, a 14-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter."

The resolution, read out by Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on behalf of the Cabinet, called the Wednesday meeting “historic… Cabinet of the Millennium” and said Modi had “fulfilled a centuries-old dream”, one that “Indian civilisation had dreamt for five centuries”.
“The love you have received from the people has established you as a Jan Nayak. But, after the ushering in of the new era, you have also emerged as the pioneer of the new era,” it stated.
Later, while briefing reporters on the decisions taken at the Cabinet meeting, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said, “At the beginning of the Union Cabinet meeting, on behalf of the Cabinet, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister for the successful Pran Pratishtha ceremony.”
The resolution stated that while several historic works have been done since the Cabinet system came into being in India, and during the British-era period of the Executive Council of the Viceroy, such an occasion never occurred and the work accomplished by Prime Minister Modi on January 22, 2024 is unparalleled in history.
“As a mass movement, there was unity among the people even during the Emergency, but that unity was against dictatorship, as a movement of resistance. But the mass movement for Lord Ram that we are witnessing signals the heralding of a new era,” it said.
“The Ram Janmabhoomi movement was the only movement in independent India that brought everyone together. Crores of Indians were emotionally attached to this movement and waited for this moment,” it stated.
Hailing his 11-day anushthan for the consecration ceremony and the trips he had undertaken to visit pilgrim sites associated with Lord Ram, the Cabinet said this had “provided energy to national unity” and “we felicitate you for this not just as members of the Cabinet but also in our capacity as normal citizens”.
“The people of this country have waited for this moment for centuries, and now a new era has been heralded with the construction of the grand Ram temple,” it stated.
“Today, it has become a narrative-setting people’s movement. This kind of anushthan can only be done at the hands of someone blessed by God,” it stated.
The resolution recalled Modi’s remarks at the consecration ceremony where he said “thousands of years later, people will remember this date (January 22, 2024)… It’s a blessing that all of us are living this moment and witnessing it” and said “it won’t be an exaggeration to call today’s Cabinet as the Cabinet of the Millenium.
Meanwhile, amid the heavy rush of devotees in Ayodhya for a darshan of the idol at the new Ram temple, Modi is learnt to have advised his ministers to defer their visits to the temple. Sources said Modi expressed concern over the inconvenience caused to the public by VIP visits to the temple.
Responding to a question on whether the entire Cabinet will visit the Ram temple, Thakur said that as of now, no member is going there. “There is no proposal by the Cabinet that the Cabinet ministers will go there,” he said.
On a personal note, Thakur said, he would suggest that people visit Ayodhya keeping in mind the decisions taken and advisories issued by the Uttar Pradesh government due to the high footfall."

According to senior officials, the charred body of an unidentified man was recovered in the morning, with no other injuries reported in the fire.
Ravindra Ambulgekar, Chief Fire Officer, Mumbai Fire Brigade told The Indian Express, “The flames were extinguished in the morning and the cooling operations are ongoing. The fire broke out and spread to nearly 400 to 500 shops inside the wood market. Therefore, the fire spread instantly”.
Speaking to The Indian Express, senior officials from the ward’s fire office said that the fire broke out at the timber market situated near a popular eatery at Grant Road. “The fire erupted in one of the shops inside the old wood market in the locality. The blaze then spread to the other shops located in the vicinity, most of which were wooden godowns,”
The civic body is yet to determine the cause of the blaze.
CFO Ambulgekar said, “We are still investigating the cause of the fire. The cause of the fire will be known once we prepare our detailed report.”
Meanwhile, responding to questions, an official from the BMC’s Disaster Management office said, “The people inside the nearby high-rise had vacated the building themselves in time ensuring that no one was trapped”.
The fire, which broke out at one of the shops at the old wood market in Grant Road, was reported at 2.07 am on January 26 and was declared level IV at 3.03 am. According to the preliminary report of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the fire had spread to nearly 400 to 500 shops in the locality.

Also confined to about 400 to 500 shops/hotels nearby,” a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) report said earlier in the day.
Senior officials said the body of the man was taken to the civic J J hospital.
To aid the rescue operations, the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) had pressed 18 lines of 16 fire engines, including six hose lines from the north side, three hose lines from the west side, three from the south side, five from the eastside and one line of the building’s internal fire fighting system. Two lines from the high-rise buildings were also deployed to put out the fire."
11JPO8RSZF_X4IJBGH0A9ZGADT,‘Incestuous relationship may gain legitimacy’: Delhi High Court upholds prohibition on ‘sapinda marriages’ under Hindu Marriage Act,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 12:28 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-high-court-upholds-prohibition-on-sapinda-marriages-under-hindu-marriage-act-9126311/,"The Delhi High Court has recently upheld the validity of Section 5(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), which prohibits marriages between “sapindas”, which are parties related to each other through ancestors from their parents’ side unless their custom or usage governing each of them allows them to do so.
A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora, in its January 22 order, observed, “If the choice of a partner in a marriage is left unregulated, incestuous relationship may gain legitimacy.”
The high court said there was no merit in the challenge to Section 5(v) (conditions for a Hindu marriage) of the Hindu Marriage Act as raised in the plea filed by a woman. The woman had sought to strike down the provision. She was also aggrieved by a trial court’s order declaring that the marriage between her and her distant cousin was solemnised in contravention of the provision of the Act and was held null and void.
She had moved an appeal against the trial court’s order before the high court which had been dismissed. She then moved a plea in the high court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 5(v) Hindu Marriage Act, which bans ‘sapinda’ marriages.
The bench further said that it was unable to accept the woman’s contention that Section 5(v) HMA is violative of Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution as the exception in the section is only for marriages between people on the basis of custom having force of law, which requires stringent proof and its existence is to be adjudicated upon by court of law.
The bench said that the woman had been unable to prove the “existence of custom in the facts of her case and has relied upon consent of parents” which cannot take the place of custom.
The bench also said that no tenable grounds in law for challenging the provision were placed before the court and added that the petitioner had failed to plead any “legal grounds” for challenging the restriction imposed by the provision.
“The impugned sub-section enacts that no marriage can be solemnised between parties who are related to each other as sapindas, unless such marriage is sanctioned by usage or custom governing the parties. The custom which permits marriage between persons who are sapindas of each other must fulfil the requirements of proof of a valid and existing custom as envisaged in impugned Section and under Section 3 (a) of the HMA Act, which defines the expressions ‘custom’ and ‘usage’,” the high court said.
However, the bench added that the woman can initiate legal proceedings against her former husband before an appropriate forum as per law."

DeSantis, who came in second in the Iowa caucuses with 21 per cent, suspended his campaign on Sunday. He said that it was clear to him that a majority of Republican primary voters wanted to give Trump another chance. “I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,” the 45-year-old politician said in a video message posted on X, a social media platform.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”

Haley, 51, the former US ambassador to the UN, is the only Republican left in the Republican nomination race against Trump, who is seeking to enter the White House for a second term. The 77-year-old former president, a White House occupant from January 2017 to January 2021, lost to incumbent Joe Biden in the 2020 elections.
Trump, so far the most popular Republican presidential candidate with a majority of the party members supporting him, as per all major polls, won the Iowa Caucus last week and is leading in the New Hampshire primaries, which is scheduled for Tuesday.
DeSantis said: “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear. A repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.” “Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on our way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favourable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,” he added.
On Sunday, Trump congratulated DeSantis at his New Hampshire rally for running a “good” campaign.
“Before we begin, I’d like to take time to congratulate Ron DeSantis and, of course, a really terrific person who I’ve gotten to know, his wife Casey, for having run a great campaign for president. He really did. He ran a really good campaign, I will tell you. It’s not easy,” he said “They think it’s easy doing this stuff, right? It’s not easy. As you know, he left the campaign trail today at 3 p.m., and in so doing, he was very gracious, and he endorsed me, so I appreciate it. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron to defeat crooked Joe Biden. We have to get him out,” the Politico newspaper reported.
With the withdrawal by DeSantis, who once was seen as a formidable challenge to Trump, it’s now a race of two in the party between Trump and Haley.
Political pundits now say that the former president is set to be the Republican party’s nominee and that the November 2024 presidential elections will be a repeat of the 2020 elections: Trump vs Biden.
The Trump campaign also welcomed DeSantis’ dropout. “With only a few days left until president Donald J Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honoured by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates. It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind president Trump to defeat crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency,” it said.
The Trump campaign also criticised Haley. “Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement. From higher taxes to decimating Social Security and Medicare, and to open borders, she represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans,” the campaign said.
A memo issued by the Trump Campaign also said that Haley needed to drop out of the race to save herself from humiliation. “Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the Primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire – there are only two options,” the memo said, adding that the Indian-American politician should either drop out and unite behind Trump or get “demolished and embarrassed” in her home state of South Carolina.
However, Haley, the former South Carolina governor, insisted that she would stay in the race. “I want to say to Ron: he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor. And we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fellow and one lady left,” she said at a campaign event in New Hampshire.
In a statement, she said that only one state had voted so far, and half of its votes went to Trump while the other half did not. “We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again or we go down a new conservative road. New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision,” Haley said.
Democratic National Committee’s national press secretary Sarafina Chitika said that DeSantis pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA (Make American Great Again) agenda that both Trump and Haley are still running on. Now, he is the latest member of the Republican party to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.
Make America Great Again, or MAGA is an American political slogan and movement popularised by Trump during his successful 2016 presidential campaign and used to refer to his political base."

The state has asked school management committees to take required steps for the new arrangement.
The decision has drawn flak from across the education sector with educationists calling it an “unnecessary classification”.
In November last year, Maharashtra’s school education department announced adding additional items with midday meals — bananas (or any local fruit) for vegetarians and eggs for non-vegetarians – to enhance nutrition value. A circular was issued on Wednesday for the plan’s effective implementation, wherein the government suggested red and green dots on students’ identity cards, among other things.
“Under this novel initiative of facilities to children at the school level, if a parent has consented for its ward to eat egg, there should be a clearly visible red dot on the identity card of that particular student. If a student is vegetarian or his/her parents has not given consent for the consumption of eggs, there should be a green dot on the child’s identity card. This will ensure convenient distribution of eggs or bananas in schools,” stated the circular which told respective school management committees to begin taking steps for the new arrangement.
Raising concerns, senior educationist, Vasant Kalpande, said, “Implementing this scheme could have been possible without marking each individual student’s identity card. Considering the variety of cultural backgrounds in our society, there will be students who may have consented to eating eggs but do not eat non-vegetarian food on certain days. In that case, will those students have to eat eggs now because their identity cards show a red dot?”
According to teachers, this information could have been made available by maintaining a record in the school’s register to serve midday meals. “The children do not have to be classified on this,” said a teacher from a zilla parishad school in Maharashtra adding that in most cases, teachers already know this information and that the children too were capable of communicating their choices.
Another teacher also raised the consequences of this classification, “Are we creating new groups among young children?” he asked.
Spokesperson for Maharashtra School Principals Association, Mahendra Ganapule, said, “In order to make adequate and effective arrangements, there are ways to make such information available in the school’s register. There is no need for children to wear it on their identity cards.”
Among other points clarified in the latest circular on the additional items in midday meals, eggs will not be served in schools where 40 per cent of students have asked for bananas. Many teachers have slammed this, raising question over 40 per cent being considered the majority. Educationist Kishor Darak, said, “This is an absurd definition of majority. The circular forces all children to have bananas if 40 per cent vote for it. But it doesn’t given any choice to schools receiving midday meals from organisations known to spread vegetarianism through meals that don’t have onions and garlic.”
The state had also identified the ISKCON-run Annamrut Foundation and Akshayapatra organisation to serve bananas in schools located in urban areas where these centralised kitchens already provide midday meals. In semi-urban and rural areas, women self help groups will provide the additional items with meals."

Singh later described the two tableaux as a “rare double treat”.
Since earlier this month, searching any poll-related keyword on Google leads to an information panel from the Election Commission before the other links appear on screen.

“The Congress is fully capable and self-sufficient to win in Haryana. So far, there are no talks with the AAP. However, for a party to stake claim or demand seats, it should have a base. The AAP and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), which fought the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in alliance, could barely get 50,000 votes in three seats. In the 2022 Adampur Assembly bypoll, the AAP got just 3,400 votes. When a party has no base, on what grounds can they demand seats?” Hooda told The Indian Express.
Hooda’s comments came a day after West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and the Punjab unit of the AAP ruled out an alliance with the Congress in the two states. Both the AAP and Congress are a part of the INDIA bloc.
Sources said the AAP has been demanding 5 of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana as part of the INDIA alliance. These include the 3 Haryana seats which share a border with Punjab, where the AAP won the last Assembly elections with 92 seats in a House of 113 members.
The Congress hands are also tied as it might need to part with some Lok Sabha seats for the Left parties, which are INDIA partners as well.
The AAP had debuted in the Haryana Assembly elections in 2019, contesting 46 of the 90 seats and polled 0.48% votes – lesser than NOTA’s share, which stood at 0.53%. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the AAP-JJP combine had secured a vote share of 4.9% while the Congress despite drawing a blank had a vote share of over 28%. The BJP had swept the state with a 58% vote share.
The Arvind Kejriwal-led outfit has also been plagued with high-profile exits in the recent past. Last week, the party’s prominent Dalit face, Ashok Tanwar, jumped ship and joined the BJP. In December, two prominent faces – Nirmal Singh and his daughter Chitra Sarwara – had quit and rejoined the Congress. Insiders say the party had been banking heavily on the trio for the Lok Sabha polls. While Tanwar was a former Haryana Congress chief, Singh was a four-time MLA. Both Singh and Sarwara had joined the AAP after the Congress denied them tickets ahead of the 2019 Assembly polls.
Asked about Hooda’s remarks, AAP Haryana president Sushil Gupta said it was for the high command to decide when to hold seat-sharing talks. “The party asked me and in the capacity of being state chief, I told them that the party should get five seats – three on the Punjab border (Ambala, Kurukshetra and Sirsa) and two on the Delhi border (Gurgaon and Faridabad) – as we have our governments there,” he said.
Gupta also refuted Hooda’s claims that the AAP has no base in Haryana. “We are not the party we were in 2019. Today, AAP has over 1.6 lakh office-bearers in the state and 21-member committees in every village and municipal ward of Haryana. We are continuously campaigning. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Bhagwant Mann will also focus more on the state. They will hold a massive rally in Jind on January 28,” he said."

“I was getting lost in the technicalities of the step. But when I saw her, I felt it was looking effortless. I thought I am going to change the step a little and do it the way she does it. That enhanced my dance as well.”
Deepika said it was too big a compliment coming from Hrithik, who is known for his dancing. “I find this very hard to believe because I never trust anything he says. But he did mention this to me! An actor and dancer of his caliber saying this… I just don’t take it seriously!”
Hrithik said collaborating with Deepika for Fighter was seamless experience as both the stars were on sets as performers, who worked to bring out the best in each other for the film.
“With Deepika, that became really, really easy because she brings a lot of realism in her work. So I was just constantly bouncing off of that. Each line she says comes from a deep place and I could tell that this was real. If I don’t maintain that, it might look that I am overdoing things so I had to ensure that I am on that frequency. Thanks to her, all the scenes of Minni and Patty look extremely vulnerable, endearing, and very real,” he added.
Also starring Anil Kapoor, Fighter is set to release on January 25. It is the third film of Siddharth Anand with Hrithik Roshan after Bang Bang and War.

Whereas, 46.2 per cent are enrolled in Arts or Humanities, followed closely by Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses with 44.2 per cent. This was revealed as the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2023 was declared last week.
The ASER 2023, focused on children from the ages of 14-18 years and surveyed one rural district per state. Apart from determining academic achievements of the targeted age group, the survey also gauged career aspirations along with higher education choices. Nanded district was identified as it was the closest to the state’s average in the previous ASER survey and thus was used as an indicator for the whole of Maharashtra.
Even as enrollment in STEM courses was among the highest, boys were found to be more inclined toward engineering as opposed to girls who showed interest in pursuing medicine. While 11.8 per cent of boys expressed an aspiration to become engineers, 7.7 per cent for girls aspired towards this. Among girls, 15.9 per cent of them expressed they aspired to become doctors, while 7.2 per cent of boys aspired towards this. A total of 6.6 per cent girls aspired to become nurses, which was only 0.6 per cent among boys.
A considerable proportion of the respondents showed they aspired to join the police force, with 28.1 per cent of boys and 20.9 per cent girls wishing to become police officials. Only 2.3 per cent of boys and 4.1 percent of girls aspired to become IPS officers, showing more of an inclination towards joining police forces at lower ranks. A significant proportion of boys – 10.1 per cent – aspired to join the Army. This was marginal among girls at 2.3 per cent.
While a very small of the respondents showed an aspiration towards professions like teachers, civil services, entrepreneurship and sports; a significant portion of boys (12.9 per cent) and girls (15.5 per cent) shared that they did not know what they wanted to do."
1SU349HL5V_MTTNL3YV2D9ATP0,"What are incestuous ‘sapinda’ marriages, and why has Delhi High Court reaffirmed the ban on them?",Ajoy Sinha Karpuram,"Updated: January 29, 2024 22:13 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/incestuous-sapinda-marriages-9129281/,"Delhi High Court this week rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of Section 5(v) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (HMA), which prohibits marriage between two Hindus if they are “sapindas” of each other — “unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two”.
In its order passed on January 22 on a petition filed by a woman who had been trying for long to have this section struck down, the court said that “If the choice of a partner in a marriage is left unregulated, incestuous relationship may gain legitimacy.”
A sapinda marriage is one between individuals who are related to each other within a certain degree of closeness. Sapinda relationships for the purposes of the HMA are defined in Section 3 of the Act.
“Two persons are said to be sapindas of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them,” Section 3(f)(ii) says.
Under the provisions of the HMA, on the mother’s side, a Hindu individual cannot marry anyone who is within three generations of them in the “line of ascent”. On the father’s side, this prohibition applies to anyone within five generations of the individual.
In practice, this means that on their mother’s side, an individual cannot marry their sibling (first generation), their parents (second generation), their grandparents (third generation), or an individual who shares this ancestry within three generations.
On their father’s side, this prohibition would extend up to their grandparents’ grandparent, and anyone who shares this ancestry within five generations.
If a marriage is found to violate Section 5(v) for being a sapinda marriage, and there is no established custom that allows such a practice, it will be declared void.
This would mean that the marriage was invalid from the very beginning, and will be treated as though it never took place.
Yes — the sole exception can be found within the same provision. As noted above, it arises when the customs of each individual permits sapinda marriages.
The definition of the word “custom” is provided in Section 3(a) of the HMA. It states that a custom has to be “continuously and uniformly observed for a long time”, and should have gained enough legitimacy among Hindus in a local area, tribe, group, or family, such that it has obtained “the force of law”.
A custom may not be protected even after these conditions are fulfilled. The rule in question must be “certain and not unreasonable or opposed to public policy” and, “in the case of a rule [that is] applicable only to a family”, it should not have been “discontinued by the family”.
In 2007, the woman’s marriage was declared void after her husband successfully proved that they had entered into a sapinda marriage, and that the woman was not from a community where such marriages could be considered a custom. This ruling was challenged before the Delhi HC, which dismissed the appeal in October 2023.
The woman then approached the HC again, challenging the constitutional validity of the prohibition on sapinda marriages. She argued that sapinda marriages are prevalent even when there is no proof of custom. Hence, Section 5(v) which prohibits sapinda marriages unless there is an established custom, violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution.
The petitioner also argued that the marriage had received the consent of both families, which proved the legitimacy of the marriage.
The Delhi High Court found no merit in her arguments.
A Bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora held that the petitioner did not provide “stringent proof” of an established custom, which is necessary to justify a sapinda marriage.
The Delhi HC also held that the choice of a partner in a marriage can be subject to regulation. With this in mind, the court held that the woman did not present any “cogent legal ground” to show that the prohibition against sapinda marriages was violative of the right to equality.
In several European countries, the laws on relationships that are considered incestuous are less stringent than in India.
In France, the crime of incest was abolished under the Penal Code of 1810, so long as the marriage was between consenting adults.
This Code was enacted under Napoleon Bonaparte, and was also enforced in Belgium. A new Penal Code was introduced in Belgium in 1867 to replace the French code, but incest remains legal.
Portuguese law also does not criminalise incest.
The Republic of Ireland recognised same-sex marriages in 2015, but the law on incest has not been updated to include individuals in same-sex relationships.
Under Italian law, incest is a crime only if it causes a “public scandal”.
In the United States, incestuous marriages are banned in all 50 states, though incestuous relationships between consenting adults are allowed in New Jersey and Rhode Island."

After 36 years of hard work and planting more than 28 lakh trees, she has been selected for this year’s Padma Shri from Jharkhand, the Central government announced on Thursday.
“I feel extremely honoured to be getting the award. It gives me an impetus to keep doing what I started in 1988,” she told The Indian Express from her village Bhursa, where she was born, in Rajajinagar block of Saraikela Kharsawan.
Among the trees that she has planted are Eucalyptus, Sal, Acacia, which are good sources of firewood, and Neem, Sheesham trees, which are used for making furniture.
Chami, a class 10 passout, faced tragedy at an early age when she lost her father and elder brother. She became the sole guardian of her three siblings and an ailing mother.
Her journey as an environmental activist began in 1988 when she attended a meeting, held in a village 80 km away from her home, on job opportunities. She, along with 23 other women from her village, left for the meeting with a hope to learn how a woman can make things work for her family and uplift its economic condition. She said she returned home brimming with ideas.
Chami realised that many villagers did not have coal as a cooking fuel option and were cutting trees for the purpose. “I could see vast tracts of barren land in my area and started planting trees. The male members of my village did not approve of a woman starting something like this. I had arguments at home and eventually, I moved to my brother’s house. There, I started working with my brother as a labourer in the fields, earning a livelihood and at the same time working for nature,” said Chami.
Gradually, she formed a network of women and set up her organisation — ‘Sahayogi Mahila’ — with 11 members. She tied up with the state government’s social forestry scheme and eventually started a nursery.
After planting over 1 lakh saplings, she received a major setback in 1996. “The men in the village destroyed my entire 1 lakh plants. I was shocked. I lodged a complaint with the police and the culprits were arrested. The incident did not deter us and we started working again with the same vigour,” she said.
The government recognised her efforts in 2000 and she received ‘Indira Priyadarshini Vrikshamitra Puraskar’ in Delhi. She said she did not face any trouble in her work after that.
“Now that I have planted 28 lakh trees and more, sometimes I feel lonely because I never started my own family and never got married. But all this was for a bigger cause,” said Chami.
She also diversified her work. Saraikela Kharawan is one of the most backward districts of Jharkhand where farmers depend on rain for agriculture. Chami has been working to build watersheds, such as rainwater harvesting tanks, for irrigation purposes.
She has been instrumental in forming 2,800 Self Help Groups, securing bank loans and credits for 30,000 women members to start their own businesses. She received Nari Shakti Award from the Women and Child Development Ministry in 2019."

Speaking to PTI, he also said that now everyone should listen to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s advice to shun habit of fighting on small disputes.
Ansari said he attended the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla on Monday and his experience was good.
“When my father (Hashim Ansari) was alive, he kept telling everyone that the Congress got the statue placed inside the Babri Masjid, the party got the mosque demolished, and it laid the foundation stone of the temple,” he alleged. “In the BJP rule, only the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya took place…nothing else has happened. The BJP has ended the Ram Mandir issue,” he said.
On the issue of Kashi and Mathura being taken up now, Ansari said, “All this will keep happening due to politics in the country. What did the Congress do? Whatever is happening today, the Congress also kept doing the same (during its rule).” Praising the speech of RSS chief Bhagwat at the consecration ceremony, he said, “Bhagwat ji was saying the right things. Whatever he was saying should happen.
In his speech, Bhagwat had urged people to end ‘kalah’ (dispute) and shun habit of fighting on small disputes. The RSS chief said Ram Lalla has returned home after 500 years because of the penance of a lot of people and he salutes their hardwork and sacrifices.
“But why did he (Ram) leave? He left because there were disputes (kalah) in Ayodhya. Ram Rajya is coming and we have to shun all disputes and stop fighting among ourselves over petty issues. We will have to shun ego and stay united,” he had said.
Ansari said the Muslims of the country want peace.
“This community is not very educated. It does not want a government job. It does its own small business. When there is no riot, they will live peacefully,” he added “Ram has not come to Ayodhya yesterday, he has been there since December 1949,” he said, referring to the appearance of a Ram Lalla idol in the Babri Masjid on December 22, 1949. On Monday, the consecration of the new Ram Lalla idol was performed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya."

He and his supporters would enter Mumbai on Saturday for their planned protest at Azad Maidan ground if their demands were not met by tonight, he warned.
Addressing a rally at Shivaji Chowk in Vashi area of neighbouring Navi Mumbai where he arrived in the morning with thousands of his supporters, Jarange said he will stay put in Navi Mumbai for the day.
“I am taking a step backward,” the 40-year-old activist said, adding that he had stopped having food from Friday and was taking only water.
“If an ordinance (to meet his various demands) is not promulgated tonight, I will come to Mumbai tomorrow,” he said.
“I will take decision on going to Azad Maidan (in Mumbai) tomorrow at noon. Once I set out, there will be no turning back,” the activist warned.
The free education policy should be amended so that boys also get free education besides girls, and all Marathas should get free education “from KG to PG” (kindergarten to post-graduation) until the entire community gets reservation, he said.
He has sought data of the 37 lakh Kunbi certificates issued by the state government, Jarange further said. Kunbi, an agrarian community, falls in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, and Jarange has been demanding Kunbi certificates for all Marathas.
“The government has told me that 54 lakh Kunbi records (records showing that a Maratha person/family belongs to Kunbi community) have been found, of which 37 lakh certificates have been given. Who are these people? We need data,” he said.
“More than two crore Marathas will get OBC certificates after Kunbi records are found,” Jarange said, adding that all Marathas should apply for the Kunbi certificate to avail of reservation. Once a person is established as belonging to the Kunbi caste, all his/her relatives should get reservation, he demanded.
Present government job recruitment should be carried out by keeping some seats reserved for the Marathas, he said. He has also demanded withdrawal of cases registered against Maratha activists during the quota protests, he said. The government has been trying to persuade Jarange not to proceed to Mumbai, sending delegations to hold talks with him. State education minister Deepak Kesarkar told reporters earlier in the day that Jarange’s demands had been accepted, and would be fulfilled as per government procedure.
Jarange and his supporters reached the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) on the outskirts of Mumbai around 5 am by bikes, cars, jeeps, tempos and trucks.
He had announced on Thursday that he would start his hunger strike at Azad Maidan from Friday, despite Mumbai Police denying him permission to hold a hunger strike in the city by issuing a notice under section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code that enables the police to prevent cognisable offences.
Police suggested that the protestors could gather at International Corporation Park Ground at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai."

The officials, who have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, were posted in the DGGI Gurugram office.
ACP Kavinagar Abhishek Srivastava said that the matter is being investigated and the statement of the plaintiff is yet to be recorded and legal action will be taken as per the evidence.
Complainant Arun Kumar Som, director of SKS Electricals, said that his company office in Ghaziabad, was raided by the GST team on July 5, 2022, under alleged allegations of violating GST rules. One of the directors was arrested without any warrant.
Som further alleged that the officials had asked for a bribe of Rs. 5 crore to ‘settle’ the matter and threatened to send him to jail in case of ‘non-payment’. He alleged that he paid Rs. 2.35 crore over the month ‘out of fear’, but the officers kept asking for more money saying that ‘the money will be distributed among the top officials’.
Som, 55, who is a resident of Bulandshahr road industrial area in Ghaziabad, then approached the police and submitted a complaint, but no FIR was registered. He filed an application in the Police Commissionerate office also, and due to no action, he approached the court under CrPC 156 (3), seeking registration of FIR against the GST officials.
Now, the Ghaziabad police has registered an FIR after the court order, under Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
According to the complaint, “During the raid, they took away all the company’s computers, hard disks etc. and arrested company director Prem Singh, who got bail after two months. I visited the DGGI’s Gurugram office several times, but they kept talking about fixing the money and threw away the company documents. When I showed my inability to give five crores, they said that you give one crore adding that ‘I am not taking this money alone, but it will be distributed among all the officers up to the top.’ Fearing threat, I spoke to my colleagues and arranged for Rs 50 lakh and went to Bengali Market in Delhi on 27.07.2022 to pay the money.”
“…But as soon as they received the money, they started calling again asking for Rs 4.5 crore more and also threatened to send me to jail. I was scared of going to jail and social disgrace, so I gave one crore rupees in front of DGGI Gurugram office on 4.08.2022 and Rs 75 lakh on 12.08.2022 at NSC Club, Pragati Maidan in Delhi,” the complainant further said.
In January 2023, Arun Kumar Som again recieved a call from another officer who mentioned that he is the new investigating officer in the case and allegedly demanded an additional Rs 50 lakh. “I somehow arranged for Rs 10 lakh and gave it to him, but he kept threatening that- you don’t know me, I will ruin your life. After this I filed a complaint with the police, but they did not take any action,” he added."

Police said the victim, Gangji Velgi, was aboard the Ala Hazrat Express when a boy tried snatching his bag and Gangji fell, his legs getting stuck under the train.
Delhi Police said they have apprehended a minor, aged around 16, in the case and are questioning him.
According to the police, the incident took place on January 17 (Wednesday) around 2-2.30 pm. Gangji told the police that he was on his way back from Gujarat’s Bhuj with his wife, son, and granddaughter. “We were travelling in the sleeper class. Around 2.30 pm, we found that the train had not stopped at Daya Basti signal. So, we went towards one of the gates. I was standing and waiting for our stop to come when a young boy came running towards me and snatched my bag. I tried to stop him and pulled my bag, but he was strong. I fell under the train. I was stuck… I started screaming for help. I don’t know what was happening. After some time, someone pulled the chain and stopped the train.”
Gangji’s family said that help came late, and his legs were completely crushed under the train by then.
His son Kamal told The Indian Express, “We were all waiting with our luggage and didn’t know the boy would come. This has never happened. My father was standing close to the gate and was pulled…almost dragged. He fell into the small gap. Nobody came to help us. We were screaming, crying, pulled the chain.”
He further said, “It took almost a dozen men to pull my father out. He was stuck deep inside, and the train had to be pulled back. I was shocked to see him. My relatives had also come in the meantime. We all rushed him to the hospital. Now, we don’t know what to do. He has lost both his legs. He can never walk again.”
According to the family, Gangji works as a manager at a warehouse company in Okhla. He lives with his two sons and their families in Delhi’s Shastri Nagar area. The family hails from Bhuj, Gujarat, where Gangji’s parents live.
Police said, “We had to call in technicians and pull him out within minutes. He was carried in a train box from the platform to outside the station. We registered a case under sections of voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery.”"
2BMRYAWNCP_Z4Z5US1XUAFSI0V,"In Karnataka, BJP sure of its Hindutva strongholds, not so much its sitting MPs",Johnson T A,"January 25, 2024 09:03 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/karnataka-bjp-hindutva-strongholdssitting-mps-9126665/,"With the Lok Sabha polls fast approaching, the BJP in Karnataka finds itself in a curious jam in its Hindutva stronghold constituencies in the coastal belt of the state.
Though the Modi wave — on a new high after the Ayodhya Ram Mandir consecration — is likely to catapult even an absolute novice fielded by the BJP from these seats of Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada and Udupi-Chikamagalur, the party is having second thoughts about fielding its sitting MPs.
The three Lok Sabha seats, out of the total 28 in the state, have always voted strongly for the BJP. In 2019, they registered nearly 75% polling, with the BJP’s three candidates winning by the three highest victory margins in the state.
Uttara Kannada
In 2019, the BJP’s Anantkumar Hegde, a five-time MP from the seat known for his controversial remarks, won Uttar Kannada by a resounding margin of 4.79 lakh votes – the highest in the state.
The ground has shifted however. One of the young stars in the BJP pantheon at the height of the Ram Mandir movement, who first became an MP at the age of 28 in 1996, the 55-year-old has not been active in politics for the past three years, reportedly due to an unconfirmed illness.
Besides, in last year’s state elections, the Congress came out strong in the parliamentary constituency, winning five of the eight Assembly segments.
However, that Hegde is keen to return to the centre stage is evident, given how he came swinging out ahead of the Ayodhya consecration, demanding that other mosques allegedly built on temples be razed, and accused Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of “selling his mentality for minority votes”. He was subsequently booked by the police for hate speech.
But at meetings of party workers in the area, Hegde’s absence on the ground has been noted and remarked upon. At a BJP meeting in Belagavi district, parts of which come under the Uttara Kannada seat, workers are believed to have asked him what he had done for them, or for development.
A source said: “Hegde may win on the Narendra Modi and Hindutva card, but he will face a stiff challenge due to the lack of development work in many parts of the region and his absence for a long period.”
This week, a BJP leader from the Khanapur region, Jayant Tinaikar, suggested openly that Hegde, a Brahmin, should nominate a replacement and step aside. (The party is unlikely to take the risk of not keeping Hegde in the loop if it goes in for a new face.)
A name doing the rounds is that of former Karnataka Speaker and ex-MLA Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, 62, a staunch RSS man, with sources saying he has already started work on the ground after getting the party nod.
Another strong contender is Sulibele Chakravarthy, 43, who has been on the periphery of BJP politics in Karnataka but has participated in campaigns for PM Narendra Modi through the Namo Brigade created ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Recently, Sulibele was in the news for attacking Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge as “useless”.
Congress spokesperson Ramesh Babu said Hegde and Sulibele’s remarks reflected their desperation for a ticket. “They are under the impression that if they abuse senior Congress leaders, they will be recognised by the BJP and they will be leaders.”
Dakshina Kannada
Former Karnataka BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, 57, has been the MP from this seat since it was created in 2008, and has been gradually expanding his victory margin – from 40,000 votes in 2009 to 1.43 lakh votes in 2014 to 2.74 lakh votes in 2019 (the third highest margin in the state that year).
In last year’s state polls as well, the BJP had demonstrated its hold in the area by winning six of the eight Assembly segments.
It is this long-term association of the region with the party and the Modi wave that are seen to have been behind Kateel’s impressive 2014 and 2019 wins, with the MP otherwise accused of mediocre performance and personal indiscretions.
Seen as a candidate of BJP national organisation secretary B L Santhosh (who is himself out of favour following last year’s Assembly poll loss), Kateel also came under a cloud following the July 26, 2022, murder of party youth leader Praveen Nettaru in Dakshina Kannada, with BJP faithful accusing him of having business transactions with those suspected of the killing.
The fact that Kateel has failed to cultivate a loyal support base, coasting on his RSS connections, may also go against him.
Besides, Kateel belongs to the dominant land-holding Bunt community while a majority of the BJP cadre in Dakshina Kannada, including the killed Nettaru, come from OBC groups like the Billavas.
Sources said that the top contenders now for the Dakshina Kannada seat are leaders from these groups, with one strong name being Arun Puthila, whose decision to contest against the BJP’s official candidate from Puttur in last year’s Assembly polls cost the party the seat.
Another contender is believed to be Union minister Shobha Karandlaje, who hails from the region. However, as per other sources, two other Union ministers who are currently Rajya Sabha MPs may get the Dakshina Kannada ticket – S Jaishankar or Nirmala Sitharaman (both, incidentally Brahmins).
Udupi Chikamagalur
The BJP had registered its second highest victory margin in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Udupi Chikamagalur, which straddles the coastal Udupi district and the hilly Chikamagalur district.
The winner was Shobha Karandlaje, who more than doubled her victory margin between 2014 and 2019, from 1.81 lakh votes to 3.49 lakh. However, the support to her in the seat has been waning, with the candidate she defeated in 2019, Pramod Madhwaraj, the son of former BJP MP Manorama Madhwaraj, now in the BJP and seen as a contender for Udupi Chikamagalur.
The 2023 state results had also seen a big slide for the BJP in the eight Assembly segments in this seat, with its tally dropping from seven in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls to four.
One other contender from this Lok Sabha seat is former BJP general secretary C T Ravi, who is seeking to reverse his fortunes after having lost the 2023 state polls.
“There is also concern in the BJP that the Congress may field its former MP Jayaprakash Hegde (a winner in 2012) who has a good standing in the region. The BJP may change its candidate as a result,” Congress sources said."

While interacting with the media, Vij said, “Five hundred years ago Babur insulted us by demolishing the Ram Janmabhoomi. Yesterday, we took revenge. The entire nation was enthusiastic and celebrated it as a ‘Victory Day’.”
Vij made these remarks while answering media’s queries after offering flowers at the statue of Subhash Chandra Bose on the occasion of his birth anniversary at the Netaji Subhas Park at Ambala Cantonment.
Taking a dig at the Opposition parties, Vij said, “Yesterday, the entire Opposition came together to celebrate Lord Ram. Now they say that Lord Ram belongs to everybody. Even if they (Opposition) worship Lord Ram day and night now, by rejecting the consecration ceremony’s invitations, they have shown their true faces and the people of the country have witnessed it. They are just engaging in damage control.”
Speaking about Bose, Vij said, “Today, across the country, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary is being celebrated with great enthusiasm. We have made the most beautiful park in Ambala and have named it after Netaji. There was a discussion about the park’s name. In the past, names of such places were usually kept after members of the Gandhi-Nehru families.”
“There is no comparison of the contribution of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in achieving independence for India because he fought an armed war against British rule by forming an army. The first flag in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was hoisted by Netaji. Today, we all remember him and his contributions,” he said.
Vij added, “He (Subhas Chandra Bose) left. Where did he go, how did he go, governments could never figure that out. But, had he been here after India got independence, the colour of this country would have been quite different.”"

According to senior party leaders, talks on seat-sharing between the two parties are very likely to have a “positive” outcome for the city. The situation in Punjab, however, is not conducive to putting up a united front. “Both parties in Punjab have maintained since the beginning that they will not come together in the state. The state units are completely opposed to the idea. This, however, will not have a bearing on the talks in Delhi,” said an AAP leader.
AAP and Congress have met twice to discuss seat-sharing in the Capital, which has seven Lok Sabha seats. All seven have been won by the BJP since 2014.
While Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has not been part of the two meetings so far, he met Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and former President Rahul Gandhi in the Capital last week.
The road, however, is not all clear with ‘four’ being the bone of contention. That is, which party will contest four of the seven seats.
“At present, negotiations are revolving around which party will contest four seats in Delhi. For the sake of the larger national cause, we are ready to contest on four seats, even though we deserve to contest on five based on our performance in 2019,” said a senior Congress leader.
According to sources, the AAP wants to contest from the North East, Chandni Chowk, North West and West seats; the Congress from East, New Delhi and South.
“Not just in Delhi, but we are also willing to accommodate the AAP on one seat each in Haryana and Gujarat. The objective is to stop the BJP from taking advantage of a triangular contest in states,” another Congress leader said.
In Gujarat, the AAP has already announced Chaitar Vasava as its candidate from Bharuch.
The next meeting in regard to the alliance is likely to take place next week."

This comes at a time when three-day celebrations are being held in Bihar to mark the birth centenary of the former Bihar CM.
Demands for a Bharat Ratna for Thakur have been made for years. Last year, on July 12, speaking at an event to mark the centenary of the Bihar Assembly building, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav demanded Bharat Ratna for Thakur, a two-time Chief Minister of the state and a towering socialist icon who is often invoked by the state’s politicians.
While Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also attended the event, did not comment on the demand, he mentioned Karpoori along with other stalwarts from the state such as Jayaprakash Narain, the pioneer of the Bihar movement, and Srikrishna Sinha, the state’s first CM.
Tejashwi’s demand was not the first time that a contemporary Bihar leader demanded the highest civilian honour for Thakur, who is popularly referred to as Jannayak or people’s leader. In fact, the RJD and JD(U) had been making the appeal almost every year around the time of Thakur’s birth and death anniversaries.
Some of the schemes rolled out by CM Nitish Kumar bear the mark of Thakur’s socialist politics – whether it is the waiving of school fees for girls until their post graduation or providing a 50 per cent reservation to women in panchayats.
But what is it about Thakur’s legacy that makes political parties queue up to stake claim?
Thakur’s life can be divided into three phases: when he was a freedom fighter and a staunch socialist who worked under the guidance of stalwarts such as Jayaprakash Narain, Dr Rammanohar Lohia and Ramnandan Mishra (1942 to 1967); as the state’s CM and tallest socialist leader (1970 to 1979); and his later years (1980-1988) when he was trying to re-establish his political identity.
Thakur belonged to the Nai (barber) community that is listed as an Extremely Backward Class (EBC) among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the state and was from Pitaunjhia (now known as Karpoori Gram), a Rajput-dominated village in the Samstipur district. He made his debut as a legislator when he won the 1952 elections and remained one till his last Assembly election in 1985. He, however, faced an electoral loss when he contested from Samastipur in the 1984 Lok Sabha polls, when several other non-Congress stalwarts had also lost their elections due to the sympathy wave in the wake of Indira Gandhi’s assassination.
Thakur was the deputy CM and education minister in the Mahamaya Prasad Sinha Cabinet from 5 March 1967 to 28 January 1968.
In December 1970, Thakur went on to become the state’s CM for the first time with the Samyuktha Socialist Party, a coalition of ideologically similar outfits. However, political instability rocked the state from 1967-72, and the stint barely lasted six months until June 1971.
He later became the Janata Party’s CM in June 1977 and held power for close to two years, until differences with its main ally, the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the BJP’s precursor, alongside other reasons, led to the government’s fall.
As CM and deputy CM, his policies were wide-ranging: promotion of Hindi language in government offices, declaring Urdu as the second official language in Bihar, waiving school fees, strengthening the Panchayati Raj system by holding regular elections, among others.
But his most significant contribution was in the sphere of reservation, a model that is still followed for all of the state’s jobs.
As CM in 1978, Thakur implemented a layered reservation system, despite resistance from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, a major constituent of the Janata Party government in power at the time.
The system, an unparalleled one, provided a 26 per cent reservation model in which OBC communities got 12 per cent of the share; Economically Backward Classes from among the OBCs got 8 per cent; women got 3 per cent; and economically backward classes from amongst the upper castes also got 3 per cent.
This was much before the Narendra Modi government introduced the Economically Weaker Section quota of 10 per cent.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Sushil Kumar Modi, former deputy CM of the state, said: “Reservation for OBCs with a separate provision for EBC reservation was Karpoori Thakur’s masterstroke and his lasting legacy.”
Former JD(U) MP K C Tyagi attributes Thakur’s enduring legacy to his “assimilative and inclusive politics”.
The reservations also hold importance in the context of the Bihar of that time, which was going through a churn, with dominant OBC and Dalit leaders asserting their positions. Lalu Prasad Yadav had become an MP in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections and was putting up a tough fight. Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan was elected as an MP in 1977 and was already challenging Karpoori’s long-held position as the socialist leader in Bihar. This was a changed picture from just a couple of years ago, when Yadav leaders such as Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav had helped Karpoori emerge as the tallest leader of the OBCs.
After 1980, Karpoori was dubbed an EBC leader, a tag that he was not able to shed till the end of his life. This was a bit of an irony since he started off as the leader of the masses by rallying together the support of the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. However, from this point until his death in 1988, he had to look for political relevance in the state.
Towards the later part of his career, Thakur’s reservation policy drew a lot of criticism from the public. In 1988, 42 upper caste people were killed by Naxalites in the Dalelchak Bhagoda village and Thakur, who went to visit the village, was nearly driven away by an angry mob from the spot. A Patna-based photographer had to rescue him.
Old-timers who have worked with Thakur talk of his “simplicity and probity.”
They recount an incident when Janata Party President Chandrashekhar is said to have collected funds from party leaders to buy a new kurta for Thakur, who would often wear worn-out kurtas. An amused Karpoori is said to have remarked: “If there are more funds, I will donate it to the party.”
Those close to him say Thakur’s commitment to the Janata Party’s socialist ideals stayed till the very end. Many recall an incident where former Uttar Pradesh CM Hemwati Nandan Bahugana went to Thakur’s house in his village after his death and broke down when he saw it was a little more than a run-down hut.
The socialist icon is known to have been firmly against dynastic politics. His son Ramnath Thakur, now a second-term JD (U) Rajya Sabha MP, only joined politics after his father’s death."
2LCRG4RR2T_OQA04ZBXA7O0RZT,75th Republic Day of India: The women who fought for our rights,Angellica Aribam,"Updated: January 26, 2024 11:27 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/republic-day-the-women-who-fought-for-our-rights-9128070/,"75th Republic Day of India: India’s journey towards becoming a republic encompasses several movements and stakeholders who struggled for a progressive agenda. The references to justice, liberty, and equality in the Preamble of the Constitution were a nod of acknowledgement to the aspirations of freedom fighters and social reformers. The feminist movements in pre-independent India played a crucial role in ensuring women’s rights were guaranteed in the Constitution. Sadly, their role in forging the republic remains underappreciated.
The most glaring example is the case of the right to vote. It is often claimed that women were “granted” this right at the same time as men. This is misleading and ignores the concerted efforts of women activists.
One of the first official calls for enfranchising women was made in 1917 when a delegation of women activists presented a memorandum of demands to Edwin Montagu and Lord Chelmsford, who had been tasked to formulate a scheme of self-governance for India. The same year, the Women’s Indian Association (WIA) was formed to address the socio-economic challenges faced by women. It was the first national body to advocate for female suffrage. In 1918, WIA and others intensified their advocacy, travelling to Britain to garner support for their causes. Sarojini Naidu took the women’s rights issue to the Congress party, moving resolutions for women’s enfranchisement at Congress sessions in Bijapur and Bombay.
Follow our Republic Day 2024 live blog for the latest updates!
The first victory came with the enactment of the Government of India Act 1919 that allowed provincial legislatures to enfranchise women. In 1921, Madras became the first province to grant women the right to vote, followed by Bombay and the United Provinces. The enfranchisement Bill was defeated in the Bengal Legislative Council. Suffragists led by the Bangiya Nari Samaj organised massive awareness campaigns for four years, leading to the passage of the Bill in 1925. Women leaders did not let up after the initial success. The right to vote, while monumental, was conditional upon ownership of property, income, and other statuses which excluded a sizeable number of women. Further, women still did not have a right to sit in legislative bodies.
The Nehru Report, a draft Constitution, prepared by an All Parties Conference in 1929 called for equal civic rights for all citizens. Britain was not keen on expanding this right. To galvanise international support, a delegation led by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and Shareefa Hamid Ali travelled to London, and then Geneva to petition the League of Nations. The Government of India Act 1935 expanded the right to vote and paved the way for women in public offices. Several women contested the 1936-37 elections and joined provincial governments. Women leaders created widespread acceptance for the idea of a universal adult franchise.
Their activism extended to social and personal spheres. In 1927, several women-led organisations joined hands to form the All India Women’s Conference (AIWC). Initially, AIWC focussed on women’s education. Later, it pushed for outlawing child marriage, raising the age of consent, and banning polygamy. AIWC believed that women’s emancipation was not possible without reforming the various religious laws (personal codes).
In 1945-46, the AIWC adopted the Indian Woman’s Charter of Rights and Duties. The charter demanded equality in all spheres. It specifically made a case for women’s economic empowerment and highlighted the need to formally recognise the value of domestic work. The charter advocated wholesale reforms to the personal codes, demanding the freedom to divorce, and equal property and inheritance rights. Some of these demands found their way into the Hindu Code Bill and were enacted a decade later.
In the aftermath of Partition, a key issue was the reservations of seats on religious grounds. In the Constituent Assembly, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur (a Christian) and Begum Qudsia Aizaz Rasul (a Muslim) made passionate appeals to do away with any special privileges. Eventually reservation was limited to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. AIWC had been against separate electorates and believed that reservation deepened communal divisions — they even argued against women’s reservation. These issues caused a rift within the AIWC reflecting the diverse worldviews within the women’s movement.
The framers of our Constitution were no strangers to the diversity of thought. The Constitution was envisioned as a living document, allowing future governments to mould the republic as per the contingencies of the time. In the last 70 years, feminists have strived to advance the rights of women leading to the enactment of various laws, policies, and Constitutional amendments. The groundwork was laid by the women who came much before us. This 75th Republic Day is an opportune moment for us to honour and acknowledge their contributions. Lest we forget.

Delivering a speech at Anna University in Chennai, Ravi also claimed that for a long period after the British left, systems were in place that ignored India’s cultural, spiritual, and civilisational heritage.
According to him, this neglect extended to the freedom fighters and martyrs, including those from Tamil Nadu who he said significantly contributed to Bose’s Indian National Army (INA).
Arguing that Bose’s role in India’s independence has been misunderstood and under-appreciated, Ravi highlighted Bose’s progressive vision, including the formation of a women’s battalion, a concept that was only realised in Independent India’s military decades later.
He also described the post-1942 period as a time of inaction in the national freedom movement led by Gandhi, which, in his view, became a “non-event”. He credited Bose with reigniting the fight against British rule, particularly highlighting the naval revolt of February 1946 and the Indian Air Force strike as direct consequences of Bose’s influence.
Ravi referred to a conversation from 1950 in which then British PM Clement Attlee purportedly said that the non-cooperation of the Indian National Congress had “minimum” impact in prompting the British to leave.
It was the fear among the British of being insecure in India following the revolt of the Navy and the rebellion of the Air Force that influenced their decision, the Governor said.
“When I read this, I thought I should look into it. Having spent a considerable period in the Intelligence Bureau, a successor of British intelligence, I delved into archival data from February and March, 1946. I was amazed to see the dispatches sent from India to Britain. Every day brought a frightening report. The Central Intelligence, as it was called in those days, reported that anything could happen anytime. Besides the Indian military, they realised that even the Indian police could not be trusted. Within a month of this revolt, they decided they would make India free. It was the consequence of what Netaji did,” Ravi said.
He also called for a reevaluation of historical accounts to include the contributions of overlooked freedom fighters, and appealed to state universities to start Netaji chairs and more research into his contributions and the INA."

Shinde will return to Mumbai on Thursday night.
Jarange-Patil, who kick-started his protest march demanding Kunbi (OBC) status to Maratha community, was expected to reach Lonavala on Wednesday night at the time of reporting. After an overnight stay, he will travel to Panvel by car on Thursday. His roadshow from Panvel will travel from Kharghar, Belapur and Nerul to Vashi.
“He will be staying at Vashi’s Agriculture Produce Market Committee along with others who are travelling with him,” said Bhaiya Patil, who is part of a team coordinating the protest march. Patil said the Maratha community was voluntarily donating food, rice, water bottles as well as fruit for all participating in the march.
On Republic Day morning, Jarange-Patil will travel to Chembur where he will garland the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and will start the roadshow towards Dadar. “He will travel to Azad maidan at south Mumbai from Dadar via Byculla,” said Virendra Pawar, one of the key coordinators of the protest march. Pawar said that they were yet to get police permission but hoped that the issue will be resolved soon.
The state government on Wednesday granted an extension to the Justice (retired) Sandeep Shinde committee, formed to finalise the methodology to grant Kunbi status to Marathas, till February 29. This is the second extension to the committee. The state backward class commission too kick-started its survey to collect empirical data of open category individuals in the state from Tuesday, which is slated to be over in a week. The survey is to prove social and educational backwardness of the Maratha community.
The government had earlier announced it will hold a special session of the state legislature on February 26 to grant reservation to Marathas. Jarange-Patil and the protesters walking with him have demanded an immediate solution to the issue and have announced that they will be stationed at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai.
Meanwhile, CM Shinde on Tuesday night reached his native village Dare and will return to Mumbai on Thursday night. “The smell and essence of the soil of my village draws me to it frequently,” said Shinde, while speaking to reporters at Dare. He claimed that the government was working on ensuring reservation to the Maratha community and will give quota which will survive the test of law.
On Wednesday morning, a group of senior ministers including deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar held a review of the situation and arrangements made in the wake of the protest march by Jarange-Patil."
2NHQ81UARJ_CL4APAOPNAOJYL3,Ram temple will ‘continue to inspire us’ to create new paradigms of development: PM Modi in letter to President Murmu,_,"January 23, 2024 22:35 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/narendra-modi-droupadi-murmu-ram-temple-9124508/,"The grand Ram temple in Ayodhya will “continue to inspire us” to create new paradigms of development and success, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday in a letter to President Droupadi Murmu, a day after returning from the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony.
“Upon returning from Ayodhya Dham after witnessing the most unforgettable moments of my life, I am writing this letter to you. I have returned with an Ayodhya in my heart, an Ayodhya which can never be separated from me,” Modi said. He was responding to Murmu’s letter to him a day before the January 22 consecration ceremony of the new idol of Ram Lalla at the temple.
In her letter to the prime minister, Murmu had said the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration of the grand Ram temple was an uninhibited expression of India’s eternal soul and the start of a new cycle in the country’s resurgence.

Noting that he received Murmu’s letter a day before leaving for Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said he is very grateful for her good wishes and affection. “Every word of your letter expressed your compassionate nature and your immense happiness at organisation of the consecration ceremony,” he said.
Modi said when he received Murmu’s letter, he was in a different state of mind and her letter gave him immense support and strength in handling these feelings and in coming to terms with them.
“I visited ayodhya Dham as a pilgrim. My mind was overwhelmed with many emotions after going to the holy land where such a confluence of faith and history has taken place,” he said.
“To witness such a historic occasion is both a privilege and a responsibility. You had also discussed about my 11-day religious exercise and the ‘Yama-Niyams’ related to it. Our country has been the witness to countless people who kept many vows for centuries so that Ram Lalla once again resides at his birthplace,” Modi said.
“Being the medium of the fulfilment of these centuries-long resolves was a very emotional moment for me and I consider it my good fortune,” the prime minister said.
Along with 140 crore people, seeing Ram Lalla and welcoming him was amazing, Modi said.
“That moment was possible only with the blessings of Lord Shri Ram and the people of India, and I will always be grateful for it,” he said.
“As you said, we not only worship Lord Shri Ram but also take inspiration from him in every aspect of life, especially in the social sphere,” Modi said.
The prime minister noted that President Murmu in her letter had discussed the impact of the scheme PM-JANMAN and the empowerment of extremely backward people in the tribal society.
“Being associated with the tribal society, who can understand this better than you? Our culture has always taught us to work for the most deprived sections of the society. Many campaigns like PM-JANMAN are bringing a big change in the lives of the people of the country today,” Modi said.
The ideals of Lord Ram “give us constant energy for the welfare works and empowerment campaigns for the poor”, he said.
“It is Lord Shri Ram who has given the inspiration for ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishvas aur sabka prayas’ in every chapter of his life,” the prime minister said.
The results of this mantra are visible everywhere today, and in the last decade, the country has succeeded in bringing about 25 crore people out of poverty, he said.
The eternal thoughts of Lord Ram are the basis of India’s glorious future, Modi said.
“The power of these ideals will pave the way for all the people of the country to create a developed India by the year 2047,” Prime Minister Modi said.
He said the grand temple of Lord Ram will “continue to inspire us to create new paradigms of development and success”.
President Murmu on Sunday had complimented Prime Minister Modi ahead of the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony.
In a two-page letter to him, the president had said that “as you prepare yourself to go for ‘Pran Pratishtha’ of Prabhu Shri Ram’s ‘murti’ (idol) at the new temple built at his birthplace in Ayodhya, I can only contemplate the unique civilisational journey that will be accomplished with each step taken by you in the hallowed precincts”.
Referring to the 11-day rigorous ‘anushthan’ that the prime minister has undertaken, Murmu said it is not only a sacred ritual but also a supreme spiritual act of sacrifice and submission to Lord Ram.
Sending heartfelt wishes, the president said that the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration of the grand temple of Prabhu Shri Ram in Ayodhya Dham is an uninhibited expression of the eternal soul of India. “We all are fortunate to witness the commencement of a new cycle in the resurgence of our nation,” she had said."
2OXOM5V832_RFWSKRJWE5Z86XQ,US Presidential elections 2024: What is the New Hampshire primary — and why is it significant?,_,"January 23, 2024 19:47 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-presidential-elections-2024-what-is-the-new-hampshire-primary-and-why-is-it-significant-9124201/,"Voters in New Hampshire are heading to the polls on Tuesday (January 23) for the country’s first presidential primary election. Under the spotlight is Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley, who is hoping to narrow former President Donald Trump’s delegate lead after his thumping victory in the Iowa caucuses last week.
For Democrats, this year’s New Hampshire primary doesn’t mean much. President Joe Biden isn’t even on the ballot. This is because Democrats have changed their primary calendar, moving their first votes to different states.
Here is everything you need to know about the New Hampshire primary election and why it is significant.
What is the difference between caucuses and primaries?
Caucuses and primaries are the processes available to the 50 American states (plus Washington DC and outlying territories) to choose the two major parties’ nominees for President. The contests — referred to as the primary race — are being held this year between January 15 and June 8.
Since the Democrats all but have their nominee already — President Biden — the 2024 primary race holds significance only for the Republican party. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is far ahead of other Republican candidates, though.
Some American states hold primaries, some hold caucuses, and a third group holds a combination of the two systems. Primary elections are conducted by governments; caucuses are private events held by the parties.
In primaries, voters go to polling stations and check the box against the name of their favoured candidate. Caucuses are lengthier processes in which voters attend meetings at public places such as school gymnasiums, churches, and community centres, debate candidate preferences and, when it comes to voting, openly raise their hands for their choice.
The caucus system favours candidates with strong, active bases over those with broader support — and is often criticised for being vulnerable to intimidation, and inconvenient for employees who work in shifts and parents who might find it difficult to attend an in-person meeting of unpredictable length.
Why does New Hampshire go first?
New Hampshire has conducted the first presidential primary election since 1920, when 16,195 Republicans and 7,103 Democrats turned out on March 9. In 1975, the state passed a law that mandated that the election must take place at least a week before any other state’s primary.
In the 1980s, New Hampshire struck a deal with Iowa, allowing Iowa to hold the first caucus and New Hampshire the first primary.
According to a report by The New York Times, conducting the first primary has several benefits, including an influx of out-of-state cash and media attention.
Who is on the ballot?
Let’s first see the Republicans. There are only two candidates left in the presidential race, including Trump and Haley. The latest contender to drop out of the race is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who made the announcement after Trump registered a big win in the Iowa caucuses. While Trump received 51% of votes, DeSantis got 21.2% of them. Haley managed to garner 19.1% of votes and stood in third position.
In New Hampshire, although polls show that Haley is closing the gap on Trump, the former president is still quite ahead of her. According to the latest Monmouth University-Washington Post poll, released on Monday (January 22), Trump leads Haley by 18 points, 52% to 34%, with DeSantis at 8% — the poll was conducted before DeSantis dropped out of the race.
Now, the Democrats. As mentioned before, President Biden isn’t on the ballot for the New Hampshire primary. But why? Last year, the Democrats changed their primary calendar to bring states with a more racially diverse make-up than Iowa and New Hampshire, which are overwhelmingly white. As a result, the first two states to vote for a Democratic presidential nominee will be South Carolina and Nevada (both of them hold primaries instead of caucuses), which will vote on February 3 and February 6 respectively.
However, New Hampshire refused to cede its first-in-the-nation primary status and scheduled an unsanctioned primary for Tuesday. Therefore, President Biden’s name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot.
Why is the New Hampshire primary important?
According to a report by CBS News, New Hampshire primary results often make or break a candidate’s presidential campaign. Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire, told the news outlet: “It’s the donors, like the people giving money, who want to see success immediately in the first few contests… So that’s why, for a lot of candidates, it’s Iowa or bust, or it’s New Hampshire or bust.”
Moreover, for the Republican side, it has been a good predictor of who wins the GOP nomination. New Hampshire has correctly predicted the party nominee every year except 2000 in the millennium. On the Democratic side, that’s only been true 50% of the time."

The incident occurred on Monday, which marked the opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The police took action on the basis of a purported video of the incident which was doing rounds on social media.
“The arrested persons were produced before a local court on Tuesday which sent them to judicial custody,” said SHO (Menhdawal) Vijay Kumar Dubey. He added that the five were booked on charges of breach of peace because no one came forward to register a case. According to police, on January 22, a group of people took out a Shobha yatra in Menhdawal town to celebrate the opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The procession ended peacefully.
“On Tuesday, a video went viral which showed a group of participants of the procession reportedly raising religious slogans outside a mosque. One of the participants also tried to climb the mosque’s iron gate. Police  promptly identified the individuals involved and arrested them,” said a police officer."

Sharmila, who took aim at her brother and Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy immediately after taking over as APCC chief on Sunday and accused him of leading the state into a financial crisis, will be following in the footsteps of her late father and former Congress CM Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, known as YSR, and Jagan, who undertook ‘padyatras’ in the state before her.
On her nine-day tour, Sharmila will travel in a convoy and cover all 26 districts in the state starting from Ichchapuram in the Srikakulam district to Idupulapaya in YSR Kadapa district. She began the journey on Tuesday in a state transport bus from Palasa to Ichchapuram, where she joined her convoy. She is being accompanied by former Telangana Pradesh Committee chief Manikrao Thakare and former APCC presidents Gidugu Rudra Raju and Raghuveera Reddy.

Speaking for the first time after his sister was appointed the APCC president, Jagan used Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu’s shoulder to train his guns on her. “Chandrababu Naidu has a number of star campaigners and sympathisers. Some of Chandrababu’s star campaigners are now in the party (Congress) that bifurcated Andhra Pradesh… Some of his sympathisers are hiding in the BJP. Chandrababu’s sister-in-law is also his star campaigner and sympathiser,” he said, referring to BJP state president D Purandeswari. Jagan was speaking at a public meeting at Uravakonda in Anantapur district, where he disbursed Aasara pensions for women on Tuesday.
Sharmila, 51, who has completed several state tours and padyatras in favour of Jagan and the ruling YSR Congress Party in the past, will be hoping to use this yatra to make some political space for herself and the Congress in a state dominated by a strong YSRCP and the alliance between the TDP and the Jana Sena Party. This time, she will be hoping to revive the fortunes of the Congress.
Congress leaders in the 26 districts have already started reaching out to former YSR supporters who have joined other parties to return to the Congress fold.
“This is the time for all YSR loyalists to join the Congress, or return to the party that my father led when he was APCC president. Time to bring back YSR rajyam,” she said while announcing her state-wide travel plan.
During her tour, Sharmila will hold review meetings with local leaders in each of the 26 districts and draw up plans to rejuvenate the Congress at the grassroots level.
“She will be drawing from her experience of the padyatra she did in Telangana to reach out to the people and hold small meetings. In the next few days we will discuss her state-wide campaign plans,” said J Goutham, APCC working president.
This is not Sharmila’s first political tour. In June 2012, after the Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Jagan in an alleged quid pro quo case, she campaigned on his behalf for by-elections. That October, she started a padyatra on her own, walking nearly 3,000 km from Idupulapaya, her native village, in the YSR Kadapa district to Ichchapuram in the Srikakulam district.
Ahead of the 2019 elections, Sharmila went on an 11-day bus yatra through Andhra Pradesh in support of the YSRCP, covering around 1,500 km.
Finding no political space for herself in Andhra Pradesh after Jagan stormed to power in May 2019, she shifted to Hyderabad in April 2021 and founded the YSR Telangana Party on July 8, her father’s birth anniversary. On October 20, 2021, she started the Praja Prasthanam Yatra, a foot march across the 33 districts of Telangana. In early January this year, she merged her party with the Congress."

Fabricating economic data or interfering in statistical work by officials has persisted despite government steps in recent years to improve the quality of the data, the bureau said in a statement, citing an unidentified senior official.
Officials who commit data fraud “will be found, investigated and dealt with, and will not be tolerated,” the official said.
“Statistical fraud is the biggest corruption in the field of statistics, which seriously violates the statistics law, seriously affects the quality of statistical data, obstructing and even misleading macro decision-making,” the official said.
The official’s remarks follow the ruling Communist Party’s new disciplinary rules that included giving warnings and expelling officials who are responsible for data violations.
There has long been scepticism about the reliability of Chinese data, especially as the government has sought to defuse market concerns about a protracted slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.
The economy grew 5.2% in 2023, meeting the official target, but analysts expect growth to slow this year amid a property crisis, mounting local debt and persistent deflationary risks."

This will be the first student union election after 2019.
In a notification, the university said, “This is to bring to the kind notice of all concerned that the JNU Students Union Elections 2023-24 will be held between six to eight weeks after the commencement of the academic session for PhD students i.e February 2, 2024.”
Detailed guidelines for holding elections will be issued by the Office of Dean of Students in due course, it added.
The notification came hours after the JNUSU called for a ‘university strike’ on January 30 demanding to notify the elections at the earliest.
The students’ union had submitted a fresh memorandum to Vice-Chancellor Santishree D Pandit to conduct the elections and revoke the Central Proctor Office manual and disciplinary action against students. “Despite repeated representations to your office regarding JNUSU elections and revocation of the CPO manual and proctorial inquiries, there has been no written communication or response to the same,” the letter read.
The student body had written to the V-C on January 15 and to the Dean of Students on January 17.
It said it will start a complete non-cooperation movement if the notification regarding the elections is not released by February 2. “Despite verbal assurances that the notification for JNUSU elections will be announced with the new academic calendar, the JNU administration has not released a single circular regarding holding of elections,” the letter read."
30MMOS9P93_K4JWDL39FOEMRLR,Emmanuel Macron is Republic Day chief guest: The bright arc of India-France ties,Shubhajit Roy,"Updated: January 26, 2024 19:03 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/macron-is-republic-day-chief-guest-the-bright-arc-of-india-france-ties-9128134/,"In 1998, then French President Jacques Chirac expressed the idea of “a partnership for the 21st century” with India. “I came with the proposition to build a strong relation between our two countries, a global partnership grounded on our complementarities and our common interests,” he had said, speaking as the Republic Day Chief Guest.
That was Chirac’s second visit in the capacity — he had accepted the same invitation 22 years ago, then as France’s Prime Minister.
The durability of Indo-French ties can be witnessed by the fact that Chirac agreed to be the Chief Guest in 1976, when India was under Emergency and facing criticism from western democracies. Later, after Chirac’s 1998 visit, India conducted nuclear tests in May that year, and even as many western powers slapped sanctions, the French did not condemn India.
Follow our Republic Day 2024 live blog for the latest updates!
Both these instances testify to the French pragmatism and foresight in how they have managed diplomatic ties with India.
In December 2023, when India invited French President Emmanuel Macron for Republic Day after US President Joe Biden was unavailable, this pragmatism was at play again. Macron accepted despite knowing he was the second choice, showing the comfort between the French and the Indian system.
This will be the sixth time that a French leader will be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day celebrations.
Macron’s visit caps a milestone year for India-France ties — the 25th anniversary of their strategic partnership.
The India-France Strategic Partnership, the first that India signed with any western country, has seen considerable progress in bilateral, regional and international contexts. “The partnership draws strength, trust and consistency from a shared sense of strategic autonomy and sovereignty, a quest for a multi-polar world, and a natural affinity for democratic values and rule of law,” a senior official said.
Defence and security, civil nuclear matters, and space constitute principal pillars of this partnership, which now also includes a strong Indo-Pacific component.
The comprehensive Roadmap between India and France, which was adopted last year in July during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit as Guest of Honour for Bastille Day, was classified under three pillars — Partnership for Security and Sovereignty; Partnership for the Planet; and Partnership for People.
Defence: India and France have had a strong and robust defence partnership. Bilateral defence cooperation between the two sides is reviewed under Annual Defence Dialogue (Defence Minister level) and High Committee on Defence Cooperation (Secretary level). A DRDO office was opened in the Embassy in 2023 for strengthening technology cooperation.
The procurement of Rafale jets as part of India’s air power is a testament to the deep defence ties. The India France joint defence exercises have also grown in scope and complexity over the years.
Space: There’s a rich history of cooperation in the field of space for over 50 years between ISRO and the French Space Agency, Centre National D’Etudes Spatiales (CNES). France remains a major supplier of components and equipment for the Indian space programme.
Civil Nuclear Cooperation: During the PM’s visit to Paris in July 2023, both leaders welcomed the progress made during discussions related to the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project (JNPP). However, the progress here has been slow, though the first pact was agreed in 2008. The two sides have also agreed to establish a partnership on Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMR).
Economic: France is one of the largest investors in India with FDI inflow of US$ 659.77 million for FY 2022-23 (as of June 2023) and a cumulative FDI stock of $10.76 billion from April 2000 to September 2023. There are over 70 Indian companies employing over 8,000 employees in France.
For FY 2023-24 (till August 2023), Indian exports to France totaled $3.06 billion and imports from France totaled $2.36 billion. India’s main exports include engineering goods, petroleum products, pharmaceutical products, electronic equipment and ready-made garments. The main imports from France are aviation products, machine equipment, electrical equipment and chemical products.
Digital: In July 2023, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was launched from the Eiffel Tower, offering secure and convenient transactions for Indian visitors and NRIs.
C-DAC and M/S Atos, an European multinational IT service and consulting company based in France, have developed 14 supercomputers for India so far, including the fastest supercomputer Param Siddhi at 4.6 petaflops/second.
Education: It is estimated that there are about 10,000 Indian students in France. An agreement on mutual recognition of degrees was signed in 2018.
The Indo French Campus for Health was also launched in June 2022 to offer double degrees.
A scheme that allows Indian students to stay in France up to two years after finishing their Masters degree, to look for jobs, was renewed in October 2022. In July 2023, it was agreed to increase the number of Indian students in France to 30,000 by 2030. During Modi’s visit, France announced the issuing of a five-year Schengen visa to Indian alumni who have completed at least one semester of their Master’s degree in France, a first for alumni from any country.
Community in France: Mainland France has an estimated 1,19,000 Indian community (including NRIs) members, largely originating from erstwhile French colonies of Puducherry, Karaikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore and the States of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Punjab.
Tourism: About 2.5 lakh French travelled to India in 2019 while about 7 lakh Indians went to France for tourism.
Rajasthan continues to lead among all Indian destinations for French tourists. Foreign tourist arrivals into Rajasthan are growing at a double digit since 2016.
France has continued to support India’s claim for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council and the reforms of the United Nations. France’s support was vital in India’s accession to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) and Australia Group (AG). France continues to support India’s bid for accession to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).
India and France have resolved to work together for adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the UN.
The current visit will give Modi and Macron an opportunity to exchange notes on issues of mutual interest — the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas war, China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific, and defence and security cooperation.
French diplomats say that Chirac, an admirer of India who had studied Sanskrit, saw India as a major emerging power and pushed for boosting political and economic cooperation. Macron, on his third visit to India as the French President — he came in March 2018 and September 2023 — will have the chance to elevate it further."

Ministry of External Affairs official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Thursday, “We have seen media reports regarding certain remarks by the Pakistan foreign secretary. It is Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda.”
“As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicentre of terrorism, organised crime and illegal transnational activities. India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence. Pakistan will reap what it sows. To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution,” he said.
Earlier in the day, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi alleged at a press conference in Islamabad that India was carrying out “extraterritorial and extrajudicial killings” inside Pakistan.

Shahid Latif, a key aide to Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and the mastermind of the 2016 attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, was gunned down in a mosque at Sialkot in Punjab province on October 11, 2023.
On September 8, 2023, Riyaz Ahmad alias Abu Qasim, who was affiliated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba and one of the main conspirators behind the Dhangri terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on January 1, 2023, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen inside the Al-Qudus mosque during pre-dawn prayers in the Rawalakot area in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
The Pakistan foreign secretary said, while talking about Shahid Latif’s killing,“A detailed investigation revealed that an Indian agent, Yogesh Kumar, based in a third country, orchestrated the assassination.”
He alleged that Kumar recruited Muhammad Umair, a labourer in the third country, to act as a contact with local criminals in Pakistan to trace and assassinate Latif. However, “they were unable to carry out the execution”, he added.
“After some of the failed attempts, Muhammad himself was personally sent to Pakistan to carry out the assassination,” the Pakistani official said, adding that Muhammad had organised a team of five target killers and succeeded in his attempt.
All those involved in the killings were apprehended and a case is being tried in a court of law, the foreign secretary said. “We have evidence of transactions made in the process linking the entire chain to Indian agent Yogesh Kumar,” he claimed.
“Another Indian agent was involved in the killing of a Pakistan man, identified as Muhammad Riaz,” he claimed, possibly referring to Riyaz Ahmad alias Abu Qasim.
The killer, Muhammad Abdullah Ali, was arrested in Karachi while boarding a flight and the interrogation has revealed that he was “recruited and guided by Indian agents Ashok Kumar Anand and Yogesh Kumar,” Pakistan’s foreign secretary alleged.
He also said that “Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations.”

In Gujjegowdanapura village, under Harohalli panchayat in Mysuru district, a stone block used to carve the idol of Ram Lalla — by Karnataka sculptor Arun Yogiraj — for the temple construction was mined from four guntas of land donated by 70-year-old Ramdas H, a Dalit farmer.
While elected representatives including former minister SR Mahesh and local MLA GT Devegowda took part in the ceremony, many “unhappy” villagers of Harohalli asked Simha, who represents Mysuru-Kodagu constituency in the Lok Sabha, on his arrival.
Suresh, former taluk panchayat member, said, “You have never visited the village in 10 years and you are here now for political reasons. Other elected representatives, including BJP MLAs, have come here and been involved. You never bothered to listen to us, and we do not want you to come here.”
Swamy Harohalli, a villager and also the cousin brother of Ramdas, told The Indian Express that “villagers were unhappy with the MP”.
“During Mahisha Dasara last year, Pratap Simha spoke against the community and its leaders. Some of our villagers were also arrested at his behest. He never cared to visit the village or address our issues. But now, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, he came here from nowhere… Besides, JD(S) leaders, even BJP MLA TS Srivatsa visited the place and spoke to people, but Pratap Simha never bothered to visit them,” he said.
Facing the ire of villagers, Simha left the place a few minutes after his arrival. Even though GT Devegowda and other leaders tried to pacify the villagers, they were not convinced.
Later in the day, speaking to the media, Pratap Simha said that it was just few Congress men who created ruckus. “Just some four misreants created the ruckus and they are Congress workers. I am against Mahisha Dasara even now. Congress cannot defeat me in this Loksabha elections which is why they are making such dramas. I will not fear for all these,” he added."

“We are thinking of roping in new faces as party candidates in Lok Sabha elections in the state. We will also discuss how many youths should be given party ticket,” said Ramesh Chennithala, in-charge of Maharashtra Congress.
The criteria for party ticket will be ability of a candidate to win the seat, he said. “The decision on party candidature will be taken by the national unit after discussions in the state Congress election committee,” he added.
On the possibility of former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan contesting Lok Sabha elections either from Satara or Pune, Chennithala said there has been no discussion on it as of now. “Chavan can win from any seat in the state but there has been no discussion on it,” he said.
However, Chavan himself responded in negative on contesting Lok Sabha elections.
On the possibility of BJP likely to induct opposition parties’ potential candidates into the party, Chennithala expressed confidence that “no one will join BJP. They are spreading rumours as they are not efficient and are not a powerful organisation. They are doing it as they are scared of going to election. If at all anyone is going then they are going for some post. Those who believe in ideology of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru will not go at any cost.”"

Delhi Congress president Arvinder Singh Lovely announced the programme following an organisational meeting in east Delhi on Sunday.
“The people of Delhi trusted the BJP and elected seven MPs, but in the last ten years, all seven MPs of the BJP have disappeared from the public and proved to be useless…if these MPs have worked for the public, then the BJP should not cut the tickets of all its MPs, and only they should show courage to contest the elections again,” Lovely said.
Lovely mentioned that the Congress national president will formally begin with the party’s Lok Sabha election campaign from East Delhi, like former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who started hers from East Delhi in 1979 after the Congress lost the 1977 elections to overthrow the Janata Party government.
“Similarly, with Kharge ji’s rally in East Delhi, the people will uproot the dictatorial BJP government at the Centre…people of every religion and caste in every province are giving their full support to the ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’ of former Congress President Rahul Gandhi, which has started in Manipur, because the Congress is the only party that has always talked about the development of the country,” Lovely said."

Speaking in Ayodhya after the consecration of the Ram temple, Bhagwat said India’s “swa” (self) had returned, and the temple would represent the rise of a “new Bharat”. “Ram Rajya is coming,” he said.
“We are all children of Bharat Varsha. We have to maintain good conduct and end disputes. We have to stop the habit of fighting over things,” he said.
The truth is that Ram resides in “kan-kan” (every particle), he said. “So, we should all live in harmony. We should walk along with everyone else. All are ours. Compassion is important. Wherever we find that people are in grief, we should run to serve them. We should save from what we earn, and also give to society from what we earn. Others also have their beliefs that may be different from ours. It isn’t necessary that we are always correct, but even if we are, let us all stay in sanyam (patience, restraint),” he said.
Quoting Mahatma Gandhi on the Earth having enough for everyone’s need but not for everyone’s greed, Bhagwat called for a social life of discipline and togetherness, saying this path would lead Bharat to becoming a “Vishwaguru” (world leader).
Crediting those who struggled for the Ram temple for “500 years”, Bhagwat said: “Ram Lalla has come to remind us of our duties”. He said Ram had to leave Ayodhya due to “kalah” (differences, strife), and reiterated the need to “stay united”.
Asserting that the whole country was happy today, Bhagwat commended Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his strict fast, hailing him as a “tapaswi” (ascetic).
Bhagwat’s speech reflected the tone and tenor of his write-up on Saturday, as reported by The Indian Express. Then too, he had called for an end to “bitterness”, “dispute” and “conflict”.
In his last Vijayadashami address, Bhagwat had exhorted people to celebrate the consecration of the Ram temple across the country. “We can do this by organising small programmes… creating an atmosphere of affection, responsibility and goodwill in society,” he had said."

The permission to allow the Chinese ship comes amid strained ties between India and Maldives after its recently-elected President Mohamed Muizzu made Beijing as his first port of call early this month soon after assuming office. Traditionally, New Delhi has been the first port of call for a Maldivian President.

“The current administration appears to be making a stark pivot towards an anti-India stance. Both, the MDP and The Democrats believe alienating any development partner, and especially the country’s most long-standing ally will be extremely detrimental to the long-term development of the country,” the two opposition parties said in their assessment on “the direction in foreign policy” of the Maldivian government.
“Consecutive governments of the country must be able to work with all development partners for the benefit of the people of the Maldives, as the Maldives has traditionally done. Stability and security in the Indian Ocean is vital to the stability and security of the Maldives,” they told a joint news conference.
MDP’s chairperson and former Minister Fayyaz Ismail and the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, MP Ahmed Saleem, along with Democrats party president MP Hassan Latheef and the Parliamentary Group Leader, MP Ali Azim addressed a joint press conference to flag the issues.
The two parties committed to work together on several governance-related issues and expressed concern on another set of issues including the foreign policy and lack of transparency.
The MPs of the two parties together hold 55 seats in the 87-member house.
The joint statement was posted on the official websites of the two parties and their official X handles too.
The other issues of concern included a lack of transparency in the financial status of the state and the lack of transparency in the MOUs and Agreements that the Government is signing, especially, with foreign parties, although no country was named in the statement. The opposition also criticised the attempts at censoring the media and meddling with the freedom of the press."
3JHYCS5IZL_JWOZIO8HA7TZFCL,Telangana’s Mahalakshmi free travel scheme for women brings fortunes even as teething problems remain,Rahul V Pisharody,"Updated: January 29, 2024 09:05 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/hyderabad/telangana-mahalakshmi-free-travel-scheme-teething-problems-9123830/,"The Mahalakshmi scheme, which offers women and transgender persons free travel on state-run non-AC buses, has breathed fresh life into an ailing Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), as numbers show an increased occupancy in buses, resulting in a considerable rise in daily revenue.
If the recent Sankranti festival and related seasonal rush to travel to homes and back is taken into account, the corporation has registered over Rs 100 crore of revenue in excess compared to the same period last year. While all this suggests beneficiaries have welcomed it with open arms, there are teething problems that are far from being addressed.
For instance, the corporation’s buses are no longer Valleti Anusha’s preferred mode of daily commute, though she was a loyal patron for eight years. If increased occupancy in these buses is a sign of the return of the corporation to its heyday, Anusha feels it has become difficult to find a bus, especially during peak hours.
“The frequency of buses has come down. After waiting for up to half an hour, the bus that arrives is full to the hilt. We see even women travelling on footboards these days. If all this is for free travel, I prefer comfortable travel to reach my office on time,” said Anusha, a schoolteacher living in Venkatagiri.
Incidentally, her sister Mounika pays three times the cost of her travel to college. “The quarterly student bus pass used to cost her Rs 1,200 but now as buses are off-limits, she is forced to take the metro to Secunderabad and then board a bus to her college in West Marredpally. The metro pass costs Rs 1,000 a month,” added Anusha.
The official figures reveal a daily increase of over 9.2 lakh passengers since the scheme was introduced last month. About 62 per cent of the passengers now are women. The overall occupancy has increased by about 53 per cent. Near to full occupancy is recorded from almost all the 97 bus depots across the state. If such a spike in occupancy rates suggests increased access to public transport for women, another interesting dataset suggests that ridership on various temple routes has increased by 82 per cent. Officials say that a lot of excitement over the free bus travel scheme has resulted in leisure travel too.
The Mahalakshmi scheme, which was the Congress’s election promise, was implemented on December 9, 2023, after new members met at the Assembly for the first time and took their oath of office. One of the six big promises, the scheme has two more components—financial assistance of Rs 2,500 to eligible women and an LPG cylinder at Rs 500—which are being worked out.
On December 15, 2023, the corporation introduced zero-fare tickets to account for beneficiaries of the scheme. Of an average of 51 lakh daily passengers, over 27 lakh are issued zero-fare tickets every day. The corporation’s average daily revenue has risen to about Rs 18 to 19 crore, of which about Rs 10 crore comes from passengers who pay for their tickets. Earlier, the average daily revenue used to be around Rs 12 to 15 crore.
While the scheme is largely seen as a success, the fact is that zero-fare tickets are categorised as reimbursements receivable from the government and do not reflect in the corporation’s daily cash inflows. “If the government reimburses these zero-fare tickets in a time-bound manner, it will help the corporation. If not, it is going to be damaging. There are talks of the government wanting us to bear a certain percentage of the burden, which is going to be difficult for the TSRTC in its present financial condition,” said an official, on condition of anonymity.
The corporation estimates the cost of zero-fare tickets to be around Rs 250 crore every month. Experts feel lack of a revenue model and failure on part of the government to reimburse the TSRTC at the end of every month would lead to slow degeneration of the corporation and its fleet and cause confusion in its operations.
Agreeing with Anusha, a bus conductor on the Patancheru-CBS route, attributed the heavy rush in buses to “avoidable” travel by women. “A lot of them, we see, are travelling across the city and bus-hopping just because it is free. Many opt for buses for short distances and get them to stop at locations other than bus stops,” the conductor said.
According to him, conductors’ work and related pressure have increased manyfold because of non-cooperation from passengers. Of late, visuals of fights that break out between women passengers purportedly for seats have been widely shared on social media.
“Not everyone carries their original ID to prove their domicile as required. Many are even using forged and fake ID cards where sometimes photos don’t match, and sometimes addresses don’t. This way, it takes two to three minutes for us to verify and issue each zero-fare ticket. Also, only three zero-fare tickets can be issued by the ticket vending machine at once. So there are multiple factors that cause a delay in travel time,” he added.
While the amount of work has increased, their salaries have not risen since 2013, the corporation’s staff including drivers and conductors point out.
“The PRC (pay revision commission) recommendations of 2017 and 2021 are yet to be implemented. There is no word yet on the 50 per cent of the arrears of pay due from April 2013. We have not received a biannual DA (dearness allowance) since 2017. There has been no new recruitment or purchase of new buses for years. We hope the state government also takes employees’ welfare into consideration,” a bus conductor at the Central Bus Station said.
VC Sajjanar, vice-chairman and managing director of the corporation, agrees on the need for more buses. “The scheme has improved public transport for women and we will know more once it stabilises. Of course, there are issues and we need everyone’s cooperation. There is a scarcity of buses. But we are getting 1,050 new diesel buses and 1,000 new electric buses by June 2024,” he said.
Of the new electric buses, 500 will operate in Hyderabad. The corporation has a fleet of over 9,600 buses plying across the state. Of them, about 2,800 are operational in Hyderabad. States such as Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Punjab and Karnataka have previously implemented free bus travel for women.
Stating that mobility empowers people and opens a world of opportunities, Anant Maringanti, director of Hyderabad Urban Lab, a multi-disciplinary urban research centre, refused to call it a free travel scheme, as the government pays for the service.
However, asked if this scheme would lead to a direct increase in women’s participation in the labour force, Maringati finds it a tricky question to answer. For this, he added that the corporation would have to ensure women are moving specifically for employment by providing connections between their homes and places of work.
“That by itself is not enough. You need to have buses at the right time, connect the right places, make sure trips are safe, bus stops are accessible to women etc. Bus travel can only get them from one place to another and improving their lives is another question. Improving women’s ability to use public transportation, very specifically buses, is what this is about,” he added."

Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel watched the consecration ceremony in Ayodhya live on TV with BJP workers and local residents at Shilaj village in his Ghatlodia constituency.
Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Temple, Patel said: “This is a historic occasion as the wait of all Indians has come to an end. We pray to Lord Ram that development works continue uninterruptedly under the leadership of the PM.”
Finance Minister Kanu Desai watched the event live at Dharampur in his constituency of Pardi at Valsad district. Cabinet Minister Rushikesh Patel, the MLA from Visnagar in Mehsana, as well as ministers like Raghavji Patel, Balvantsinh Rajput, Mulu Bera, Kuber Dindor and Bhanuben Babariya, among others, also celebrated the occasion in their constiutencies.
State BJP president C R Paatil said Modi has fulfilled an age-old demand of the people. “Today, after 500 years, Lord Ram is seated again in his birth place Ayodhya. I congratulate the PM for doing pran pratishtha rituals by taking everyone together…,” he added.
While many residential societies, trusts and temples organised bhajans, bhandara, Ram Katha recitation and other religious events in their premises, processions were also taken out.
Processions or ‘Shoba Yatras’ were taken out in different towns and cities in the districts of Ahmedabad, Patan, Navsari, Mehsana, Dahod, Gandhinagar, Bhavnagar, Bharuch Gir Somnath, Vadodara and Kutch.
As announced by the state government earlier, all government offices and institutes in Gujarat were closed for half a day on Monday in view of the consecration ceremony. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, meanwhile, is scheduled to attend a function for the consecration of a redeveloped Ram temple at Ranip in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. The area falls within Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, represented by Shah.
The temple has been rebuilt by Shri Ramji Mandir Charitable Trust. President of the Trust and former BJP MLA from Sabarmati, Arvind Patel, said, “The temple was built in 1985. Over the years, it had become dilapidated. So, we have rebuilt it with stones at a (approximate) cost of Rs 7 crore.”"

The Army Commander is presently on a seven days’ visit to Nepal, starting from January 16.
Located on the foothills of Tharang La Pass in Mustang, the Bipin Bell was installed at the revered Muktinath Temple when four former Chiefs of the Indian Army—General V N Sharma, General J J Singh, General Deepak Kapoor and General Dalbir Suhag, who are also Honorary Generals of Nepal Army, visited Nepal to attend the 260th Nepali Army Day in February last year.
“Late General Bipin Rawat, a proud Gurkha officer himself, had a deep connect with Nepal and Nepali people and always endeavored to strengthen the camaraderie and brotherhood between both Armies and nations. The installation of Bipin Bell at the temple premises signifies his keen interest in visiting the temple which he had planned in the year 2021, but due to his untimely and unfortunate demise, could not materialise,” said a press statement from the Southern Command.
“Lt Gen A K Singh also called upon General Prabhu Ram Sharma, chief of Nepali Army, wherein he discussed furtherance of military bilateral relations between the two nations in order to bolster army-to-army connect.
During his visit to Pokhara, Baglung, Dharan and Kathmandu, he also interacted with Nepal domicile Gorkha veterans, Veer Naris and their dependents through various ex-servicemen rallies and updated all of them about various welfare measures pertaining to their pension benefits and other initiatives undertaken by the Indian Army,” said the release.
Earlier, the Army Commander visited the Embassy of India in Kathmandu and interacted with ambassador Naveen Srivastava. He also visited the defence wing in the Embassy of India. He was updated by Defence Attache, Nepal, on the issues concerning pensions, welfare, Ex Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and medical aspects and documentation of Nepal domicile Gorkha veterans, their next of kin and dependents.
The general officer also interacted with the veterans and their dependents at Record Office Indian Embassy (ROIE) in Kathmandu and appreciated the efforts of the defence wing that is working  to mitigate problems of the Nepal Domicile Gorkhas and their dependents.
The Army said that the visit was aimed at fortifying mutual relations between India and Nepal and fostering a spirit of camaraderie and mutual respect. “It also underlines our firm commitment to honouring our esteemed veterans and acknowledge their vital role in maintaining special relationships between both nations,” said the Army."

“File as many cases as you can against me. The BJP-RSS can’t intimidate me,” Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday as his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra resumed its journey in Assam’s Barpeta.
Earlier in the day, while addressing a gathering, Rahul Gandhi had hit out against Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, accusing him of spreading hate. “Assam’s CM spreads hate 24×7. He (Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma) is the most corrupt Chief Minister in the country… Whatever is told to you by the media is exactly what Assam CM has conveyed to them… The control of Assam’s Chief Minister is in the hands of Amit Shah… If he (Himanta Biswa Sarma) dares to say anything against Amit Shah, he will be kicked out of the party,” Gandhi said.
The scuffle in Tuesday happened when the yatra tried to enter Guwahati city on Tuesday. Several people were injured in the incident, including Congress’s Assam chief Bhupen Borah.
“With reference to wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Congress members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in a post on X. The FIR was filed under several IPC sections, including those dealing with criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and rioting.

When he did not return the day after, his father filed a missing persons complaint.
Police questioned one of the two friends, also a lawyer, and said that they found inconsistencies in his statements. The friend has now been detained as police suspect that he, along with the other friend, allegedly killed Lakshay after a fight in Panipat and threw his body in a canal. Police teams have been deployed in Delhi’s Rohini and Haryana’s Panipat to search the Munak Canal and locate the body.
The other friend, meanwhile, is said to be on the run. According to sources, Lakshay and his two friends – an advocate and a court clerk — left their houses between Sunday and Monday to attend the wedding. When Lakshay did not return the next day, and the day after, his father Yashpal Chauhan, the ACP (Operations) with the Delhi Police, lodged a missing persons report.
“Several searches were made around the wedding area and in Delhi but Lakshay wasn’t found. We then contacted one of his friends but he was giving different statements each time. We detained him for questioning and he later confessed to the crime,” said the source.
As per police, Lakshay’s friend, who is now a murder suspect, allegedly told the police that the men had a fight in Bhiwani after which they left for Panipat together. At Panipat, the fight escalated and the accused allegedly attacked Lakshay and threw him in the canal. It is not yet clear why the three men took a detour to Panipat. Police said multiple teams are looking for Lakshay’s body.
The second friend, a clerk, is said to be on the run.
Police said his family couldn’t be contacted either. The three men had been friends for years as they worked at the same court. Police are yet to register a murder case as they are still looking for the body. As of now, only a kidnapping case has been registered. The suspect lawyer, who has been detained, is being further interrogated about the motive and sequence of events. As per police, Lakshay’s friends left his body in the canal and fled to Delhi.
The Indian Express tried to reach ACP Yashpal but his friends said the officer doesn’t wish to comment on the matter. DCP (Outernorth) Ravi Kumar Singh said, “A missing report was filed on Tuesday night at 11.20 pm on the complaint of Yashpal Singh (ACP/Ops Outer North District) about his son Lakshay Chauhan being missing since Monday. During the inquiry, it was found that Lakshay was last seen at Karnal Bypass and later, it was found that he had gone to Haryana with two known people to attend some function. During the investigation, 3-4 suspected persons have been detained and are being interrogated. Further investigation is in progress to trace the abducted person.”"

A curative petition is the last recourse open to a petitioner after the Supreme Court dismisses a review petition. The curative petition is meant to ensure there is no miscarriage of justice or abuse of process. Such a petition is usually decided by judges in a chamber unless a specific request for an open-court hearing is allowed. After a five-day march from his village in Jalna district, Jarange-Patil and thousands of followers reached Pune on Wednesday.
Marathas, who have pursued agriculture-related activities, have always been a politically dominant community. Since Maharashtra’s formation in 1960, 12 of its 20 Chief Ministers, including incumbent Eknath Shinde, have been Marathas. But the division of land holdings and agrarian distress have, over the years, led to a decline in the prosperity of middle and lower-middle-class Marathas.
In 2018, the then Devendra Fadnavis government enacted the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, that granted Marathas 16% reservation in government jobs and education.
In June 2019, a Bombay High Court Division Bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharati Dangre upheld the SEBC Act but ruled that the 16% quota was not “justifiable”. It reduced the quota to 12% in education and 13% in government jobs, as recommended by the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC). The High Court also said that total reservations should not exceed 50%, except in “exceptional circumstances and extraordinary situations”.
The High Court verdict was challenged in the Supreme Court. A five-judge Constitution Bench of the SC led by Justice Ashok Bhushan on May 5, 2021, struck down the SEBC Act, 2018. The Bench said “no extraordinary circumstances were made out in granting” the “separate reservation… by exceeding the 50% ceiling limit of reservation … ” set by the 1992 Indra Sawhney (Mandal) judgment. Secondly, it raised questions about the empirical data submitted to prove Marathas’ social backwardness.
The Maharashtra government, then run by the Maha Vikas Aghadi, filed a review petition in the apex court. That was rejected in April 2023, following which a curative plea was filed.
The state government led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde believes guidance from the Supreme Court will be of immense help in providing a solution that is long-lasting and withstands legal and constitutional tests.
A senior minister who belongs to the BJP and is part of a sub-committee on the reservation issue said, “When the Supreme Court admitted the curative petition, it was a huge sigh of relief. Now, we have reasons to believe and hope the apex court will guide us on the vexed issue. Whatever lacuna exists in the Maratha reservation will be brought to our notice. It will give us a legitimate right to work on those and rectify our wrongs.”
Accordingly, the state government has initiated the process of furnishing empirical data to substantiate the backwardness of Marathas, beginning a caste survey on January 23. “We have deployed 1.5 lakh persons to conduct door-to-door surveys to ascertain ‘Kunbi’ caste,” Shinde has said. The Kunbi community is associated with agriculture-related occupations and is grouped under the OBC category. Giving Marathas Kunbi caste certificates will mean that Marathas will be counted as OBCs and get reservation benefits OBCs are eligible for.
A member of the sub-committee said, “The curative petition outcome is significant as it will give us a clear idea of how to proceed with reservation. If empirical data and backwardness are established and legally sustainable, it will be tantamount to giving Marathas reservation under the SEBC Act.”
OBC groups are opposed to Marathas getting quota benefits from the reservation pie allotted to them but many within the sub-committee believe the backward class groups will not be against granting separate reservation to Marathas through the SEBC Act.
The OBC Mahasangh has warned the state government of serious consequences if it agrees to Marathas reservation under the OBC category. “We will take our battle to every village and streets if the government includes Maratha reservation within the OBC category,” OBC Jan Morcha president Prakash Shendge has said.
But Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh general secretary Sambhaji Dahatonde Patil has said, “The OBC quota should be raised beyond 27% to 42%. This additional 15% quota can be used to accommodate Marathas within OBC.”
Maratha Kranti Morcha leader and petitioner Vinod Patil, commenting on curative petition, has said, “It is likely the apex court points to shortcomings in the reservation Act. Or it can reject the petition.” In the first scenario, the government will have to rectify the shortcomings to make the Act tenable. In the second, the government will have to go by the demand of Jarange-Patil, Patil observed.
The state government says it is not worried about the quota ceiling, pointing out that even now the total reservation in existence is 52%. With a 10% quota for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), it goes up to 62%. The ruling coalition has also pointed out there are nine other states that have already surpassed the 50% ceiling, reasoning that there is a provision in the Constitution that allows state governments to exceed the quota limit under “extraordinary circumstances”.
The government has emphasised it will not dilute the OBC quota and that the Maratha reservation will be separate and above the existing OBC quota. “Our government is committed to Maratha reservation. Under CM Shinde, we want reservation that will be lasting and withstand legal and constitutional validity. It is our resolve to ensure the OBC quota remains uncompromising. We will ensure the OBC quota remains intact,” Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis has said."

After leaving the night halt camp in Nagaon’s Rupahi around 8:25 am on Monday, the yatra started moving towards the Batadrava Than – until it came across barricades and police personnel. The Congress had announced earlier that its schedule for January 22 includes a morning visit to Batadrava Than in Nagaon district – the birthplace of revered Vaishnavite reformer-saint Srimanta Sankardeva and one of the most sacred sites for Assamese Vaishnavites.
Unable to move forward, the convoy led by Rahul stopped by the barricades. He sat on the ground surrounded by supporters, who sang ‘Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram’ in unison.
Around 9:30 am, Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi and Batadrava MLA Sibamoni Bora were allowed past the barricades to visit the Than.
According to AICC leader Jairam Ramesh, while the original plan was for Rahul to visit the Than, in the end only the two Assam leaders were permitted to go and that it was decided that the yatra would proceed after their return.

On Sunday, the president of the Than management committee had written to the Congress MLA from Batadrava constituency, telling her that Rahul would not be permitted to enter the premises before 3 pm on Monday since thousands of people were expected gather there in the morning because of the pran pratishtha at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya at that time.
Significantly, earlier in the day, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, while speaking to the media in Guwahati, had suggested that Rahul should visit the Batadrava Than after the programme in Ayodhya and not in the morning.
“It shouldn’t be like there is a competition between Ram Mandir and Batadrava… That is not good for Assam. So we request that we would like it if he goes to Batadrava Sattra after the Ram Mandir programme is done… There is no competition and he should not come and create the image of that competition,” he had said.
After Gogoi and Bora’s return, the yatra left Haiborgaon for the rest of its programme for the day.
Around 2 pm, a crowd wielding saffron flags stood in wait along the yatra’s route at Jagiroad in Morigaon district. The yatra is supposed to pass through this area to reach Jorabat on the Assam-Meghalaya border."

The Bose-Gandhi rivalry is frequently understood as the biggest dichotomy of the Indian nationalist movement, its narrative often picked up by parties now to futher their own agenda.
But was Bose really opposed to the Congress Party?
“Subhas Chandra Bose was a key member and a frontline leader of the Indian National Congress. He plunged into the anti-colonial movement under Gandhi’s leadership in 1921 and rose to be the president of the Congress in 1938 and 39,” reminded Sugato Bose, Professor of History at Harvard University. “There were certain differences of opinion with the Gandhian high command in 1939, but he remained true to the Congress ideal of freedom,” he added.
“Bose was a complex character,” explained historian Ramachandra Guha in an Indian Express Idea Exchange session. His complexity comes alive when one realises that despite his disagreement with the Congress leadership, when Bose took over the Indian National Army (INA), he constituted four regiments, three of which were named after Gandhi, Nehru and Maulana Azad. “He had profound respect for his colleagues,” said Guha. In 1943, while Gandhi was in jail, Bose on the former’s birthday gave a moving address over the Azad Hind Radio where he referred to Gandhi as ‘father of the nation’. As Guha noted, this was probably the first time this epithet was used for Gandhi, and soon it became ubiquitous.
Joining the Indian National Congress
On July 16, 1921, Bose had returned to Bombay from London where he had gone on his father’s insistence to prepare for the Indian Civil Services examination. Despite qualifying for the services he had refused to take up the opportunity. In a letter to brother Sarat Bose, in September, 1920, he wrote: “It is not possible to serve one’s country in the best and fullest manner if one is chained on to the civil service” — as reproduced by historian Leonard Gordon in his book, ‘Brothers Against the Raj: A Biography of Indian Nationalist Leaders Sarat and Subhas Chandra Bose’.
Such was Bose’s zeal to join the freedom struggle that on the very afternoon he arrived in India he went to meet Gandhi at Mani Bhawan. The main objective of his visit was to get from the leader of the campaign a clear idea of his plan of action. “I wanted to understand the Mahatma’s mind and purpose,” he had recollected later, as cited by historian Rudrangshu Mukherjee in his book, ‘Nehru and Bose: Parallel Lives’ (2014).
Mukherjee in his book narrated how Bose wanted to “know how the different aspects of the movement were going to culminate in the non-payment of taxes, the last stage of the campaign.” Secondly, he wanted to know how the non-payment of taxes would eventually force the British to leave and thirdly how Gandhi could promise Swaraj in one year. Bose was convinced by Gandhi’s response to the first question, but was rather unimpressed by his answers to the other two. “It appeared to him that for Gandhi, swaraj within one year was a question of faith. Gandhi left Subhas ‘depressed and disappointed’. Gandhi had failed to cast a spell on him,” wrote Mukherjee.
Mukherjee compared Bose’s relationship with Gandhi to that of Nehru, both leaders being of the same age of similar political leanings and often finding themselves frustrated by Gandhi’s commitment to non-violence. However, while Nehru was starry-eyed in his reverence for Gandhi, Bose though immensely respectful of Gandhi, found his political strategies to be ambiguous.
On Gandhi’s advice Bose moved to Calcutta, where he worked closely with the lawyer and Congress leader C R Das. Bose found Das to be inspirational in his leadership qualities. He was immersed in Congress work under his astute guidance. He was given the responsibility for publicity of the Bengal province Congress Committee and was appointed principal of the National College. He also began writing for the nationalist cause during this period. This was also the period when the non-cooperation movement began and Bose was thoroughly involved in it, directing and organising Congress volunteers in Calcutta.
In February 1922, Gandhi had unilaterally called off the non-cooperation movement on account of the outbreak of violence at Chauri Chaura. Both Bose and Nehru had been in prison at that time and both expressed disappointment and anger in knowing that the movement they had worked so hard for, had been forced to wind up.
Much has been made of the rivalry between Nehru and Bose, but on issues like Chauri Chaura and several others, they were in fact very closely aligned. Both were left-leaning radical men, unswerving in their commitment to ‘purna swaraj’ and to the forming of a socialist state in independent India. In their dedication to independence, they both were often at loggerheads with those within the Congress who were more attracted to the idea of holding office in the provincial governments.
“Gandhi’s withdrawal of both the non-cooperation and the civil disobedience movements exasperated the two radical young men. They were bewildered by his emphasis, at this critical phase of the national movement, on social uplift and spinning. They yearned to go forth into battle to confront British rule while Gandhi throughout the 1930s was reluctant to call a mass movement on the grounds that neither the Congress nor the people were prepared for it,” wrote Mukherjee. Despite their shared frustrations, they both reacted to the situation differently. Nehru yielded while Bose rebelled.
The political rivalry between Bose and Nehru developed only from the later 1930s, and were a product of their differing attitudes towards Gandhi and the nationalist movement as well as their opposing views towards Fascism and the Second World War.
As Congress president
In February 1938 Bose had taken over as president of the Congress and the next two years would be defining in creating his political profile as a Congressman and in drawing the rift with Gandhi and Nehru. At the Haripura session of the Congress, Bose made his presidential address, which is known to be the lengthiest and most important speech he ever made to the party. He made it clear that he stood for unqualified Swaraj.
However, it needs to be noted that nowhere in the speech did Bose suggest any criticism or deviation from Gandhi’s methods. He said, as cited in Mukherjee’s book, “I believe more than ever that the methods should be Satyagraha or non-violent non-cooperation in the widest sense of the term, including civil disobedience. It would not be correct to call our method passive resistance. Satyagraha, as I understand it, is not merely passive resistance but active resistance as well though that activity must be of a non-violent character.”
As president of the Congress, his first disagreement with Gandhi happened in December 1938 when Bose was eager to form a coalition government in Bengal along with the Krishak Praja Party. Gandhi’s letter to Bose sternly dictating him to stay away from including Congress in the Bengal ministry came as a rude shock to the latter. Bose was under the impression that Gandhi was on the same page as him with regards to the Bengal ministry.
The seeds of discord with Gandhi had been sown with this disagreement. In a curt reply to Gandhi, Bose madeit clear that if he did not change his decision he would have to carefully consider his position.
The following year, Bose was hopeful for re-election as Congress president. A second term was very rare and Gandhi was pretty much against the idea of re-electing Bose. The latter found support from the younger and left leaning members of the Congress and also from the literary giant Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore had personally written to Gandhi requesting a second term for Bose. “The prospect of a prolonged agony of humiliation for my province compels me at last to appeal to you with an earnest request that you may use your influence to offer Subhas (Bose) another chance for presidentship in the Congress,” he wrote as cited in Guha’s book, ‘Gandhi: The years that changed the world: 1914-1948’. Tagore was aware that Bose was regarded, not just by Gandhi, as hot-headed and temperamental, but assured in his letter to Gandhi that he would help Bose from his own vantage ground if he so desired.
Generally and ever since Gandhi’s emergence as the party’s preeminent leader, the president would be chosen by consensus. With Gandhi and Bose both sticking to their grounds on the matter of re-election, an election had to be organised by the All India Congress Committee (AICC). Bose won comfortably, getting the support of 1,580 AICC members, about 200 more than Pattabhi Sitaramayya, who was the preferred candidate of Gandhi.
Gandhi was at Bardoli when he heard of Bose’s re-election. In his statement he wrote: “I must confess that from the very beginning I was decidedly against his re-election for reasons which I need not go into. I do not subscribe to the facts or the arguments in his manifestos. I think that his references to his colleagues were unjustified and unworthy. Nevertheless, I am glad of his victory. And since I was instrumental in inducing Dr. Pattabhi not to withdraw his name as a candidate when Maulana Saheb withdrew, the defeat is more mine than his.”
Bose was aggrieved to know that Gandhi saw this as a ‘personal defeat’. Despite the differences he saw Gandhi with utmost respect as was evident from the responding statement he issued: “It will always be my aim and object to try and win his confidence for the simple reason that it will be a tragic thing for me if I succeed in winning the confidence of other people but fail to win the confidence of India’s greatest man.”
Even if Gandhi was open to compromise, his supporters were not. In response to Bose’s re-election several members of the Congress Working Committee resigned including Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad. Among the detractors, no one was more opposed to Bose than Patel.
Patel had an old rivalry with Bose, which was both personal and political. Their relationship had deteriorated rapidly with the death of Patel’s elder brother Vithalbhai in 1933. Bose had been very close to Vithalbhai and had nursed him during his last days. In his will, Vithalbhai had left a substantial portion of his property to Bose. Vallabhbhai had cast aspersions on the authenticity of the will and a long legal battle had followed culminating in the victory of Patel.
But the family history aside, Patel was also staunchly against Bose’s strategy of militant socialism. “Bose wanted to bring the peasants and workers into the nationalist movement, while Patel believed in class conciliation and wanted to work with the landlords and the industrialists,” said Sugata Bose.
On several occasions in the following months, Bose wrote to Gandhi, urging him to take a more adversarial stance towards the British Raj and help in the reconciliation of the party that had been split apart ever since his re-election. Gandhi remained unmoved in his position. In a letter to Bose written in March 1939, he said: “I smell violence in the air I breathe. But the violence has put on a subtle form. Our mutual distrust is a bad form of violence. The widening gulf points to the same thing.”
On April 29, 1939 Bose resigned from his post as president of the Congress Party. In a statement to the press, he mentioned the efforts he had made to find a common ground with Gandhi. “These having failed, he felt his presidency may be a sort of obstacle or handicap in the path of the Congress as it sought to reconcile its two wings,” wrote Guha in his book.
Life after leaving Congress
In September 1939 German tanks invaded Poland, marking the beginning of the Second World War. The war was to have a most significant impact in the history of modern India. The difference in the attitude towards the war would be the final straw in the embittering relationship between Bose and the Congress leadership, particularly Nehru.
Bose was a special invitee in the three-day meeting of the Congress Working Committee from September 9 to decide India’s position on the war. For Bose, the war served as a golden opportunity for India to launch a civil disobedience movement in order to win independence. The resolution put forward by the CWC on the other hand reflected the views of Nehru who had drafted it. The resolution asked the British government to clarify its position on the war with regard to imperialism and democracy and till such time postponed the decision of the Congress on the matter. For Bose the stance taken by the resolution was completely unacceptable. He suggested, as noted by Mukherjee in his book, that the resolution was “long-winded” amounting to nothing but mere words.
Nehru had nothing but hatred towards Fascism and Nazism and sought for some concessions from the British government to fight Mussolini and Hitler. Bose was critical of the position of compromise taken by the Congress. He wrote in the strongest language possible that the resolution of the CWC read as “we shall continue to lick the feet of the British government even though we have been kicked by them.” Bose’s consistent outbursts with regard to the Congress’ position angered Nehru. In a letter to V K Krishna Menon he wrote, “Subhas Bose is going to pieces and has definitely ranged himself against the Congress.”
In his exasperation, Bose was seeking an alternative leadership to that of the Congress. In March 1940 he organised the All India Anti Compromise Conference in Ramgarh. He urged his audience to act while before it was too late. “He presented the examples of Lenin and Mussolini as leaders who seized the moment in history and provided decisive leadership to their countries. He ended the speech with ‘Inquilab zindabad’, a sign off that would soon become his trademark,” wrote Mukherjee.
Having failed to convince the Congress to go into civil disobedience, Bose organised mass protests in Calcutta for the removal of the Holwell monument that stood in Dalhousie Square as a memorial to those who died in the Black Hole of Calcutta. He was arrested by the British government for the protests, but was released soon after he went into a seven-day hunger strike.
Bose’s arrest and the subsequent release set the scene for him to escape to Germany via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. When Bose sought the support of the Nazi governement in Germany, he found himself ideologically at the farthest end to Nehru’s views on the matter. Writing about Bose’s position on Nazism Mukherjee said, “Subhas had from his youth a fascination for things military, and this may be one factor that attracted him to militaristic regimes.”
Despite the many differences, political experts have maintained that Nehru and Bose shared a close personal relationship, as was evident in the way Bose named the brigades in the INA. “If you look at the period when Netaji was in Europe, he was the one who accompanied Kamala Nehru to the sanatorium while Nehru was in India. He was also present at Kamala Nehru’s funeral,” said Sugato Bose, also grand-nephew of Bose. “Nehru would also always be a guest to Sarat Bose, my grandfather, whenever he visited Calcutta.”
It is also worth noting that at the end of the Second World War, Nehru put on his barrister’s gown and joined the defense team for the INA prisoners at the time of the Red Fort trials. In the several speeches of Nehru after Bose’s death, the former referred to Netaji in the most affectionate way. In January 1946, for instance, speaking on Bose’s birth anniversary, he said, “Subhas Bose and I were co-workers in the struggle for freedom for 25 years… Our relations with each other were marked by great affection. I used to treat him as my younger brother. It is an open secret that at times there were differences between us on political questions. But I never for a moment doubted that he was a brave soldier in the struggle for freedom” — as quoted in Mukherjee’s book.
Sugata Bose said that “in August 1947, in his first speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Nehru mentioned only two people by name and they were Gandhi and Bose. It was quite a warm reference.”
Bose on his part too had on several occasions displayed his reverence and affection for the Congress leadership. In his address from Bangkok on the Azad Hind Radio in October 1943, he reminded his Indian listeners that this was the birthday of “their greatest leader, Mahatma Gandhi”. In his address he reiterated Gandhi’s contribution to the freedom movement. “‘The service that Mahatma Gandhi has rendered to India and to the cause of India’s freedom,’” said Bose, ‘is so unique and unparalleled that his name will be written in letters of gold in our national history for all time,’” wrote Guha. “The task that Mahatma Gandhi began has, therefore, to be completed by his countrymen- at home and abroad,” said Bose as he ended his speech.

With this, the Ambardi Safari Park becomes the third facility in the state where wolves have been released in soft-release facilities as part of the state government’s plan to restock the population of wolves in the wild.
The Minister opened the door of a quarantine room and released the wolves into two soft-release enclosures within Ambardi Safari Park near Dhari. “The objective of the soft release is to reintroduce wolves in the greater Gir area,” a press release said, adding, “They will be taught skills necessary for surviving in the forest and then will be released in the wild in a phased manner.”
With this, the Ambardi Safari Park, which is a microcosm of Gir forest, becomes the third soft-release facility in Gujarat to host wolves. The other two facilities have been set up in Nadabet in Banaskantha and Gir Interpretation Zone (GIZ), Devaliya in Gir (west) Wildlife Division. The GIZ is popularly known as Devaliya Safari Park.
Aradhna Sahu, Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) of Junagadh Wildlife Circle, said that the wolves released in the soft-release facility in Ambardi have been bred at the wolf breeding centre in Sakkar Baug Zoo in Junagadh city. “They were brought to Ambardi around three months ago. After they successfully acclimatised in a quarantine facility, the honourable minister released them in soft-release enclosures today,” Sahu told The Indian Express. Rajdeepsinh Zala, Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF) of Gir (East), said that among the six wolves, four are females and two males.
“They will be kept in two packs of three animals each. The two packs will be kept in separate enclosures and trained for life in the wild,” Zala said, adding the enclosures were already there. The release said that wolves play a key role in controlling the population of wild ungulates like blue bulls (nilgais) and wild boars. “They have proven to be the best friends of farmers,” added the release.
The CCF said that wolves sent to Devaliya Safari Park too have completed their quarantine period. “The ultimate objective of conservation breeding is to release animals bred in conservation breeding facilities into the wild,” said Sahu."
446EJ6F4A2_HFYS8DE98BAKNGW,Israel-Gaza conflict: ICJ to rule on South Africa’s case today; Israeli military focuses attacks on Khan Younis,_,"January 26, 2024 10:55 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/israel-gaza-war-icj-verdict-khan-younis-attack-9128504/,"UN judges in The Hague will rule on Friday whether to order Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza as officials push ahead with efforts to negotiate a new deal for a ceasefire and release of more Israeli hostages.
On the ground in the seaside enclave, Gaza officials said on Thursday that Israeli strikes killed 20 Palestinians queuing for food aid in Gaza City, six people in a house in central Gaza’s Al-Nusseirat refugee camp and at least 50 people in the prior 24 hours in Gaza’s main southern city Khan Younis, where Israel is currently focusing the brunt of its might. Reuters could not independently verify the details while Israel said it was either looking into the reports or did not immediately comment on the incidents.
The judges of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also called the World Court, are due to rule on Friday on South Africa’s request for emergency measures against Israel in a case accusing it of state-led genocide in the Gaza Strip.
In more than three months of war, Israel’s campaign has levelled much of the enclave, displaced some 1.9 million Palestinians and killed at least 25,900 people, according to Gaza officials. Israel launched its offensive in October after militants from Hamas, which rules Gaza, stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages.
The court will issue its ruling at 1 pm (1200 GMT, 5.30 pm IST) in a hearing expected to last about an hour. While the judges will not rule on the merits of the genocide allegations, which may take years to decide, South Africa asked the court to issue an interim order compelling Israel to suspend its military operations.
Israel has called South Africa’s allegations false and “grossly distorted,” and said it makes the utmost efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza. The court’s rulings are final and without appeal, but it has no way of enforcing them. Israel on Thursday expressed confidence that the ICJ would “throw out these spurious and specious charges.” Hamas said it would abide by an ICJ ceasefire order if Israel reciprocates.
Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to negotiate a break in the conflict continued. US and Israeli intelligence chiefs were due to meet Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe this weekend, one official told Reuters. A second source said Egypt’s intelligence chief would also participate.
The White House has been trying to facilitate the release of the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages taken during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which ignited the war in Gaza, although there remains a considerable distance between the two sides’ demands.
A third source with knowledge of the talks said that Israel has proposed a 60-day pause in the fighting during which hostages would be released in phases, beginning with civilian women and children.
Previously, three sources told Reuters that shuttle diplomacy over the past month involving the US, Qatar and Egypt has sought to hammer out a new deal for a ceasefire of about one month. But progress has been held up by differences between Hamas and Israel over how to bring a permanent end to the Gaza war.
In Gaza on Thursday, tanks hit areas around two hospitals in Khan Younis, forcing displaced people into a new desperate scramble for safety, residents said.
Israel’s military said early on Friday that its intelligence found that Hamas was operating from inside and around the two hospitals, Nasser and Al-Amal, in Khan Younis. Hamas and medical workers have denied Israeli claims that militants in Gaza use hospitals as cover for bases.
The Israeli military said it was coordinating with hospital staff to ensure they remain “operational and accessible” and there is a safe corridor for people to leave the hospitals. “The facts on the ground disprove the blatant misinformation that has been disseminated over the last 72 hours falsely claiming that the hospitals are under siege or attack,” it said in a statement.
On Thursday, thousands of homeless people sheltering in Khan Younis sought to flee to Rafah, 15 km away, the UN relief agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) said.
Video posted on X by Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, showed a crowd of people walking en masse on Thursday on a dirt road. “A sea of people forced to flee Khan Younis, ending up at the border with Egypt. A never ending search for safety that #Gaza is no longer able to give”, Lazzarini wrote.

The diorama for Karnataka shows the tech-savvy Bengaluru airport perched upon the iconic Vidhana Soudha building. A statue of Kempe Gowda I, the Vijayanagara empire chieftain who founded and developed Bengaluru, is in front of the tableau.
The Himachal Pradesh tableau showcases the unique Kullu Dussehra festival. The description board informs that the festival dates back to the 17th Century when an idol of Raghunath (another name for Ram) was brought from Ayodhya on a throne and made the presiding deity of Kullu by local ruler Raja Jagat Singh. Bordered with Kullu’s famous knit-patterned border, the tableau has a wooden chariot with replicas of the deity and its consort adorned with bright red and yellow cloth.
While Assam showcased its tea cultivation and processing, the Jammu and Kashmir tableau advertises the state’s handicraft industry and saffron cultivation.
Notably, Uttarakhand’s tableau displays the “first village of India”, Mana, located approximately 26 km from the Indo-Tibet border. It also displays the state’s first Vande Bharat train connecting Delhi to Dehradun.
Goa’s tableau showcases its exotic marine life and the Yog Setu. Interestingly, the tableau has a statue of Parashurama in front of it, highlighting the folktale that the state was created after the sage threw his axe into the Arabian Sea, causing the waters to recede and reveal what we know today as the Konkan coast.
This year, 26 central ministries and departments are also showcasing citizen-centric schemes and initiatives of the government such as Mission Life; One District One Product; Viksit Bharat; Nari Shakti; Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.

In a series of posts on X, Sitharaman said, “Inside the famous Kamakshi Kovil, which is privately held, where bhajans have started from 08:00hrs, LED screens are being removed with plain-clothed policemen.

She said that in the Kancheepuram district alone, 466 LED screens were arranged for the live telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ayodhya and in more than 400 of those places, the police have either confiscated the screens or deployed force to prevent the live telecast.
“LED suppliers are fleeing with fear. The Anti-Hindu DMK is hitting at small businesses. In Tamil this is called ‘Vayathile Adipathu’,” she wrote.
On Sunday, a war of words had erupted between the Tamil Nadu Government and Nirmala Sitharaman after she alleged people in the state were not being allowed to organise events related to the Ram Temple consecration. Sitharaman had also alleged the temples under the Tamil Nadu government have barred puja for Lord Ram on the day of the consecration of the temple.
The charges were denied by state Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) Minister P K Sekar Babu. In a statement on Sunday, Babu said they haven’t imposed any limitations on devotees’ freedom to offer food, conduct pujas in the name of Lord Ram, or provide prasad in Tamil Nadu temples.
Sekar Babu said he strongly condemns the spreading of false information in an attempt to divert the people’s attention from the DMK Youth Conference in Salem. “It is unfortunate that people in office, like Union Finance Minister Mrs Nirmala Sitharaman and others, are purposefully propagating this erroneous information,” he added.
While no Government Order has been issued disallowing holding any programme related to the event, confusion prevailed among devotees and the officials of temples managed by the HR and CE Department.
After a couple of videos and images of the order purportedly issued by the local district administrations emerged, the police in a few districts denied permission for the organisers to set up LED screens inside the temple premises to stream the event."

How did the Indian National Army (INA) help India to gain independence—but not on the battlefield?
Why does India celebrate Republic Day on January 26? How did India observe its first Republic Day?
Introduction
— The introduction of the answer is essential and should be restricted to 3-5 lines. Remember, a one-liner is not a standard introduction.
— It may consist of basic information by giving some definitions from the trusted source and authentic facts.
Body
— It is the central part of the answer and one should understand the demand of the question to provide rich content.
— The answer must be preferably written as a mix of points and short paragraphs rather than using long paragraphs or just points.
— Using facts from authentic government sources makes your answer more comprehensive. Analysis is important based on the demand of the question, but do not over analyse.
— Underlining keywords gives you an edge over other candidates and enhances presentation of the answer.
— Using flowcharts/tree-diagram in the answers saves much time and boosts your score. However, it should be used logically and only where it is required.
Way forward/ conclusion
— The ending of the answer should be on a positive note and it should have a forward-looking approach. However, if you feel that an important problem must be highlighted, you may add it in your conclusion. Try not to repeat any point from body or introduction.
— You may use the findings of reports or surveys conducted at national and international levels, quotes etc. in your answers.
Self Evaluation
— It is the most important part of our Mains answer writing practice. UPSC Essentials will provide some guiding points or ideas as a thought process that will help you to evaluate your answers.
QUESTION 1: How did the Indian National Army (INA) help India to gain independence—but not on the battlefield?
Introduction:
— The Indian National Army was formed on February 17, 1942, two days after the British surrendered to Japanese forces in Singapore.
— It primarily consisted of Indian prisoners of war (PoWs) seized by the Japanese during their Southeast Asia campaign. The Japanese believed that a native Indian force would be an effective weapon in their intended takeover of India.
— However, the army was in disarray, lacking vision and leadership. Bose arrived in Singapore in July 1943, having courted both the Nazis and the Japanese for assistance in India’s independence campaign. On July 4, he assumed command of the INA’s 12,000-strong force.
Body:
You may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer:
— Over the next six months, he would pull off a public relations coup, gaining support — both material and human — from the Indian diaspora in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.
— The INA soon expanded to more than 40,000 members, and many Indians contributed their life savings to the cause.
— Bose had hoped for a large-scale insurrection within the country to supplement the INA’s offensive on the border. “When the British government is thus attacked from both sides — from inside India and from outside — it will collapse, and the Indian people will then regain their liberty,” he declared in a speech delivered on July 9, 1943.
— After being unable to take Imphal and Kohima, the supply starved INA, along with its Japanese allies, was forced to retreat, all while suffering heavy losses due to the enemy’s air superiority and gunpowder, as well as starvation and disease.
— By 1945, the British had launched their own campaign to retake Burma, and the INA once again found itself in retreat.
— After the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered on August 15.
— Bose wanted to stay with his troops for the surrender, but was persuaded to leave by his subordinates.

QUESTION 2: Why does India celebrate Republic Day on January 26? How did India observe its first Republic Day?
Introduction:
— French President Emmanuel Macron is India’s chief guest on the 75th Republic Day today (January 26). Since 1950, January 26 has been the day India’s Constitution went into effect.
— However, the Constitution was prepared way before the chosen date, adopted officially by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949.
— On January 26,1930, the historic “Poorna Swaraj” declaration was officially promulgated, beginning the final phase of India’s freedom struggle where the goal would be complete independence from British rule.
— The Lahore Session of the INC met in December 1929. On December 19, the historic “Poorna Swaraj” resolution was passed by the conference. The resolution, which means “total self-rule/sovereignty,” stated that the British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom, but has also based itself on mass exploitation, destroying India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually.”
— This declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on January 26, 1930.
— The Indian tricolour was hoisted across the country by Congress party workers and patriotic songs were sung as the country reconfigured its strategy for Independence.
— From 1930 till India finally won its independence in 1947, January 26 was celebrated as “Independence Day” or “Poorna Swaraj Day” with Indians reaffirming their commitment towards sovereignty on that day.
Body:
You may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer:
How did India observe its first Republic Day?
— Although British sovereignty in India ended on August 15, 1947, India had not severed all links with the Empire. For more than two years after independence, India remained a British dominion, regulated under the 1935 Government of India Act and still owed allegiance to the Crown.
— All of this changed on January 26, 1950. On that day, India’s freshly drafted Constitution took effect, replacing the 1935 Act as the country’s highest governing document. Dr. Rajendra Prasad began his first tenure as President of India, succeeding the British queen as the ceremonial head of state.
— Military parades are symbols of sovereign power and prestige. During the British Raj, royal parades and processions were commonplace, displaying colonial power to Indians and the globe.
— The new nation decided to continue this tradition—and reclaim it for Indians. Thus, since 1950, Republic Day celebrations have been highlighted by a military parade in New Delhi, which has grown in size and splendour over time.
— The 1950 parade was held in the Irwin Ampitheatre opposite the Purana Qila, now known as the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium. President Dr Rajendra Prasad inspected the parade, and Indonesia President Sukarno was the chief guest.

4B4XSZ7JLY_10G94K6PVTCXFS5,Wall Street Journal reporter jailed in Russia loses appeal; to stay in jail through March,_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 15:48 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-gershkovich-us-russia-court-appeal-9129097/,"A court in Moscow extended the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested on espionage charges, until the end of March, Russian news agencies reported on Friday.
United States Consul General Stuart Wilson attended the hearing, which took place behind closed doors because authorities say details of the criminal case against the American journalist are classified.
In video shared by state news agency Ria Novosti, Gershkovich was shown listening to the ruling, standing in a court cage wearing a hooded top and light blue jeans. He was pictured a short time later walking towards a prison van to leave the court.
Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March while on a reporting trip to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Moscow. Russia’s Federal Security Service alleged that the reporter, “acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex”.
Gershkovich and the Journal deny the allegations, and the US government has declared him to be wrongfully detained. Russian authorities haven’t detailed any evidence to support the espionage charges.
During his end-of-year news conference in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is in dialogue with the United States on bringing home both Gershkovich and jailed American Paul Whelan, and that the Kremlin hopes to “find a solution” even though “it’s not easy.” Putin was replying to a question about an offer the Biden administration made to secure the two men’s release. The US State Department reported it in December, without offering details, and said Russia rejected it.
“We have contacts on this matter with our American partners, there’s a dialogue on this issue. It’s not easy, I won’t go into details right now. But in general, it seems to me that we’re speaking a language each of us understands,” Putin said.
“I hope we will find a solution,” he continued. “But, I repeat, the American side must hear us and make a decision that will satisfy the Russian side as well.” The Russian Foreign Ministry has said it will consider a swap for Gershkovich only after a verdict in his trial. In Russia, espionage trials can last for more than a year. Gershkovich is the first American reporter to be charged with espionage in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for US News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Gershkovich is being held at Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, notorious for its harsh conditions.
Analysts have said that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips after US-Russian tensions soared when Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At least two US citizens arrested in Russia in recent years, including WNBA star Brittney Griner, have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the US."
4CWNJE4BBC_NNJ6KEXJGFRRBE1,"INDIA hits Bengal wall: Mamata says no talks, will fight Lok Sabha polls alone",Ravik Bhattacharya,"Updated: January 25, 2024 07:48 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/mamata-banerjee-will-fight-alone-in-bengal-lok-sabha-polls-india-alliance-9125278/,"The sputtering India bloc took a damaging hit on Wednesday as two partners said they were calling off seat-sharing talks. While seat discussions in both West Bengal and Punjab were expected to be tricky, the timing and wording of the declaration by the Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party — days after the BJP’s Ram Temple crowning moment, and putting the onus on the Congress — will hurt the coalition.
In her statement, TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said no talks were on with the Congress, her party would contest the coming Lok Sabha polls alone, and that the issue of a national alliance would be decided only after the elections.
“Amar kono kotha hoyni, amar karoro songe kotha hoyni. Kono charcha nei. Mithe kotha (I have had no talks, no talks with anyone… no talks at all. It’s all lies). Absolutely wrong,” Banerjee said, while adding that the non-Congress regional parties were holding together.
Soon after Banerjee’s statement, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann said the AAP will not have an alliance with Congress in the state, and will contest all 13 seats on its own. “Desh mein Punjab banega hero, Aam Aadmi Party 13-0 (Punjab will be the country’s hero. AAP will win 13-0),” Mann said.
In her remarks, coming a day before Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra enters Bengal, Banerjee underlined that the Congress had declined her offer of 2 seats in the state. “My initial proposal has already been rejected by them. Then our party took a decision that we will fight alone in Bengal. We are a part of the INDIA alliance. They are doing a rally (Yatra) here… Even as a matter of courtesy, did they even once inform us, say, ‘Didi, I am coming to your state’. I have no relations with the Congress as regards Bengal.”
“All India ki korbo, na korbo after election bhabbo (Nationally, what we will do, not do, we will think after the elections). We are a secular party, we will do what is needed to thwart the BJP. But right now there are no discussions (on seat-sharing),” Banerjee said.
The INDIA alliance did not involve just one party, she said. “Regional parties will stay together as one. We have said that the Congress can fight 300 seats and the regional parties will fight in the rest. The Congress should not interfere there. But if it does, we will see what is to be done.”
Mann said that the Lok Sabha candidates in Punjab will be chosen on winnability. “We have got a list of 40 probables, out of which 13 will be selected. We will get them surveyed.”
The CM’s statement came as a surprise as lately he had been giving indications of softening his stance on the issue, hinting that the high command would make the final decision on an alliance with the Congress. On January 1, in a show of support for the INDIA bloc, he said, “We are fighting for the country. If the Constitution is saved, then the country will be saved. If the Constitution is saved, then parties will be protected.”
Recently, in another positive sign, the AAP and Congress came together for the mayoral elections to the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, which were put off at the last minute as the presiding officer claimed to have taken ill. Soon after the tie-up, AAP MP Raghav Chadha, the party in-charge of Punjab, said it marked the beginning of electoral cooperation within the INDIA bloc.
However, the Punjab Congress unit never reconciled to any tie-up with the AAP, accusing the Mann government of unleashing a “vendetta” against its leaders. Recently, the Congress began meetings in different constituencies of Punjab reportedly for a feedback on an alliance with the AAP, after which its Punjab in-charge Devender Yadav is learnt to have conveyed to the party high command that the state unit was strictly opposed to any alliance.
Mann’s statement came three days after he went to Delhi for a meeting with AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak and Chadha, along with other leaders.
Of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab, the AAP currently holds 1, while the Congress has 6.
Banerjee’s statement came a day after Rahul, speaking to mediapersons in Assam on the sidelines of his Yatra, said that he shared a cordial relationship with her, that seat talks with the TMC were on, and that any differences were minor tiffs which could be easily solved."
4ERMP25U65_H9R19J0K8BMYRKM,Govt to BSF: Hold promotion panels’ meet by Jan-end,Mahender Singh Manral,"Updated: January 23, 2024 08:47 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-to-bsf-hold-promotion-panels-meet-by-jan-end-9122748/,"The Border Security Force (BSF) has not yet conducted meetings for 24 departmental promotion committees (DPCs) for the 2024 vacancies — a serious violation to the rules — said the Ministry of Home Affairs, and asked its BSF director-general to complete the process by the end of this month.
In a communication to the DG-BSF earlier this month, a under secretary rank MHA officer said that all the DPCs’ meetings for the 2024 vacancy — according to the Department of Personnel & Training (DOP&T) calendar — should have been conducted between May and October last year, with the select panel ready by December 31, 2023.
“Even though, the BSF was allowed to complete all the DPCs’ meetings for 2024 by December 31 last year, it has been observed that the BSF is yet to conduct 24 DPCs of various cadres for the 2024 vacancy, which is a serious violation of DOP&T instructions and directions issued by the MHA,” states the letter.
The regular promotion of government employees is generally decided based on recommendations made by the DPCs. Functions such as the conduct of DPCs for promotions, cadre clearance for deputations, acceptance of resignations, voluntary retirements, and disciplinary powers are conducted by the respective ministries or departments as the grades of assistant section officer and section officer are concerned.
A task force — earlier formed by the MHA to look into suicide and fratricide cases in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) — had flagged several reasons to be slow promotions, continuous posting in conflict theatres, and little opportunity for growth and development.
In the communication, the MHA has directed the DG-BSF — following the competent’s authority orders — “to complete or finalise all 24 DPCs’ meetings this month and furnish compliance reports. “Besides, the MHA has also asked to depute the officer concerned to discuss the pending DPCs’ meetings in the ministry,” says the letter.
According to the MHA data, 46,930 personnel from the five Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), BSF, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), and Assam Rifles took up the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) from 2019 to 2023 — with the maximum being from the BSF at 21,860. “Till March 2023, there was a shortage of 79,960 vacancies of different posts in CAPFs and Assam Rifles, and the recruitment process was underway at various stages. Around 36,521 personnel were recruited then,” said an official, requesting anonymity."

Khan, who reached the Assembly at around 9 am, concluded the policy address before 9.02 am and left the House by 9.04 am.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted outside the House by Speaker A N Shamseer, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Parliamentary Affairs Minister K Radhakrishnan with bouquets.
Khan began the customary policy address by greeting everyone in the House and then said, “I will now read the last para.” Reading out the last of the 136 paragraphs of the 62-page policy address, the Governor said, “Let us remember that our greatest legacy lies not in buildings or monuments, but in the respect and regard we show to the priceless legacy of the Constitution of India and the timeless values of democracy, secularism, federalism and social justice.” He further said that the essence of cooperative federalism is what has kept India united and strong all these years and it was everyone’s bounden duty to ensure that this essence is not diluted.
“The essence of cooperative federalism is what has kept our country united and strong all these years. It is our bounden duty to ensure that this essence is not diluted.
“Together as part of this varied and beautiful nation we will weave the tapestry of inclusive growth and responsible resilience, overcoming all the challenges that are thrown our way,” he said, concluding his address, and sat down in the seat marked for him on the dais.
Thereafter, the national anthem was played and after it ended, Khan walked out of the Assembly, the entire exercise taking just under 5 minutes.
Khan and the Left government have been at loggerheads over several issues, primarily about the functioning of universities in the state and his non-signing of certain bills passed by the Assembly.
It also resulted in his facing widespread protests across the state from the CPI(M), its youth wing — Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) — and its student outfit — Students Federation of India (SFI)."

The safari will be the first of its kind anywhere in the world, and the Chief Minister invited tourists to see “the rare and majestic” melanistic tiger species “found only in Odisha”.
The state government’s plan has received in-principle approval from the technical committee of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the national body for the conservation of the big cat. As of now, the safari is likely to be ready for visitors by October this year.
Glad to announce that #Odisha is setting up an exclusive Melanistic Tiger Safari near Similipal Tiger Reserve in #Mayurbhanj. Tourists and visitors can now have a glimpse of the rare and majestic species found only in Odisha. pic.twitter.com/h3g2ep8tui

Melanism is a genetic condition in which an increased production of melanin, a substance in the skin that produces hair, eye, and skin pigmentation, results in black (or nearly black) skin, feathers, or hair in an animal.
Many royal Bengal tigers of Similipal belong to a unique lineage with higher-than-normal levels of melanin, which gives them black and yellow interspersed stripes on their coats. These tigers are not entirely black, and are therefore more accurately described as being pseudo-melanistic.
The STR, which sprawls over 2,750 square km in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district adjoining Jharkhand and West Bengal, is Asia’s second largest biosphere, and the country’s only wild habitat for melanistic royal Bengal tigers.
According to research co-authored by Uma Ramakrishnan and her student Vinay Sagar from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NBCS), Bengaluru, a single mutation in the gene Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) causes black tigers to develop stripes that seem to have broadened or spread into the tawny background.
Genetic analyses of other tiger populations in India and computer simulations suggest that the Similipal black tigers may have arisen from a very small founding population of tigers, and are inbred. The STR cats live isolated from other tigers, because of which they breed among themselves.
“Approximately 37% of tigers… in the Similipal Tiger Reserve are pseudomelanistic, characterized by wide, merged stripes. Camera trap data across the tiger range revealed the presence of pseudomelanistic tigers only in Similipal,” the researchers wrote. (‘High frequency of an otherwise rare phenotype in a small and isolated tiger population’; Sagar, Ramakrishnan, and others: PNAS, Sept 2021)
The researchers examined the “role of drift in driving this phenotype’s frequency”. They concluded that “pseudomelanism cosegregates with a…coding alteration in…Taqpep, a gene responsible for similar traits in other felid species”.
Sampling revealed a high frequency of the mutation in Similipal, and absence in all other tiger populations (395 individuals). “Population genetic analyses confirmed few (minimal number) tigers in Similipal, and its genetic isolation, with poor geneflow,” the researchers said.
“Melanistic tigers have been recorded only in the Similipal Tiger Reserve in Odisha. As per the 2022 cycle of the All India Tiger Estimation, 16 individuals were recorded at Similipal Tiger Reserve, out of which 10 were melanistic,” Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change Ashwini Kumar Choubey told Rajya Sabha on December 21, 2023.
Was extremely fortunate to sight T18 with its pseudo melanistic cub. T18 has 2 cubs, one normal one melanistic. Father is Normal too. Below are camera trapped pictures from the same grid. Each grid covers around 2sq km of area & is coming up with rich data to analyse😊 pic.twitter.com/24y2Y8bo53

The state government’s ongoing tiger survey, however, suggests that the number of royal Bengal tigers in STR is more than what has been mentioned in the NTCA report. The state government’s report will be released soon.
Susanta Nanda, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Odisha, said around 200 hectares of land along the Dhanbad-Balasore National Highway-18 has been identified for the proposed safari. The site is about 15 km from the STR, and its landscape matches that of Simlipal.
About 100 hectares will be the display area of the park, and the rest will be used to build veterinary care facilities, including a rescue centre, staff infrastructure, and visitors’ amenities. Initially, three melanistic tigers from the Nandankanan zoo north of Bhubaneswar, and rescued/ orphaned tigers who are not fit for wild but fit for display, will be housed in the safari in an open enclosure.
The safari aims to allow wildlife conservationists, researchers, and enthusiasts to see the rare big cats from up close, and to create awareness about the need for their conservation. The sighting of tigers is difficult in STR because of its vast area, and the safari has been proposed as an added attraction for visitors to Similipal.
An NTCA committee will visit the proposed site to carry out a feasibility study before final clearance is given to the project. The state government will also have to obtain other statutory clearances, including approval from the Central Zoo Authority, a body under the Environment Ministry that has oversight over zoos in the country."
4PEBBBB8O3_45HLZQARGJDDOF1,"Facebook, Instagram may lose legal immunity over fake loan apps advertisements",Soumyarendra Barik,"Updated: January 24, 2024 15:25 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/facebook-instagram-may-lose-legal-immunity-over-fake-loan-apps-advertisements-9124589/,"The Centre is considering legislative measures to prevent social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Instagram from hosting advertisements of fraudulent loan apps as it looks to curb the distribution of such apps on the Internet, a top government official said Tuesday.
“We will amend the existing Information Technology Rules to prohibit intermediaries from hosting advertisements of fake loan apps,” Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar told reporters. Once the changes are in place, platforms could risk losing their legal immunity for hosting such advertisements. However, the amendments may not come into force before the General Elections later this year.
Online companies like Facebook and Instagram have become an important way for fraudsters to distribute dubious loan apps to users as these platforms allow them to market such apps, for a fee, and only take them down once they are flagged by users.
The Indian Express – in a two-part investigation published on November 20-21 last year – had reported how dubious loan apps advertise on Instagram and Facebook, and, despite whatever filters the platforms claim to use, many such apps, including those red-flagged by the government, continue to offer their services.
Last month, the IT Ministry had issued an advisory to social media platforms to take “additional measures” to ensure that they don’t host advertisements of fraudulent loan apps, warning that the “consequences” will be the “sole responsibility” of such intermediaries/ platforms.
“The IT Ministry has been discussing the issue for several months with the Reserve Bank of India, but we have recently intensified our effort to find a solution to this problem,” Chandrasekhar had said at the time of issuing the advisory. However, since an advisory is not legally binding, the government is moving to take concrete legislative action to force the platforms to increase their due diligence before they accept such advertisements.
Over the years, fraudulent firms have mushroomed on the back of rapid growth in digital lending. While there are no official estimates, industry players said the illegal lending market could be at least $700-800 million. The Indian Express has reported around a dozen cases since 2020, where some of those caught in the trap of illegal loan apps had allegedly died by suicide.
As part of a months’ long investigation into dubious loan apps, this paper had spoken to a range of stakeholders including borrowers, fintech intermediaries, government functionaries, big tech companies and former RBI officials.
A number of victims caught in the crosshairs of these apps pointed towards a common narrative: In the absence of any government and regulatory norms, online platforms carry out little due diligence, letting fraudsters openly advertise predatory loan apps. At the time, the Reserve Bank of India didn’t have a white list of registered loan apps, or even a negative list which is updated, despite the government’s assurances.
Earlier this month RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the regulator has shared a whitelist of lending apps with the Centre.
A senior IT Ministry official had earlier confirmed that the RBI had sent a list of “valid” lending apps. “The RBI has been working on a list of valid lending apps for a while, but has sent us a new list of loan apps that are being used by registered entities like banks and NBFCs after your report came out. We will take action accordingly,” the official had said.
The IT Ministry is also considering outlawing platforming deepfakes – misleading content generated through artificial intelligence – on the Internet as part of the overall amendments to the IT Rules. It could also introduce norms for regulating bias in the algorithms that online companies deploy on their platforms."
4RN5AMX6LU_WZT7YZMVIPZJFR4,Ram Temple and popular belief: What early European travellers wrote about Ayodhya,Vikas Pathak,"January 22, 2024 11:47 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/ram-temple-early-european-travellers-beliefs-9121190/,"Early accounts of European travellers cited by the Supreme Court in its 2019 Ayodhya title suit judgment and a just-released book on Ayodhya by former Rajya Sabha MP Balbir Punj of the BJP record popular beliefs in the temple town that a castle or temple devoted to Hindu deity Ram once stood there.
Interestingly, at least two early travellers and evidence adduced by Punj from other books on the subject suggest that Aurangzeb, rather than Babur, was held responsible for the purported demolition by most of the folklore. Some, however, blamed it on Babur, say the accounts of travellers, largely because of an inscription there attributed to Mir Baqi.
While the first account of a European traveller, William Finch, who visited India during the reign of Jahangir, talks about “ruins of castles and temples”, another account penned decades after Aurangzeb’s death records most people accusing the sixth Mughal emperor of destroying remnants of the memory of Ram.
William Finch arrived in India in August 1608, landing in Surat, and wrote about his Ayodhya visit. The account has been taken from William Foster’s book Early Travels in India. Finch visited Ayodhya between 1608 and 1611, when Jahangir ruled the Mughal empire. Calling Ayodhya a “city of ancient note”, Finch says, “Here are also ruins of Ranichand’s castle and houses, which the Indians acknowledge for the great god, saying that he took flesh upon him to see the tamasha of the world. In these ruins remain certain Brahmins, who record the names of all such Indians as wash themselves in the river running thereby; which custom, they say, hath continued for four lakhs of years (which is three hundred ninety four thousand and five hundred years before the world’s creation). Some two miles on the further side of the river is a cave of his with a narrow entrance, but so spacious and with so many turnings within that a man may well lose himself there, if he (does) not take better heed; where it is thought his ashes were buried. Hither resort many from all parts of India, (who) carry from hence in remembrance certain grains of rice as black as gunpowder.”
The text of the Supreme Court judgment adds, “The expression ruins of Ranichand’s castle and houses has appended to it a footnote stating: Ramachandra, the hero of the Ramayana.”
Punj also cites the 1631 account of Joannes de Laet who became a director of the Dutch East India Company in the 1620s. The English translation of that account says, “Not far from this city (Ayodhya) may be seen the ruins of the fort and palace of Ramachand, whom the Indians regard as God most high; they say that he took human flesh so that he might see the great tamasha of the world.”
In 1740, during the reign of the later Mughals more than three decades after Aurangzeb’s death, Jesuit missionary Joseph Tieffenthaler visited India. He wrote an account of his travels, spanning four decades, in Latin. The English translation refers to his visit to Ayodhya. “Avad, called as Adjudea by educated Hindus, is a city of very olden times. Today this city is hardly populated, since the foundation of Fesabad (Faizabad) — a new city where the governor established his residence — and in which a great number (of the inhabitants) settled. On the south bank are found various buildings constructed by the nobles in the memory of Ram. The most remarkable is the one called Sorgadaori (Swarg Dwar), which means the celestial temple. Because they say Ram took away all the inhabitants of the city from there to heaven: this has some resemblance/similarity to the Ascent of the Lord.”
Tieffenthaler writes that the city was repopulated by “King Bikramadjit”, adding, “There was a temple in this place constructed on the elevated bank of the river. But Aurangzeb, always keen to propagate the creed of (Prophet) Mohammed and abhorring the noble people, got it demolished and replaced it with a mosque, with a view to obliterate even the very memory of the Hindu superstition. But a place especially famous is the one called Sita Rasoi, i.e., the table of Sita, the wife of Ram. Emperor Aurangzeb got the fortress of Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place. Others say that it was constructed by Babor (Babur).”
The Jesuit also refers to a widespread belief in the existence of a cradle in which Ram was born and adds that Aurangzeb or Babur razed it to the ground to deny people the right to follow their “superstitions”. He adds, “However, there still exists some superstitious cult in some place or other. For example, in the place where the native house of Ram existed, they go around three times and prostrate on the floor.”
Born in Dublin in 1801, Robert Montgomery Martin was a civil servant who wrote a three-volume book on eastern India in the 19th Century. He too describes Ayodhya and says the people of Ayodhya believed that once deserted, their city was repopulated by Vikramaditya. But Martin casts doubt on the historicity of the belief. He says he found no available trace of Hindu temples that were supposed to have once existed, adding, “The destruction is very generally attributed by the Hindus to the furious zeal of Aurangzeb, to whom is also imputed the overthrow of the temples in Benares and Mathura.”
Punj cites the work of retired IPS officer Kishore Kunal, who dismissed the belief that the Ram Temple in Ayodhya was demolished in 1528 by Babur’s general Mir Baqi and claims that it was demolished in 1660 by Aurangzeb’s foster brother Fedai Khan. Kunal’s book says that Mir Baqi was not a historical person at all. Apart from Aurangzeb’s “bigotry”, Kunal claims another reason for Aurangzeb deciding to get the temple demolished: “His bete noire Dara Shukoh had written in 1656 an interesting introduction to the Persian translation of the famous Sanskrit work Yoga-Vashishtha Ramayana under the title Tarjuma-Joga Vashishta.” Shukoh wrote that he saw Lord Ram in his dream and that gave him a deep desire to get the work translated."

The new system, announced by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday, will begin from February 1 on a pilot basis.
The four cities where monthly electricity bills will be issued are — Panchkula, Karnal, Hisar and Mahendragarh.
Addressing the Republic Day function in Karnal, Khattar said it was a long-pending demand of the people to issue monthly electricity bills.
“Under the new system, meter readers will visit homes every alternate month to note the readings while the consumers will have to upload the readings on an app themselves for the rest of the months,” Khattar said.
Small land parcels for poor, homeless
The Chief Minister also said his government is all set to launch a scheme to provide small land parcels to the homeless and the poor from February 1 this year. Initially, the scheme will be launched in 11 cities of Haryana and a portal will be opened for the same. Every person who applies for the scheme will be given a 30 square yard plot at “an inconsiderable” rate, Khattar said.
He added that the places have been identified for allotting the plots. “Loans will be arranged from the banks for the applicants to build houses on these plots. The Centre and the Haryana government will contribute together for the scheme,” the CM added.
Under the Mukhyamantri Shehri Awas Yojana, Khattar said, the government had issued an advertisement to know the requirement for such plots and flats. “We received applications from nearly one lakh people for small size plots and a similar number of applications for small flats,” Khattar said.
Atal Kisan Majdoor Canteens to remain open throughout the year
The CM also said that the Atal Kisan Majdoor Canteens will be opened in 15 more grain markets of the state. Currently, these are functional in 25 mandis and remain functional for only five months but the CM announced that these would be made functional throughout the year.
Women security and fake news
Khattar further said, “Our first priority is to ensure women’s security. The Opposition will try to defame (the government) by scripting false stories. Their only aim is to defame the government.”
Citing an example, the CM said recently a story was cooked up that there have been instances of atrocities on women in Sirsa. “We verified it and found out that it was the mischief of a teacher who circulated a news about this. The police had to invest many days to probe the case and the statements of hundreds of girls were recorded. Finally, nothing came out. Earlier too, they (Opposition) supported a disgusting act. An incident of Panchkula was raised but no substance was found in that too.”"
50T80WPU2E_O5NKCTNR7CTP07S,"The Republic of India, after January 22",_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 09:39 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-republic-of-india-after-january-22-9128077/,"January 22, 2024, has passed into history. The spectacle enacted with unrestrained pomp on that day is the most decisive step yet in recasting the Indian republic in a religious majoritarian mold. The question now is whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi wishes to transform the de facto Hindu rashtra into a de jure one after winning the general elections.
In the face of such a determined onslaught, a status quoist position based on a postcolonial constitution retaining elements of colonial authoritarianism is unlikely to succeed. It must be met with a principled ideological challenge that is genuinely democratic, drawing on our robust history of anti-colonial constitutionalism.
As a child, I was enchanted by stories of the Ramayana that I read with my grandmother. A favourite book was the Tuktuke Ramayana by Nabakrishna Bhattacharya that narrated Valmiki’s epic in simple Bengali verse. Later in life as a historian, I explored the many iterations of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata that travelled across the Indian Ocean. Rabindranath Tagore believed that the Southeast Asian versions were as original as the ones to be found in India. He called for more comparative studies of the epics. He grumbled that one day some German scholar will do the work and after that, by agreeing or disagreeing with that thesis, Indian scholars will earn PhDs.
I have always been moved by the grandeur of the Ramayana as a literary epic and the religious sensibility of the many who flock to Ram leelas performed in the villages of north India. However, the event at Ayodhya had little to do with either literature or religious faith; it simply provided a climax of sorts to a triumphalist political narrative based on religious majoritarian identity. On January 22, I re-read my mother Krishna Bose’s speech that she delivered in the Lok Sabha more than two decades ago in a debate on Ayodhya. Explaining that she had learned her Hinduism from Swami Vivekananda, she asserted that if an edifice is built on a foundation of violence and hatred, Shri Ram will not reside there. She pleaded in the name of Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose for good sense to prevail.
The sun did rise on the morning of January 23, 2024, the 127th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the one leader who had assured equal rights for members of every religious community and united them all in the struggle for freedom. His close aide Abid Hasan has recounted how Netaji had turned down an invitation to the Chettiar temple in Singapore saying, “What! Come to your temple where even Hindus of other castes are not permitted entry, not to speak of members of other communities who are equally near and dear to me.” He agreed to go flanked by Mohammad Zaman Kiani and Hasan when the precincts were offered as a venue for “an Indian national demonstration”. As for Netaji’s Azad Hind Fauj, this is how Hasan described the army of liberation: “Every region in India was represented and every religion and every caste, mixed inseparably together not only in bigger formations but even in small platoons and sections, each unit being a living tribute to the unity of India”.
While Netaji’s gallant fight for freedom is celebrated, what is less well-known are his thoughts about India’s future constitution and his ideas about what he called “an independent federal republic”. Even before resigning from the ICS, he wrote to Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das on March 2, 1921: “We must now craft India’s Constitution based on Swaraj”. In fact, the blueprint of a federal constitution was unveiled by the Swarajists a hundred years ago in 1923 alongside a pact for the equitable sharing of power between Hindus and Muslims. The best in Indian political thought categorically rejected the constitutional devices of the 1919 and 1935 Acts to perpetuate British colonial rule.
Once the pledge of Purna Swaraj was taken, January 26 was observed as our Independence Day from 1930 to 1947. Upon the onset of World War II, Netaji rejected the Congress proposal of a Constituent Assembly under the auspices of an imperialist government. He recalled how Sinn Fein had scorned Lloyd George’s Irish Constitutional Convention and the Bolsheviks had walked out of Russia’s constituent assembly in 1917. In his view, only after the nationalists seized power could a legitimate Constituent Assembly be elected.
It is a pity that when the British were being forced to quit India as a direct consequence of Netaji’s wartime achievements, his tragic death robbed our country of his contribution to the making of the Indian republic. His elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose was elected to the Constituent Assembly from Bengal, but he resigned when the Congress high command accepted Partition along religious lines in exchange for power at the British Raj’s unitary centre.
A handful of followers and admirers of Netaji did try to argue in favour of substantive democracy and genuine federalism. K T Shah, whom he had inducted into the National Planning Committee in 1938, brought an amendment to Article 1 to proclaim: “India shall be a Secular, Federal, Socialist Union of States”. It was negated. He also wanted to categorically deny the centre any authority to change the name and boundary of any state without the explicit permission of the state legislature. Hari Vishnu Kamath strenuously argued against the Emergency provisions in our Constitution, especially the power to suspend habeas corpus. B R Ambedkar conceded that these provisions could be misused but expressed the hope that they will remain a “dead letter”. By contrast, Sarat Chandra Bose in a January 1950 article in the Indian Law Review described the authoritarian features inherited from the colonial Government of India Act as “a time bomb” and potentially a grave threat to Indian democracy.
During the 1975-1977 Emergency, the suspension of habeas corpus was deemed to be constitutional by four out of five judges of the Supreme Court. In the recent verdict on Kashmir, the Supreme Court has unanimously acknowledged the constitutional authority of the President, on the advice of the Prime Minister and his cabinet, to alter the status of any state of the union.
Many observers have noticed a second republic in the process of formation. Some see the need of a new Constitution for a new India. The words of the Preamble to our Constitution are indeed very beautiful and inspirational. However, certain clauses of what a recent author has called “the colonial constitution” lend themselves to be interpreted in a way that buttresses authoritarianism at the expense of democracy. To be able to strengthen democracy, it is necessary to draw upon an alternative political tradition of anti-colonial constitutionalism. Federalism, egalitarianism, and religious harmony are its main pillars.

Ukrainian officials did not immediately confirm or deny Russia’s claims about the crash in Russia’s Belgorod border region, although they said they were looking into them.
The Associated Press could not confirm who was aboard or other details on what brought the plane down. Throughout the 700-day war, Russia and Ukraine have traded conflicting accusations, and establishing the facts has often been difficult, both because of the constraints of a war zone and because each side tightly controls information.
Video of the crash posted on social media showed a plane falling from the sky in a snowy, rural area, and a massive ball of fire erupting where it apparently hit the ground.
In addition to the 65 POWs, the Il-76 transport carried a crew of six and three other passengers, the Russian military said. According to the statement, Russian radar registered the launch of two missiles from Ukraine’s Kharkiv region that borders the Belgorod region. The ministry did not provide evidence for its claim.
Firefighters, ambulances and police rushed to the site in the Korochansky district of Belgorod, state news agency Tass reported, citing a local emergency services official.
The Russian military said the POWs were being flown to the region for a prisoner swap when the plane was downed at 11:15 am local time (0815 GMT, 3:15 am EST).
The Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman, Andrii Yusov, confirmed to media that a prisoner swap was to happen Wednesday but was not going ahead. He said the agency is checking whether Ukrainian POWs were on the plane.
The plane was headed to the Belgorod region from the Chkalovsky air field in the Moscow region, and the POW swap was scheduled to take place at the Kolotilovka crossing on the Russian-Ukrainian border, the statement read. The crossing is about 135 km (85 miles) west of the village of Yablonovo, near where the plane fell.
Russian officials and lawmakers expressed outrage and questioned whether there should be further prisoner swaps. The most recent one, brokered by the United Arab Emirates, took place this month and was the biggest to date, with 230 Ukrainian POWs returning home and 248 Russians released. It was the first in almost five months and 49th since the war began.
Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and Russia’s Belgorod region have long been a focus of the fighting, especially involving airstrikes with missiles and drones.
Russia has largely ensured its air dominance during the war against Ukraine’s fleet of Soviet-era warplanes. But Russia has suffered a series of crashes that some observers have attributed to a higher number of flights amid the fighting in Ukraine.
At the same time, Kyiv has boasted of shooting down two Russian command and control planes, which would be a major feat for Ukraine if true. Cross-border attacks on Russia’s Belgorod region also have increased, with the deadliest one killing 25 people in December.
Shortly before the crash, Belgorod Gov Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram channel that a “missile alert” had been triggered in the region and urged residents to take shelter.
Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said it was looking into the crash but did not immediately provide any information. Instead, it cautioned against sharing “unverified information”.
“We emphasise that the enemy is actively conducting information special operations against Ukraine aimed at destabilising Ukrainian society,” it said in a statement on Telegram.
The Russian Defence Ministry said a special military commission was headed to the crash site.
President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on his call with reporters that he could not comment on the crash because he did not have enough information about it.
The Il-76 is designed to carry up to 225 troops, cargo, military equipment and weapons, according to Russia’s military export agency.
The war’s 1,500-km (930-mile) front line has been largely static amid a second winter of fighting. As both sides seek to replenish their weapons stockpiles, the war recently has focused on long-range strikes.
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a major Russian missile attack on Tuesday had killed 18 people and injured 130.
The barrage, employing more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles hit 130 residential buildings in three Ukrainian cities, “all ordinary houses,” Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter.
Russia’s onslaught, which included targets in Kyiv and the second-largest city of Kharkiv, was the heaviest in weeks and lent weight to Zelenskyy’s appeals for Western allies to provide more military aid.
“This year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend front-line positions,” Zelenskyy posted Tuesday.
Analysts say Russia has stockpiled missiles to pursue a winter of aerial bombardment, while Ukraine has sought to strike inside Russia with new types of drones.
Russia may have employed decoy missiles in Tuesday’s attack in an effort to open up holes in Ukraine’s air defences, a US think tank said.
The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Moscow is likely trying to acquire more ballistic missiles from foreign countries, including Iran and North Korea, because they may be more effective in some circumstances.
A further barrage of Russian S-300 missiles struck residential districts of Kharkiv late Tuesday, injuring nine people and damaging residential buildings, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said.
Russia denies its forces strike civilian areas, although there is substantial evidence to the contrary.
Also on Wednesday, the Russian Defence Ministry said its air defences shot down four Ukrainian drones in the Oryol region of western Russia. Oryol Mayor Yuri Parakhin said that several drones were downed over the city with no casualties.
Another Ukrainian drone was downed early Wednesday over the Belgorod border region, according to Gladkov. He said there were no casualties or damage.
Ukraine’s allies have promised more military aid even though their resources are stretched. Help from the United States, by far Ukraine’s single biggest provider, has also hit political snags.
The German Defence Ministry said Wednesday it plans to send six Sea King Mk41 helicopters to Ukraine."

The accused, Ayaj Khan, 27, along with four others and a minor, were arrested on January 21 for killing Sadhram Yadav, 48, who worked at a local cow shelter, on January 20.
Yadav was on his way to his village Lalpur on his cycle but he was later found dead with his throat slit on the outskirts of the city. Acting on a tip-off that Khan, who has a previous criminal record, was involved in the murder, a police team nabbed him and his aides.
Khan is said to have nine previous cases against him, including dacoity, body offences and a communal violence case in 2021 where two communities had clashed over the waving of two flags in the city.
During the probe, the local police found that Khan was running an illegal shop in the front portion of his house in the Bichpara area of the city after which the information was relayed to the local municipal council for taking appropriate action, after which a bulldozer was used to raze the illegal shop.
“We are trying to ascertain the motive behind the crime. Yadav worked at the cow shelter for the last 25 years,” said Kabirdham Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava. Yadav is survived by his wife and three children, the police said.
The other accused arrested for the murder have been identified as Sufian Kureshi, 21; Idris Khan, 27; Ayaz Khan, 18; and Mahtab Khan, 22."

The programme, Namo Nav Matdata conference, being organised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP, hopes to reach one crore first-time voters between the age group of 18 and 25 years.
“The Namo Nav Matdata conference will take place tomorrow (Thursday) at 5,000 places in India. Registrations have been done for the youths to interact with Modiji. Lakhs of youth will interact directly with the PM tomorrow. This is the first time that a PM is interacting with first-time voters at this scale. One crore first-time voters will be touched,” BJYM national president and BJP MP Tejaswi Surya said on Wednesday.
“Tomorrow is National Voters’ Day. Under Naddaji’s leadership, the BJYM will contact new voters and make them interact with Modiji. We will enroll lakhs of youth tomorrow as Viksit Bharat ambassadors,” Surya said, adding that there were more than seven crore new voters aged between 18 and 25 years.
“Youth voters played a major role in the election and re-election of Modiji. There are many youth-centric policies of this government. The new education policy has come after 36 years. There are new IIMs and IITs. Digital India, startup India, aerospace, the drone sector are growing, and the private sector has also been involved. Niti Ayog stated that around 25 crore people have come out of poverty. The youth have benefitted from all these,” Surya said.
“There is an infrastructure revolution. Highways, airports, railways, have directly benefitted the youth. Unemployment is at an all-time low. The youth are enthusiastic and extremely keen on making Modiji PM for the third time,” he said.
He said the contrast between India before Modi as PM, and India after Modi as PM will be conveyed to the young voters."

The PM is also expected to virtually address the “new voters’ conference” organised by the BJP’s Yuva Morcha on Wednesday. As the Lok Sabha polls approach, Modi is scheduled to address 50 lakh first-time voters while the party’s youth wing is also set to hold youth-voter conferences at 5,000 locations across India.
On Tuesday, the Centre announced that social justice icon Karpoori Thakur would be posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna amid a three-day celebration organised by the JD(U)-led Bihar government to mark the former Chief Minister’s birth centenary. A public meeting will be held in Patna on Wednesday as part of these celebrations, where CM Nitish Kumar is likely to make some significant announcements.
The PM acknowledged the award in a social media post, saying, “I am delighted that the government of India has decided to confer the Bharat Ratna on the beacon of social justice, the great Jannayak Karpoori Thakur Ji and that too at a time when we are marking his birth centenary. This prestigious recognition is a testament to his enduring efforts as a champion for the marginalised.”
A two-time Bihar CM and socialist stalwart, Karpoori is popularly referred to as “Jannayak” or people’s leader. He is widely considered as the pioneer of EBC (Extreme Backward Classes) and OBC (Other Backward Classes) reservations in the country. Parties in Bihar, including the JD(U) and RJD, have regularly demanded the Bharat Ratna for Thakur.
By evoking Thakur, the BJP is making a direct appeal to the non-Yadav OBCs whom Nitish has come to represent in Bihar. The move also seems aimed at countering the opposition INDIA group’s caste census pitch in recent months.
Meanwhile, in the Supreme Court, it’s the Maratha quota issue that will take centre stage. On Wednesday, the court will take up a curative petition filed by the Maharashtra government challenging its decision to strike down the Maratha quota. A curative petition is the last recourse open to a petitioner after the review petition is dismissed.
In 2021, a five-judge Constitution Bench struck down the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018, which provided reservations to the Maratha community for admission in educational institutions and government jobs.
Saying that “no extraordinary circumstances were made out in granting” the “separate reservation… by exceeding the 50% ceiling limit of reservation” set by the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgement, the court had said the law “clearly violates Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution which makes (it) ultra vires”.
The petition will be heard as Maratha activist Manoj Jarange-Patil marches towards Mumbai, where he plans to sit on an indefinite hunger strike to demand his community’s inclusion in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. The protesters are expected to arrive in Lonavala, outside Mumbai, on Wednesday.
Amid a recent flare-up in violence in Manipur, the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei organisation of around 50,000 people engaged in guarding villages in the Valley areas of the state, has asked all ministers and MLAs from the Meitei-dominated Valley for a meeting in state capital Imphal, where security has been tightened with large deployment of CRPF, Assam Rifles, Army, and state police personnel.
The latest development comes a day after a three-member Union Home Ministry team met the leaders of the group at the residence of Rajya Sabha MP Leishemba Sanajaoba on Monday, a state official said.
The group has demanded the delisting of Kukis from the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list, deportation of refugees to camps in Mizoram, border fencing, the replacement of Assam Rifles with other paramilitary forces, and the revocation of the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement between Centre and Kuki militant groups, officials said.

5LIDXJN5MZ_SEQ0OZDGMLTWRSE,"Women, add these 5 yoga asanas to your daily routine",_,"Updated: January 29, 2024 19:09 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/beginner-friendly-yoga-asanas-womens-health-9110024/,"Women often forget to take care of their health and well-being, having to devote their time to their kids, jobs, house chores and what not. In such a scenario, yoga offers a sanctuary for women seeking holistic wellness. The ancient practice not only enhances physical flexibility but also nurtures mental and emotional resilience.
Through an Instagram post, celebrity yoga and holistic wellness expert, Anshuka Parwani, shared 5 yoga asanas women can practice daily. “We women are always on the go and great multi-taskers, but in the process, we tend to ignore our health and well-being,” Parwani captioned the post. “These asanas are beginner-friendly, will work on your entire body, and leave you feeling refreshed and energized,” she added.
Also known as Bound Angle Pose or Cobbler’s Pose, Baddhakonasana is a seated yoga asana often used to open the hips and groin. According to Manushreya Sharma, a certified yoga instructor, this pose helps regulate bowel movement, stretches the knees, and stimulates circulation in the legs. “It also removes fatigue from long hours of standing and walking as well as offers relief from menstrual discomfort and menopause symptoms,” she said.
However, if you are suffering from a groin or knee injury, Sharma advises individuals to keep a blanket under the outer thighs for support. Additionally, sciatic patients should either completely avoid the pose or sit on a cushion to raise the hips.
Steps:
Malasana, also known as Garland Pose, involves squatting down on the floor. “Malasana engages and strengthens various muscles, including quadriceps, hamstrings, and the lower back and core muscles. It is good for the digestive system as it compresses the abdominal area, helping eliminate digestive issues and bloating,” Sharma said.
However, individuals with lower back, hip, foot, or ankle injuries should refrain from performing this asana.
Steps:
Sukhasana refers to a simple seated cross-legged pose, and Parivrtta denotes a twist or revolved variation of it. This twisting motion also stretches the upper back and spine, Sharma said. “This can help increase flexibility and reduce tension and stress.” Additionally, the twisting in the pose massages the abdominal organs, which helps stimulate digestion.
Sharma advises those with knee and ankle issues to avoid this pose, and those with back problems to practice gently with care and not overexert.
Steps:
In Naukasana, the body takes a shape resembling a boat. “The pose helps build muscular strength, focuses your mind, stimulates the digestive system and boosts energy in the body,” Sharma said. However, women who are pregnant or on their menstrual cycle should skip practicing this pose.
Steps:
Viparita Karani, also known as Legs Up the Wall Pose, is a rejuvenating and restorative yoga pose. “It is effective for increasing the blood flow towards the brain. The asana also induces a calming effect, leading to stress reduction and relaxation,” Sharma explained. However, people with hypertension, heart ailments, pregnancy, respiratory disorders, and spinal disorders should avoid this posture.

The accused person claimed that his brother had found the abandoned drug packet near the sea, suspected to be part of a major drug consignment, which was abandoned by a bigger racket in the sea water. He and his brother tried to cash in on the opportunity and tried to sell the drugs, but got busted, the police said.
Thane police commissioner Ashutosh Dumbre confirmed the development and said, “We are coming down heavily on drug traffickers as well as the consumers.”
Accused Abhay Parshuram Pagdhare, 42, is a fisherman from Dahanu taluka in Palghar district.
Crime branch unit-5 senior inspector Vikas Ghodke recently received reliable information that a suspect is likely to come to ‘I Love Majiwada’ junction in Thane along with some narcotics substance to further sell it to another person for peddling them in Mumbai.
Acting on the information under the supervision of police commissioner and other officers, Ghodke’s team on Wednesday nabbed Pagdhare from the spot.
A bag was found in his possession and 8 kilograms of Charas was seized from it, the police said.
During interrogation, he revealed that his brother had found the drug packet off the coast near Gujarat. He handed it over to Pagdhare, who was attempting to sell it to make some quick money, a crime branch officer said.
The seized drugs is said to be part of a big drug consignment that was found abandoned off the Raigad and Ratnagiri beaches last year.
First, over 278 kg of hashish was found on seven different beaches of Ratnagiri from August 14 to 22. Later, 175 packets of hashish weighing a total of 209.13 kg worth ₹8.36 crore were found on five beaches on the Raigad coast.
“Many fishermen had found the drugs packets, but they all have returned it to the police. But few of them did not. Later some of them were arrested too. We suspect Pagdhare and his brother could be from that lot. We are checking Pagdhare’s brother’s involvement,” said another police officer."

Officials said the two brothers hailed from Rajasthan and had moved to Pune over a month ago for work.
Officials from Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigade said that two godowns located in Jai Malhar Colony of Walhekarwadi —one of which housed wooden items and other aluminium frames—were completely gutted in the fire that started around 2.25 am.
Kamlesh Arjun Chaudhary (23), his younger brother Lalit (21) and another person were sleeping in an attic in the godown that housed aluminium frames. Officials said one of them managed to come out in time after the fire started. “The two brothers had moved to Pune more than a month ago,” said an official.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1) with Pimpri Chinchwad police, Swapna Gore said, “Initial observations suggest that the fire started in the godown that housed wooden items and then spread to the other once. We have come to know that the workers do not usually sleep in the premises, but on Monday night, they did.”
“A case has been registered and we are investigating. If the probe points to negligence on any person’s part, a case will be registered accordingly. At this point, the exact cause of the fire has not been ascertained.” said Inspector Dilip Shinde, in-charge of Chinchwad police station.
“The fire spread very quickly and generated intense smoke because of wooden items stored in the first godown. In such cases, victims often fall unconscious after inhaling fumes that have carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. We have reason to believe that the same thing happened here, and the brothers were rendered helpless after they inhaled the fumes. They were suffocated and then charred to death,” said Gautam Ingawale, Station Officer for Pradhikaran Fire Station.
“Before our tenders reached, locals had been trying to douse the blaze with whatever means they had. We brought the fire under control within a few minutes,” Ingawale said.
“It took four fire tenders and 40 fire fighters to bring the fire under control. The exact cause of the fire is being ascertained.” said the fire station officer."

Payment settlement mechanisms for the disrupted trade routes along with pending issues relating to vostro accounts are likely to be taken up in the meeting, officials said.
The meeting, which is to be chaired by Department of Financial Services (DFS) Secretary Vivek Joshi, will be attended by officials from the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry, External Affairs, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
“It is a coordination meeting planned between government departments, regulators and banks to discuss trade related payment issues. Objective is to hear from all stakeholders and find solutions for orderly trade transactions and settlement thereof,” a senior government official told The Indian Express.
This comes a week after the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had asked the DFS to maintain credit flow to the exporters amid disruption in the Red Sea region that could impact over 80 per cent of the exports to Europe, following an inter-ministerial meeting on January 17.
Freight rates to Europe have more than doubled due to security tension in the Red Sea region. Fears of disruptions in the Red Sea region have risen and oil prices have begun inching up ever since the US and the UK earlier this month attacked Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for the attacks on their commercial ships in the Red Sea region.
Indian shipments of low value products such as agriculture and textiles to Europe are primarily expected to face the impact of disruption in the Red Sea region due to surging freight costs. Earlier, the government had asked Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) not to raise insurance premiums amid rising cost of shipping to Europe."

“So you have an authority under law to tie people to poles and beat them?” Justice BR Gavai queried while hearing their appeal challenging the Gujarat High Court order sentencing them to 14 days’ imprisonment for alleged contempt of court.
The high court had stayed the execution of its October 14, 2023, order for three months to enable the police personnel to appeal.
Senior advocate Siddharth Dave, who appeared for the police personnel, told the bench also comprising Justice Sandeep Mehta that a contempt-of-court case could not be made out against them.
He submitted that the police personnel were also facing criminal prosecution and departmental proceedings and that the National Human Rights Commission was also looking into the matter.
Making evident the court’s displeasure over the incident, Justice Mehta exclaimed, “What kind of atrocities!…Tying the people to poles, beating them in public view.”
On Dave’s contention that there was no wilful disobedience of the DK Basu judgment, Justice Gavai wondered whether ignorance of law can be a valid defence.
“So, ignorance of law is OK?” he remarked and added that “it is the duty of every police officer to know what is the law laid down in DK Basu”. “We have been hearing about D K Basu even as students of law…” he added.
Dave contended that the finding that the men were detained illegally beyond 24 hours was subject to trial and could not be the subject for contempt of court.
The bench admitted the statutory appeal and stayed the contempt proceedings before the high court."
5TH7ODRJ32_H1S0YKZAAFX4HM9,"In a huff, Trump walks out on lawyer’s closing at defamation trial before jury begins deliberations",_,"January 27, 2024 03:55 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/in-a-huff-trump-walks-out-on-lawyers-closing-at-defamation-trial-before-jury-begins-deliberations-9129781/,"A jury began deliberations Friday in the defamation trial against former President Donald Trump, deciding whether he owes writer E. Jean Carroll additional millions after a jury last year concluded that he sexually abused her in 1996.
The jury began its work after closing arguments punctuated by Trump’s dramatic exit from the courtroom as one of Carroll’s lawyers spoke. He later returned as his lawyer defended him over statements he made while president in June 2019, and he remained until deliberations began.
Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked jurors to award $24 million in compensatory damages and much more in punitive damages.
Trump’s attorney, Alina Habba, said Trump told the truth when he refuted her claims, and she said Carroll has more fame and is better poised for success because of her accusations against Trump.
Kaplan was only a few minutes into a closing that lasted more than an hour in Manhattan federal court when Trump suddenly rose from his seat at the defense table and walked toward the exit, pausing to scan the packed courtroom as members of the Secret Service leaped up to follow him out.
The unexpected departure prompted Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who is unrelated to Carroll’s attorney, to speak up, briefly interrupting the closing argument to note: “The record will reflect that Mr. Trump just rose and walked out of the courtroom.”
The walkout came only minutes after the judge, without the jury present, threatened to send Habba to jail for continuing to talk when he told her to stop. “You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,” the judge told Habba, who immediately complied.
Donald Trump is facing four criminal indictments, and a civil lawsuit. You can track all of the cases here. Trump, who was not required to attend the civil lawsuit proceedings, had appeared agitated all morning, vigorously shaking his head as Carroll’s attorney branded him a liar who had incited a “social media mob” to attack her client.
“This case is about punishing Donald Trump for what he’s done and what he continues to do,” Roberta Kaplan continued. “This trial is about getting him to stop.”
Later, Trump returned to the courtroom to hear Habba argue that he should not be made to pay Carroll for comments that set off hate messages from strangers.
Habba showed the jury a video in which Trump said a jury’s verdict last year finding that he had sexually abused Carroll was “a disgrace” and “a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.” “You know why he has not wavered?” Habba asked the jury. “Because it’s the truth.”
That statement prompted an objection that the judge sustained with a warning that “if you violate my instructions again, Ms. Habba, you may have consequences.” Habba told jurors that Carroll’s once-thriving career was in a slump and her pay as a gossip columnist at Elle magazine had been reduced to $60,000 when she chose to reveal her claims against Trump, winning a level of fame and riches she hadn’t seen before. “She’s living the life of the rich and famous,” Habba said.
Roberta Kaplan warned jurors not to adopt the defense argument that Carroll would not face online threats if she had chosen not to make claims against Trump. “Donald Trump is not the victim here,” she said.
The judge later instructed nine jurors that they are only to decide what Trump owes, if anything, to Carroll after a different jury last May awarded her $5 million.
The final remarks from the lawyers come a day after Trump managed to sneak past a federal judge’s rules severely limiting what he could say during his turn on the witness stand, which wound up lasting just 3 minutes. He left fuming that he hadn’t been given an opportunity to refute Carroll’s sexual abuse accusations.
“She said something that I considered to be a false accusation,” Trump said, later adding: “I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.” The jury was told by the judge to disregard both remarks.
The jury last May concluded that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the spring of 1996 in the changing room of a luxury Manhattan department store. It also found that he defamed her in 2022 by claiming she made up the allegation to sell a memoir.
Trump, the Republican frontrunner in this year’s presidential election, has long regretted his decision not to testify at that trial, blaming his lawyers for bad advice.
During her closing, Roberta Kaplan told jurors that the current case was not about a sexual assault. “We had that case,” she said, referencing the first trial. “That’s why Donald Trump’s testimony was so short yesterday. He doesn’t get a do-over this time.”
As she finished her argument, the lawyer urged jurors to support “the principle that the rule of law stands for all of us” by sending an unmistakable message to a man who “time and time again has shown contempt for the law.”
She said the jury should award $12 million to repair Carroll’s reputation and another $12 million for the suffering she has endured because of Trump’s attacks. Then, she said an “unusually high punitive award” was also necessary against a man worth billions of dollars “to have any hope of stopping Donald Trump.”
The jury in this new trial has been told they must accept last year’s verdict.
Habba has argued against damages, saying Carroll’s association with Trump had given her the fame she craved and that death threats she received cannot be blamed on Trump’s remarks.
Carroll, 80, testified at last year’s trial that she had a chance encounter with Trump at a Bergdorf Goodman store that was flirtatious and lighthearted until Trump cornered her in a changing room. Her claim that Trump raped her was rejected by last year’s jury, though it agreed she was sexually abused.
Last week, Carroll testified that her career was shattered by Trump’s statements about her claims over the last five years, most recently on the campaign trail for president. She said she bought bullets for a gun she inherited from her father and installed an electronic fence around her home.
On Thursday, Trump testified that he stood “100%” behind comments he made in an October 2002 deposition in which he denied Carroll’s accusations, calling her “sick” and a “whack job.”
Kaplan intends to instruct jurors Friday that the jury last year concluded that Trump had digitally penetrated Carroll in the department store, but the same jury did not find that he had raped her, according to how rape is defined under New York state law.
The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done."

“This is indeed a very pious day for all Indians wherever they are settled. We all are very happy. Everyone is celebrating the aagaman of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya with full fervour and devotion. I am sure that people of all religious beliefs are happy for this occasion. I am personally very happy about the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. I congratulate each and every Ram bhakt on this occasion. Let us take the slogan of Jai Shree Ram to the skies,” Warring said afterwards.
Warring repeatedly chanted Jai Shree Ram, Jai Siya Ram as he visited the temples. “I did the service in Bhandara today in the joy of Shri Ram Lalla pran pratishtha. Felt so happy that I contributed my bit,” he said.
Warring, who has been in his constituency since morning, will attend a Bhajan Sandhya followed by Ramleela in the evening. He was seen greeting people in the streets of Gidderbaha with folded hands and clad in the robe of Lord Ram.
The Congress leader also posted in the Punjabi language on his social media congratulating people of Punjab on the pran pratishtha ceremony in Ayodhya.
Shiromani Akali Dal leader Hardeep Singh Dimpy Dhillon also visited many temples and joined Warring at the Sanatan Dharam temple, where they hugged each other.
Vijay Inder Singla, a former Congress minister, put up boards greeting all residents of the Sangrur constituency, which he had represented as an MLA.
Over 100 programmes were held in various temples of Muslim majority Malerkotla town.
Ankur Yakhmi, a BJP leader from Malerkotla said, “We honoured all the mandir committees who had organised programmes on Monday morning.” BJP state president Sunil Jakhar congratulated everyone on the occasion of the consecration of the Ram mandir at Ayodhya.”
In the evening, BJP state president Sunil Jakhar along with other senior leaders went to Devi Talaab mandir, in Jalandhar where the temple management lit 1.21 lakh diyas on on Monday evening. I congratulate everyone on this day,” the Sunil Jakhar said.
Jakhar also visited various other temples in Jalandhar on Monday evening.
People, politicians of all hues embrace Ram, celebrate Ayodhya in unison
Cricket, Bollywood, Mahabharat and Ramayan are among a few things that unite a diverse country like India. When it comes to Ramayan and Lord Ram, one will easily find their optimistic supporters across India. And this was witnessed in Punjab on Monday – unalloyed support for Ram Mandir opening cutting across traditional party lines.
Rich and poor residents, the common man, politicians from different parties joyfully celebrated the historic opening of the Ayodhya temple, uniting in a display of devotion and cultural pride. Politicians of all hues were apparently seen embracing the saffron colour.
On Monday, politicians in several parts of the state were seen in “shobha yatras” (procession), temples and participating in langar service, while residents burst firecrackers, performed “deepmala” ceremony at their home to mark the Ram Mandir inaugural event in Ayodhya.
AAP MLA Gurpreet Bassi Gogi took out a “shobha yatra” in Ludhiana West constituency wherein he was seen sitting in a chariot dressed to the nines, later he was seen offering langar service and performing pooja, while Atam Nagar MLA Kulwant Singh Sidhu was also seen taking part in a langar service in his constituency. Vijay Singla, AAP MLA from Mansa, was seen in a “shobha yatra” in Mansa town on Sunday as well as on Monday evening. Singla was also seen visiting various temples on Monday morning. Langar service continued on roadsides till late evening in many areas of the state. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu was seen watching live telecast of Ram Mandir “pran pratishtha” (consecration ceremony) from Dandi Swami temple of Ludhiana. Several business tycoons were also seen distributing sweets among their friends and relatives, apart from organising langars in Ludhiana. Rajnish Ahuja, president of Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industry, organised a “pooja” (prayer) inside a factory (owned by him) and distributed sweets among the entire staff thereafter.
“Many devotees didn’t eat anything till afternoon and had their first meal after the consecration ceremony,” said Vijay Kumar, a resident of Makkar Colony in Ludhiana.
“Shobha yatras” were also taken out in Barnala, Sangrur, Patiala, Muktsar and other towns of Punjab.
To commemorate the occasion, city-based businessman Hemant Sood, MD of Findoc Investmart Private Limited, bought a miniature model of Ayodhya Ram Mandir at the e-auction of mementoes and gifts presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Sood confirmed the purchase, but refused to divulge the price. Talking to the media on Monday, Sood said, “You can call it my little contribution in national interest.” The online auction has been going on for about a month now.
“Being a devotee of Lord Ram, I am feeling blessed to have got this model of the temple. I appreciate the PM’s feeling behind this e-auction, as he will use the money earned out of it in national interest,” he said. Sood’s entire office staff was given a full day off on Monday.
Batala resident cycles to Ayodhya
Batala-based Nitin Bhatia has embarked on a bicycle yatra to Ayodhya to pray for his ailing son.
Bhatia hit the road, along with some essential paraphernalia, on January 17 morning displaying a placard that read “Batala to Ayodhya” cycle yatra (distance 1,115 km). Slogans of “Jai Shree Ram” and “Jai Hind” were also written on the placard. His bicycle also has a flag with Lord Ram inscribed on it.
Bhatia had told the media that his son is not keeping well and he is going to Ayodhya to pray for his son.
“I am sure my prayers will be answered. Despite the tough weather, I have decided to go on bicycle all the way to Ayodhya, and by the blessings of Lord Ram, I will ride it out,” he had told the media earlier.
Although he was supposed to reach Ayodhya on Monday, The Indian Express could not confirm if he has reached the temple town. Bhatia had bought a black bicycle only for this purpose."

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2
FYI:
— The Ninth Schedule contains a list of central and state laws which cannot be challenged in court. Currently, 284 such laws are shielded from judicial review.
— Most of the laws protected under the Schedule concern agriculture/land issues. Hence, statement 3 is correct.
— The Schedule became a part of the Constitution in 1951 when the document was amended for the first time. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
— It was created by the new Article 31B, which along with 31A was brought in by the government to protect laws related to agrarian reform and for abolishing the Zamindari system. While A. 31A extends protection to ‘classes’ of laws, A. 31B shields specific laws or enactments.
— Article 31B reads: “Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 31A, none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void, or ever to have become void, on the ground that such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions of this Part, and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or Tribunal to the contrary, each of the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent Legislature to repeal or amend it, continue in force.”
— The First Amendment added 13 laws to the Schedule. Subsequent amendments in 1955, 1964, 1971, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1984, 1990, 1994, and 1999 have taken the number of protected laws to 284.
— When the Tamil Nadu law was challenged in 2007 (I R Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu), the Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous nine-judge verdict that while laws placed under Ninth Schedule cannot be challenged on the grounds of violation of fundamental rights, they can be challenged on the ground of violating the basic structure of the Constitution. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— The court clarified that the laws cannot escape the “basic structure” test if inserted into the Ninth Schedule after 1973, as it was in 1973 that the basic structure test was evolved in the Kesavananda Bharati case as the ultimate test to examine the constitutional validity of laws.
Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.
FYI:
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The Lok Sabha referred the Multi-State Co-operative Societies (Amendment), Bill, 2022 to a joint committee of Parliament.
— Cooperatives are organisations formed at the grassroots level by people to harness collective bargaining power in the marketplace. This can mean different kinds of arrangements, such as using a common resource or sharing capital, to derive a common gain that would otherwise be difficult for an individual producer to get. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
— Cooperatives are a state subject under the Constitution, meaning they come under the state governments’ jurisdiction, but there are many societies whose members and areas of operation are spread across more than one state. For example, most sugar mills along the districts on the Karnataka-Maharashtra border procure cane from both states. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— In agriculture, cooperative dairies, sugar mills, spinning mills etc. are formed with the pooled resources of farmers who wish to process their produce.
—Amul from Gujarat is perhaps the best-known cooperative society in India, but the numbers show their prevalence, there are nearly 2 lakh cooperative dairy societies and 330 cooperative sugar mill operations across the country.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— Article 356 of the Indian Constitution contains provisions for the imposition of “President’s Rule” in a state, removing an elected government.
— Article 356 was inspired by Section 93 of the Government of India Act of 1935. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
— Article 356 empowers the President to withdraw executive and legislative powers of any state “if he is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution”. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.
— According to the provisions of Article 356, the President’s Rule in a state can be imposed for six months at a time for a maximum duration of three years. Every six months, Parliamentary approval to impose President’s Rule will be required again. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— Under Article 123 of the Constitution (“Power of President to promulgate Ordinances during recess of Parliament”), “if at any time, except when both Houses of Parliament are in session, the President is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to require.” Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— An Ordinance “shall have the same force and effect as an Act of Parliament”. But the government is required to bring an Ordinance before Parliament for ratification — and failure to do so will lead to its lapsing “at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of Parliament”.
— The Ordinance may lapse earlier if the President withdraws it — or if both Houses pass resolutions disapproving it.
— If an Ordinance makes a law that Parliament is not competent to enact under the Constitution, it shall be considered void. Hence, statement 2 is correct.
— Article 213 deals with the broadly analogous powers of the Governor to promulgate/ withdraw an Ordinance when the state legislature is not in session.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.

The space agency says significant progress has been made in resolving technical issues that were identified during the spacecraft’s flight certification process. Starliner went through a successful drop test earlier this month. Teams from NASA and Boeing are conducting the final analysis of the data to complete overall system certification ahead of its first crewed flight.
NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 to develop crew transport systems to carry astronauts into space. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract, while SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion. Elon Musk-led SpaceX completed its first crewed flight in 2020, and it has carried more than a dozen crewed flights to the space station since then, along with many cargo flights. Boeing, meanwhile, has only completed two uncrewed flight tests of Starliner.
In the background, Boeing completed the removal of over seven kilograms of the P213 tape that could pose a fire risk in some conditions. In parts of the spacecraft where removing the tape could lead to other hardware issues, the company overwrapped the P213 tape with a different non-flammable, chafe-resistant tap and installed fire breaks on wire harnesses.
Major integrated flight operations exercises are also underway with mission support teams recently completed a two-day undocking to landing mission dress rehearsal at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico."

“Today is an important day, isn’t it? The situation in India is such that we are considered terrorists if we don’t light camphor today. We don’t know how worse the situation will be in the next 5-10 years,” Ranjith said while speaking at the audio launch of the film Blue Star, bankrolled by his Neelam Productions, on Monday.
Annamalai said the BJP was clear about its ideology. “It’s his remark; BJP or RSS never said that those who do not light a camphor are terrorists,” he said while addressing reporters in Chennai.
“Since 1952, involving everyone, on moral grounds, in a virtuous method, we had promised to raise the Ram temple. With patience, not bringing any ordinance in the Parliament despite being in power… We waited for the verdict of the Supreme Court and following the verdict, we gave the first initiation of the event to our Muslim brothers. This is not something done by an individual. People together have raised this temple,” he added.
He said the Ram temple was not something confined to a particular religion but for the entire country, adding that everyone including Muslims had contributed to its construction.
Talking about his En Mann En Makkal Yatra, Annamalai also said yatras had always pushed the BJP one step forward and that the Ram Mandir pran pratishtha was an example of such success.
“En Mann En Makkal is a different yatra. It is for a political change. We are showcasing what is happening in Tamil Nadu. More people are joining the party. We are visiting people and taking the BJP to each and every village of the state. All these will echo in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. There is no doubt about it,” he added.
The BJP state president also said the party had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the yatra’s conclusion."
66D16UL6KA_JXZ9ZENP6O3E2ER,Christopher Nolan on Oppenheimer Oscar success: ‘Sometimes you catch a wave’,_,"January 24, 2024 16:12 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/christopher-nolan-on-oppenheimer-oscar-success-sometimes-you-catch-a-wave-9125672/,"Christopher Nolan was still sleeping when his film, Oppenheimer, landed a leading 13 Academy Awards nominations Tuesday. Emma Thomas, Nolan’s wife and producing partner, roused him after a flurry of congratulatory messages came through on her phone.
“Don’t take it as being blase,” Nolan told The Associated Press, laughing. “We just didn’t want to jinx anything. Watching the nominations was more than our nerves could take so we just had a restless night and slept through.”
Nolan and Thomas didn’t have much reason to be anxious. Oppenheimer, Nolan’s sprawling American saga of J Walter Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb, has more or less been the Oscar frontrunner since it made its acclaimed debut in late July.
On Tuesday, it earned nominations for of its achievement, including acting nods for Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer was nominated for Nolan’s direction and adapted screenplay; for Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography; Jennifer Lame’s editing; Ellen Mirojnick’s costume design; Ruth De Jong and Claire Kaufman’s production design; Luisa Abel’s makeup and hairstyling; best sound; and Ludwig Göransson’s score. It came one nomination shy of tying the record for best Oscar nominations ever.
“It’s flabbergasting,” said Thomas who spoke with her husband in an interview a few hours after nominations were announced. “Then we got on with the routine of getting a 16-year-old out of bed, but with a spring in our step.”
Though Nolan is regarded as the big-canvas auteur of his era, he’s never won an Academy Award — nor have any of his films won Best Picture. He was nominated for best director once before, for Dunkirk. But Nolan’s absence from the movie’s biggest stage has often been more notable than the honours his films have collected.
After his The Dark Knight was overlooked for Best Picture in 2009, the academy expanded the category beyond five films. But this year’s Oscars may be leading toward a coronation for the 53-year-old Nolan and a three-hour opus that broke records — and Hollywood conventional reasoning — in grossing nearly $1 billion worldwide. On Tuesday, he and Thomas reflected on the movie’s Oscar success.
Do you see the success of Oppenheimer as a statement to the industry — which usually funnels big budgets only to sequels and remakes — about what’s possible for an original film made with scale?
Nolan: I grew up loving Hollywood movies and believing studio filmmaking can take on anything. Seeing audiences respond to that this summer was incredibly thrilling and getting this kind of recognition from the academy, I don’t know what to say, really. It certainly confirms our faith in what studio filmmaking can be.
Have you reflected on why Oppenheimer has resonated so much?
Nolan: It’s always a tricky thing to try to analyze the zeitgeist or analyze success. We were really interested and excited, in particular, to see young people responding to a piece of history. I keep coming back to the unique nature of the story. I think it is one of the great American stories. It encompasses so much that’s important and dramatic about our history. That gives audiences a lot to hang to, when you get a great group of actors and incredible cast like we have, you can make this feel real and emotionally accessible. That’s as far as I can analyze its success. Beyond that, sometimes you catch a wave and it’s a wonderful and unique thing.
Thomas: Oftentimes you think of history as being the ancient past, and it’s not terribly relevant to today. But I think the unique thing about the Oppenheimer story is that everything the movie deals with has direct relevance to this moment in time as well. And so I think that’s something that really touched audiences.
Nolan: Yeah, that’s a good point. When I first started on the project, one of my kids said to me about nuclear weapons, people my age don’t really worry about that so much. This was a couple of years ago. With everything that’s going on in the world since, that’s very much changed. We came along right at a time when people were beginning to worry about this again, and worry about the fate of the world. Oppenheimer’s story is so relevant to that — not just the threat of nuclear weapons but also the burgeoning threat of AI and what it can do to our world.
Though your films have often been celebrated by the academy, neither of you have won an Oscar. Does this year feel different?
Nolan: I think the breadth of recognition that we woke up to this morning is something we haven’t experienced before, and it’s really thrilling for us. It’s a very unique feeling to see in academy recognizing all different aspects of the film, from the performances to the technical achievement of the film. I mean, I grew up watching the Academy Awards. It’s the pinnacle of sort of the recognition of your peers.
Do you see Oppenheimer as the culmination of your collaboration together?
Thomas: It definitely feels like a film that was made with all the things we’ve learned together over the years. It all came together on this film. But I’m hoping it’s not the culmination. I’m hoping that we’ll get to make another one. (Laughs) We’re at the midway point!
Nolan: We’re just getting started! With every film, you try to build on what you’ve learned previous films.
Any big plans to celebrate tonight?
Thomas: Well, we’ll probably be having dinner with our kids. We’ve got one who’s going back to college. We’ll have a family celebration, which feels entirely appropriate given the nature of our movie and the way we work.

687PVG4MO5_J1H9U1TAFO9JPMT,"Mumbai suburb clashes, bulldozer action hit a colony that emerged out of an act of communal harmony",Zeeshan Shaikh,"Updated: January 25, 2024 07:40 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/thane-clashes-bulldozer-action-colony-act-communal-harmony-9125921/,"Naya Nagar in the Mumbai suburb of Mira Road that finds itself in the midst of communal tension, following the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration, was once imagined as a haven precisely against this.
Around 44 years back, two men representing opposite ends of the political spectrum had come together to lay the foundation of the housing colony in Thane district — one was Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, the other Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader G M Banatwala.
On Tuesday, a dozen-odd allegedly illegal shops belonging to the minority community were bulldozed by the local administration, two days after a clash broke out when a procession celebrating the Ram Temple with provocative slogans was stopped as it passed through the area.
The sprawling Naya Nagar, located in close proximity to the Mira Road Railway Station, was the brainchild of social activist and real estate developer Syed Nazar Hussain, who wanted to turn the swampy area into a planned residential zone for the Muslim community.
Hussain invited slurs of a “conspiracy” to set up a “mini-Pakistan”, but he had the last laugh when Thackeray appeared together with Banatwala to give the colony his blessing in 1979. This was the time when the Shiv Sena was seeking all possible support to claim power in the then Bombay Municipal Corporation. The Sena and IUML, in fact, had a tacit political understanding in the mid-70s, with the League’s Corporators backing the Sena candidate for the mayoral elections.
While the Sena-IUML bonhomie did not last, Naya Nagar’s foundations as a symbol of communal harmony proved stronger, with the colony avoiding communal strife even in the tension following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.
The peace prevailed even as the riots that followed the demolition prompted many Muslim families to move from congested areas of south-central Mumbai to localities in the suburbs such as Navi Mumbai, Thane, Mumbra, Mira Road, and Naya Nagar, leading to a property boom there. The unaffordable real estate market of Mumbai was another reason for the rush, with Naya Nagar emerging as a haunt for eateries.
As per the 2011 Census, of the Mira Road Municipal Corporation’s population of over 8 lakh, 16% were Muslim, a bulk of them residents in the vicinity of Naya Nagar.
The BJP has dominated the area since the formation of the Mira Bhayander Assembly constituency in 2009, with either the party or its affiliates winning both the seat and the Municipal Corporation.
The last time Naya Nagar drew an uneasy spotlight was when three of the accused in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts – later convicted – were found to be its residents.
However, even then the arrests didn’t descend into violence. Lamenting the events of the past few days, Dr Azimuddin Syed, a social activist who is a resident of Mira Road, said: “Mira Road was deemed as a safe haven. Even when riots erupted across Mumbai in 1992-93, Mira Road was peaceful. So many Muslims displaced due to the riots chose to settle down in Naya Nagar. This place kept its peace and we hardly had any communal strife in the past.”
Ehtesham Parvez, a resident of Naya Nagar, said he wishes there had been no retaliation to the “provocation”. “People should have held their peace… but they lost their cool over the provocative slogans being raised at the rally. That momentary lapse of judgment has brought this immense trouble to locals in our area,” Parvez said.
By Tuesday evening, the entry and exit points to Naya Nagar were barricaded, with IDs of people being checked.
“Naya Nagar was meant to be a place which would bring communities together. These barricades seem to have amplified the distance,” said Anil Patel, a resident of Mira Road."
6AB6KHEBZ3_2IXNR5JAEMWH95Y,SC slams Tamil Nadu Govt on plea against alleged ban on puja on Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha day: ‘act in accordance with law’,Ananthakrishnan G,"Updated: January 22, 2024 17:42 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-plea-tamil-nadu-govt-ram-mandir-pran-pratishtha-ceremony-live-telecast-ban-9121244/,"The Supreme Court on Monday termed “atrocious” the reasons given by the Tamil Nadu Police while rejecting an application by a local temple in the state’s Dindigul district seeking permission for almsgiving (annadanam) in connection with the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha event.
The bench presided by Justice Sanjiv Khanna was hearing a pea which alleged that on January 20, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin had “issued oral orders/Directions to the Police Department not to permit any kind of Poojas, Archanas, Annadhanam, Live Telecast of Pran Prathishta, Bhajans and processions in the name of Lord Ram on the auspicious occasion of “Pran Prathista” of Lord Ram at Ayodhya, in all the Temples in the State of Tamil Nadu irrespective of whether it is a Private Temple controlled by the TN HRCE Department”.
“If the order on page 21 (of the petition) is to be made applicable across Tamil Nadu, wherever there are minorities, they will never be able to hold a prayer meeting… See the reason. Here the Hindus are in the minority, if they are given permission to hold this prior meeting that will cause problems in the society. Is this a reason?” asked Justice Dipankar Datta, who was part of a two-judge bench.
“You regulate it, you have the power. You have the power to pass orders regulating all these processions. But this reason is atrocious,” Justice Datta added.
The counsel appearing for the Tamil Nadu Government told the bench that “no such oral directions”, as alleged by the petitioner Vinoj P Selvam, a state BJP functionary, had been issued and there is no ban on the live telecast, performance of poojas, archanas, annadanam, and bhajans on the occasion of Ram Mandir Pratishtha in Ayodhya”. He termed the plea as politically motivated.
The court recorded the state’s submission that there is no ban as alleged, in its order.
Issuing notice on the plea to the Tamil Nadu government, the SC asked it to record reasons for accepting or rejecting applications seeking permission and to keep data on the same.
“We believe and trust that authorities will act in accordance with law and not on the basis of any oral instructions… The authorities, while examining any application for permission et cetera shall proceed in accordance with law and record reasons if any, while rejecting the said application. Authorities will also maintain data with regard to the applications received, and the reasons given for allowing or allowing such applications. While examining such applications, the authorities will keep the relevant parameters as held by this court,” the bench said in its order.
What angered the court was the reply of the deputy superintendent of police, Dindigul Rural Sub Division, Dindigul district, to an application by the administrators of Sri Bhagavatiyamman Temple, seeking permission to give special almsgiving (Annadanam) on the occasion of the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha.
Among other things, the police note said, “The area of A Vellodu village, where you have requested permission to conduct the event, is predominantly inhabited by Christians. Additionally, there are areas with Christian temples. Due to the lower number of Hindu residents in this village, there is a possibility of encountering cultural sensitivities or legal complications related to public peace and morality when organizing events that are perceived as deviating from the prevailing religious practices”.
“Also, public peace is likely to be affected by the programme proposed to be conducted and law and order problems are likely to arise. Religious problems also are likely to arise and public property is likely to be damaged, and the public is likely to be put to discomfort. Therefore, due to the above reasons, permission is denied for the program you want to conduct”.
Disapproving of this, Justice Khanna also said while law and order can be a reason to regulate, what is stated in the order alone can’t be the reason. “We have made it very clear. We want to know the reason. If this is the reason going to be given, you will be in trouble,” Justice Khanna cautioned the Tamil Nadu counsel.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the bench he was told some police stations have passed written orders and added that a message must go from the highest constitutional court that what is happening is not acceptable."

The US and EU had imposed countervailing duties (CVDs) on paper file folders, common alloy aluminum sheet and forged steel fluid after an anti-subsidy investigation. CVDs are tariffs on imported goods that are imposed to offset subsidies given by the exporting country’s government, aimed at protecting the domestic industry.
“When US investigators come to the manufacturing plants, the exporters should be able to show what they are getting is a remission and not an incentive. They should be able to show that they are paying electricity bills and value-added tax (VAT). But there are problems in maintaining the documents from our exporters side. We are working on a process to familiarize the exporters with the entire documentation process,” the official said.
“There is no need to relook at the scheme. It is WTO compliant. There were few exporters who could not show the documents..some people mentioned it is an incentive because there used to be incentives. So our exporters will have to adapt to the documentation mechanism and the government will be helping in the process,” the official added.
The RoDTEP scheme, announced in January 2021, refunds embedded duties and taxes, such as VAT on fuel used in transportation, mandi tax and duty on electricity. It replaced the WTO-incompatible Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) scheme, which had faced several challenges from WTO members.
The RoDTEP scheme operates under a budgetary framework and for FY 23-24, Rs 15,070 crore was allocated to boost exports of items such as pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals and articles of iron and steel among other items.
“If our partner country is not able to interpret our policies, then it is a problem. The onus is upon us. Because we are looking for market access. For instance, if partner countries are imposing standards, we have to conform to the standards. So we need market access and so we will have to resolve these issues,” Biswajit Dhar, Professor, Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said.
Dhar added that implementation of the scheme assumes significance as other countries are more likely to scrutinize the scheme after the US and EU have imposed countervailing duties on Indian products. He added that RoDTEP is WTO compatible but WTO is about transparency and predictability and the government has to ensure that.
“Another thing is how we are implementing it. There is a problem of oversight. The industry was making a valid point that the rates were too low. In any policy, it has to be constantly reviewed and monitored, to check if compliance is in order. Because for one black sheep, you can’t let the whole scheme be called into question. The government has to be careful about implementation because when our exports are falling, we need to count our pennies. Because we stand to lose,” Dhar added."
6H04D6FWDA_MDVML1P8I209X3E,Nitish Kumar back with BJP: A timeline of JD(U) supremo’s U-turns since 2013,_,"Updated: January 28, 2024 17:29 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/nitish-kumar-bjp-jdu-u-turns-9127748/,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar crossed over to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) again on Sunday — an alliance he left in 2022 to join hands with the Opposition. Amidst talks of a rift in the INDIA alliance, the RJD and JD(U) held separate meetings whereas BJP state president Samrat Choudhary left for Delhi to hold discussions with top party leaders. The Bihar CM’s latest comments on ‘dynasty politics’ have added to these rumours, inviting a reply from Lalu Prasad Yadav’s Singapore-based daughter Rohini Achary. Here’s a look at a timeline of Nitish Kumar’s multiple political jumps through the years:
🗓️ 2013: JDU-BJP alliance breaks
When Nitish had severed ties with the BJP in 2013, it was on the ground that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) should have a leader with a “clean and secular image”. He parted ways when it became clear that the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi was going to be the BJP-led NDA’s prime ministerial face for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. After walking out of the NDA then, Nitish had given a call for “Sangh-mukt Bharat”. Nitish had also gone on to declare that “mitti mein mil jayenge, BJP ke saath wapas nahi jayenge (I would prefer to be reduced to dust rather than going back to BJP)”.
🗓️ 2015: RJD and JDU unite
In the run-up to the November 2015 elections to the 243-member state Assembly, Nitish joined hands with the arch rival Lalu Prasad-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress and some other smaller parties to form a “Grand Alliance” which won 178 seats, with Nitish again taking over as the CM.
🗓️ 2017: JDU sides with BJP after breaking away from RJD
In mid-2017, the CBI conducted raids at Lalu’s premises in an alleged IRCTC scam in which the then Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu’s son, was also named as one of the accused for allegedly being a beneficiary of the land transfers from the RJD supporters for railway jobs. As Tejashwi was Nitish’s deputy, the latter wanted him to explain his position in public and had also expected him to resign and returned to the NDA after Tejashwi’s refusal to resign. Nitish then formed the government in BJP with the BJP. Continuing as the CM, he resumed his camaraderie with the BJP’s Sushil Kumar Modi as his deputy. Things went on smoothly till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP won all 17 seats it fought from and the JD (U) bagged 16 of 17 seats the party contested. With the LJP winning six of six seats it contested, the NDA’s tally rocketed to 39 out of the total 40 Lok Sabha seats in the state – its best-ever performance.
🗓️ 2022: JDU BJP breaks apart and Nitish becomes CM
JD (U) leader Nitish Kumar returned to the Mahagathbandhan and Tejashwi in 2022. Nitish ended his alliance with the BJP, resigned as the coalition Chief Minister, only to stake claim again hours later with Tejashwi as his deputy. He formed a new government with the support of the RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI (M-L) and HAM (S) and an Independent making a team of 164 MLAs in a House of 243.
🗓️ 2024: Nitish on the verge of leaving INDIA
With cracks in the INDIA alliance just months before Lok Sabha polls, all eyes are on Nitish Kumar, who has parted ways with the Mahagathbandhan."

Rama Rao cited media reports on the appointments of Prof M Kodandaram and Amer Ali Khan, joint editor of the Urdu daily Siasat, as members of the Legislative Council under the governor’s quota and asked what prompted Soundararajan to “make her decision now, without wasting any time”.

He said the governor had rejected BRS nominees Dasoju Sravan and K Satyanarayana citing their political affiliations but overlooked Prof Kodandaram’s credentials as president of the Telangana Jana Samithi, a political party.
However, there has not been any official order from the Raj Bhavan or the state government regarding the MLC appointments.
In August last year, the then BRS government recommended the two party leaders for appointment under the governor’s quota, but the Raj Bhavan rejected the nominations on September 25. After Sravan and Satyanarayana appealed to the Telangana High Court against the rejections, the Raj Bhavan issued a note on January 17, 2023. “The Governor has decided not to take any decision on the proposal of the state government to fill the vacant two MLCs under Governor Quota till the writ petitions are finally decided by the High Court,” it read.
Demanding an explanation, Rama Rao said, “How can the governor accept Kodandaram, who is a president of a party, for MLC candidature when she rejected Dasoju Sravan and Satyanarayana for being politically affiliated? The governor is answerable to people, not Revanth Reddy. Was this decision taken because of the Fevicol bond between the Congress and the BJP?” he asked.

For his part, Sravan said the “situation appears to be a significant mystery and suspense thriller” in a social media post.
Why has a false campaign been unleashed claiming that two MLCs were appointed by the Honorable Governor of Telangana, @DrTamilisaiGuv @TelanganaGuv, despite the absence of any official order from either Governor’s office and GAD?

Alleging collusion between the Congress and the BJP, Rama Rao questioned the decision on separate MLC elections under the MLA quota when both BRS MLCs Kadiyam Srihari and Kaushik Reddy had resigned on the same day on being elected to the Assembly.
This, the BRS leader suggested, was following Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy’s recent meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. Rama Rao also recalled BJP national general secretary Bandi Sanjay’s recent statement calling for unity between the Congress and the BJP to finish the BRS. He said Revanth Reddy too spoke on these lines and that it was proof enough of a secret understanding between them."
6OFV1KRY0E_ZCMAP8STFZU9RBS,Five takeaways from Modi’s address to first-time voters,_,"January 25, 2024 17:10 IST",20230125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/five-takeaways-modi-address-first-time-voters-9127547/,"In his virtual address to around 30 lakh first-time voters from across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday touched upon a wide range of talking points for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, trying to frame the same in a language that spoke to the youth. He also promised to physically meet those among them whose suggestions for the BJP manifesto were accepted by the party.
Here are the five most important takeaways from his 25-minute speech earlier today, on the occasion of National Voters’ Day.
‘Responsibility as voters’
While asking the youth to send suggestions for the BJP manifesto, Modi said the responsibility of the youth didn’t end with voting themselves, but in getting others to vote, especially ones who are yet to have their names included in the voters’ list. He also said India’s future rested on their shoulders, and is expressed through their electoral choices, which is why they should shun “family-run parties” that do not allow youth from outside their ruling families “to rise in life”.
‘Deciding India’s future over the next 25 years’
The PM said that just as a hundred years ago, India’s youth rose up to fight for freedom — which they achieved over the next 25 years — so too should today’s youth rise up to the challenge of making India a developed country by 2047, over the next 25 years. He congratulated the first-time voters for being born during “Amrit Kaal” and encouraged them to elect stable governments that “hasten India’s rise to the third-largest economy”, speed up reforms, energise the digital revolution, send the first Indian to space, ensure that India establishes its first space station “as it rises in influence around the world”.
‘Need for stable, majority governments’
The PM said stable governments with a majority are able to take decisions that propel the country forward, and listed achievements of his government that, he said, wouldn’t have been possible without such a majority, like the removal of Article 370, introduction of One Rank-One Pension for Army veterans, as well as GST, New Education Policy, women’s reservation, legislation against instant triple talaq, etc. He went on to add the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya to the list, saying this too was an outcome of “firm decisions taken by a stable, majority government”.
Driving the narrative of him as the representative of India’s entire population, he claimed that when he shakes hands with world leaders, it is as the representative of 140-crore people.
‘End of talk about corruption and scams’
Recalling many “chronic problems of the past”, Modi said his government had solved these, like the talk of corruption and scams involving thousands of crores of rupees. He said instead of having to protest against the government, today’s youth talk about credibility and success stories. He went on to talk about goals in power generation and distribution, saying that soon, there would be solar panels on 1 crore rooftops, that would lead to a reduction in power bills, with the government buying excess electricity from the people.
‘The Modi guarantee’
He wound up his speech with his government’s promises, referring to them as “Modi’s guarantees”. Saying that the dreams of India’s youth power his resolve, he spoke of advancements in the drone and space sectors, the ability of youth to take loans without guarantee under the Centre’s Mudra Yojana, the common admission test for universities, new institutions of higher education coming up, the funding of research, the construction of new highways, airports, railway routes and investments in infrastructure, all for the benefit of the youth. “We will take decisions for the youth – this is Modi’s guarantee,” he said."

On Sunday four persons had been arrested by the police.
The accused claimed to be ED officials and threatened to implicate the complainant in an ED case if he did not pay them the concerned amount.
The complainant’s firm had in the past been under the ED scanner, thus making the threat seem more credible. However when the complainant realised he had been duped, he approached the police following which an FIR was registered at the Bandra police station.
The case was transferred to the Mumbai crime branch with CCTV footage of the coffee shop where the threat was made and identified the accused.
While four persons were arrested on Sunday, Sawekar was arrested on Monday."
6R8WB7APAM_PC2FCZPUNBQ2TM1,France’s early bet on India is paying off,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 16:08 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/frances-early-bet-on-india-is-paying-off-9126346/,"India and France are kindred souls on the global stage. They are both systemically important powers, with France being a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. What they say and do matters. The relationship has attracted attention in all major capitals, from Washington to Berlin to Moscow to Beijing. This is not without justification.
The two countries complement each other in many areas. They do not carry historical baggage and do not have any major bilateral differences. Where such differences exist, the two sides have shown a remarkable ability to overcome them. Relations between them are time tested in every sense of the term.
The visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to India as the chief guest for the Republic Day exemplifies the natural bonds of friendship between the two countries. France occupies a unique position in India’s strategic thinking. It is seen as a country that has stood by India through thick and thin — in 1998 when India went nuclear, its support to India on Jammu and Kashmir, its advocacy of India’s claim to permanent membership of the UN Security Council, standing with India to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism or bolstering India’s capabilities against China.
Its cooperation on security issues such as in defence production, nuclear and space sectors and intelligence sharing has been open-ended and has strengthened Indian hard power. France has not shied away from sharing the most advanced defence and civil technologies and building India’s production and manufacturing base. It has promoted India’s interests within the European Union without hesitation, becoming both the gateway for and a strong partner of India in Europe. It has offered its biggest strategic asset, its vast Indo-Pacific territory, and equities in organisations such as the Indian Ocean Commission, to India. Indian Air Force planes have been deployed to Reunion Island. France has also refrained from commenting on India’s internal affairs.
This is a remarkable record of cooperation between two countries. India has reciprocated by treating France as a dependable source of high-end defence equipment and technology that has led to military purchases worth billions of dollars.
There are good reasons for this to happen.
France values its strategic autonomy like India. France’s ability to look at India differently from the Anglo-Saxon world gives it immense advantage in dealing with India. For India too, the relationship with France exemplifies its policy of strategic autonomy without being labelled anti-Western. In doing so, both countries celebrate their commitment to multiculturalism and pluralism at the domestic and international level. They empathise with each other’s challenges, such as at the moment of France’s sense of betrayal over the cancellation of the contract for French nuclear submarines by Australia and the accompanying announcement of the AUKUS grouping, or India’s experience with cross-border terrorism.
The two countries have developed a culture of supporting each other. France was the co-founder of one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship international initiatives, the International Solar Alliance. It was the first European country to accept the UPI payments system. Several mechanisms have been established to strengthen the India-France partnership in the Indo-Pacific region even though France is not a member of the Quad. Bilateral strategic maritime cooperation between the two predates the Quad.
Every summit meeting between the leaders results in new areas of cooperation. The forthcoming one is expected to be no different. Apart from exceptional protocol gestures, the visit is likely to result in new announcements in the area of military and technical cooperation, relating to engines, aircraft, submarines and space, digitalisation, cyber security and climate change.
President Macron’s personal contribution to the India relationship cannot be overstated. This will be his third visit to India, and with it, France gets the unique honour of being the country that has been invited the highest number of times as chief guest for the Republic Day.
Furthermore, President Macron’s role at this time of global tensions and uncertainty is even more important. He is the youngest leader to be sworn in as President of France since Napoleon, yet today, in his second and last term, at the age of 46, he is the senior-most leader in Europe. The world needs a bridge between the West and the East and between the North and the South. Prime Minister Modi and President Macron have a unique opportunity to harness their friendship to these ends.
France bet on India very early on. India fully reciprocated. Today, those bets are paying off.

The letter has been signed by 207 former students of the FTII, including Oscar winner Resul Pookutty, film editor Anupama Chandra, filmmaker Prateek Vats and actor Shardul Bhardwaj.
“It is painful to see the students of this great film school being assaulted with impunity. We, as a community of film professionals, educators, and artists of both national and international acclaim, extend our support to the FTII student community at this tough and testing moment,” the letter said.
The incident took place on Tuesday, a day after the consecration ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. According to police, some 12 to 15 unidentified people allegedly barged into the campus by overpowering security personnel and assaulted students while shouting slogans. They tore up and burnt the banner that read “Remember Babri, Death of Constitution”.
The FTII Students Association (FSA), which put up the banner, claims that its president, Mankap Nokwoham, was among those who were attacked. The alumni group said they “unequivocally condemn” the violence perpetrated on the students.
“FTII students had organised discussions and screenings on their campus as part of their academic commitment. That intruders were allowed to attack the students is inexcusable,” the open letter said. It said the “inaction” of the police in investigating and taking action against those responsible for the violence was even “more inexcusable”.
The letter appealed to the police and other authorities to take prompt action against those who perpetrated violence against the students and who entered with the intent to vandalise property on the campus. “We hold the institute in great affection and regard, and owe to it the rigorous training that turned us into film professionals,” it added.
An FIR was registered against unidentified persons at the Deccan police station under Indian Penal Code sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 427 (mischief causing damage) and other provisions, the police said.
The police have also registered an FIR against three students under Indian Penal Code sections 153B (1) (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs)."

The sanction letters were distributed at a function presided over by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, just two days before the Republic Day, said an official statement.
“Today, J&K creates a new record by distributing sanction letters to set up new units and startups that will fulfill dreams of youth and their aspiration of being a job creator and not a job seeker,” the Lt Governor said.
This momentous occasion also marks a significant leap forward in transforming the UT’s economic landscape, he added.
On the occasion, Sinha congratulated the Jammu Kashmir Bank for its endeavour to strengthen the spirit of Ghar Ghar KCC Abhiyaan and Swarozgar Utsav – two ongoing campaigns aimed at the financial empowerment of farmers and the youth.

He said the J&K Bank is the common man’s bank and is playing its important role for the betterment of the common man.
Swarozgar Utsav that promotes entrepreneurship and self-employment covers all the panchayats of J&K Union Territory and is supported by J&K Bank that will provide Rs 1,384 crore to set up new units and startups, the Lt Governor observed.
Lt Governor Sinha also highlighted the achievements registered in saturation of Kisan Credit Cards across the Union Territory.
Under Ghar-Ghar KCC Abhiyaan, about two lakh farmers were provided with Kisan Credit Card to ensure they have access to reliable, adequate and affordable credit.
“I see a new revolution is under way in the agriculture and allied sector that will construct new pathways for the prosperity of Jammu Kashmir,” the Lt Governor said.
While appreciating the bank’s contribution towards social development projects in the UT under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Lt Governor Sinha underscored the scope for input credit in agriculture and MSME sectors to help farmers and youth for creating employment opportunities besides attaining self-sufficiency.
He directed the J&K Bank to achieve saturation in Ghar Ghar KCC Abhiyaan, Stand-Up India and Startups.
“We have a lot of expectations from J&K Bank and I expect the bank to devise campaigns to take financial literacy programmes to a vast portion of the population. Under ‘Back to Village’ and ‘My Town My Pride’ programmes, the banks must strive to achieve the envisaged target for extension of financial assistance to enterprising youth,’’ he observed.
He called upon the banks in the Union Territory, especially the J&K Bank, to ensure the cater to the needs of farmers, youth and women through people-friendly schemes aimed at the creation of employment and livelihood opportunities “not only for the beneficiaries but those associated with them as well”.
On the occasion, the Lt Governor handed over insurance claim settlement cheques to the legal heirs of the deceased government employees covered under the bank’s Group Personal Accidental Insurance. He also felicitated successful entrepreneurs and farmers financed by the bank.
Sinha launched the Kisan Sathi Chatbot, an AI-based farmer-friendly application of the Agriculture Production Department. J&K Bank has also contributed Rs 40.27 lakh for the chatbot application.
Two cheques worth Rs 3.35 crore and Rs 3.84 crore under J&K Bank’s CSR programme were handed over to the representatives of Jammu Smart City and Srinagar Smart City, respectively, for the construction of e-bus bays/passenger sheds.
As part of its CSR initiative, J&K Bank handed over a commitment letter to the administrative secretary, Department of Health and Medical Education, for providing 120 Patient trolleys and 120 wheelchairs to all the district hospitals of the Union Territory UT, handing over of cheque worth Rs 26 lakh for two transport ambulances to the principal of Government Medical College Jammu and Rs 34 Lakh for one critical care ambulance to SKIMS director.
Two corporate movies themed on ‘Ghar-Ghar KCC Abhiyaan’ and ‘Swarozgar Utsav’ and the bank’s CSR Initiatives were also screened on the occasion."
6YRPG254WZ_TCDT6HTQ6ZIYT4K,A new state-people compact,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 09:51 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ramlalla-prana-pratishtha-ayodhya-ram-mandir-inauguration-return-of-shri-ram-bharat-ram-mandir-movement-9122590/,"January 22 marks a pivotal moment in the millennia-old civilisational history of India. The prana pratishtha of Shri RamLalla at the Ram mandir in Ayodhya will not only herald the return of Shri Ram after 500 years, but also mark the culmination of the struggle of the people to reclaim Bharat. The struggle for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is the most consequential movement in the history of India after independence. It was not just a religious movement but also a political and social mobilisation against the post-colonial power structures where Brown Sahibs had simply replaced erstwhile foreign rulers. The anglicised urban elites, in alliance with the rural landed elites, dominated the levers of power after 1947, while the masses continued to remain disempowered. The elite project of reshaping the country in the image of secular-socialist dystopia produced only misery, disenchantment and marginalisation of the people’s culture and aspirations.
The intensity and widespread appeal of the Ram mandir movement were a reflection of the revolt against post-colonial power structures, old elites, and their manufactured cultural hegemony. The movement was the largest subaltern struggle of our times. It was the democratic uprising of the small towns and villages against the corridors of power to which they had no access. It was the uprising of the non-English-speaking majority against the intellectual and cultural hegemony of the tiny English-speaking elite who held the masses in contempt. It was the uprising of the newly emerging middle class seeking to create a political space for itself.
It was also the first time there was large-scale mobilisation of numerous smaller Dalit and OBC castes who had remained on the margins of various political movements, irrespective of their ideological moorings. The Ram mandir movement forged a new socio-political reality. It was for the first time that these castes appeared on the political map of the country and in the agenda of political parties. They were politicised and mobilised around a common Hindu identity. Their desire to see their caste narratives and history mainstreamed saw fulfilment in the Hindutva movement, which also saw a rapid expansion in its social constituency.
Unlike the fashionable rhetoric in the activist circles and academia living in its make-believe world, the appeal of a common Hindu identity has always been strong among the subaltern communities. The attempt to divert the struggle against the caste system and discrimination towards the anti-Hindu agenda was decisively defeated during the Ram mandir movement.
Shri Ram was the central deity in the medieval Bhakti movement that challenged social exclusion and still has a strong presence among the Dalit and backward castes through various sampradayas and traditions. It is interesting to note that in the calamitous medieval period, Shri Ram emerged as the central deity in the Bhakti movement to unite Hindus across castes and communities, and again, in the modern period, Shri Ram became the focal point around which all Hindu castes and communities united to reclaim their liberty after centuries of foreign depredations. This religio-political phenomenon can be attributed to Shri Ram being the Maryada Purushottam, a righteous warrior and an ideal King. It is not for nothing that the imagery of “Ram Rajya” moved the people during the anti-British struggle.
During the foreign Islamic rule of the Turks and Mughals, Ramcharitmanas, the Awadhi version of Ramayan, captured the imagination of the masses. For a common Hindu, sovereignty belonged to “Raja Ram” even in this darkest hour. And in the moment of despair, to find hope and to wage the struggle against the insurmountable odds, people rally around their king. And rallied around the king they did, whether during the struggle against the Turko-Mongol rule, British imperial rule or against the post-colonial elites. From Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to Gandhi to the nameless karsevak, the valour of Shri Ram and the appeal of Ram Rajya have inspired warriors and reformers across centuries.
The consecration of the Ram mandir in Ayodhya is not just a religious ceremony but also symbolises the “return of the King”, the reclamation of the sovereignty of the Hindu Rashtra. The last time a temple existed in Ayodhya, Krishnadevaraya was emperor in the South, ruling over the Vijayanagara Empire, Nuno da Cunha was governor of Portuguese India, and Suleiman the Magnificent was inaugurating the era of Ottoman supremacy in West Asia. The rebirth of the Ram mandir in Ayodhya is happening at a time when India is rising again after centuries. The wheel of the time has turned again, and India is not only undergoing rapid economic transformation, but a popular sentiment of decolonisation is also sweeping among the youth. There is an upsurge of cultural consciousness and deepening interest in the religious and civilisational roots of modern India.
In more than one way, the struggle for Ram mandir led by the Hindutva movement was the vehicle of this modern India. Hindutva is Hindu modernity. Hindutva inherited the legacy of the Hindu proto-modernity and contemporary social and religious reform movements to imagine a modern Hindu nation. It sought to overcome the caste system and unite people towards a common goal of economic rejuvenation and civilisational renaissance. It is important to mention that the first brick of the Ram mandir in 1989 was laid by Kameshwar Chaupal, belonging to a Dalit caste, while a prime minister from a backward caste presided over the prana pratishtha at a time when India has a woman president from a tribal community. And at a time when more than 25 crore people have been uplifted from multidimensional poverty in just nine years. What we are witnessing is the forging of a new compact between the state and the people and the rise of a new modern republic in consonance with the ancient civilisation of Bharat.

Nehru and Abdullah held separate meetings with Mrs Gandhi and discussed the latest political development in the state.
Film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Sivaji Ganesan, and Ben Kingsley, Mahatma Gandhi’s biographer, external affairs officials K Natwar Singh, secretary general of NAM and coordinator of CHOGM and chief of protocol M H Ansari, Punjabi journalist Sadhu Singh Hamdard and Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar are among the 69 winners of this year’s Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri awards.
The entire gamut of physical and financial control is proposed to be reviewed along with the issue of giving more powers to nationalised banks and term lending institutions by a high-level official committee headed by M Narasimham, who until recently was secretary, Economic Affairs, at the Centre. The setting up of the committee follows the recommendations made earlier by the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister.

6ZSEVO46K4_OAYF4RKLACUVS9U,Express View on India-Myanmar border: Keep it porous,_,"January 24, 2024 07:40 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/keep-it-porous-9124536/,"The Centre should rethink its decision to fence the country’s 1,643-km border with Myanmar. Announcing the move last week, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that plans to formally end the Free Movement Regime (FMR) regime, suspended since September 2022, are also on the government’s anvil.
The FMR, which came into effect in 2018, allowed people living along the border of either side to travel up to 16 km into the other country without any visa.
Admittedly, the situation along the Indo-Myanmar border has deteriorated after the Tadmadaw seized power in Yangon in February 2021.  The junta has persecuted the Kuki-Chin people and the turmoil has resulted in an influx of Myanmarese refugees in the country’s Northeast.
The instability has sparked security concerns in Delhi. The trafficking of arms and drugs is also worrying. But sealing borders could complicate matters in parts of the Northeast that bear the scars of insurgencies and ethnic strife, past and present. Undermining people-to-people relations can cause heartburn amongst tribal groups like the Kukis in Mizoram and Manipur who share kinship ties with Myanmar’s Chin community. Mizoram’s Chief Minister Lalduhoma — like his predecessor Zoramthanga — has opposed the fencing and civil society groups in the state have also criticised the move.
The junta has ruled Myanmar for all but five years since 1990. Unlike Western powers, which have made democracy the sole prism of their Myanmar policy, India has chosen to do business with the military regime, and that also has to do with the latter’s help in the denial of a safe haven to insurgents from the Northeast.
Myanmar has also been a part of India’s Look East Policy. The strategy to do business with Yangon worked to a large extent till the latest military takeover three years ago. Since February 2021, the country’s Chin province which shares a border with Mizoram has become a major battleground in the conflict between the junta and its opposition.
Entire villages have reportedly been burnt down for failing to comply with the Tatmadaw’s writ. In August last year, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told his counterpart in Myanmar that “India’s border areas have been seriously disturbed and any action that aggravates the situation should be avoided”. That, however, was a rare admonition. Delhi has, by and large, failed to restrain Yangon from acting against Indian interests. Instead, the Union Home Ministry now seems to be picking on the junta’s victims.
Mizoram has provided a sanctuary to the refugees. In neighbouring Manipur, however, the Biren Singh government has framed the crisis in ways that help him gloss over his own government’s failures to stanch the state’s nearly nine-month-long ethnic strife. Singh has accused the chiefs of the Kuki community of “illegally settling immigrants” from Myanmar. Such hostility is part of a playbook that fails to acknowledge and address the complex nature of the frontiers in the Subcontinent, many of which are a creation of the colonial state. India’s border with Myanmar cuts through villages and divides families in Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur. It should remain porous."

The notice issued by PPCC’s general secretary in-charge Captain Sandeep Sandhu read that father-son duo organised the event without keeping the state leadership or even the local district unit in loop. The notice further read that action was taken on the complaint of Malvika Sood Sachar, party’s Moga constituency in-charge.
The notice also accused Maheshinder Singh, former SAD MLA from Baghapurana who had later moved to Congress ahead of 2017 assembly elections, of involving in “anti-party activities” and “being in touch with local Aam Aadmi Party MLA”. The duo has been asked to submit a reply within two days or face disciplinary action. Maheshinder Singh is also Congress’s former district president for Moga.
Meanwhile, addressing another parallel rally in Moga on Sunday, Sidhu threw an challenge to CM Bhagwant Mann to have an open debate with him on issues of Punjab. Sidhu said that “kleptocracy” (rule of corrupt leaders) was currently prevailing in Punjab.
In his Moga address, Sidhu said that time has come when the Congress , which has “roaring lions” has to be raised. “We have to raise an honest Congress… I am not a rolling stone on whom Mann can come and crack jokes. Sidhu is a true Sikh… Sidhu was a Congressman, he is a Congressman and will die a Congressman,” he said.
Sidhu said that it wasn’t the democracy but “kleptocracy” which is currently ruling Punjab. “I wasn’t even aware of this word called “kleptocracy” until a highly educated man, who was equally worried for Punjab, told me. It is “choran da tantra” (rule of thieves). It is the corrupt which the ruling the state now,” said Sidhu.
Daring CM Mann to debate with him, Sidhu said that “let’s sit alone in a room and I will give you facts.”
Targeting his own party, Sidhu said that Congress cannot continue to live in a fool’s paradise. “I even appeal to Congress. It is about Punjab. It is a question in hearts of every Punjabi…who will bring them out of this trap? How? People are selling their assets worth crores and moving abroad. Who will bring them back? People change parties for positions but I am working to change this system,” he said. He claimed that the Mann government was under debt of Rs 90 crore per day. “Within 630 days of AAP government, we have debt of Rs 90 crore per day. Deny this if you can,” said Sidhu to Mann.
Attacking the BJP government at the Centre, Sidhu said, “Lord Ram belongs to all and the Ayodhya temple should be celebrated by one and all. The people are waiting for establishment of Ram Rajya where there is justice and equality for poor, farmers, downtrodden and other lower sections of the society. But where is the Rs 15 lakh which PM Narendra Modi promised to deposit in each resident’s account after getting back black money from foreign shores.”
Meanwhile, Malvika Sood, said that they were neither informed about the event, nor invited. “There was no point attending when it wasn’t an official party programme. None from local leadership were kept in loop. Moreover, the organiser (Maheshinder Singh) has no link with Moga constituency. He belongs to Nihal Singh Wala and is a SAD MLA from Baghapurana. He held the rally in Moga without keeping us in loop due to which I had to submit a complaint against him,” said Sachar.
Sidhu’s parallel rallies, which had continued even when party’s state affairs in-charge Devender Yadav was on Punjab tour recently, have invited sharp criticism from PPCC chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring who had said that “indiscipline in the party won’t be tolerated.” Yadav had also said action will be taken against those who will indulge in indiscipline.
While Warring did not respond to calls or messages, PPCC general secretary in0charge Sandeep Sandhu who issued the notice Sunday, said, “One cannot hold any party event single-handedly or without keeping local heads in loop. If any such rally was being organised, it was their (Maheshinder Singh’s) duty to inform constituency in-charge (Malvika Sood Sachar). She is also district’s vice-president. Nor they invited any block presidents. Such acts build party’s poor image in eyes of people.”
Meanwhile, Maheshinder said that he would submit a detailed written reply to the notice. “But I would like to ask what crime did I commit by organising a rally for a senior party leader (Sidhu)? Why no such notices were issued to the organisers of his previous rallies in other districts? Even former PPCC president (Lal Singh) was present there so why only me who is being targeted,” he said."
73UVHVUXU5_D1DOBQS2A83YKYG,“Change is disquieting for those in positions of power and complacency”: Lakshmi Puri,Udbhav Seth,"January 26, 2024 15:07 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/books-and-literature/swallowing-the-sun-lakshmi-puri-book-interview-9128938/,"Set during the freedom movement, Lakshmi Puri’s Swallowing the Sun (Rs 899, Aleph) is about the encounter of India’s national story with unknown individuals, the constant tussle between revolution and reform, encapsulated in the gaze of Malati, a girl from a Maharashtrian village who grows up to know the cost at which independence — for herself and her country — comes. We speak to Puri on how the novel came about. Edited excerpts:
This novel wanted to be written for years, if not decades. I was born to parents who were 45 years old when I was born, so they belonged to a much older generation. I was a post-Independence child. And they belonged to the British Raj period and had contributed their might to India’s Independence struggle.
Their world and stories really fascinated me. I wanted to tell an epic story no one had told before, inspired by my parents’ odyssey. They were extraordinary people in multiple ways, and broke so many boundaries as a generation. They were feminists, believed in women’s emancipation, engaged with the British even while fighting them. They dealt with the dilemma of how the Western liberal values they admired were not adopted by the British in India, and could be used to gain independence.
Simultaneously, they had a fierce desire to reclaim their civilizational heritage and sense of the self. It was a period of tremendous cultural and literary efflorescence, especially in Maharashtra. This novel tries to recreate that Marathi ethos against the backdrop of the times through poetry, theatre, and music – and its invocation as a kind of soul force.
I wanted to write about what freedom and nation-building meant, to capture the levers and turning points of social transformation. I was in the United Nations and, within it, led a global organization on women’s empowerment. My passion and advocacy for the feminist cause resonates through the novel. Some characters were so avant-garde on gender relations, but while much has changed, much has not. It’s a book as much about and for young people to read.
I knew the kernel of three characters – Malati, Guru and Baba – and the rest grew around them like the silken threads of a cocoon. The characters emerged as if from nowhere and tangled around these three and led me on an uncharted journey. Everyone has a right to and potential for self-realization, and it’s up to us how we negotiate and eventually break the boundaries drawn for us. For instance, young people in my novel are constantly debating non-violent or armed resistance and whether the revolutionary way can serve the national cause best.
None of my women are trying to hold other women down except perhaps Ramabai. Even though the protagonist’s mother is the upholder of ‘Stri Dharma’, she never holds her two daughters back. Neither does Surekha resent the freedom these girls have once she’s married and settled in her relationship. Even Mai (Guru’s stepmother) is a rebel and enviously applauds Malati’s rebellion. They’re all trying to soar into the sky and swallow the sun, to make miracles happen whether they succeed or not. I’d say the same about Shaila, Chandra and Ambu Tai. Shanta Bai is a revolutionary in disguise. These women are always straining at the leash, trying to redraw boundaries for themselves.
Young people even today know that change happens in many ways, one of which is reform. Revolution doesn’t happen out of nothing. I wanted to capture that snowballing effect with the freedom struggle as a transformational moment. Though my characters aren’t Annie Besant, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, or BR Ambedkar, they were an integral part of achieving independence. It’s a call to young people today.
As a student of history, I developed my characters’ engagement with the freedom movement around its key events and leaders. Many of the book’s historical figures were from Ratnagiri, like Veer Savarkar, Maharshi Karve and Annie Besant. Madan Mohan Malviya had an association with Banaras. Some stories were based on what I heard from my family, and some on what I read. And some of it was imagined. For example, I discovered that my parents and Yusuf Meher Ali, who led the Simon Commission youth protests, were in the same Elphinstone College class and later in the same law college course. That’s how an episode of protest is born in the novel.
The story is partly set among the quiet masses of the British Raj. Political scientists comment on how this sense of a “cultural insult” was used by freedom fighters – many of whom feature in the novel – to turn the tide against the Empire. Have you seen this kind of discourse change in Indian politics over the years?
Of course, it has changed. It had already begun to change in the post-Independence era I was born in. It has evolved for 75 years and we are in a different era altogether, an era of renewed self-confidence and assertion of our identity, while reclaiming our civilizational heritage and rightful place in the world.
For example, in the narrative, enacting a patriotic play was contested. It was asserted as Vishnu’s chakra flying across as an expression of Gandhian satyagraha subduing the British Raj. But that image is now metamorphosed. We are already self-realized in so many ways. We have to strengthen that and move to a new stage of freedom and national achievement.
It’s a very powerful medium. As a child, I was exposed to vibrant Marathi theatre. In Delhi I had met my father’s friend Mama Warerkar, also a Rajya Sabha MP, whose iconoclastic plays like Bhumikanya Sita had deeply moved me. His revolutionary drama Satte Che Gulam (Enslavement of Power) is used in the play to illuminate nationalistic and social justice themes. I thought theatre could be Guru and Malati’s first act of patriotism, from which they get the zeal to plunge into the frenzy of satyagraha, braving lathi-charge on the docks of Bombay. It also encapsulates their love for each other and the country — that romance is combustive.
Because it seems to be a perennial conundrum, a strain between the comfort of the same place and change. Change is ever disquieting for those in positions of power and complacency. Look at a feudal character like Malak. He is educated and educates his own daughter. But then, a patriarchal mindset somehow returns. When she leaves her husband, it’s an earth-shattering moment for him. Perhaps he regrets even giving her the freedom he did. You see these tensions not just in those days, but today as well.
Of course. Baba is a classic case of someone who practices what he preaches. But whether it is patriarchy, caste system, or the freedom movement, the educated classes need to be true to themselves and the ideas they espouse. A young person asked me, “Why should we be so interested in the independence movement after being so removed from it?’ My answer is, to remember and never to forget the value of what you have. The remembrance transforms you and makes you more self-aware.
The story is rooted in Maharashtra but also pan-Indian, across rural and urban spaces. In urban privileged spaces there is a notion that we have moved beyond caste or gender discrimination. The characters here vary – some agree, some don’t.
It’s pan-Indian, set across Maharashtra, Desaikheda, Vaishali, Indore, Banaras, Simla and Delhi. Then or now, social and political reform is never complete. We really need to push the frontiers of women’s empowerment and a casteless society in every space because they envelop us repeatedly.
I was influenced by Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, William Shakespeare, EM Forster, James Joyce, Bernard Shaw. I’d also include TS Eliot, WB Yeats and Rabindranath Tagore. Among Indian writers in English, Raja Rao, RK Narayan, Manohar Malgonkar. Hindi writers like Premchand and Marathi poets that I have evoked in the novel are part of my literary consciousness.
Not as anchors. But I felt that Malati meeting Madan Mohan Malaviya or Mahatma Gandhi marked a milestone in their journeys by affirming her. Same for the youngsters’ meeting with Annie Besant as she went on to found the Mahila Mahavidyalaya. Or their encounter with Jiddu Krishnamurti. These connections between individual actions of the protagonists and the big players on the stage of India formed the tapestry I was trying to weave."

In a letter that was leaked on social media,  allegations of rape, sexual harassment and corruption were made against a Deputy Commissioner of Police and two police inspectors of the motor vehicle department.
A police source said, “The probe was transferred to the crime branch by the senior officers. Since sections of the IT Act were invoked in the FIR registered at Nagpada police, the cyber police that comes under the crime branch has been asked to probe the matter.”  The source added, “On Tuesday, DCP (Motor Transport) Nimba Patil had come to the Mumbai crime branch office and joined the probe.”
On January 9,a case was registered under sections 500 (defamation), 506 (criminal intimidation, 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 465 (forgery) of the IPC and under relevant sections of IT Act at the Nagpada police station against unidentified persons.
Police said that the case was filed for allegedly writing inaccurate details and submitting the same to the chief minister, deputy chief minister and other senior officials from the department.
The investigators further added that the letter is suspected to have been dispatched via Speed Post from Dadar.
The three-page letter, which was widely shared on social media in January alleged that the three officers had taken the eight woman constables to their official residence and sexually assaulted them.  It also said that some of the constables got pregnant following the incident.
Since the allegations against the three senior officials were serious in nature, the Mumbai Police initiated an inquiry.
Later when the eight women constable drivers informed that they had not written the letter, police authorities initiated an inquiry to identify the person who wrote the letter and circulated it. The Maharashtra State Commission for Women took cognizance of the matter Monday and issued a notice to the Mumbai police commissioner to conduct a probe and submit a detailed report to them."

Speaking at a public rally at Pimpri Chowk on Sunday, Thackeray said, “Several scams from Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have come to light. Administrators are calling the shots in civic bodies in the state as no elections have been held for two years. These administrators are directly under the state government but it has no control over them.”
Scams have become the order of the day everywhere, he alleged, adding, “In the Talathi exam, the paper leak scandal took place. I want to request the Chief Minister to ensure that those who indulged in the paper leak get life imprisonment. Can he do it? Those who play with the lives of our children should not go scot-free.”
Aaditya Thackeray also spoke about the pollution in the Indrayani river which flows through the city. “There should be effective coordination between different government departments. There is a need for serious efforts to make the sacred river free of pollution. Currently, there seems to be no such effort,” he said.
Criticising Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s visit to Davos to attend the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, the Sena leader said, “The chief minister went to Davos so that he can entertain himself in the ice there.”
He also sought to underline the party’s stand on Hindutva. “The Sena’s Hindutva is about having Ram in the heart and giving jobs to youths. Our Hindutva is about social work and not about playing caste cards,” Thackeray said."

The police team fired almost 11-12 rounds even as the gangsters fired back. Eventually, both gangsters, Abdul Kadir and Kuldeep, were caught after the latter sustained gunshot injuries.
According to police, Kadir and Kuldeep had allegedly gunned down 30-year-old Suraj Mann, brother of gangster Parvesh Mann, in his car outside his gym in the upscale Sector 104 market area in Noida.
Police said the duo, along with other gangsters belonging to the Bishnoi-Jitender Gogi gang, allegedly attacked Suraj to avenge an old murder and a 15-year-old property dispute.
During questioning, the accused revealed they were in contact with gangster Kapil Mann alias Kallu Kheda, who is presently lodged in jail, through one of his friends. Police said Parvesh and Kallu have a long-standing rivalry over a 100-yard of plot in their village in North Delhi’s Kehda Khurd, which spiralled into violence.
CP Amit Goel (Crime) said his team, led by ACP Umesh Barthwal, Inspectors Rampal and Yogesh Kumar, were closely tracking the movements of the assailants who were on the “lookout for their next target”.
On Sunday night, the team found that the accused were in Delhi and would come to Sarai Kale Khan bus stand to flee the city. “In the early hours of Monday, our team laid a trap near the bus stand. None of the locals were allowed in the area and our informers were activated. In the morning, the duo came on foot and we waylaid them. We tried to warn them but they fired at us. More than 12 bullets were fired. Inspector Yogesh was shot at but escaped injuries as the bullet grazed his jacket. We retaliated and fired at them. Both were injured and caught,” said an officer.
DCP Goel said the accused were involved in multiple thefts and robberies and were “used” by gangs to commit bigger crimes and indulge in gang rivalry. Police seized semi-automatic pistols from their possession. (reporter: Jignasa Sinha edited by Nikitha Phyllis)"

Addressing the students of Hindu College on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, she said the time has come for India to become economically ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) and march forward to become a developed nation by 2047.
Regretting that 60 years since Independence passed without any sense of urgency, Sitharaman said, “we have laid the material foundation for a Viksit Bharat” and empowering people by providing basic necessities to all.
Even earlier governments had schemes of providing houses, roads etc but the sense of urgency was missing, she said, adding, nearly 50 per cent of the population were devoid of fundamental things 50 or 60 years post independence.
“So that’s the underlying principle with which between 2014 and today we have done with a sense of urgency. Push the border forward, you take it further. Make sure everybody who’s actually eligible to get those should get it…the approach (of the government) is to empower people, skill people, give access and ensure that everyone gets good health treatment and so on,” she said.
She also said the government has been able to save Rs 2.5 lakh crore through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) by weeding out dummy and undesirable beneficiaries.
DBT has not only improved transparency in the government fund transfer but also enhanced efficiency through the use of technology, she said.
Stressing that the government doesn’t differentiate between people, Sitharaman said that is the reason why the prime minister categorises India in four groups–Youth, Women, Farmers and Poor– and efforts are made for betterment of these groups irrespective of caste, creed and religion. She also said that India is nearly self-sufficient as far as agriculture is concerned except in oil seeds and pulses.
However, she advocated that one should not waste food as many parts of the world are facing problems.
Terming Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha ceremony of January 22 as a ‘civilisational marker’, she said, this was a fortunate moment for the generation who could witness restoration of civilisational values. She urged the students to focus on skill development as well as on values — both civilisational and nationalistic.
Reminding students that the country celebrates National Voters’ Day on January 25, she said, it is not just the right of citizens to vote but it is their duty also, and the first-time voters have greater responsibility."
80HG1QQ4E1_03TL8X0S7BQ2QLI,Why a Chemistry professor suggested adding salt to tea for the perfect cup,_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 18:58 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/salt-in-tea-bitter-taste-effect-science-9127798/,"A new book on the science of tea has sparked online debates among Americans and the British on the best way to prepare the world’s second-most-consumed beverage (after water).
Author of the book ‘Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea’ and Chemistry professor Michelle Francl said in an interview to the UK news outlet Daily Mail on Wednesday (January 24), that a pinch of salt should be added to tea to reduce its slightly bitter taste. The UK’s Cabinet Office and the US Embassy in the UK also joined in on the ‘fight’, with the latter saying in a statement: “We want to ensure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain’s national shrink is not official United States policy. And never will be.”
In response, to the statement put out by the US Embassy in the UK:
We appreciate our Special Relationship, however, we must disagree wholeheartedly…
Tea can only be made using a kettle. https://t.co/Jt5xWKYRkT
— Cabinet Office (@cabinetofficeuk) January 24, 2024
Tea has long been seen as a beloved drink in Britain, ever since it first reached European shores from China in the colonial era. Meanwhile, the US is largely a nation of coffee drinkers, and the differences in preferences – along with the ways of preparing tea – have often been a source of friendly contentions.
Both tea and coffee have a slight bitterness to them (also described as being astringent). This is partially because of the compounds caffeine and tannin. The explanation behind why the salt tip seems to work for some seems to be related to how the human tongue experiences taste. Taste receptors are key cells in this regard.
“Humans perceive taste through thousands of tiny sensory organs called taste buds, which are located mostly on the upper surface of the tongue. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste cells, which contain molecules, known as receptors, that can detect each type of taste—sweet, bitter, sour, salty, or umami (savory). These taste cells then relay this information from the tongue to the brain,” according to Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).
CUIMC found in 2017 that signals sent by the tongue’s taste cells prevent the brain from confusing flavours such as bitter and sweet. So apart from the receptors, it is also the signals sent to the brain that affect the perception of taste. When salt and bitter compounds are mixed, according to earlier research, salt can help mask the bitterness. Salt is also used at times in baking, to help enhance the sweetness of an item. But how exactly does salt do this is not very well-known.
Francl said adding a pinch of salt helps because the “sodium ion in salt blocks the chemical mechanism that makes tea taste bitter.” A BBC report noted that her suggestion is not the first. She reportedly got the idea from “eighth century Chinese manuscripts”. “What is new is our understanding of it as chemists,” Francl said.
Many unusual things, according to the new book. Fracl’s work is reportedly a product of three years of research and experimentation. The book explores the more than 100 chemical compounds found in tea and “puts the chemistry to use with advice on how to brew a better cup,” its publisher says.
She says that firstly, the tea cup needs to be short and stout to conserve heat. It should be heated separately to “release more ‘aromatic compounds’”. Loose tea is preferable to teabags because it results in more room for tea leaves to circulate, and this enhances the fragrant compounds. She also discourages using microwaves, seemingly the preferred mode to make tea in the US.
Francl told The Guardian that in case tea bags are being used, they should be large for the same reason. They should be steeped in hot water quickly but with plenty of dunking and squeezing. This helps reduce the sour-tasting tannins (which lend the astringent flavour), created by caffeine dissolving slowly in water.
Finally, warmed milk should be added after pouring the tea to reduce the chance of milk curdling. Another tip was adding a small amount of lemon juice to remove the “scum” that sometimes floats on the surface of the drink, which is formed from chemical elements in the tea and water.
Francl writes in her book’s introductory chapter that “The chemistry of tea is also entwined with more fundamental discoveries in science.”
She recalls the history of how in 1902, Emil Fischer was awarded the second-ever Nobel Prize in Chemistry, “in part for his work on caffeine”. Francl adds: “In 1913, Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy had tea with another young scientist working at Manchester, Henry Moseley. de Hevesy wondered aloud if there was a way to follow the water molecules in the tea through his body… But 20 years later, with the help of Harold Urey’s gift of heavy water and a few dozen goldfish, not to mention liters of distilled urine, de Hevesy would crack the problem. The work would contribute to de Hevesy’s 1943 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of isotopic tracing—a phenomenon that has spawned such innovations as PET scans and methods for mapping ocean currents.”"

The commission was set up by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government in September to conduct a public inquiry into foreign meddling in Canadian affairs after reports of alleged Chinese attempts to influence elections and mounting pressure for an inquiry. Beijing has repeatedly denied any interference.
The commission said in a statement on Wednesday that it had requested the Canadian government to provide documents “relating to alleged interference by India related to the 2019 and 2021 elections.”
“The commission will also examine the flow of information within the federal government in relation to these issues, evaluate the actions taken in response, assess the federal government’s capacity to detect, deter, and counter foreign interference, and make recommendations on these issues,” it said.
The commission, led by Quebec Judge Marie-Josee Hogue, is charged with conducting an independent public inquiry into allegations of attempted foreign interference in Canadian affairs by China, Russia and others. It is expected to complete an interim report by May 3 and deliver its final report by the end of this year.
Diplomatic relations between India and Canada have frayed in recent months over Canada’s allegations linking Indian agents to the murder of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia last year. India has rejected that allegation. Canadian authorities have yet to charge anyone with the killing.
The Indian High Commission in Ottawa did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday."

Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari and senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha led a rally from Baikuntha Nath Mandir in the Burrabazar area of north Kolkata to the Ram temple at Central Avenue. The procession was taken out with tableaus and placards depicting Lord Ram and goddess Durga. Chou performers and women wearing yellow and red saris added colour to the procession.
“It is a historic day for the people of the country. Today a saffron tsunami has taken place across the nation,” said Adkhikari.
To mark the occasion, BJP leader and Midnapore MP Dilip Ghosh lighted a ceremonial lamp containing 27 kilos of ghee at the Balaji Temple at Kharagpur Old Settlement in Paschim Medinipur. He later participated in a Ram sankirtan event and distributed laddoos among devotees at the Gopali Ashram in the Kharagpur Rural constituency.
Ghosh accused the state’s TMC government of trying to stop people from celebrating the Ram temple inauguration. “The TMC’s all-faith harmony rally is an attempt to mislead the people. The country is busy celebrating the inauguration of Ram temple. But the TMC is trying to stop people from participating in such celebrations. By organising her rally today, (Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee has tried to divert attention from the historic event,” said the BJP leader.
Later in the day, Banerjee led an all-faith rally from Hazra to Park Circus. She started by visiting the Kali Temple in Kalighat. She will also visit a gurdwara, church and a mosque before the rally culminates."

Alyy recently appeared in the Netflix film The Archies and the Disney+ Hotstar series The Trial. He is also a regular face no Pakistani television. In an interview, he said that it is important for Pakistani actors to work abroad if they want to be successful.
Asked about his long history with India, Alyy said in an interview with Maliha Rehman, “I began my career in India, and whatever respect I earned in my career started from there. When I started working in Pakistan, I was already in a ‘nearly famous’ category. I didn’t have to face some of the problems that Pakistani actors do. Not only India, I had also worked in other industries around the world, so I had that experience.” But, he said, there’s some weight to the argument that Pakistani actors need to work abroad in order to be taken seriously. “Pakistan’s public doesn’t support its own people very easily. When actors go to India and they’re praised there, suddenly their value increases,” he said, adding that Pakistani artistes are very talented, and should be given opportunities in industries around the world.

Asked about the key differences between the film industries in India and Pakistan, the actor said, “People talk about budgets, but exposure is more important. There was a film called Bheja Fry. They made it for Rs 50 lakh, but it earned Rs 10 crore. They made a sequel for Rs 10 crore, but it didn’t do well. Budgets aren’t the only thing. You need people on set (to maintain order). In Pakistan, you go to a commercial shoot, the budgets are high. They want to shoot in magic light, and you arrive on set on time, but the way people work is still as ‘dheela’ as it used to be. You can forget all about magic light. The actual work isn’t happening the way it should happen.”
Alyy said that until a bigger pool of artistes isn’t trained, the same level of professionalism will not filter down to those with more ‘hands-on’ roles. He said that shoots that require 25 days often take 50, and there’s usually no issue with clashing dates because other projects are also delayed. Which is why he had to fly back to Pakistan every few days when he was working in India, and shoot solo because the Pakistani projects weren’t on schedule.

On January 20, Deepika Lokesh left her home in Manikyanahalli village on her scooter towards SET Public School in Melukote as usual. She finished work by 12 pm and left the school but never returned home, according to the police.
Deepika was married to Lokesh and the couple have an eight-year-old son. She was last seen fighting with a man in the foothills of Melukote, a police officer said. “Some tourists recorded the fight and later shared the video with us. We visited the place but only to find an abandoned Honda Dio scooter,” he added.
“We took the scooter to the police station and on the way, one of Deepika’s relatives identified the vehicle and asked why the scooter was being taken. After we told him that the scooter was found abandoned near the foothills, he said he would come to the police station with Lokesh to get it back,” said the police officer.
Lokesh filed a man-missing complaint with the Melukote police after she failed to return home by the evening. “As her mobile phone was switched off and it was last active at the same place, we did not get any leads,” the officer added.
Her family members noticed a lot of flies and ants where Deepika’s scooter had been found abandoned. When they dug a bit, they discovered her body and informed the police immediately.
A police officer part of the investigation told The Indian Express, “We have identified the person with whom Deepika was fighting on January 20. He is a distant relative of Deepika. Till the body was discovered, he was present in the village but is now absconding. We have formed teams to nab the accused.”
Mandya Superintendent of Police N Yatish visited the spot and conducted an inspection."

A man sitting next to her struck up a conversation with her, impressing her with his glib talk, offering to help her find a job in Delhi Cantt. Somewhere along the journey, he offered her a few sweets and snack items that she readily accepted. A few hours later, she found out that all her gold jewellery was stolen. What’s more, he also made her transfer Rs 23,000 to his account through UPI when she was not fully in her senses. Turns out, the snacks and sweets that the man, Ankit Choudhary, had offered her were laced with sedatives.
Following a complaint by the woman, the man was arrested by Delhi Police on Monday. Police found out that Choudhary, 30, was inspired by Ladies vs Ricky Bahl, a 2011 Bollywood film depicting the life of a conman specifically targeting women. During questioning, the accused informed police that he had targeted at least 10 women in the last two years on the pretext of job or marriage.
Buses and trains would be his preferred hunting grounds where he would target gullible women, charming them with his style of talking and impressing them with fake job titles and profile, said police. Choudhary would pose as a government officer or businessman living in Delhi Cantt area to impress the women, they added.
However, his run was cut short after Rashmi approached police. An FIR was filed against Choudhary under IPC sections pertaining to cheating.
“The woman approached the local staff and later joined the investigation last week,” said an officer.
Confirming Rashmi’s case, a police official said, “During the bus journey, he stole all her gold jewellery. He also made her transfer money through UPI when she was not in her senses.”
DCP (Southwest) Rohit Meena said that after the complaint, a team followed the route of the bus from Noida and checked multiple hotels and taxis, auto-rickshaws and bus stops. The staff also analysed footage from several markets in Delhi and finally found one showing the complainant with the accused.
“Technical surveillance was done and informers were deployed. On Monday, we were told that the accused would be coming to Kashmiri Gate Bus Terminal. The team laid a trap and managed to apprehend him before he could flee,” added DCP Meena.
The accused is a resident of Saharanpur, police said. Police said they found a necklace, and several rings, earrings and other gold articles in his bag. Many of these items belonged to the complainant. Police said they also traced the cheated money and recovered tablets of Alprazolam drug from his possession.
Police said that not only would Choudhary cheat women by lying to them but would also sedate them using Alprazolam tablets and rob all their valuables. Police have seized a leaflet of such tablets from his possession.
During interrogation, Choudhary confessed he would mainly target women in buses or trains, said police. DCP Meena said Choudhary would also drug his victims to rob them. “He was inspired by Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. He cheated them on the pretext of a job or marriage. He earlier used to work as a conductor/helper with truck drivers. He was caught last year from Bareilly in a similar case but got out on bail,” he said.
Officials said that Choudhary had disclosed his involvement in at least 10 similar cases. Police are looking for the women Choudhary targeted and have found three cases against him, said officials."
8MLXRRA83H_KNU0ONNGF46PCIJ,SC to hold special sitting today after Calcutta HC judge accused fellow judge of ‘acting for political party’,Ravik Bhattacharya,"Updated: January 28, 2024 11:19 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/calcutta-hc-judge-accuses-acting-political-party-9129267/,"A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court will hold a special sitting Saturday to consider the developments in the Calcutta High Court, where a judge accused a fellow judge of “acting clearly for some political party in this State” and requested the Chief Justice of India to look into the matter.
CJI D Y Chandrachud set up the bench comprising himself and the four most senior judges of the court – Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose – after taking suo motu cognisance of the developments on Friday.
On Thursday, a single-judge bench of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay of the Calcutta High Court had directed that a CBI investigation ordered into alleged irregularities in MBBS admissions in the state will continue, despite an order of a division bench to the contrary.
In the written order, he levelled accusations against a fellow judge, Justice Soumen Sen.
When contacted, Justice Sen declined to comment.
Justice Gangopadhyay had Wednesday ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in admission of MBBS candidates in state-run medical colleges and hospitals. However, the state government moved the division bench of Justices Sen and Uday Kumar, which ordered an interim stay on the single-bench order. The state government had made a verbal appeal before the division bench, which admitted the petition.
In his written order, Justice Gangopadhyay wrote, “Now I have to do something which is though unusual, but unless I do this, I think I will fail in my duty to hold the sanctity of judiciary in general and this court in particular. It is fully in respect of His Lordship, the Hon’ble Justice Soumen Sen”.
“I was told some days back by Justice Amrita Sinha that Justice Sen called her in his chamber on the last day before vacation, and like a political leader, he dictated Justice Sinha three things: i) Mr. Avishek Banerjee has a political future, he should not be disturbed; ii) Live-streaming shall be stopped in Justice Sinha’s court; iii) The two writ petitions before Justice Sinha, where the name of Mr. Avishek Banerjee is involved, are to be dismissed,” the order continued.
“Justice Sinha intimated this to me over telephone in vacation. Subsequently, Justice Sinha reported it to the Hon’ble Chief Justice of this High Court and I was told that the Hon’ble Chief Justice of this court has communicated this to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India,” he added in the order.
Justice Gangopadhyay added, “Thus, Justice Sen is acting clearly for some political party in this State and, therefore, the orders passed in matters involving the State are required to be relooked if the Hon’ble Supreme Court thinks so.”
Since 2022, Justice Gangopadhyay has ordered CBI probes in teacher recruitment scams and alleged irregularities in the recruitment process in the state. The investigations led to the arrest of former TMC minister Partha Chatterjee, senior officials, and recovery and seizure of movable and immovable property worth over Rs 100 crore.
On September 20, 2022, he gave an interview to a Bengali television news channel where he criticised the state government and the Trinamool Congress.
The matter subsequently reached the Supreme Court, which asked the Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court to reassign cases in school jobs scam from Justice Gangopadhyay to another judge. The SC also observed that judges cannot give interviews on pending cases.
Justice Gangopadhyay’s order from Thursday further states: “Today I am told by the Learned Advocates that Justice Sen has quashed the FIR already lodged by CBI, and called the Registrar General (Acting)… to know how the order of the Single Bench, despite stay order passed by the Division Bench, was communicated to CBI. In my order there was a clear direction in this regard.”
“What Justice Sen has done today is to advance the cause of his personal interest to save some political party in power in this State. Therefore, his actions clearly tantamount to misconduct,” Justice Gangopadhyay said in his order.
“I want to request the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India to look into… the matter as recorded above, that is, calling one Judge in his chamber and to dictate (to) her something, which is nothing but interference with the course of justice,” he said in the order and directed “the Registrar General to send a copy of this order to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India and to give a copy of this order to the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of this court.”
Justice Gangopadhyay further stated that “I am of the view that the order passed by Justice Sen’s Division Bench quashing the FIR today is not a valid order because it is a continuation of an appeal void ab initio and he has acted against the law with his own interest as has been indicated above. In the order passed by the Division Bench, I repeat, there is no recording as to the urgency of the matter. I do not know whether sky was falling upon some persons by order of CBI enquiry. Therefore, the FIR should remain intact because Justice Sen’s Division Bench’s order is wholly illegal and has to be ignored. CBI should start acting by investigating into the matter”.
Meanwhile, late Thursday evening, the Calcutta High Court came out with a new roster for the judges. According to the new roster, the division bench headed by Justice Sen will no longer hear recruitment-related cases and the same will now be heard by the division bench headed by Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty. The division bench headed by Justice Sen will now hear cases which were so far being heard by Justice Chakraborty."

Pro Vice-Chancellor Amitava Datta and a security guard were injured in a scuffle that followed.
According to sources, as university authorities did not grant permission to the ABVP to conduct the screening, members of the outfit assembled on the campus and chanted ‘Jai Shree Ram’ slogans. As the authorities led by Datta and some security guards tried to stop the students, a scuffle erupted between both parties which left Datta and the guard injured. They were taken to a local hospital for first aid.
Members of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), meanwhile, shouted counter-slogans at the ABVP members, leading to a minor scuffle. Later, the situation was brought under control by the security guards.
Following the incident, the gates were locked and no one was allowed inside the campus as semester exams were underway. SFI members alleged that the ABVP activists brought in outsiders to celebrate the consecration ceremony.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Tamalina Ghosh, a third-year student and a member of the Arts Faculty Students’ Union (AFSU), said, “The ABVP members did not have permission to hold any such event. They forcefully entered the campus with outsiders to disrupt the academic atmosphere in the campus. They also chanted the ‘Jai Shree Ram’ slogan. We don’t want the peaceful atmosphere of the university to be destroyed. Therefore, we strongly protest such hooliganism.”
To mark their protest, SFI students will hold a demonstration outside the JU campus later in the day.
There was no official reaction from the university authorities. However, JU Registrar Snehamanju Basu told officials that no major commotion took place.
The ABVP, meanwhile, said some students belonging to their outfit wanted to hold a live screening on the campus but were receiving threats from a section of the students.
The outfit’s Jadavpur unit leader Monoranjan Joardar said, “They are the students of the university. They wanted to celebrate the historic moment. They did not seek permission as it is a moment being celebrated across the country. They had faced some threats from a section of the students for planning to do this. But when they tried to hold their programme, they were stopped by the authorities and SFI members. We want the students to have the right to celebrate such moments.”
Joardar said the situation has normalised on the campus and there is no tension at the moment.
On Sunday, the All Bengal University Teachers’ Association (ABUTA) wrote to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Education Minister Bratya Basu and Governor C V Ananda Bose, voicing concerns over attempts to “hold religious activities on the campus which violates the secular spirit and has no relation with education and public interest.”"

At the same time, Nitish, however, also took a swipe at the Modi-led BJP government, saying that finally they (BJP) have also realised the importance of Karpoori Thakur.
Addressing a public meeting in Patna — organised by the JD(U) to commemorate the birth centenary of Karpoori — Nitish said: “PM called up Ramnath Thakur (Karpoori’s elder son and JD(U)’s Rajya Sabha MP) to share the news (about Karpoori being awarded the Bharat Ratna). I got the news through Ramnath ji. The PM did not call me. But I want to thank PM through press. Don’t say that he had given Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur because of sustained demands from us. Let him take full credit.”
The CM then said: “They (BJP) have finally realised that they cannot do without Karpoori Thakur. Unki ijjat karenge to unko bhi kuchh mil jayega (if they respect him, they, too will get something. As for me, I have been making the demand for Bharat Ratna for Karpoori Thakur since 2007 from whichever government came to power at the Centre. Finally, this government gave him the honour. We are very happy that our long-pending demand has been fulfilled.”
Pressing for separate reservations for the Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) at the national level on the basis of the Karpoori model, Nitish said: “Jan Nayak (Karpoori) had pioneered separate quotas for EBC and OBC by giving them 12% and 8% reservation respectively. Let there be the same model in the country.”
Highlighting Karpoori’s opposition to dynastic politics, the JD(U) supremo said, “Karpoori never promoted his family. It was only after his death, we pressured his son Ramnath to join politics. He is now Rajya Sabha MP and we respect him very much. Lekin aajkal to log parivar karte rahte hai… aaj log bahut parivar ko badhate rahte hai (these days, people keep promoting their family members in politics). But like Karpoori, I have not promoted my family in politics”. He, however, did not mention any names, even as his Mahagathbandhan allies like the RJD and Congress have often drawn fire from the BJP for allegedly promoting “dynastic politics”.
Elaborating how he assumed Karpoori’s legacy, Nitish said: “We often talk about Bapu (Mahatma Gandhi), Jayaprakash Narayan, Ram Manohar Lohia, B R Ambedkar and Karpoori Thakur. While Karpoori himself worked on the ideas of four great people, I have been also trying to follow Karpoori and others. I am into the 18th year as the CM and have done everything that furthers Karpoori’s legacy… EBC is more in numbers than OBC and they are also poorer – let Centre also work its policy around EBC and OBC lines”.
The CM also flagged the two-time CM Karpoori’s efforts for enforcing prohibition in Bihar. “Just when he (Karpoori) had been doing a host of good things, his government was pulled down,” he said, while also mentioning the Karpoori government’s achievements of taking electricity to every Bihar household besides ensuring potable drinking water across the state.
The Bihar BJP, which also commemorated Karpoori’s birth centenary, continued to distance itself from Nitish, with state BJP chief Samrat Choudhary saying that “There is no question of getting Nitish Kumar back in NDA”.
There have been speculations over growing strains in Nitish’s relations with the Opposition INDIA bloc for several days. Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi asked, “Why did RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who had been Union minister, not get Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur? It was Narendra Modi government that bestowed the honour on Karpoori. As for Nitish, media should stop making speculations. Nitish’s politics has been exhausted. He is a liability now”.
As the CM in 1978, Karpoori, who belonged to the EBC Nai community, implemented a layered reservation regime, which was then unparalleled. It provided a 26% reservation model in which EBCs got 12% quota, OBCs got 8%, women got 3%, and economically backward classes (EBWs) from among upper castes got 3%.
The Modi government’s decision to confer the Bharat Ratna on Karpoori barely a couple of months before the Lok Sabha polls indicated the BJP’s attempt to stake claim over his legacy. It also signalled the BJP’s bid to blunt the campaigns of its Bihar rivals, the JD(U) and RJD, which have been raising the social justice pitch by keeping Karpoori at the fulcrum of their EBC and OBC politics.
The Nitish dispensation’s move to conduct a caste survey in Bihar last year after the Centre brushed aside its demand for a nationwide caste census put the BJP on the back foot.
By deciding to bestow the Bharat Ratna on Karpoori, the Modi government has tried to turn the tables on the Mahagathbandhan now."
8Q1EG1MR4S_5WC5YJJ5BVYEGZC,"At this election, an owl, chinkara and tamarind are the clear winners",Anuradha Mascarenhas,"Updated: January 24, 2024 21:22 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/at-this-election-an-owl-chinkara-and-tamarind-are-the-clear-winners-9126225/,"There has been no shortage of superstitions surrounding this nocturnal bird. Still, for people in Pingori, a small village located in the Sahyadri mountain range in Purandar tehsil of Pune district, an owl has always been a farmer’s friend. The bird went on to garner the most votes at a unique election where people came together to select their village icon.
Along with the owl (bird category), villagers rooted for chinkara (in the mammals category) and tamarind (in the trees category) as their “village icon”at a novel election held on January 20.
The aim was to promote nature conservation and inculcate a sense of pride in biodiversity.
So the villagers, whose forefathers were mainly soldiers, cast their vote in ballot boxes that were kept in secret polling booths.
Identity cards were confirmed by the polling officers who were mainly school teachers from the village and upon casting their vote, in true polling style, fingers were inked.
An election campaign that lasted for eight days had two groups – The Sun and The Moon — visiting each house to pitch for their respective candidates. The mottled wood owl had to face grey francolin for the top spot of the village icon. At the same time, among mammals, it was a battle between the chinkara and striped hyena . Among the trees category villagers had to decide between the tamarind and banyan.
A total of 610 villagers including children (from class 5 students) , teachers, homemakers and farmers dressed up in their best clothes and gathered at Ela Habitat — a field research centre for the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau — run by the Ela Foundation to cast their votes. According to Sachin Shinde, a villager who was also part of this coordinated activity, 420 villagers voted for Owl as against 241 for the grey francolin.
Indian gazelle or chinkara garnered 470 votes vis a vis the striped hyena and tamarind was favoured by 356 villagers as against 299 who cast their vote for the banyan tree. Another 80 villagers who have settled in Pune, Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra decided to cast their vote via an online form. The sealed ballot boxes were later opened and votes were counted in front of the student representatives and chief polling officer.
Dr Satish Pande, founder of the Ela foundation which works on nature education and conservation, told The Indian Express that after years of conservation awareness programmes – especially for owls and mammals, habitats and trees, the response to this novel election was a heartening experience.
Ela Habitat, the public outreach centre of Ela Foundation is located in this remote mountain village of Pingori and recently completed 10 years of social and conservation service. “Hence we decided to conduct this unique election,” Dr Pande said.
Dr Pande along with Rajkumar Pawar, rural outreach coordinator of Ela Foundation, soon involved all the villagers including retired soldiers, tribals, shepherds and marginalized community members to participate in the activity. “It was extremely satisfying to find that superstitious beliefs regarding the owl were set aside and the bird was elected as the village icon,” Dr Pande said.
The nature conservationist now plans to write about this unique initiative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and how if emulated across the country can help step up conservation awareness efforts."
8XZRZ4LD8Y_EUSC063E34JZQ7F,Khakee: Did Amitabh Bachchan’s progressive police epic inspire the James Bond blockbuster Skyfall?,Rohan Naahar,"Updated: January 27, 2024 13:49 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/khakee-did-amitabh-bachchan-progressive-police-epic-inspire-skyfall-9117256/,"Fans of Vikramaditya Motwane’s Bhavesh Joshi Superhero lapped up a recent reel comparing it to Matt Reeves’ The Batman. Granted, it was mostly restricted to superficial similarities between the two superhero movies (and some very basic thematic connections), but the evidence was so compelling that one couldn’t help but take it seriously. Nobody, however, has made such a reel about Rajkumar Santoshi’s cop epic Khakee, which has such specific overlaps with the James Bond film Skyfall that you could almost picture director Sam Mendes having caught it on opening night in Mumbai.
If Pritam can lift the music of an obscure Indonesian band and avoid drawing suspicion, then why can’t the Oscar-winning Mendes pull the same move on an Indian film? Of course, it’s entirely possible that this is all just a giant coincidence, but that wouldn’t be any fun to discuss, would it? Skyfall was released nearly a decade after Khakee, emerging as the highest-grossing Bond film of all time. Unlike earlier instalments of the storied franchise, the film presented a more intimate portrait of Bond, revealing information about his past that we didn’t know before.

The climax, for instance, was staged at Bond’s childhood home, where he faced off against the villainous Silva — a disgruntled former MI6 agent with a bone to pick against his old boss, M. Designed like a Western siege, the scene takes place mainly inside Bond’s mansion, before spilling out onto the property’s sprawling grounds. A near-identical sequence, would you believe, unfolds just before the interval in Khakee, the star-studded 2004 film that combined the grittiness of Ram Gopal Varma’s Satya with old-fashioned Bollywood masala.
In Khakee, a veteran cop named Anant Srivastava (Amitabh Bachchan) is tasked with putting together a crack team to escort a suspected terrorist from a small town to neighbouring Mumbai, where he will stand trial for his alleged crimes. This is a quintessentially Western set-up, seen in such films as 3:10 to Yuma, and more recently, in Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight. Despite finding the time for a CGI-fuelled dance number — “Dil Dooba” — Anant and his team recognise the danger they’re in, and proceed determinedly on their perilous journey to Mumbai. They’re tailed by a mysterious villain who keeps taunting them with polite greetings, and sounds an awful lot like he’s about to endorse mouth freshener.
This man is Aangre, played by Ajay Devgn in a rare villainous turn. He wears a plain jacket over an even plainer vest, but his most striking feature — besides a hairdo that makes it seem as if he’s just been to the salon — is a pair of sunglasses that the Gen Z has recently made fashionable again. Along the way, Anant and his team are ambushed by Aangre, and having sustained considerable damage, forced to retreat to a secluded mansion.
The staging, structure, and even the stakes of this centre-piece sequence are uncannily similar to Skyfall’s climax. For starters, when Anant and his team arrive at the mansion, they’re greeted by an old caretaker. In Skyfall, Bond and M are also welcomed to the property by its old gamekeeper, played by Albert Finney. As they batten down the hatches, preparing for Aangre’s inevitable assault, the mood is tense. The protagonists are cornered, as gunfire pulverizes the windows. It is in this scene that Aangre removes his shades to reveal a grotesquely disfigured face, like all the most memorable Bond villains, including Silva.
But what’s most striking about all of this is Aangre’s backstory. Anant, who has lived on the principles of ‘zameer’ and ‘vivek’, discovers that Aangre was an old colleague of his in the police, and was dishonourably discharged for often taking the ‘extra-judicial’ route to dispensing justice. Haranguing Anant days before his retirement is his way of getting back at him. In Skyfall, Javier Bardem’s disgraced former agent Silva also has a personal score to settle M, who threw him under the bus for taking the law into his own hand.
Interestingly, the one key area in which Khakee differs from Skyfall is its general progressiveness. While the Bond movie, despite its many achievements, had an almost romantic view of the UK’s colonial past, Khakee was positively progressive, not only for 20 years ago, but even by today’s standards. But that isn’t saying much, considering the stronghold that Rohit Shetty’s ‘copaganda’ films occupy in culture. It’s no coincidence that Khakee was co-written by Sridhar Raghavan, one of the key creative forces behind last year’s sneakily subversive Pathaan, and the more recent (and even more radical) Tiger 3.

One of the primary themes of Khakee is Islamophobia — Anant and the gang unites in not only defending, but also preserving the honour of a Muslim man falsely accused of terrible crimes. It preempted Kafeel Khan’s story in its characterisation of the doctor Ansari, played by Atul Kulkarni, years before Jawan. And that’s the lasting impression that the movie leaves you with. The Skyfall conspiracy theories are momentarily amusing, but the image of Amitabh Bachchan lecturing a violent mob about the Constitution will remain for eternity. As they say, only in the movies…

8Y6OIRTPAY_TFMJCZWKSIL5BB4,Saudi Arabia prepares to open first alcohol store for diplomats,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 18:08 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/saudi-arabia-prepares-open-first-alcohol-store-diplomats-9125881/,"Saudi Arabia is preparing to open its first alcohol store in the capital Riyadh which will serve exclusively non-Muslim diplomats, a source familiar with the plans and a document showed on Wednesday.
Customers will have to register via a mobile app, get a clearance code from the foreign ministry, and respect monthly quotas with their purchases, the document said.
The move is a milestone in the kingdom’s efforts, led by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to open the ultra-conservative Muslim country for tourism and business as drinking alcohol is forbidden in Islam. It is also part of wider plans known as Vision 2030 to build a post-oil economy.
The new store is located in Riyadh’s Diplomatic Quarter, a neighbourhood where embassies and diplomats reside and will be “strictly restricted” to non-Muslims, the document said.
It was unclear if other non-Muslim expatriates will have access to the store. Millions of expatriates live in Saudi Arabia but most of them are Muslim workers from Asia and Egypt.
A source familiar with the plans said the store is expected to open in the coming weeks. Saudi Arabia has strict laws against drinking alcohol which can be punishable by hundreds of lashes, deportation, fines, or imprisonment and expatriates also face deportation. As part of the reforms, whipping has largely been replaced by jail sentences.
Alcohol has been available only through diplomatic mail or on the black market.
The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.
State-controlled media reported this week that the government was imposing new restrictions on alcohol imports within the diplomatic consignments, which may boost demand for the new store.
The new regulation will curb imports to counter “improper exchange of special goods and alcoholic beverages received by the embassies of non-Muslim countries inside Saudi Arabia”, Arab News daily reported on Sunday.
Saudi Arabia, which was relatively closed off for decades, has in recent years relaxed strict social codes, such as segregating men and women in public places and requiring women to wear all-covering black robes, or abayas.
Prince Mohammed’s tightening grip on power has been accompanied by changes which included opening the country for non-religious tourism, concerts and allowing women to drive, as well as a crackdown on dissent and political rivals.
Vision 2030 also includes developing local industries and logistics hubs, and aims at adding hundreds of thousands of jobs for Saudi nationals."

But it said that the Congress’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra event in Purnea on January 30, where party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is scheduled to share the stage with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) founder Lalu Prasad, should have been held under the banner of the Opposition alliance and not the Congress.
“Our main focus is ensuring a grand success of the Karpoori Thakur centenary celebrations on Wednesday. People should stop making speculation about our alliance,” said JD(U) national spokesperson K C Tyagi. “Had it (January 30 event) been an INDIA bloc rally, it would have given a very good message about our unity. It is not important if allies join Rahul Gandhi’s Nyay Yatra or not, it is important to hold joint INDIA bloc meetings from district to state to national levels.”
Asked if the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance looks better prepared for the Lok Sabha elections, Tyagi said, “The BJP does look better prepared even though they too have not done seat-sharing. They have been also trying to encash the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration wave. The BJP must realise that Ram represents India’s cultural and religious ethos and does not belong to any party or ideology.”
The JD(U) leader’s clarification that there was no sign of any rift in the Bihar alliance or the national INDIA bloc came on a day when Nitish Kumar visited the Raj Bhavan to meet Governor R V Arlekar, triggering buzz that all was not well in the ruling coalition in Bihar. Nitish, accompanied by state finance minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, held discussions with Arlekar for more than 40 minutes. Later in the day, government sources clarified that the CM met the Governor to discuss pending appointments of vice-chancellors in at least six universities in the state. The governor is the ex-officio chancellor of the universities.
Sources in the RJD said they were not “overtly worried about what is being said and written through various media platforms”. An RJD leader said, “We know for sure that the Mahagathbandhan is intact. We are also in an advanced stage of seat-sharing talks. One should also ask the NDA about seat sharing.”
Asked if there was any pressure on the RJD from the CM on the issue of simultaneous polls, another party functionary said, “The CM had expressed this desire but our party is not in its favour. There is not too much to read into it.”"

The student, dressed in convocation attire, approached the teacher and bowed down to touch their feet—an ancient Indian custom symbolising deep respect and gratitude.
The act was met with a mixture of surprise and applause from the audience, as many were unfamiliar with the cultural significance of the gesture.
The student’s chant of ‘Jai Siya Ram,’ a phrase associated with reverence for Lord Ram, added a spiritual dimension to the event.
The video shared on social media platform X had the caption, “Be proud of your roots, values and culture – Student touches feet of the teacher and chants ‘Jai Siya Ram’ at Convocation Ceremony in Leicester, UK.”

Banerjee made these remarks during a programme at Raj Bhavan to celebrate the 75th Republic Day. Banerjee said, “If the central government does not clear the funds, then we (TMC) will initiate a massive protest.” According to West Bengal government’s figures, the Centre owes the state Rs 9,330 crore under the PMAY, Rs 6,900 crore under MGNREGA, Rs 830 crore under National Health Mission, Rs 770 crore under PM Gram Sadak Yojna, Rs 350 crore under the Swachh Bharat Mission, Rs 175 crore for mid Day Meals, as well as money under other schemes.
Banerjee had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 20, and discussed the issue of pending central funds. After the meeting, she said Modi proposed that officials from state and Centre can sit together and clear the issues. Earlier this week, a team of state government officers visited New Delhi to meet their central counterparts.
According to officials, they submitted a detailed report on alleged irregularities in the 100 days’ work scheme and the measures taken to address them. The delegation also met Union ministry of rural development secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh.
In November, TMC MLAs led by the party chief had staged a protest within the state assembly premises against the delay in the release of central funds by the Modi government.
Earlier, the party’s national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee, led a protest dharna at Rajghat in New Delhi on Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary, demanding the release of funds by the Centre."

There have been quite a few reports of tension and a growing rift between the two parties over the past few weeks, and the JD(U) and other parties of the INDIA alliance have also had differences.
* Comments of Lalu’s daughter
The latest point of friction was Nitish’s remarks on Wednesday in which he appeared to target dynastic rule while paying homage to former Bihar CM and socialist icon Karpoori Thakur at his centenary celebrations.
“Karpoori never promoted his family,” Nitish said at a public meeting in Patna on Wednesday. “It was only after his death, we pressured his son Ramnath to join politics. He is now Rajya Sabha MP and we respect him very much. Lekin aajkal to log parivar karte rahte hai … aaj log bahut parivar ko badhate rahte hai (these days, people keep promoting their family members in politics). But like Karpoori, I have not promoted my family in politics.”
Though Nitish did not name any party, the BJP has targeted the RJD and the Congress in the past for allegedly promoting “dynastic politics”. On Thursday, Lalu’s Singapore-based daughter Rohini Acharya posted, subsequently deleted, on social media platform X: “Samajwadi purodha hone ka dawa karta wahi dawa hai, hawaon ki tarah badalti jinki vichardhara hai (One whose ideology changes with the direction of the wind claims to be the patron of socialism).” There was also said to be little interaction between Nitish and Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav at Thursday’s Cabinet meeting, which went on for about just 20 mins.
* Changing the Education Minister
The RJD is said to have sensed unease in the Mahagathbandhan and on January 20 readily agreed to replace Chandra Shekhar with Alok Kumar Mehta as the Education Minister to not ruffle Nitish’s feathers. Chandra Shekhar was known for making controversial remarks — from referring to some verses of the Ramcharitmanas as “casteist” and “potassium cyanide” to backing fellow RJD MLA Fateh Bahadur Kushwaha on his remarks against Hindu goddess Saraswati — and his relegation was seen more as a matter of the RJD seeking peace with Nitish than to effect a change for better governance.
* Simultaneous polls a point of friction?
On the evening of January 20, Nitish rejigged the team of national office-bearers of the JD(U). He announced a 21-member team, dropping six of the party’s seven Lok Sabha MPs from it. Some of them are said to be close to former party national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh or Lalan Singh who lost his post to Nitish last month amid reports that the CM had been upset with him over his alleged proximity to Lalu Prasad.
Lalan Singh’s removal as JD(U) chief was said to have not gone down well with Tejashwi cancelling his official Australia tour, which was to begin on January 6. A key RJD leader said the party “did not want to take any chances by sending its key leader out of the country at a time with the uncertainty in state politics”.
Sources in the RJD and JD (U) at the time said Nitish had been “pressuring” Lalu to agree to simultaneous Assembly polls along with the Lok Sabha elections slated for April-May. Nitish is said to have come under increasing pressure from within his party to go for synchronised elections so that the party could improve on its tally of 43 constituencies in the 2020 Assembly elections, when it emerged as the third-largest party behind the RJD and the BJP.
“Nitish looks desperate for simultaneous polls because he is afraid of exodus in his party. But why should we force Assembly polls on the state one-and-a-half years before schedule?” an RJD leader said at the time.
* Credit for jobs and hospitals
The Bihar government on January 20 also put out a full-page advertisement in local newspapers about the state health department’s key initiatives, which did not make any reference to Tejashwi, who holds the health portfolio among other ministries.
The ad said that while Bihar previously had only six medical colleges (until the Lalu-led RJD’s tenure in 2005), the state now had 15 medical colleges and hospitals and that the government had sanctioned another 15 medical colleges and hospitals for the future. “Everyone knows health is the key department under RJD. Even if there is no photograph of the health minister with the ad, there should have been a mention of the health minister,” an RJD leader told The Indian Express at the time.
There was also unease in the alliance over credit for the jobs generated by the government. On January 13, the Bihar government ran advertisements on its employment drive with the slogan: “Rojgar Matlab Nitish Kumar (employment means Nitish Kumar).” That day, appointment letters were distributed to 96,823 teachers offline and virtually. The CM, at an event at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan, handed out appointment letters to 12 teachers.
“Everyone knows that the 10-lakh jobs initiative was our idea and promise during the 2020 polls,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari told The Indian Express back then. “We should have been given equal credit and a picture of the deputy CM should have been included in the government advertisement. People know that it is the Nitish-Tejashwi government and not just a Nitish Kumar government. The employment drive is our baby and it cannot be hijacked.”
In November 2023, during the first phase of the teachers’ mass recruitment, the government appointed 1,20,336 teachers. The state government claims to have achieved a teacher-student ratio of 1:5, with 51 women teachers being among the newly appointed ones in the two phases.
* Differences in INDIA alliance
The lack of consensus in the Opposition alliance may have also played a role in pushing Nitish away and led him to question his future with the grouping. He turned down an offer to become its convener till there was agreement on his role. Last year, he had taken the initiative to get all the anti-BJP parties together on a common platform, helping in the formation of the INDIA bloc.
The Bihar CM is said to have always pushed for a consensus regarding his role in the coalition, but a meeting between West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal last month before the meeting of the INDIA bloc in Delhi is said to have strengthened his reservations. He was said to have been left upset with Banerjee proposing Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge’s name for leader of the alliance.”
Kharge’s statement earlier this month that the INDIA alliance would meet in “10 to 15 days” to make decisions about key posts did not sit well with the JD(U) that claimed that the INDIA alliance was “running out of time and ideas” to outthink the BJP. “INDIA is still in a confused state. What if Lok Sabha polls are announced soon after the Ram Temple opening? We still do not have clarity on seat-sharing, agenda, and leadership roles,” JD(U) spokesperson K C Tyagi told The Indian Express at the time."
99VRWSZ4V9_SMTF6IO6S1OTLRE,"Decode Politics: In Yatra clashes, signs of Rahul-Himanta bad blood",Manoj C G,"Updated: January 24, 2024 04:25 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/decode-politics-yatra-clashes-rahul-himanta-bad-blood-9123962/,"EVER SINCE Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra entered Assam, there have been constant skirmishes between Congress leaders and crowds wielding BJP flags or the police. From the march route, to Rahul’s thwarted plans to visit a revered shrine around the same time as the Ram Temple consecration, and the face-off with the police in Guwahati on Tuesday, the Yatra has faced hiccups, unlike its smoother run even through conflict-hit Manipur.
A sideshow has been the war of words between Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Rahul – a script that sounds familiar to many in the Congress. Since he left the Congress to join the BJP in 2015, Sarma has been scathing about his former party, particularly Rahul, making it difficult to separate the personal from the political in their Yatra encounters.
The bitter history
A long-time Congress leader and one of the party’s most prominent Assam faces, Sarma had a bitter parting of ways with the party after he saw his ambitions curtailed in favour of former CM Tarun Gogoi’s son Gaurav. Sarma’s appeals to the high command also went unanswered, with Gaurav seen as part of Rahul’s inner circle.
In an autobiography released last year, another former Congress leader, Ghulam Nabi Azad, wrote that it was Rahul who blocked Sarma’s elevation as CM.
In the book Azaad, Azad said he was asked to go to Assam as an observer by then Congress president Sonia Gandhi when Sarma revolted against Gogoi “sometime during Gogoi’s third term”. “I called Himanta and his group to Delhi; he came with 45-plus MLAs to my residence… A few days later, I asked Gogoi to come to Delhi or send his MLAs. He sent seven MLAs who were supporting him… I reported the situation to Sonia ji, who remarked that it was obvious that Himanta had a clear majority and should be the new CM. She asked me to go to Assam the following day along with the general secretary in-charge and oversee the formal election of Himanta as the new leader. The evening before we were to proceed to Assam, Rahul, who had not been in the loop of deliberations so far, telephoned me with a request to cancel the visit to Assam. Instead, he asked me to visit his home the next morning along with the general secretary in charge of Assam.”
Azad added: “When we arrived at Rahul’s residence the next morning, we saw Tarun Gogoi and his son, Gaurav Gogoi, sitting with him. Rahul told us bluntly that there would be no change in leadership. We pointed out to him that Himanta had the majority of MLAs and would rebel and quit the party. ‘Let him go,’ Rahul said. The meeting was over.”
The senior leader said that he then met Sonia and told her what had happened. “Despite understanding the disastrous consequences that lay ahead, it is rather unfortunate that she did not assert herself as the party president. Instead, she asked me to request Himanta to not rock the boat.”
Sarma’s departure story
Since leaving the Congress, one anecdote that Sarma frequently recounts is a meeting with Rahul where the senior Congress leader appeared more interested in feeding biscuits to his pet dog ‘Pidi’ while he and others wanted to discuss Assam’s issues.
Sarma uses the story to underline how removed the Congress high command is from its own senior leaders.
Post-exit
In 2017, Rahul appeared to hit back at Sarma with a tweet of a video of Pidi doing Namaste while standing up on its haunches to accept a treat, adding: “Ppl been asking who tweets for this guy… I’m coming clean… it’s me… Pidi..I’m way (cooler) than him. Look what I can do with a tweet… oops… treat!”
Sarma, then a minister in the Sarbananda Sonowal government, responded: “Sir @OfficeOfRG, who knows him better than me? Still remember you busy feeding biscuits 2 him while we wanted to discuss urgent Assam’s issues.”
In 2021, at an Indian Express Adda, Sarma had again elaborated on the meetings he had had with Rahul. He said it was Sonia who had advised him to meet Rahul after he resigned as a minister from the Tarun Gogoi government in 2014.
“I met him once. That meeting was also very, very disgusting. But I did not make it public,” he said. On why it was disgusting, he said: “Because if I raise something, Mr Rahul Gandhi would say, ‘So what?’… I was there with him for 20 minutes… and I heard the word ‘so what’ not less than 50 times.”
Then he again spoke about their “famous” meeting “because of that character called Pidi”. “We went there with a conciliatory move…Mr C P Joshi… he had somehow brought a kind of a peace formula. So me, Mr Tarun Gogoi, Mr C P Joshi, Mr Anjan Dutta… we all went to meet Mr Rahul Gandhi. We started saying that elections are nearing, Assam has great potential, we can defeat the BJP… But I saw that Rahul was not interested in the meeting from the very beginning. He was playing with that dog.”
Sarma added: “Anyway, at some point of time, we were served tea and biscuits. The dog went up to the table and picked up one biscuit from the plate. So Rahul looked at me and he started smiling. So I was thinking why was he smiling, I waited with my cup, thinking that Rahul will push the calling bell and ask someone to change the plate. I waited for five minutes… After some time, I saw Mr Joshi, Gogoi all started taking biscuits from the same plate and started eating.”
According to Sarma, “I was not a frequent visitor there, but then I realised that this must be normal for everybody. This happens in all the meetings. That day I realised that enough was enough and you cannot stay with that person anymore. But having said that, I am grateful to Mr Rahul Gandhi — I would not have become the CM had it not been him, who literally shunted me out of the Congress party. If I am in this position today, it is because of that famous meeting. And also because of the fact that Rahul Gandhi did not appreciate me being in the Congress.”"

A single-judge bench of Justice Sanjeev Narula, in its January 18 interim order, said it appeared that the website was “attempting to monopolise the consecration event by preying on the public’s religious beliefs and devotion and deceiving them into transferring money” to the site’s proprietors using the goodwill of the plaintiff Khadi and Village Industries Commission.
The high court, in its prima facie opinion, observed that the marks of defendants 1 and 2, Khadi organic, are deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s Khadi mark. It thereafter restrained the owners of the website from “manufacturing, selling, exporting, advertising” any goods/services under the marks Khadi Organic which is “identical or deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s registered KHADI marks” amounting to infringement of the commission’s marks, till the next date of hearing.
“Defendant No. 3 shall suspend the operation of the domain name/website ‘www.khadiorganic.com’ registered by them and shall also maintain status quo with regards to the ownership of the said domain name. Defendants No. 1 and 2 shall take down their social media pages mentioned in paragraph No. 25 of the application and/or any other pages active on social media platforms that use any mark identical or deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s registered KHADI marks,” Justice Narula directed.
The Khadi and Village Industries Commission had moved the high court in a trademark infringement lawsuit claiming that they had adopted the trademark “KHADI” in 1956 and have been continuously using the same for their products including soaps, food products, grocery items etc, ever since. These products are sold through retail outlets, exhibitions, their website and other third-party e-commerce websites. It also has a considerable social media presence and operates a mobile application by the name of “KHADI INDIA”, the plaintiff said.
The commission claimed that this month they came across a reel/ video posted on Instagram advertising a website ‘www.khadiorganic.com’ for the delivery of free prasad from the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. As per the information hosted on the homepage of the aforesaid website, members of the public who are desirous of obtaining the “Ram Mandir Prasad” for free, could place their orders by filling up a form provided on the website. For such delivery, a charge of Rs 51 is sought from Indian customers, and USD 11 from foreign customers, it argued.
The commission claimed that it had learnt that Defendant No. 1, Ashish Singh, had established the brand “KHADI ORGANIC” which is a part of the Defendant No. 2 company, M/s DrillMaps India Private Limited.
The high court issued a summons on the commission’s lawsuit as well as a notice in its application for interim relief and listed the matter for hearing on May 27."

Thakur certainly was one, but during his lifetime, the Sangh Parivar fought against him relentlessly – and vice versa.
Karpoori Thakur belongs to the Indian socialist tradition. He took part in the Quit India Movement as a Congress Socialist Party member in his home state, Bihar, the crucible of the socialist movement in India as well as of the leftist version of kisan politics. In fact, he was the joint secretary of the Bihar Kisan Committee between 1948 and 1952, the year when he was elected as MLA for the first time.
When the Socialist Party split, Thakur joined the Samyukta Samajwadi Party (SSP). He was a supporter of Ram Manohar Lohia who promoted positive discrimination or quotas for the lower castes. Thakur belonged to one of them. In contrast to most of his then comrades, he belonged to the jati of the nais (barbers). In 1967, he popularised the Lohiaite slogan – “Socialists ne bandhi gath/Pichda pave sau me sath (Socialists are now determined to get 60 per cent reservation)”.
That year, the SSP jumped from 6 to nearly 18 per cent of the votes and from 7 to 68 seats. The Opposition parties – the communists, the Jana Sangh and the socialists – formed a coalition called Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD, the united parliamentarian group), of which the SSP was the largest component. A former high caste (Kayasth) Congressman, Mahamaya Prasad Sinha, became the chief minister, but the deputy chief minister was no one else but Karpoori Thakur, who was also the education minister. In this capacity, he removed English as a compulsory subject for matriculation and promoted Hindi in order to democratise education. The SVD government, in five months, could take other significant measures, such as the abolition of land revenue.
Thakur became chief minister of Bihar in 1970, two years after the first OBC socialist CM in the state, B P Mandal. However, Thakur remained at the helm of the government of Bihar for only six months as the SVD coalition disintegrated: The Jana Sanghis and the leftists disagreed on too many topics and “anti-Congressism” – Lohia’s motto – was not strong enough as a cementing force to surmount this division.
A similar scenario repeated itself in the 1970s – with many more lessons that are relevant today. In 1977, the Janata Party swept the polls in Bihar – like elsewhere in the Hindi belt – and Thakur became CM again. His government, for the first time in the state, had much more OBCs (42 per cent) than upper-caste members (29 per cent). In 1978, before the formation of the Mandal Commission, Thakur announced new quotas for Bihar, on the basis of the Mungeri Lal Commission, that had been appointed by a Congress CM, Daroga Lal Rai, in 1971 and which had submitted its report in 1976. Following the Mungeri Lal Commission’s report, Thakur distinguished between Other Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes for the first time. He introduced quotas of respectively 8 and 12 per cent for these two groups.
Upper castes immediately opposed this reform. Their demonstrations were supported by the Jana Sanghis who were supposed to support Thakur as a component of the Janata Party. They finally withdrew their support to Thakur’s government on April 19, 1979, and provoked the fall of the government, with the help of a group of Scheduled Caste MLAs close to Jagjivan Ram, the then deputy chief minister. This episode illustrated the persistence of what American political scientist Paul Brass called the “coalition of extremes”, that associated upper castes and Dalits who were both afraid of the rise of the OBCs/ MBCs.
This coalition immediately found another expression in the formation of a new government, headed by Ram Sunder Das (a Dalit), but comprising of 50 per cent upper caste and only 20 per cent of OBCs; not even one representative from Most Backward Classes (MBCs) was part of it. This government amended Thakur’s reservation policy by deducting from the quotas of the SCs, STs, OBCs and MBCs the posts that members of these groups got via the “General” category. But Thakur had prepared the ground for the reservation policy which was to culminate in V P Singh’s Mandal moment, another occasion for the Sangh Parivar to criticise what The Organiser called “a Shudra revolution” and for the Hindu nationalist party, now called the BJP, to withdraw from a coalition party, the Janata Dal, in the name of social conservatism.
Ironically, today, Narendra Modi, the last incarnation of this school of thought is greeting Karpoori Thakur. Well, better late than never, but will the Modi government replicate his policy and, for instance, introduce a specific quota for the MBCs, a reform that would make a caste census even more necessary? So far only Bihar – again – has conducted such a survey. Will Bihar show the way to progressive politics again?
While Bihar remains imbued with the socialist ethos, socialist political forces have vanished – Thakur’s career illustrates this trend very clearly. In 1980, he joined Charan Singh’s Lok Dal before seceding for creating his own Lok Dal, the LD(K) and withdrawing in the background.

9IYOZJHF4E_LJY4AZZACJUWFDD,How the Telecom Act undermines personal liberties,Rajat Kathuria,"January 25, 2024 07:07 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-the-telecom-act-undermines-personal-liberties-9126314/,"“Is Big Brother watching you? At the press of a button a civil servant can inspect just about every detail of your life your tax, your medical record and periods of unemployment. That civil servant could be your neighbour. There is mounting concern over this powerful weapon that the computer revolution has put in the government’s hand. But no civil servant will be allowed to examine personal files from another department, without written authority from a Minister. I shall be announcing legislation enabling citizens to take action against any civil servant who gains unauthorised access to his file.” (Yes Minister). The year is 1980, the computer revolution is just about beginning and questions of surveillance have become pertinent; safeguards in the form of separation of powers between the executive and legislative are announced by the Minister for the protection of citizens.
Although theatrical, Yes Minister can yet be invoked to characterise governments in most parliamentary democracies especially India’s.
More than four decades on, the Indian Parliament witnessed the smooth passage of several pieces of legislation, including the Telecommunications Act (TA) 2023, which justifiably seeks to bury remnants of colonial-era laws. While the modern digital age creates conditions for unprecedented surveillance reflecting the Benthamite tenet of maximum monitoring at minimum cost, the question on everyone’s minds is whether the law has enough safeguards and an independent regulatory architecture to protect the rights of citizens.
Before contemplating this weighty query, let us set the narrative in context with a quick recap of the major markers in digital governance in India that have concluded, at least for the moment, in the passing of TA 2023.
The institutional regime for telecommunications dates back to the late 1990s and was created more by accident and less by design. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) became necessary because private sector investment came in when the public sector operator was both player and referee. Massive litigation followed, leading to the setting up of TRAI. Within a few years, the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) was carved from TRAI to fast-track excessive litigation. In between, there was the dissolution of the first TRAI, only confirming who the “boss” was.
The desire to serve in regulatory regimes has surely been tainted by the goal of securing sinecures. This is not just an Indian phenomenon. For example, the Biden administrators wish they continue in office for long. It is in the nature of such positions that many of those appointed will never again be in a position of authority. There have been few instances after its dissolution that TRAI has taken on the government. The relationship between the legislature and the executive is complex but suffice it to say that such a separation in telecom is met much more in the breach.
The regulatory regime for telecom described above notifies subordinate legislation, enforces and adjudicates disputes — it performs the role of the executive and the adjudicator. One key safeguard for the protection of ordinary citizens is, therefore, already undermined. The separation of powers remains on paper and the exercise of authority through delegated rule-making ensures the government can intervene with little resistance.
In this background, TA 2023 poses challenges. Although undoing colonial-era laws is one of the stated goals, the re-purposing of some existing provisions and ambiguous drafting does little justice to that aim. For example, the definition of telecommunication services has been left open to interpretation. Internet-based services like WhatsApp and Gmail are, therefore, likely to fall under the Act’s ambit. Provisions empowering the government to notify standards and conformity measures or ask for alternatives to end-to-end encryption such as client-side scanning could undermine privacy. Further requiring messages to be disclosed in an “intelligible format” is irreconcilable with end-to-end privacy engineering. Tinkering with end-to-end encryption for compliance could create potential points of vulnerability.
The grounds on which such information may be sought, outlined in Section 20 (2) include sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state and public order. Prima facie these appear reasonable. However, the current phrasing leaves room for expansive interpretation by overenthusiastic enforcement machinery — it could go beyond the letter of the law to please political masters. Research conducted in 2021 by Vrinda Bhandari and others found that many orders issued under the guise of public order restrictions would not qualify as legal per se. The Act cements the government’s power to suspend internet services (Section 20(2)(b)) and does not include procedural safeguards envisaged in the Supreme Court’s Anuradha Bhasin judgment such as the proportionality test, exploration of suitable alternatives and the adoption of least intrusive measures.
The Act also does not establish an independent oversight mechanism for interception and suspension orders related to telecommunications. These rules, framed in 1996 in line with the directions of the Supreme Court in PUCL v. Union of India and requiring a committee consisting exclusively of senior government officials, reflect inadequate separation. In the UK the law mandates approval of interception warrants by judicial commissioners. Separation of powers is however not a panacea; it is just a necessary condition for the effective functioning of institutions. We must also observe the counsel of John Stuart Mill for the maintenance of institutional integrity namely, not “to lay [their] liberties at the feet of even a great man, or to trust him with powers which enable him to subvert [their] institutions” — JS Mill, quoted by BR Ambedkar on November 25 1949, requoted by sitting Chief Justice of India on Constitution Day (November 26, 2018).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reaching out to 50-lakh new voters virtually on Thursday and will also launch the party’s Lok Sabha campaign in Uttar Pradesh with a public rally in Bulandshahr.
Also, the party is getting ready to release its first list of candidates soon, it is learnt. Sources said the top leadership is expected to meet later this month to finalise the party candidates for the difficult seats in order to give its candidates ample time to work on the ground. Around 150-160 candidates could be finalised soon, they said.
BJP leaders also said although big ticket announcements are not expected, the interim budget is also expected to “create a positive atmosphere and optimism” as “India’s glory as Vishwaguru would be one of the key themes in the BJP campaign” for the Lok Sabha elections.
Party sources added they expect the Lok Sabha elections to be announced by the fourth week of February. The budget session, beginning on January 31, is scheduled to be concluded on February 9. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UAE on February 13-14 during which he is expected to attend a diaspora meet – Ahlaan Modi 2024 – and inaugurate the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi. After his return, the BJP is likely to have its National Council meeting to finalise the campaigning schedule.
In the Bulandshahr rally, the Prime Minister is expected to launch big infrastructure projects for Meerut, Bulandshahar and nearby areas. Among the projects to be inaugurated is a medical college in the name of former chief minister Kalyan Singh. Singh was BJP’s face in the peak of Ram Janmabhoomi movement as he was the Uttar Pradesh CM when Babri Masjid was razed and he had quit the post taking moral responsibility for the demolition.
The Bulandshahr event comes at a time when the BJP launched a massive outreach programme for rural villages – Gaon Chalo Abhiyan — to take stock of the implementation of the Central welfare schemes and talk about the development programmes as well as the January 22 consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
On Thursday, Modi is scheduled to virtually address 50-lakh first-time voters during a NaMo Navamatdata Sammelan organised by the BJYM in 5,000 locations across the country. According to BJYM president Tejasvi Surya, the nationwide initiative is aimed at engaging and registering new voters. “The BJYM is organising 5,000 sammelans, each engaging a minimum of 1,000 new voters across the country. Special efforts will be made to engage and register navamatdata as Viksit Bharat Ambassadors,” he said on Wednesday.
The main target of the outreach programmes would be to increase the party’s vote share from 37.36 per cent to over 50 per cent in this Lok Sabha election. “With the programmes like Jan Dhan Yojana, toilet scheme, Ujjwala Yojana, PM Awas Yojana and Jal Jeevan Mission being huge successes, the ‘labharthis’ (beneficiaries) remain a major support base for the party. But programmes like Gaon Chalo Abhiyan would help the party to consolidate the rural votes too,” said a party leader."

DCP (Shahdara) Surendra Choudhary said they received a PCR call at 5.22 pm that some residents were trapped in a blaze in a building in Ram Nagar. Police rushed to the spot and, with the help of passersby, three trapped persons were pulled out. After the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) personnel arrived, three more persons were rescued.
“They were rushed to GTB hospital where four people were declared dead,” said an officer.

Police said the deceased were identified as Rachna (28), her nine-month-old daughter Ruhi; Gauri Soni (40) and her son Pratham Soni (17). They died of asphyxiation after smoke spread across the building; they sustained burn injuries as well. The injured were identified as Radhika (16), who sustained burn injuries on her leg and hand; and Prabhawati (70), who had a burn injury on her leg.
Rachna had adopted Ruhi around three months ago; they lived on the second floor. Gauri and her son, a class 12 student, lived on the third floor.
Police said the owner has been detained and a case is in the process of being lodged.
At GTB Hospital, Yogesh Soni, Pratham’s uncle, told The Indian Express, “We received information about the fire at around 5 pm… my brother Ashutosh was not at home and had gone to office… Gauri and Pratham’s bodies were found on the stairs… the fire spread from the ground floor which is a godown for wipers.”
Building housed a godown in parking lot
Police said the building housed a wiper godown in the parking area, which was owned and operated by the son of the building’s landlord.
The building comprises a ground floor plus four floors and has a single staircase. While the owner stays on the first floor, the others have been rented out. The occupants of the top floor were not present in the house. The landlord and his son were also not there at home at the time, said police.
A senior police officer said that the prima facie reason behind the fire seems to be a short circuit due to which the plastic material stacked on the ground floor, in the parking area, caught fire and the smoke eventually travelled upwards.
“During our primary inspection, some plastic material was found stored on the ground floor from where the fire started,” said the officer.
DFS Chief Atul Garg also said wipers, rubber and a cutting machine on the ground floor sparked the blaze.
A police officer said, “It is also being probed if someone accidentally threw a combustible item like a cigarette or beedi into the godown, due to which it caught fire.”
A fire official involved in the rescue operation said, “The building does not have ventilation and lacked enough windows… Separate families lived on different floors… when the fire broke out, most of them tried to run to the terrace but they got asphyxiated and fell unconscious on the stairs, from where their bodies were recovered.”
The incident comes days after a fire in a four-storey building in Northwest Delhi’s Pitampura killed two sisters; and an elderly couple and their daughter. The incident was suspected to have been caused by a heater allegedly left running on the first floor."

A single-judge bench of Suraj Govindraj, in its order on January 4 while disposing of a set of petitions, said, “More often than not these violations are occurring over small plots which have been purchased by individual citizens by making payment of huge amounts of money from their own personal funds and sometimes by borrowing funds.”
“Since there is no particular violation of the building bylaws as such, I am of the considered opinion that whenever authorities were to pass orders… it would be required for such authorities to look into and pass necessary orders after taking into consideration if there is any violation of the building bylaws and not direct demolition only on account of building sanction not having obtained,” the court noted.
The bench also said if there was no violation of the said bylaws, after collecting the relevant fees, the authorities could regularise the building by issuing a sanctioned plan. Property tax with penalty would also have to be paid from the date of the unsanctioned construction, it said.
The high court also took a serious view of the allegations by some petitioners that there had been collusion by some officials with other parties regarding the properties.
“The chief commissioner would also have to institute necessary enquiry into the same to ascertain the veracity thereof….the officers of the corporation cannot act contrary to the applicable law at the behest of the private party…. The officers of the corporation or the corporation itself cannot be treated as pawns or stooges of private parties and act on their behalf.

I never had the opportunity to meet Karpoori Ji but, I heard a lot about him from Kailashpati Mishra Ji, who worked closely with him. He belonged to one of the most backward sections of society, the Nai Samaj. Overcoming numerous obstacles, he achieved a lot and worked for societal betterment.
Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji’s life revolved around the twin pillars of simplicity and social justice. Till his last breath, his simple lifestyle and humble nature resonated deeply with the common people. There are numerous anecdotes that highlight his simplicity. Those who worked with him recall how he preferred to spend his own money for any personal matter including his daughter’s wedding. During his tenure as Chief Minister of Bihar, a decision was taken to build a colony for political leaders but he himself did not take any land or money for the same. When he passed away in 1988, several leaders went to his village to pay tributes. When they saw the condition of his house, they were moved to tears- how can someone so towering have a house so simple!
Another anecdote of his simplicity dates back to 1977 when he just took over as CM of Bihar. The Janata Government was in power in Delhi and Patna. That time, Janata leaders had gathered in Patna to mark Loknayak JP’s birthday. Among the galaxy of top leaders walked in Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur Ji, with a torn kurta. In his own style, Chandrashekhar Ji asked people to donate some money so that Karpoori Ji could purchase a new kurta. But, Karpoori Ji was Karpoori Ji — he accepted the money but donated it to the CM Relief Fund.
Social justice was most dear to Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji. His political journey was marked by monumental efforts to create a society where resources were distributed fairly, and everyone, regardless of their social standing, had access to opportunities. He wanted to address the systemic inequalities that plagued Indian society.
Such was his commitment to his ideals that despite living in an era where the Congress Party was omnipresent, he took a distinctly anti-Congress line because he was convinced very early on that the Congress had deviated from its founding principles. His electoral career began in the early 1950s and since then, he became a force to reckon with in the legislative chambers, powerfully voicing the struggles of the working class, labourers, small farmers and youngsters. Education was a subject very close to his heart. Throughout his political career, he worked to improve education facilities for the poor. He was a proponent of education in local languages so that people from small towns and villages could climb the ladder and attain success. As CM, he took many measures for the welfare of senior citizens as well.
Democracy, debate and discussion were integral to Karpoori Ji’s personality. This spirit was seen when he immersed himself in the Quit India movement as a youngster and it was again seen when he resisted the Emergency tooth and nail. His unique perspectives were great admired by the likes of JP, Dr. Lohia and Charan Singh Ji.
Perhaps one of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji’s most significant contributions to India was his role in strengthening the affirmative action apparatus for the backward classes, with the hope that they were given the representation and opportunities they deserved. His decision was met with heavy opposition but he did not bow to any pressure. Under his leadership, policies were implemented that laid the groundwork for a more inclusive society, where one’s birth did not determine one’s fate. He belonged to the most backward strata of society but he worked for all the people. He had no trace of bitterness in him, which is what makes him truly great.
Over the last ten years, our Government has walked on the path of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji, reflected in our schemes and policies that have brought transformative empowerment. One of the biggest tragedies of our polity has been that barring a few leaders like Karpoori Ji, the call for social justice was restricted to being a political slogan. Inspired by Karpoori Ji’s vision we implemented it as an effective governance model. I can say with confidence and pride that Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji would have been very proud of India’s feat of freeing 25 crore people from the clutches of poverty in the last few years. These are people from the most backward sections of society, who were denied basic facilities nearly seven decades after freedom from colonial rule. At the same time, our efforts towards saturation — of ensuring every scheme reaches 100% coverage — echo his commitment to social welfare. Today, when people from OBC, SC and ST Communities are becoming entrepreneurs due to MUDRA Loans, it fulfils Karpoori Thakur Ji’s vision of economic independence. Likewise, it was our government which had the privilege of extending SC, ST and OBC reservation. We also had the honour of setting up the OBC Commission (which was opposed by Congress, sadly), which is working on the path shown by Karpoori Ji. Our PM-Vishwakarma Scheme will also bring new avenues of prosperity for crores of people belonging to OBC communities across India.
As a person belonging to the backward classes myself, I have much to thank Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji for. Unfortunately, we lost Karpoori Ji at a relatively young age of 64. We lost him when we needed him the most. Yet, he lives on in the hearts and minds of crores of people due to his work. He was a true Jan Nayak!"

The group would include academics and those involved in conducting elections in India and abroad, he said.
Asked whether it would be appropriate to have foreign observers monitoring the election process, Pitroda said it was in the interest of transparency. Devasahayam, a retired IAS officer, added that India’s democracy was not a local matter, being the most populous country in the world, its democracy was a global issue."

Sagar Singh Kalsi, Additional Commissioner of Police, conducted a thorough security assessment in the East District, including Shahdara, inspecting vulnerable areas along with senior officers.
Flag marches and area assessments are also being carried out in other districts of the national capital and senior officers said monitoring of proclaimed offenders and history sheeters is also being done to prevent any potential criminal activities.
The Delhi Police organised an inter-state coordination meeting at its headquarters, led by Commissioner Sanjay Arora. The discussions focused on assessing potential terror threats and implementing anti-terror measures, with particular attention to border security and the scrutiny of anti-social elements.
“Any cases of drug smuggling and possible godowns where they can be stored will be checked…those out of jail will be monitored,” said a senior police officer.
Meanwhile, security checks at borders are being held and all two-wheelers and trucks are being subjected to verifications, said a Delhi Police officer. Stringent measures have been put in place to ban and monitor aerial objects like paragliders and drones.

With this appointment, the Supreme Court will once again function at its full-strength of 34 judges. The lone vacancy was created when Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul retired in December last year.
“The Supreme Court of India has operated almost throughout last year with full strength of thirty-four Judges and, therefore, could achieve the distinction of recording an unprecedented rate of disposal by disposing of 52191 cases in the calendar year 2023,” the Collegium resolution had stated.
“Bearing in mind that the workload of judges has increased considerably, it has become necessary to ensure that the Court has full working judge-strength at all times,” the statement had added.
Apart from CJI Chandrachud, the five-member Collegium that recommends SC judges also comprises of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose.
The Collegium said that Justice Varale, whose parent High Court is the Bombay High Court, is a “competent judge with unimpeachable conduct and integrity and has throughout maintained high standard of professional ethics.” The Collegium also underlined that it has taken into consideration the fact that Justice Varale belongs to the Scheduled Caste and ranks sixth in the All-India list of seniority of High Court judges."

Soren’s Jharkhand Mukti Morcha had demanded “strict legal action” against the CRPF, alleging that the Central force had come with an ulterior motive to fuel tension. However, the BJP had defended the CRPF, saying its personnel had arrived to protect ED officials as a large number of JMM supporters had gathered outside the CM’s residence at the time.
On January 21, Ranchi police registered an FIR against CRPF personnel for violating prohibitory orders.
“CRPF is one (force). An unnecessary large gathering was organised outside CM’s residence on January 20 and for that only CRPF had to come. It is this party’s mistake and it is this government’s mistake. This has to stop,” Governor Radhakrishnan said on Thursday, in response to a question from a reporter.
Later on Thursday evening, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha released a press statement with 10 questions addressed to the Governor. Signed by the party’s general secretary Surpriyo Bhattacharya, the release said that in case of natural disasters, emergency situations or during deterioration of law and order in any state, the District Magistrate of the local district can use the paramilitary forces, military forces and NDRF and the demand is made and numerical strength is also clearly stated. However, the release stated, there was no such issue at hand on January 20.
“Doesn’t the Governor know that the Ranchi District Magistrate had not made any such demand either to the Home Ministry of India or to any paramilitary force?…There was no public call by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha asking the workers to come near the CM’s residence and the workers (on their own) came out of their homes towards the Chief Minister’s residence and …they were confined to a (specific) area,” the letter stated.
The release said that the president of the BJP had issued statements on the CRPF presence, and that the Governor was using the same words. “Being a political activist, I have an intuitive understanding…when the statement of a political party is made by the constitutional head,” Supriyo Bhattacharya said in the release.
The JMM then said that the words of the Governor were “unexpected and unnecessary”.
“Governor sir, whatever concerns you have, please express them in a procedural manner and not on a public platform. Otherwise, it will be understood that this statement is motivated by political motives, which is strongly condemnable,” the party said."

In his address, Governor Reddy Nallu said, “Everyone should work for the development of Tripura with the inspiration of our leaders. The state of Tripura should be made a drug-free state. Child marriages should be stopped. Divisive forces should be boycotted by society and the state should be made plastic-free.”

Stating that agriculture is the primary vocation of nearly 70 per cent of Tripura’s population, the governor said the state government had laid special emphasis on planned development in agriculture and allied sectors for doubling farmers’ income.
“Under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Rs 640 crore was credited to accounts of 2,46,339 farmers. A total of 12.76 lakh farmers were insured under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana till date,” he said, adding that the government had also laid stress on developing the tourism sector.

“Tripura is a destination of diversified tourist attractions like archaeological sites, religious tourism, ecotourism, wildlife sanctuaries, heritage sites, adventure tourism sites etc. The state government has implemented a holistic strategy to boost tourism within the state, focusing on enhancing last-mile connectivity, accommodation facilities, upgrading infrastructure at tourist destinations and enhancing the skills of individuals employed in the tourism sector,” he said.
Tripura has recently got a helipad for tourists at Narikel Kunja, a waterbody in Gomati district that resembles the backwaters of Kerala. A weekend tourist hub was introduced in front of the Ujjayanta Palace, and development of religious sites like Tripurasundari Temple is underway.

Multiple adventure tourism activities like paramotoring, paragliding, water-scooters, water-ski, zorbing (rolling downhill inside a hollow ball), banana boats and hot air balloons were introduced at Dumbur, Chabimura and Jampui Hills.
The governor also highlighted the state’s success in rubber cultivation and agar production as well as in setting up international market linkages for the state fruit, queen pineapple, which is exported to Dubai and Qatar along with other organic products.
He also said that Bru migrants from Mizoram who had been living in makeshift transit camps for over two decades were now being settled permanently in the state. A host of initiatives are being taken to provide jobs and these include a decision to open 150 new petrol bunks. Welfare initiatives were undertaken for tribals, Scheduled Castes, backward communities and minority communities through scholarships, financial assistance and soft loans."
A7AZZW1GTU_BW0BUQR0P9CAW5X,"Chambers, carvings, decorations: ASI report on Gyanvapi mosque describes temple that was",Asad Rehman,"Updated: January 27, 2024 22:48 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/chambers-carvings-decorations-asi-describes-temple-that-was-9129734/,"A central chamber “tastefully decorated with carvings of animals and birds”, pillars with “lotus medallion” and “flower bud chains”, a “large decorated entrance gateway” on the wall of one of the chambers — these, according to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), formed part of “a large Hindu temple” that existed at the site in Varanasi where the Gyanvapi mosque now stands.
In a report on its scientific survey of the mosque complex – it’s in four volumes – the ASI, tasked by the Varanasi district court to ascertain whether the mosque was “constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple”, has concluded just that, and describes a temple that existed before it “appears to have been destroyed in the 17th century, during the reign of Aurangzeb and part of it… modified and reused in the existing structure”.
Hindu litigants have claimed that the Gyanvapi mosque was built on the site of the earlier Kashi Vishwanath temple after its destruction in the 17th century.
The ASI report, made public Thursday after its copies were handed over to Hindu and Muslim litigants by the court, in the section titled ‘Reply to Observations of the Court’, stated: “Based on the studies carried out, observations made on the existing structures, exposed features, and artefacts studied, it can be concluded that there existed a large Hindu temple prior to the construction of the existing structure.”
“This temple had a big central chamber and based on the study of the existing structures and available evidence it can be concluded that it had at least one chamber to the north, south, east and west respectively,” it stated.
“Remains of three chambers to the north, south and west can still be seen but the remains of the chamber to the east and any further extension of it cannot be ascertained physically as the area to the east is covered under (a) solid functional platform with stone flooring,” it stated.
“Entrance to the central chamber of the temple was from (the) west which has been blocked by stone masonry. Its western chamber was also connected with north and south chambers through a corridor accessible from its north and south entrances respectively.”
“Main entrance to the central chamber was tastefully decorated with carvings of animals and birds and an ornamental torana. Figure carved on the lalatabimba has been chopped off and most of it is covered with stones, bricks and mortar which is used to block the entrance. Remains of a bird figure carved on the door sill, and part of which survived at the northern side, appears to be of a cock,” it stated.
Concluding that the western wall of the Gyanvapi mosque was the “remaining part of a pre-existing Hindu temple”, the ASI said, “Art and architecture of any building not only indicates its date but also its nature. Karna-ratha and prati-ratha of central chamber visible on either side of western chamber, a large decorated entrance gateway on the eastern wall of the western chamber, a smaller entrance and destroyed image on lalatabimba, birds and animals carved for decoration suggest that the western wall is remaining part of a pre-existing Hindu temple.”
On the pillars in the mosque complex, the report stated: “From the minute study of these pillars, it is found that pillars with (a) square section having lotus medallion in the centre and flower bud chains on the corners, were part of the pre-existing Hindu temple. These pillars and pilasters are reused in the existing structure after removing vyala figures and converting that space in floral design. The observation is supported by two similar pilasters still existing on the northern and southern wall of the western chamber in their original place. This similarity is established on the basis of scientific study, art and design.”
The first volume of the ASI report is divided into three main categories: Introduction, Structures, Summary.
Under Introduction, it has the subheads – Court directive and Compliance, Constraints, Location, Settlement Plot number 9130, and Study Area. Under Structures, it has the subheads – Cellars, Existing Structure, Pillars and Pilasters, Western Wall, Inscriptions, Mason’s Marks, Measurements. Under Summary, it has the subheads – Reply to Observations of the Court, Brief Findings of the Survey. The first volume comprises 137 pages.
The second volume is on Scientific Studies and has the following subheads: Cleaning Operations and Finds, Scientific Investigations/Survey, X-Ray Fluorescence Report, Ground Penetration Radar Survey, Condition Report, Field Laboratory and Relative Humidity and Temperature. The second volume has 196 pages.
The third volume has Objects as the main heading and the following subheads: Artefacts, Retrieved Objects, Architectural Members. The third volume has 227 pages.
The fourth volume contains illustrations, with subheads Images and Figures. It has 238 pages.
The survey was undertaken by a team led by ASI Additional Director-General Alok Tripathi.
During the study, objects like inscriptions, sculptures, coins, pottery, architectural fragments and objects of terracotta, stone, metal and glass were examined and analysed.
According to the report, objects that required first-aid treatment were treated at the site. It stated that “archaeologists, epigraphists, chemists, engineers, surveyors, photographers, and other officials of the ASI and scientists of the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Hyderabad carried out investigations and collected data” which were “systematically analysed”.
Scientific studies were carried out in a 2150-sqm area, fenced by a steel grill around the existing structure, the report stated, adding that the “survey team established a reference point and prepared a plan of the entire complex”."

The trio – comprising Usama Ali, Ahad Khan, and Raffey Anwar –recently engaged in a candid conversation with BBC’s Haroon Rashid, sharing the back story of their collaboration.
During the interview, Rashid acknowledged the magnitude of their collaboration, affirming, “You have collaborated with one of the biggest music stars on the planet.”
Anwar disclosed that Malik had reached out to them after their song gained traction in India, expressing his admiration for their work. Khan added, “The people from Sony told us that we are going to do a collaboration. Without even thinking, my first reaction was, ‘I hope it’s with Zayn.’ I didn’t know that it was actually going to happen.”
Watch the video below:


A post shared by BBC Asian Network (@bbcasiannetwork)
The band members, though, struggled to realise at first that their music has worldwide influence. Anwar recounted, “We continuously pestered our management for three days just to confirm that this was indeed unfolding.”
Khan said they did not believe that they were indeed speaking with Zayn Malik, “We believed it (his voice) might be AI-generated. We also thought, ‘Mazaak horaha hai hamare sath’ (we are being played with).”
Rashid also highlighted speculations on social media suggesting that the AUR boys had familial ties with Malik. Anwar further said, “People keep messaging us, asking us to get them a birthday wish from Zayn Malik.”
When probed about their friends and family’s reactions to the success of their song, Ali shared, “They really like it.” Khan emphasised, “They feel proud.” Anwar revealed that his mother is actively involved in keeping him informed about ongoing developments, underscoring the unwavering support from their close circles.
Rashid, with a dash of humour, pointed out that the newfound fame might have increased attention from previously ‘disinterested parties’ (read girls). The band members laughed in agreement.
Reacting to the interview, one social media user wrote, “I’m so happy this collab happened because now I got introduced to AUR!!! They seem so humble and down to Earth and I love their support for Zayn!!! They killed it!!! Zayn killed it!!! This song is beautiful!!!”
Another added, “One of the biggest music star on the Planet.” A third said, “Love this collab.”
A fourth concluded, “These kids are so humble and bowled over by getting to work w Zayn. yassss. 🔥🔥Song is fire. Aur is so cute and Zayn Malik is A GOD.”"

Gaza’s Health Ministry said Thursday that Israeli fire struck a crowd of people waiting for humanitarian aid at a roundabout in Gaza City on Thursday, killing at least 20 and wounding 150. The Israeli military says it was looking into the reports.
The International Court of Justice was set to read out its decision on Friday on whether to order Israel to halt its offensive in Gaza as the Health Ministry announced that deaths there had surpassed 26,000 since the Israel-Hamas war began.
South Africa accused Israel of genocide and asked the court in The Hague, Netherlands, for interim orders, including that Israel halt its offensive in Gaza. Israel swiftly rejected the filing and asked the court to throw out the case."

Thousands of people were trapped at a hospital by heavy fighting in the southern Gaza Strip, and Israeli forces on Wednesday had surrounded a second hospital where displaced people were sheltering, aid agencies said, after Israel’s military ordered evacuations for that part of the city of Khan Younis.
The evacuation order posted by the military’s Arabic-language spokesperson, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, designated blocks that include the grounds of the two facilities, Nasser Hospital and Al-Amal Hospital. They are among the last hospitals still providing some medical care to patients in Gaza even as many more people seek refuge there from intensifying Israeli air and ground attacks.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society on Wednesday reported “intense shelling” near Al-Amal hospital, which it runs, and said a strike had killed three people outside its offices in an adjacent building. Israeli forces were “surrounding” its teams and “enforcing restrictions on movement” around its offices and the hospital, the group said.
The Gaza Health Ministry said in a statement that Nasser Hospital had in effect been cut off by “continuous bombing,” preventing injured people from getting there and blocking the transfer of patients to the nearby Jordanian field hospital. The United Nations’ humanitarian affairs office said in its daily update Tuesday that the Jordanian hospital was also included in the evacuation area.
The three hospitals, with a total of more than 600 beds, account for one-fifth of the remaining functional hospital capacity in Gaza, according to the U.N. It said the evacuation area held 88,000 residents and an estimated 425,000 displaced people, packed into about 1.5 square miles.
“The Israeli occupation isolates Nasser Medical Complex and puts the lives of staff, patients and displaced people at risk,” Ashraf Al-Qudra, the spokesperson for the Gaza Health Ministry, said in a statement.
The aid group Doctors Without Borders said late Tuesday that its staff at Nasser could hear bombs and heavy gunfire, and that 850 patients and thousands of others sheltering there were unable to leave because the roads from the hospital were either inaccessible or too dangerous. The group said that it was “deeply concerned” for the people’s safety.
The evacuation orders came around the same time that the military said it had encircled Khan Younis after weeks of intense fighting and bombardment. The Israeli military has said it was focused on hunting down Hamas leaders in the city, which is densely packed with displaced civilians who fled the northern half of the territory at the military’s urging.
In a statement Wednesday, Israel accused Hamas of exploiting the civilian population and said that its operation in Khan Younis would continue until it had finished “dismantling Hamas’ military framework and Hamas strongholds.”
As many as 7,000 people were believed to have been sheltering on the grounds of Nasser Hospital last week, many of whom fled as fighting intensified. The Israeli military has said mortar fire has been launched at its troops from the hospital, which is the largest in southern Gaza. Its claim could not be independently verified. Israel has long said that Hamas uses hospitals to hide militants and weapons.
The World Health Organization said last week that Nasser Hospital alone had treated 700 patients in one day and was struggling to attend to growing numbers of wounded people amid the escalating violence in Khan Younis."
AAMY2R1IQL_VAK03BXYVHMXT6H,US presidential election watch | All eyes on South Carolina after Trump wins second primary; Nikki Haley says ‘race is far from over’,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 13:06 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-presidential-election-latest-developments-9125268/,"From former US President Donald Trump’s victory in New Hampshire to Nikki Haley’s reaction to the loss, here are some key stories to follow in the run-up to the US Presidential elections.
Trump scored a key victory with the Republican voters on Tuesday, winning the party primary in New Hampshire. He won over 54% of the votes and gained 11 delegates, as compared to Haley, who won 43% of the votes and eight delegates.
Between January 15 (when the Iowa primary was held) and June 4, 2,429 Republican delegates are up for grabs. To win the Republican nomination, the candidate needs at least 1,215 of these delegates. Currently, after the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Trump has 32 delegates while Haley has 17, as per CNN.
Addressing supporters after the New Hampshire win, Trump criticised Haley, saying she had a “very bad night.” “She [Haley] did very poorly actually,” he said, as per CNN. “The governor said she’s going to win, she’s going to win, she’s going to win. Then she failed badly.”
However, his competitor Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor and a UN ambassador during the Trump administration, remained defiant, saying “We’re not going to let them coronate Donald Trump when 48 states haven’t voted.”
The Indian-origin legislator has some room for hope, as she bested Trump among college graduates and moderates. Experts have also pointed out that Haley continuing in the competition, especially now that all other competitors have dropped out, could work to her advantage depending on Trump’s legal troubles.
Thank you, New Hampshire! The political class wanted us to believe that this race was over before it even began. You proved them wrong, and I am so grateful. It’s time to put the negativity and chaos behind us. Our fight is not over, because we have a country to save. pic.twitter.com/DDA7VjPTjZ

Haley’s main focus is on the upcoming South Carolina primary on February 24, which could make or break her campaign. “Donald Trump’s only strategy is to lie about me and my record. That’s not going to work in South Carolina. The people of South Carolina know that I cut their taxes, passed one of the toughest immigration bills in the country, and moved thousands from welfare to work,” she said in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) hours after the NH loss.
US President Joe Biden, who won the Democratic party’s primary in New Hampshire as the write-in candidate, has started treating Trump as his rival in the upcoming 2024 elections.
“It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher. Our democracy. Our personal freedoms — from the right to choose to the right to vote. Our economy — which has seen the strongest recovery in the world since COVID. All are at stake,” he said in a statement, as per CNN.
His campaign has started selling merchandise with the slogan ‘TOGETHER, WE WILL DEFEAT TRUMP. AGAIN’ in red and white letters. The Biden-Harris campaign is selling unisex t-shirts for $32, 2-pack of stickers for $6 and phone wallpapers."

The latest statement by the government comes amid a tussle between the state Transport department and the omni bus associations.
“If any violation is noticed, severe action will be taken against the operator as per provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and rules,” a statement from the Transport department on Wednesday read.
On Wednesday, Chennai Metropolitan Department Authority Minister P K Sekar Babu said a government cannot function as per the whims of the Omni Bus Owners Association.
Babu said even before the inauguration of the terminus at Kilambakkam, discussions were held between the government and the omni bus associations and the latter had agreed to operate the busses in a phased manner from December 30, 2023 (the day of the inauguration) and later sought time to operate from January 24. However, now they are claiming that they are not ready to operate from Kilambakkam.
“We request the omni bus associations to stick to their word and oblige the directions of the government,” Babu added.
The Transport department, in a circular on January 22, had said when the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) commences their operation from the KCBT, it would not be advisable to allow the omni buses to enter the city to pick up and drop passengers. It had said that the move may create an unhealthy competition between the two players and lead to huge revenue losses to the SETC.
The government had also said that the KCBT has already earmarked various facilities for the omni bus operators, hence, at any point of time, no less than 250 omni buses can be parked at the KCBT. “This will ensure smooth operation of all south-bound omni operations from the KCBT even during the peak festival seasons,” the Transport department had said.
A Anbalagan, president of the All Omni Bus Owners Association, said, “On an average, around 1,000 buses are operated on a daily basis and currently, the KCBT has space to accommodate only 144 buses. The government had promised to build a bus stand at Mudichur for omni buses on a five-acre of land. But the construction hasn’t been completed and it is expected to take six more months.”
“Despite raising this issue during multiple meetings with the government officials, they didn’t provide us a solution and suddenly on January 22 they issued a statement saying that from January 24, omni buses should not be operated. This sudden announcement has caused unnecessary confusion to passengers who had made bookings 30 to 90 days prior. We request the intervention of the Chief Minister and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. The Transport department should consider the plight of the passengers and provide a solution accordingly,” he said."

The user, Naren Krishna, still in awe, wrote a post on LinkedIn to recount the extraordinary journey and the insightful conversation that unfolded.
The post began with the user expressing sheer disbelief at finding himself seated next to the visionary entrepreneur, describing the encounter as an unexpected and pretty cool turn of events. Throughout the journey, the user couldn’t shake off the astonishment of being in the presence of such a stalwart in the business world.
“What blew me away was how down-to-earth and approachable he was. In the few hours we shared, I delved into a myriad of topics with him, from the future landscape with AI, pivotal role the youth plays in the Indian economy on a global scale, surpassing even China in the future & managing expectations, dealing with stress, and navigating through failures while building a company,” he wrote.

Among the gems shared by Murthy was the importance of detachment from results, drawing on instances from Infosys’s journey where relentless efforts did not yield expected results, while unexpected deals surprisingly fell into place. The key takeaway for Krishna was a quote from Louis Pasteur that Murthy referenced: “Chance favours the prepared mind.”
On the subject of artificial intelligence, Murthy emphasised its transformative impact on industries such as autonomous vehicles and precision surgery.
However, what left a lasting impression on Krishna was his belief that AI would exponentially boost human productivity by 10-100 times in various sectors. According to Murthy, the pace of innovation in the coming years is poised to outstrip that of the last decade.
Krishna’s LinkedIn post concluded with expressing gratitude for the memorable encounter and the enriching conversation. The last few lines mentioned, “According to him, the pace of innovation in the coming years will outstrip the last decade. Will carry this memory very strongly for a long time with me.”"

On January 5, ED officers and central force personnel were assaulted by the supporters of the Trinamool Congress president of the Sandeshkhali unit Shahjahan when they raided his house in connection with their investigation into the alleged ration scam.
On Wednesday, ED officers visited Sheikh Shahjahan’s house in Akunjipara in Sandeshkhali, North 24 Parganas district at around 6 am. Unlike on January 5, the 125 central force personnel who were escorting the ED team wore body shields, and helmets and were in riot control gear carrying tear gas shells along with batons and guns. A large number of state police personnel as well as the Rapid Action force were also present on the spot.

ED officers broke open the lock at Shahjahan’s house with the help of a locksmith and initiated the search operations. They were escorted by a videographer and two witnesses. They are trying to open every room in the house to conduct searches.
Immediately after reaching the house in Akunjipara, a section of the central force team cordoned off the house, while others went for area domination. They were also seen conducting route marches not only on the Dhamakhali-Sarberia Road in front of the house but also at the local market and surrounding villages.
A Zilla Parishad member HE IS STILL P MEMBER ( incharge of fisheries department but removed after January 5) AND PARTY UNIT HEAD IN SANDESHKHALI, Sheikh Shahjahan has multiple houses in the area and also owns over 400 bighas of fisheries, five brick kilns, and a market which is named after him.
While West Bengal Police are yet to trace him, Shahjahan had released an audio clip from his hideout asking TMC workers and leaders not to fear central agencies. His clout extends beyond the Sandeshkhali area to other parts of the state’s North 24 Parganas district. He is known to be close to Jyotipriya Mullick, former food and forest minister who was arrested by ED in connection with the ration scam.
After they were assaulted by the mob on January 5, three ED officers sustained injuries and had to be hospitalised. While Sheikh Shahjahan is yet to be arrested, the West Bengal Police have arrested nine people in connection with the assault. They had lodged three FIRs after the incident, including one against the ED.
On January 17, the Calcutta High Court ordered the formation of a Special Investigation Team of officers of the CBI and West Bengal police to probe the attack on the ED officials in Sandeshkhali earlier this month."

According to the Union Law Ministry, 81 per cent of the 20,000-plus responses received by the High Level Committee on One Nation, One Election have favoured the idea. The Committee headed by a former president, Ram Nath Kovind, issued a public notice asking for suggestions between January 5-15. Unfortunately, given its constitution, manner of functioning and the larger context of one-party dominance, the Kovind Committee gives the impression of being partisan at best and a rubber stamp at worst. The blame for the lack of robust debate on the proposal also lies with the Opposition, particularly Congress. On an issue with far-reaching consequences, it has refused to engage.
The eight members of the Committee have either openly expressed support for simultaneous polls — as president, Kovind did, in Parliament, in 2019 — or are seen to be close to the government and therefore broadly in agreement with its pet projects. Congress Leader in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, refused to be a part of the Committee arguing that it is imbalanced. The Committee’s very terms of reference assume that One Nation, One Election is in “national interest”. But despite this, an Opposition leader could have played an important role — by voicing concerns the government may not want heard and by pushing for greater transparency in the process. As things stand, the concerns of the Opposition and the states look scattered and are being voiced piecemeal: Congress has called it “undemocratic”, AAP has said it will give an “unfair advantage” to the ruling party, the DMK has labelled it “dangerous”, and the TMC described it as “against the federal structure”.
Admittedly, a near-constant election cycle, and the short-termism this engenders, places a great burden on the exchequer. But while these issues are important, they cannot be used as an excuse to artificially keep governments that lose the support of the legislature and by extension, the people, in power. Certainly, such a fundamental change in the democratic structure and process must not be brought about without adequate engagement with the Opposition’s concerns. The legitimacy of the electoral system does not flow only from the Treasury Benches or the corridors of power at Kartavya Path. It also emanates from those without executive office continuing to have a voice. The elected Opposition, all but silenced in the last session of Parliament with the expulsion of 146 MPs, must have a say, and not just a token one, in the consequential matter of the design of elections."
AIPJTFY3FX_KUO5B6C4BT8G2FC,Not available: Land for AAP national party office at key location in Delhi,Damini Nath,"Updated: January 24, 2024 20:21 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/not-available-land-for-aap-national-party-office-at-key-location-in-delhi-9124737/,"A representative of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) went scouting for vacant land for its national party office, especially on the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, with officials of the Land and Development Office, but vacant land could not be traced, The Indian Express has learnt. The AAP, in a response, said the party was not shown any parcels of land and was informed that there was no land available as per its requirement.
After the Election Commission recognised it as a national party on April 10, 2023, the AAP became eligible for allotment of land for building its party office as per the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs’ (MoHUA) policy for land allotment to national parties.
AAP national secretary Pankaj Gupta then wrote to the Land and Development Office (L&DO), which comes under the MoHUA, on April 17 and April 20, 2023, regarding the allotment. The party had requested land on DDU Marg or other centrally-located areas, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have been allotted land for their respective national offices.
On June 26, 2023, the L&DO wrote back to Gupta saying the matter had been examined and a joint visit of an AAP representative and officials had been carried out to identify any vacant land, “especially on DDU Marg”, it is learnt. No such vacant land was found, and the allotment could not be made, the L&DO told the AAP.
Replying to another letter from Gupta on August 23, the L&DO informed him on September 15 that the matter had been examined again and no vacant land in the centrally-located area of New Delhi was available for allotment.
While sources in the ministry said that the party had been offered land in Saket, near the District Courts there, and a prime location in Civil Lines, a senior AAP official said they had not received any official communication in this regard.
In its official response regarding the allotment, the AAP said, “The AAP is entitled to 1,000 square metres of land, given its status as a national party with 62 members in the Delhi Legislative Assembly. A representative of the AAP has visited only one location, but unfortunately, they were not shown any parcel of land available. We are disappointed as we were neither shown any land nor the list of available land parcels, despite our requests. Rather, we were informed that there is no land parcel available as per our requirement.”
Later, the AAP moved the Delhi High Court seeking quashing of the June 26 and September 15 letters, and directions to the government to allot land “preferably in centrally located areas in New Delhi”. The party argued that the L&DO letters rejected its demand on “vague and frivolous grounds”. Hearing the petition on December 12, the court issued notice to the government and listed the matter for April.
The AAP also filed another petition seeking allotment of residential accommodation to be used as an office till it is given land where it can construct an office. Under the MoHUA’s rules, one residential accommodation in Delhi can be allotted to the president of a national party. The court issued notice to the government on this plea too on December 12 and listed the matter for April.
As per the Ministry’s 2006 policy, national parties are eligible for allotment of land at concessional rates. For parties with up to 15 MPs in both Houses of Parliament, the policy allows for the allotment of 500 square metres of land. Parties that have Delhi state units with representation in the state assembly are eligible for another 500 sqm. Once they are allotted land, the parties have three years to construct the building and vacate any other properties, such as residential accommodation, allotted to them as office space."

Ankita Lokhande and Mannara Chopra‘s rivalry has been a talking point this season. However, they had to field multiple questions at a recent press conference inside the Bigg Boss house on the many smear attacks they launched on each other. As they defended themselves, they again pointed fingers at one another.
While both have been at loggerheads since the start of the season, Mannara’s growing friendship with her husband Vicky Jain especially irked Ankita. Talking about the same, Ankita shared, “Mannara was never a part of our journey from the start, but suddenly when her relationships got strained, she gravitated towards Vicky. Mannara and I already had a rivalry, so as a wife, I felt Vicky should not talk to her. You can call it possessiveness or insecurity, but I took a stand for myself. I felt Mannara kept teasing me about her friendship with Vicky.”

A post shared by ColorsTV (@colorstv)
Commenting on the nasty remarks that Mannara has been making about every woman in the house, Ankita said, “Mannara has a pattern; if she doesn’t get along with one of the partners, she starts badmouthing them. She never steps back despite realizing that she is causing problems between the couple. Whenever Mannara has an issue with someone, she speaks so badly about the other person that it has no limits. She attacked anyone close to Munawar Faruqui. I never had issues when Vicky was friends with Sanaa or Khanzaadi, because they never teased me about the friendship, but Mannra likes to poke.”
Clearing her stand on the remarks Ankita made and her friendship with Vicky, Mannara said, “He is like a brother to me. In one week, a lot happened to me and Vicky bhai, Isha, and Samarth were there for me during that time. I might have victimized everyone in the house, and I will apologise for it, but the character assassination was never intentional. I feel very awkward if things are being portrayed like this.”
She also added, “When Ayesha came, I welcomed her nicely and connected to her story, but she made nasty comments about me. As far as character is concerned, I told Ayesha that if I liked someone, I would wait for that person to express it, and not make a desperate attempt to come on the show. As for Ankita, she has made nasty remarks about me and said mean things related to Munawar and Vicky. So she cannot just defend herself.”
Recently, both Ayesha Khan and Isha Malviya spoke about how Mannara would question every girl’s reputation on the show. Isha said, “My issues with Mannara were there. She has never hesitated to point fingers at any girl’s character. She started judging all the girls from the second week itself. She has said a lot of disgusting things and was never called out. It is very disappointing to see Mannara play the victim card and get the audience’s sympathy.”

Ayesha also shared, “I have had several showdowns with Mannara, and I got to know certain things she said about me. She has attacked me several times on the show. Everyone called her cheap during the fight after the torture task, but I took a stand for her.”

AP8MKHRW36_LTMS11XAHPX17OA,Decode Politics: A 42-day strike in Andhra ends — why YSRCP moved fast to defuse it,Sreenivas Janyala,"Updated: January 23, 2024 14:15 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/42-day-strike-andhra-ends-ysrcp-9123343/,"Anganwadi workers in Andhra Pradesh who had been on strike for 42 days called it off on Tuesday morning after reaching an agreement with the state government. The strike was called off after the government agreed to address 10 of the workers’ 11 demands. This came days after new state Congress president Y S Sharmila, the sister of Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, talked about meeting the striking workers, and other Opposition parties targeted the government over its response to the workers’ demands.
Anganwadi Workers’ Union President G Rani on Tuesday said, “They (government) have assured us that they will implement our demands and we are satisfied with their assurance.”
* Implement salary increments scheduled for July next year, in line with a mutual agreement
* Provide life insurance coverage, including a Rs 2-lakh accident insurance policy, to Anganwadi workers and helpers starting this year
* Increase age limit for the appointment of Anganwadi assistants from 45 years to 50 years
* Pay Anganwadi workers Travel Allowance (TA) and Dearness Allowance (DA) on a monthly and bi-monthly basis, respectively
* Set the upper age limit for the continued service of Anganwadi workers and helpers at 62 years
* Approved end-of-service benefits, providing Rs 1 lakh to Anganwadi workers and Rs 40,000 to helpers after they turn 62 years
* Sanctioned Rs. 66.54-crore fund for Anganwadi centres in rented buildings
* Allocate Rs. 7.81 crore for 55,607 centres to address sanitation requirements
* Release Rs. 6.36 crores for 21,206 centres at a rate of Rs 3,000 per centre to cover maintenance expenses, including painting walls and minor repairs
The YSRCP initially took a tough stand against the Anganwadi workers but softened up due to the changing political scenario in the state. While the TDP and the JSP have teamed up to take it on, the Congress has appointed Y S Sharmila to head the state unit, shaking up state politics.
In her first speech after taking over the state Congress, Sharmila took aim at her brother, criticising him for, among other things, “lack of development and rising unemployment”. She said she would also meet the Anganwadi workers. The YSRCP government moved in quickly to subdue the fire, reopening talks with the Unions and resolving the matter overnight. The government held talks with All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) general secretary G Obulesu, International Federation of Trade Unions state secretary K Polari, and G Rani, among others.
Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu had been criticising Jagan Mohan Reddy for not heeding the requests of the Anganwadi workers, saying that the CM’s “ego left no room for negotiations” with the striking workers.
Both Naidu and Jana Sena Party (JSP) chief K Pawan Kalyan spoke out in favour of the Anganwadi workers. Kalyan said how the government had handled the situation was undemocratic. “Threatening them and terminating their jobs is not how you deal with workers. It is an undemocratic approach,’’ Kalyan said.
TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh Naidu alleged that the Anganwadi workers were being threatened with termination of jobs to fall in line and end the strike.
The Opposition parties have not reacted since the strike was called off.
State Education Minister Botcha Satyanarayana said the government had agreed to meet 10 of the workers’ demands after “resolute negotiation and open communication” and thanked them for not getting “incited” by the Opposition parties.
”It is commendable that the Anganwadi workers also refused to politicise their strike and thwarted efforts by TDP and JSP to incite them,” the minister said. “The Anganwadi union leaders remained united and rejected the false incitement by Opposition parties and have ended their strike peacefully.”
Government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said, “Opposition parties have been trying to incite Anganwadis and spread false propaganda throughout the strike. The government has consistently demonstrated empathy and a commitment that has been extended beyond merely meeting demands, as it actively maintained communication with the Anganwadis throughout the strike. This cooperative stance was reciprocated by Anganwadis who, in due course, acknowledged the attempts made by the opposition parties to politicize the strike and understood the government’s perspective.”"

Calling the decision to confer Bharat Ratna on Thakur a “political” move, the Congress said had Modi been sincere about bringing about social justice, he would not have been indifferent to demands for conducting a caste census. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the caste census will be a true tribute to the socialist leader as the country now needs “real justice” and not “politics of symbolism”.
Calling Thakur a precious gem of India, Gandhi said the BJP government’s “concealment” of the results of the social and economic caste census conducted in 2011 and their “indifference” towards a nationwide census is an attempt to weaken the movement for social justice. “ ‘Justice of equal participation’, one of the five justices of Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, is at the centre of justice and social equality, which can begin only after caste census,” Gandhi said.
“In the true sense, this step will also be a true tribute to Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur ji and his struggles for the rights of the backward and the deprived,” he said. “The country now needs ‘real justice’ not ‘politics of symbolism’,” Gandhi said on X. Echoing him, Congress communications head Jairam Ramesh said, “Even though it reflects the Modi government’s desperation and hypocrisy, the Indian National Congress welcomes the posthumously awarded Bharat Ratna to the champion of social justice Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakurji,” he said."

Late K M Mani, a veteran of regional party Kerala Congress (M), was then forced to quit as the Finance Minister in the wake of the scandal — he was accused of pocketing Rs 1 crore from bar hotel owners to renew their liquor licence. Mani died in April 2019.
In his autobiography, which was released here on Thursday, Mani wrote that senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, who had been the Home Minister in the UDF regime, took a stand against him (ordered vigilance probe into the allegations) because he (Mani) did not put his weight behind the demand to make Chennithala the chief minister.
The autobiography, titled Athmakatha, was released by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who handed over a copy to Assembly Speaker A N Shamseer.
When the bar bribery scandal emerged, Oommen Chandy was the Chief Minister and Chennithala was the second-in-command in the Cabinet, holding home and vigilance portfolios. Being leaders of two power groups in the Congress, both were at loggerheads and Chennithala had looked for a change of leadership in the government.
Mani, in the autobiography released posthumously, wrote, “Two days after a bar owner raised the allegation against me, a probe was ordered by Chennithala. It looked as if they were waiting to hear an allegation. Had Chennithala considered the propriety of issuing such an order against a senior colleague like me, it (the probe) would not have happened. That I did not favour a change of leadership (in the UDF) to help Chennithala become the chief minister might have influenced the decision to order the probe. He might have seen the allegation as a stick to beat me.”
“The allegation was baseless and the bar owners had given only election funds, which is a normal practice during any poll time. A section of Congress leaders had conspired to eliminate the party, Kerala Congress. They could not stomach Kerala Congress remaining a political force in the state. The bar bribery case was the fallout of that conspiracy of Congress leaders,’’ he wrote in the autobiography.
The bar bribery scandal was a severe setback for the Congress. The solar scandal, which had simultaneously hit the UDF regime, was allegedly kept alive with the support of bar hotel owners, who had suffered losses in the UDF liquor policy.
The bar case was the main reason for the Kerala Congress (M) to distance itself from the Congress and eventually walk out of the UDF alliance. Ahead of the Assembly elections in 2021, Kerala Congress (M), led by Mani’s son Jose K Mani, had joined the CPI(M)-led LDF, thus taking away a chunk of traditional Christian votes of the UDF to the LDF. The Kerala Congress helped the LDF win several seats in central Kerala, although a breakaway faction of the Kerala Congress, led by P J Joseph, remained with the UDF.
Chennithala, who had been the Opposition leader from 2016 to 2021, had lost his prominence in the party after the rout of the UDF in 2021. Had UDF won the Assembly elections of 2021, Chennithala would have been the natural choice for the chief minister’s post."

According to a clause of the pact, ULFA shall abjure the path of violence, give up all arms and ammunition and disband the organisation within one month.
The tripartite agreement was signed by the central and state governments and the ULFA.
The decision to disband the organisation was taken at a meeting of the organisation held in Assam’s Darrang district on Tuesday, the outfit’s General Secretary Anup Chetia told PTI.
It was also decided at the meeting to form a seven-member monitoring committee to ensure the implementation of the various clauses of the tripartite agreement, he said.
Chetia will be the convenor of the committee.
A socio-cultural organisation named ‘Asom Jatiya Bikash Mancha’ will be formed, which will work towards protecting the cultural and linguistic identity of the society, he said.
The members will also soon meet Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to inform him about the outfit being disbanded and also to take forward the implementation of the agreement, Chetia added.
A possible organisational set-up for the rehabilitation of the cadres and to involve them in productive economic activity was also discussed at the meeting, another senior leader Mrinal Hazarika said.
The outfit will also have to vacate all the nine designated camps where ULFA cadres and their families were staying after coming for talks in 2011.
The arms/ammunition will be handed over to the state government at a formal ceremony later this month.
The agreement, signed in New Delhi in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, also included an ex-gratia payment to the cadres, funding of their economic, vocational training and government jobs depending on eligibility along with withdrawal of criminal cases registered against the cadres for non-heinous crimes.
The ULFA was formed on April 7, 1979, in Sivasagar by a group of 20 youths from Upper Assam districts to establish a sovereign Assam through an armed struggle. The outfit had split in 2011 with the top leadership, including Chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, returning to Assam from a neighbouring country and agreed to talk without the sovereignty clause and submitted a 12-point charter of demands to the central government.
Another faction ULFA (Independent), led by Paresh Barua, remained firm on the demand for sovereignty and is yet to come for talks."

“On the auspicious occasion of the consecration in Ayodhya, my resolve has been further strengthened that the people of India should have their own solar rooftop system on the roof of their houses,” Modi said, announcing the Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana.
“This will not only reduce the electricity bills of the poor and middle classes, but will also make India self-reliant in the energy sector,” the Prime Minister said on X (Twitter).
Although the 1-crore-households target is new, the installation of solar systems on rooftops has been an ongoing government programme for more than a decade. But it is running far behind schedule — and the announcement by the Prime Minister is an attempt to give a fresh push to decentralised solar power in the country.
In one of his first major decisions after becoming Prime Minister in 2014, Modi had set a target of installing 100 GW of solar power in the country by 2022. This was a five-fold jump from the existing target at that time. Forty per cent of this capacity — 40 GW — was supposed to come from grid-connected solar rooftop systems.
While the installed solar power capacity in the country has risen rapidly over the past decade, the 100 GW target for 2022 has been missed by a long margin, and so has the target for rooftop installations. At the end of last year, the total solar installed capacity in the country had reached only 73.3 GW, of which grid-connected rooftop solar contributed just about 11 GW.
Part of the reason why the country fell behind the target was the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. But even before that, the growth trajectory of solar power was not sufficiently steep. The 40 GW target for rooftop solar systems is now supposed to be achieved by 2026.
The details of the new programme have not been released yet, but its focus is slightly different in that it is targeting a certain number of households instead of installed capacity. From this perspective, this latest initiative is similar to the ones that have been launched in some other countries in the past.
In the late 1990s for example, the United States had unveiled plans to put rooftop solar systems on 1 million houses, a target that took about 20 years to achieve. A few countries in Europe too have had similar programmes.
Also, the new programme announced by the PM is aimed primarily at individual households that have remained largely untapped by the ongoing schemes on rooftop solar. As a recent report by the public policy think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) showed, the residential sector currently accounts for just 20% of the installations of rooftop solar capacity. The bulk of the current installations have happened in the commercial and industrial sectors.
Residential buildings, therefore, offer a vast, untapped potential. The same CEEW report showed that the nearly 25 crore households across the country have the potential to deploy 637 GW of solar energy on rooftops, and just a third of this is enough to meet India’s entire demand for electricity from the residential sector.
Not all of this is feasible, of course — but there is nonetheless tremendous scope for growth in India’s rooftop solar power capacity. The CEEW report says about one-fifth of this potential, or about 118 GW, is certainly doable.
Importantly, the potential for rooftop solar is available uniformly across all states and regions, unlike concentrated generation of electricity through large solar parks that require big corporate investments, open tracts of land, and powerful transmission lines.
Whether targeting installed capacity or number of households, the overall objectives of such programmes are the same: ensuring energy security, effecting a transition to non-fossil sources of energy, and increasing energy access.
India has an international commitment to ensure that by 2030 about 50% of its installed capacity of electricity generation comes from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources. This share has already reached 43%, with renewables — wind, solar, biogas — contributing about 30% of the total installed capacity. But with India’s electricity demand expected to rise sharply, and other non-fossil fuel sources like nuclear or hydro unlikely to show a major surge, renewable energy, particularly solar, needs to grow at a very rapid pace to fulfill the demand.
However, potential alone is not enough, as the experience with the ongoing programmes has shown.
The government will have to incentivise the installation of rooftop solar on individual households — and using just financial mechanisms will not suffice. Of course, financial incentives are available even for the ongoing programme, and they are essential.
But many other measures need to be taken to create an enabling environment for greater penetration. Experts say the learnings from the ongoing exercise would help the government in designing the right model that ensures greater success for the Suryodaya Yojana.
One of the key interventions needed in this direction is to enable and empower the distribution companies, especially ones that do not put an additional financial burden on them. Most of the electricity distribution companies are already bleeding, and improving their financial health is a prerequisite for the success of the new programme."

In the legion of India’s great freedom fighters, Bose occupies a special spot, as a man who raised an army to fight for India’s liberty and sought help from Britain’s enemies to defeat the Empire militarily.
An episode that is illustrative of many of Bose’s qualities — daring, resourcefulness, and the lengths he was prepared to go to for India’s independence — is of his escape to Germany from house arrest in Calcutta after World War II broke out.
Here’s the story of how Bose reached Berlin, from Calcutta to Gomoh to Peshawar to Kabul to Russia, changing identity thrice along the way.
July 1940: Bose is arrested
By July 1940, Bose had resigned from the Congress and launched his own party, Forward Bloc. Apart from his commitment to the cause of India’s freedom, Bose was also a staunch champion of Hindu-Muslim unity. Working for both these causes, he joined a movement demanding the removal of the Holwell Monument from Dalhousie Square in Calcutta.
This monument was in the memory of British prisoners of war who died allegedly due to the excesses of the army of Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal. John Zephaniah Holwell, an East India Company employee, had claimed that after the Nawab’s forces defeated the British in June 1756, a large number of prisoners of war were forced into a tiny room (‘black hole’) in Fort William, and more than a 100 died of suffocation. Bose and other nationalists believed this version to be exaggerated, and considered the monument an insult to the Nawab’s memory.
Once the movement for its removal was launched, the British gave in quickly. However, they used this as an excuse to arrest Bose, under the Defence of India Rules and on two counts of sedition.
Bose, however, had no intention of staying in jail when momentous developments were taking place in the world and could be used to India’s advantage. He launched a fast unto death, demanding his release. As the popular leader’s health worsened, the British released him, intending to arrest him once he got better.
Plans to escape begin
On December 6, 1940, Bose returned to his heavily guarded house in Calcutta, with British spies slipping in and out. All correspondence to the house was being monitored. However, Bose, along with his nephew Sisir, began to plan ways to escape. Gradually, some more people were involved in the plan, including Mian Akbar Shah, the Forward Bloc’s provincial head of the North Western Frontier Province, who had travelled from Afghanistan to the Soviet Union in his youth. It was decided that Bose would travel to Peshawar as Muhammad Ziauddin, a North Indian Muslim gentleman, and from there to Kabul.
To deflect suspicion, in all his letters, Bose spoke about his future return to jail. He even wrote some post-dated letters that could be posted after his escape, to buy him more time to plan his next moves.
Soon after midnight on January 17, 1941, Bose and Sisir left the house, in the latter’s car. Historian Sugata Bose writes in his book His Majesty’s Opponent, “Subhas had changed into his disguise as “Muhammad Ziauddin.” Dressed in a long, brown, closed-collar coat, baggy shalwars, and a black fez, he wore the gold wire-rimmed glasses that he had stopped using more than a decade before.”
Sisir drove to his brother Asoke’s house near Dhanbad. From here, Asoke, his wife, Sisir, and ‘Muhammad Ziauddin’ drove to Gomoh station, where Ziauddin caught the train to Peshawar.
Crossing the border
Once here, Bose was met by Mian Akbar Khan, who arranged his escape beyond the borders of the British empire into Afghanistan, via a car and a trek with the help of a tribal guide. Bose had changed into another disguise, that of a deaf-and-mute Pathan. The last bit was necessary as Bose did not speak Pashto, the local language.
Sugato Bose writes, “Bhagat Ram [an associate of Mian Akbar Khan], under the assumed name “Rahmat Khan,” would be taking his deaf-mute elder relative Ziauddin to the shrine at Adda Sharif, in an attempt to cure him of his affliction. Abad Khan taught Ziauddin how to drink water from a kandoli and partake of food from a common plate with his fellow Pathans. With a new set of clothes, complete with the local headgear, Subhas Chandra Bose fully looked the part but had to be careful not to utter a word.”
After crossing the border, Bose and his helpers managed to get to Kabul. Here, they had to spend some time of uncertainty and worry, as they tried to look for ways to travel to Europe or the Soviet Union, even as a livid British continued to look for Bose.
Bose eventually walked up to the German embassy and asked for help. The Italians, the Russians, and the Germans all helped Bose travel to Berlin via Russia. For this, a third identity was necessary — that of Orlando Mazzotta, an Italian diplomatic courier, whose actual passport Bose used to escape Kabul.
Finally, on April 2, 1941, Bose managed to reach Berlin, crossing four countries and outwitting the most powerful empire in the world."

The case was registered under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 290 (public nuisance), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 149 (unlawful assembly and common object) of the Indian Penal Code.
An officer of the High Grounds police said that Nalapad and other protesters caused public nuisance despite being asked to end the torchlight rally. They had not taken permission to hold such a rally, the officer added.
In a complaint, Inspector Bharat stated that about 25-30 Youth Congress members had gathered on the premises of Congress Bhavan and were carrying torchlights made with cotton fabric. “This affected the public on the street and traffic movement. Though several announcements were made through a microphone that it was wrong to gather illegally in public places, they continued. The police personnel eventually had to douse the fire on the torchlights and took the illegally gathered people into custody as a precautionary measure.”"
BC7Q39T380_10YFF1C7U714S8D,"‘With flexibility, access to maths and science courses, engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad’",_,"Updated: January 28, 2024 11:35 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/education/a-lesson-from-iit-a-btech-at-iit-on-the-way-to-a-career-in-mathematics-and-sciences-jee-main-2024-9122028/,"— Chetan D. Pahlajani
It’s the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) season, and so amidst the anxiety and anticipation capping years of hard work, you possibly find yourself wondering: “If I can make it to one of my preferred IITs, which BTech programme should I choose?” You look up the top choices: “Okay, Computer Science, then. But I think Mechanical or Electrical Engineering may be much broader. What about Chemical or Civil?” There’s input from friends and family, which might not all of is necessarily helpful. And then, perhaps, you love the sciences, but are ambivalent about engineering, and wonder: “Is engineering even the right choice for me? Perhaps I might be better off pursuing an Integrated MSc in the physical sciences.”
These are difficult questions with no easy answers, and so, when the time comes, one will have to make an important life decision with incomplete information. The good news is that very often, one’s academic and professional trajectory and eventual success may not depend so much on making the perfect choice, but simply on making a good enough choice. Part of the reason is that a good BTech programme at many of the IITs is a remarkably good springboard for a variety of career paths, as is evident from the biographies of numerous distinguished IIT alumni.
However, I want to turn my attention to the last group of students mentioned above, passionate about science but unsure about engineering. I too once belonged to that group, and following conventional wisdom at the time, chose engineering (though not at an IIT). What followed were a few not-so-happy years, but I fortunately had the opportunity to take several advanced Mathematics courses, and secured admission to a PhD programme in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I wrote my doctoral thesis in Probability Theory guided by an advisor who, interestingly enough, had also started as a student in Electrical Engineering and then switched to a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I got a postdoctoral position, worked in the US for a few years, joined IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) in 2014, and lived happily ever after. More or less…
Anyway, back to you and your predicament. Well, one thing I have learned over the years is just how versatile an engineering degree can be, provided one can also take courses in one’s area of interest, whatever that may be. This brings me back to the IITs, specifically IITGN, since it is the only IIT where I have worked. Two big strengths of the BTech programme at IITGN are equipping engineering students with a solid foundation in the basic sciences, and providing students the chance to explore numerous courses outside their major. With Mathematics, all students are required to take a few core courses: single and multivariable calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. Additionally, each engineering department may require their students to take specific courses.
Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter). Further, students who have completed at least four semesters with satisfactory academic performance can also apply for a joint BTech/MSc dual degree, where the additional MSc degree can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. We recently had a BTech student from Mechanical Engineering take this route, also completing an MSc in Mathematics in the process. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Ohio State University.
The take-home message here is that with a bit of flexibility and access to Mathematics and Science courses, an Engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad for pursuing higher education and a career in these fields. Besides academics, Mathematics PhDs have found careers in Quantitative Finance, and more recently, in Data Science. And so, if you think your dream is to study the Navier-Stokes equations or Algebraic Geometry or Particle Physics or Neuroscience — but you’re not yet sure — a good BTech programme might not be a bad place to start.

BI655195I2_UUK1E461YSLS0CX,Govt should not cut import duties on parts used in making smartphones in Budget: GTRI,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 08:51 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/govt-should-not-cut-import-duties-on-parts-used-in-making-smartphones-in-budget-gtri-9122716/,"The government should avoid slashing import duties on electronic components used for the manufacturing of smartphones in the Union Budget as the current tariff structure has helped boost domestic manufacturing, a think tank said on Monday.
This runs counter to the demand put forth by India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA). The industry body says that the purpose of the duty has run its course and that a import duty cut would boost domestic production of handsets by 28 per cent to $82 billion.
“Currently, tariffs on imported parts for smartphones in India are between 7.5 per cent and 10 per cent. The Budget should maintain these taxes. The Budget should not cut the import tariffs on parts used to make smartphones,” it said, adding that the current rate of levies supports duty-free imports for making products to exports.
The think tank said that Indian manufacturers “must pay” duties on smartphones sold within India, but exports should be exempted from such duties.
“Firms can import necessary inputs or capital goods duty-free for manufacturing and exporting electronic items. This is facilitated through schemes like Advance Authorisation, Export Promotion Capital Goods, and operating in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) or 100 per cent Export Oriented Units. Additionally, firms can use the customs bond scheme for duty-free imports without localisation requirements,” GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.
The GTRI report also said that India’s smartphone industry, with exports booming from $ 7.2 billion in 2022 to $13.9 billion in 2023, becomes the top performer for the PLI (production linked incentive) scheme by a wide margin and over 98 per cent of smartphones sold in India are made locally.
This shows the success of deft policy interventions that include the PLI incentives that allow 4-6 per cent cash incentive on annual incremental production and retaining a difference in tariffs of smartphones and its components.
“Big players like Apple, using facilities in SEZs, benefit greatly from this, exporting large volumes without paying import duties on components. Apple collaborates with contract manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron to make smartphones in India. Both Foxconn and Wistron are located in SEZs in India,” he said.
Srivastava added that removing tariffs might lead to a rise in superficial assembly plants that rely on imported parts and contribute little to the local economy.
“Such setups would likely vanish once government incentives end, harming deeper, more sustainable manufacturing efforts in India. Imported components and subassemblies account for the bill of material value of an India-made smartphone up to 90 per cent,” he added.
Rising import bill of electronic components from $24.4 billion to $30.7 billion, a 25.5 per cent growth, suggests a high use of imported components in local manufacturing, the GTRI said, adding that with time, there is an expectation that value addition will go up as more components are made locally.
“However, cutting import duties on components will kill any incentive for setting up a deep manufacturing operation in India. Firms will be happy to assemble a mobile phone from nearly ready imported kits. They will pack and go as soon as government incentives disappear,” it added."

Startling footage captured by onlookers on the ground in Miami revealed flames erupting from the aircraft’s side as it battled the critical situation.
The video shared on the Instagram handle @nowthis, which went viral, showcased the intense and alarming moment when the massive cargo plane became engulfed in flames mid-air. Fortunately, all crew members on board managed to escape unharmed, marking a miraculous escape from what could have been a disaster.
The video mentions that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) swiftly launched a preliminary investigation into the incident. Preliminary findings disclosed a ‘softball-sized hole’ located above one of the plane’s engines, shedding light on the possible cause of the mid-air emergency.

The fiery scene over Miami sent shockwaves across social media, with viewers expressing their concerns and relief as the plane descended for the emergency landing.
The next few lines in the caption read that Boeing released a statement in response to the incident, stating that it is actively supporting Atlas Air following the unfortunate incident involving their 747-8 cargo plane.
One user wrote, “Dang, 2024 is really going after Boeing.” A second added, “Boeing needs an internal safety audit. It’s getting out of hand.”
A third expressed relief by saying, “I’m so glad everyone is okay. What a rough way to end your duty day. Congrats to the pilots for landing safely.” And a fourth wrote, “What is happening with the airplanes?!?!???!?”
This isn’t the first time something like this has resulted in an emergency landing. Recently, Phil Hardy, a British traveller, prompted the cancellation of Flight VS127 at Manchester Airport on January 15 as he observed four missing screws on the wing, which caused an instant alarm.

“Netaji had said that if we want to make India great, the foundation of political democracy and democratic society should be strong. But unfortunately, after independence, his idea came under severe attack,” Modi said.
During his address, he also called on people, especially women and the youth, to end the “evils” of nepotism, dynasticism and corruption in Indian politics.
“After independence, evils like nepotism and dynasticism started dominating India’s democracy. This has also been a major reason why India could not develop at the pace it should have,” Modi said. “We will have to show courage to end these evils through politics and defeat them,” he added.
During the programme, Modi also launched the Bharat Parv, which will showcase the country’s rich diversity with Republic Day tableaux and cultural exhibits featuring efforts of 26 ministries and departments, highlighting citizen-centric initiatives, vocal for local, diverse tourist attractions, among others. The festival will be held till January 31, at the Ramlila Maidan and the Madhav Das Park in front of the Red Fort.

In a televised address to a gathering on the temple premises, shortly after the Pran Pratishthan ceremony where he was joined by RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Modi said, “January 22, 2024 is not a mere date on the calendar, it is the origin of a new Kaal Chakra,” “Hamare Prabhu Ram aa gaye hain” (our Lord Ram has come) and “will no longer be in a tent” – a reference to the makeshift temple that came up at the then disputed site after the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992.
“Today’s occasion is not only a moment of celebration but also a moment that signifies the maturity of Indian society. For us, this occasion is not only about vijay (victory) but also about vinay (humility)… The way our country has untangled this knot of history with seriousness and sensitivity, it indicates that our future is going to be much more beautiful than our past… A thousand years from today, people will talk about this date, this moment. And how great is Lord Ram’s grace that we are living in this moment, witnessing it happen,” he said.
“There was a time when some people said that if the Ram temple was built, it would lead to unrest. Such people failed to understand the purity of India’s social sentiment. The construction of this temple of Ram Lalla is also a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and coordination in Indian society.”
“We are seeing that this construction is not igniting aag (fire), but rather it is giving birth to oorja (energy). The Ram temple has brought inspiration to every section of society to move towards a brighter future. Today, I call upon those people… Feel it, rethink your perspective. Ram is not fire, Ram is energy. Ram is not vivaad (dispute), Ram is the samadhan (solution), Ram is for everyone. Ram is not just the present, Ram is eternal.”
“The entire nation is celebrating Diwali today. Every household is prepared to light the Ram Jyoti in the evening.”
Recalling his visit Sunday to Arichal Munai in Dhanushkodi, the starting point of Ram Setu, Modi said it was the moment which altered the Kaal Chakra. Drawing an analogy to that moment, he said he got the belief that today’s moment will also be the one to alter the circle of time and move forward.
During his 11-day anushthan, he said he attempted to bow at all the places where Ram had set foot. Mentioning Panchvati Dham in Nashik, Thriprayar temple in Kerala, Lepakshi in Andhra Pradesh, Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam, Sri Ramanathaswamy temple in Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi, he expressed gratitude for the journey from the sea to river Sarayu.
“From the sea to the Saryu river, the same festive spirit of Ram’s name is prevalent everywhere… Lord Ram is connected to every particle of the soul of India. Ram resides in the hearts of Indians.”
Modi said there must have been something lacking in “our efforts” that it took centuries for Ram to return to Ayodhya. “Today, I also seek forgiveness from Lord Shri Ram. There must have been some shortcomings in our efforts, our sacrifices, our penance, that we couldn’t accomplish this task for so many centuries. Today, that deficiency has been fulfilled. I believe Lord Ram will surely forgive us today.” In the Treta Yuga, he said, Ayodhya missed Ram for 14 years, while people of this era missed him for five centuries.
Recalling that the first draft of the Constitution had Ram in it, the Prime Minister also thanked the judiciary: “I express my gratitude to the judiciary of India, which upheld the dignity of justice. The temple of Lord Ram, synonymous with justice, was also built in a lawful manner.”
Thanking the kar sevaks, sants and Ram Bhakts for their contribution to the movement for the Ram temple, Modi exuded confidence that the future of the country would be much more beautiful than its past.
“In the form of Lord Ram, today is also the Pran Pratishtha of Indian civilisational values and humanity… We have to vow to build a samarth (capable), saksham (able), bhavya (grand) and divya (divine) Bharat.”
“This is not just a divine temple. It is a temple of India’s vision, philosophy and direction. It is a temple of national consciousness in the form of Ram,” he said.
“Moving beyond the construction of the temple, now all of us citizens, from this moment, pledge to build a capable, magnificent and divine India.”
He asked people to expand their consciousness from Dev to Desh, Ram to Rashtra – from deity to nation – and learn from Hanuman’s service, devotion and dedication. “These feelings of devotion, service and dedication in every Indian will become the basis of a capable, grand and divine India,” he said.
He said none should think he is too small to contribute to the country, that people should take inspiration from Jatayu who fought Ravan despite being aware he could not defeat him.
He urged the youth to take inspiration from their glorious tradition and work for a country that had now reached the Moon and space: “You represent the generation of India that is hoisting the flag on the Moon, conducting Mission Aditya by travelling 15-lakh kilometres… waving the flag of Tejas in the sky and Vikrant in the sea. You have to write the new dawn of India while being proud of your heritage.”
Peppering his speech with socially inclusive messages, Modi recalled the “Adivasi mother” Shabri who used to say “Ram aayenge” and (kevat) Nishad Raj who helped Ram and Sita cross the Ganga in his boat.
The speech marked a near continuum with the Prime Minister’s speeches after the 2019 Supreme Court judgement and the foundation laying ceremony of the Ram temple on August 5, 2020.
“Sri Ram temple will be the modern symbol of our culture and I am intentionally using the word ‘modern’. It will symbolise our eternal hope. It will epitomise our national feeling. This temple will be the emblem of the collective will power of millions of people. This shrine will inspire hope, devotion and determination in the minds of future generations,” Modi said in 2020. “Lord Ram is the foundation of our culture; he is the dignity of India. He personifies dignity. It is with this splendour that the “bhoomipujan” (ground-breaking) ceremony of the grand temple of Sri Ram has taken place.”
He had also likened the foundation-laying ceremony after “centuries of struggle” to the freedom struggle against British rule. He had commended the country for maintaining peace, just as it had done when the Supreme Court had pronounced its verdict."
BVXOKF29Z8_W6MUS3ADEUOV9HI,How Bose’s INA helped India win independence — but not on the battlefield,Arjun Sengupta,"Updated: January 24, 2024 00:14 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/subhas-chandra-bose-ina-helped-win-india-independence-not-battlefield-9123486/,"Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897. His Indian National Army (INA), also called the Azad Hind Fauj (literally Free Indian Army), faced the British on the battlefield during World War II. While militarily unsuccessful, the INA played a crucial role in India’s struggle for independence. In what way? We explain.
Bose takes over the INA
The INA was formed on February 17, 1942, two days after the British surrendered to Japanese forces in Singapore. It mostly comprised Indian prisoners of war (PoWs) captured by the Japanese during their Southeast Asia campaign. The Japanese thought that a native Indian force would be a powerful weapon in its planned conquest of India.
By December, however, the army was in disarray, lacking vision and leadership. It would take the arrival of Subhas Chandra Bose to turn things around. Bose arrived in Singapore in July 1943, after courting both the Nazis and the Japanese for help in India’s independence struggle. He took charge of the 12,000-strong INA on July 4.
“For an enslaved people, there can be no greater pride, no higher honour, than to be the first soldier in the army of liberation,” he told his troops the next morning, and immediately rejuvenated the army.
Over the next few months, he would carry out a public relations masterpiece, gathering support — in both men and material — from the Indian diaspora in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. The INA’s strength eventually grew to more than 40,000 personnel, and many Indians donated their life savings for the cause.
A doomed fight for freedom
From the very beginning, Bose had pinned his hopes on a large-scale uprising within the country, to complement the INA’s attack at the border. “When the British government is thus attacked from both sides — from inside India and from outside — it will collapse, and the Indian people will then regain their liberty,” he said in speech on July 9, 1943.
But to spark a countrywide revolution, the INA needed to first achieve some military successes of its own. Unfortunately, by the time Bose’s army was ready to fight, the tide of the war had turned.
Instead of a victorious romp into Assam and then to Delhi, as Bose had hoped, the Imphal offensive of 1944 was a deadly reality check. After being unable to take Imphal and Kohima, the supply starved INA, along with its Japanese allies, was forced to retreat, all while suffering heavy losses due to the enemy’s air superiority and gunpowder, as well as starvation and disease. The army would never set foot in India again.
By 1945, the British had launched their own campaign to retake Burma, and the INA once again found itself in retreat. Many perished or surrendered to the rampaging Allies, and by August, Bose and what was left of the INA were back in Singapore. After the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered on August 15.
Bose wanted to stay with his troops for the surrender, but was persuaded to leave by his subordinates. He died in a plane crash three days later.
But Bose’s fight was not in vain
Even after the military defeat, Bose genuinely believed that the INA’s fight had not been in vain. “… I regret more than you do that your sufferings and sacrifices have not borne immediate fruit. But they have not gone in vain, because they…will serve as an undying inspiration to Indians all over the world. Posterity will bless your name, and will talk with pride about your offerings at the altar of India’s Freedom…,” he said in a message to his supporters on July 15. He was right.
After the war, Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian army, decided to publicly prosecute senior INA officers for high treason. The trials would be held publicly at the Red Fort from November 1945 to May 1946, and unleash a wave of nationalist sentiment among the public.
Contrary to Auchinleck’s calculations, the Indian public overwhelmingly sympathised with Bose’s INA, hailing the soldiers as heroes in India’s national struggle. Shah Nawaz Khan, Prem Sahgal and Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon, facing the first and most high-profile of court martials, became a potent symbol of the unity of Indians.
So overwhelming was the national sentiment that the Indian National Congress — which had been highly critical of Bose and his decision to ally with the Japanese — decided to assume responsibility for defending the accused. Jawaharlal Nehru himself put on his barrister’s coat for the trial.
For the British, particularly concerning was the sympathy that INA soldiers had aroused among men of the British Indian armed forces.
Between February 18-25, 1946, mutiny broke out in the Royal Indian Navy, spreading from Bombay to Karachi and Calcutta, and eventually involving more than 20,000 Indian personnel and 78 ships. Another mutiny broke out in the Army in late February in the Jabalpur Cantonment.
“Thus, in the aftermath of the trial, the very idea of a British Indian Army — an imperial army — became untenable: the identity of the armed forces had now come to be grounded in that of the nation to such an extent that there could only be either a British Army or an Indian Army,” the historian Mithi Mukherjee wrote. (‘The “Right to Wage War” against Empire: Anticolonialism and the Challenge to International Law in the Indian National Army Trial of 1945’ in Law and Social Enquiry, 2019).
For the British, losing control over the Indian soldiers in their armed forces effectively ended their ability to govern their colonial possessions in India — and maybe beyond.
The newly elected British Premier, Clement Atlee, announced the Cabinet Mission a day after the mutiny started. While multiple INA officers were found guilty on various charges, their sentences were never carried out."

While the charred bodies of a woman and her daughter were found in one part of the house located in Champadanga, the son appeared to have died by suicide. The Tarkeshwar police have launched an investigation.
Officers identified the deceased as Bijli Maiti, 54, her daughter Sujata Maiti, 31, and son Shubham Maiti, 29, residents of the Biswaspara area in Champadanga village panchayat. The family was reportedly under stress due to financial burdens.
According to sources in the locality and family, there was no activity in the house since Monday morning even as neighbours noticed a burning smell and alerted relatives. The door was soon opened by force and the bodies of the two women were found lying on the floor, fully burnt.
A police officer said, “The cause of the tragic deaths remains unclear. It is being investigated,” adding that the bodies have been sent for autopsy.
Prima facie, investigators have concluded that Shubham first set his mother and sister on fire before dying by suicide. Officers are investigating whether a family dispute or some other reason led to the incident.
Prabhat Chattopadhyay, deputy head of Champadanga village panchayat, said, “The real cause is not clear. The police are investigating. The girl was unmarried, while Shubham worked in a private company.”
Recently, a similar incident was reported at Garia in Kolkata where a man died by suicide after murdering his parents. The incident was the fallout of financial issues."
BWZX1CSQKK_14DRMOGVJTQ9OMR,Donald Trump and Joe Biden shift focus to general election rematch as Haley fights on,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 09:35 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/trump-biden-focus-general-election-haley-fights-9126691/,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden attacked each other on Wednesday as they prepared for a likely general election rematch in November after Trump’s win in New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary made his White House nomination increasingly likely, although his last remaining rival Nikki Haley vowed to stay in the race.
Former Republican President Trump’s back-to-back wins in nominating contests put him on an almost certain path toward a general election contest with Democratic President Biden. Both turned their fire on each other after Trump’s New Hampshire victory over Haley on Tuesday night.
Biden’s reelection campaign issued a statement saying it is “now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee,” and repeated warnings that the former president is a threat to democracy.
Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to repeat unfounded allegations that Biden and his Justice Department were engaged in political persecution, following the multiple criminal indictments of Trump last year. But Haley, who served as Trump’s U.N. ambassador and is now his sole opponent for the Republican nomination, pledged to take that race to South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 24, and beyond.
In a speech to supporters in South Carolina on Wednesday night, Haley said US voters deserved a better option than a Biden-Trump rematch, “and we’re going to give it to them.”
She also repeated her challenge to Trump to debate her. “Bring it Donald, show me what you got!” she declared to cheers.
The Republican nominating race has months to go, but Trump is seeking to knock Haley out and become the presumptive nominee quickly.
In South Carolina, Trump, 77, will be looking to embarrass Haley, 52, by defeating her in her home state. Haley is aiming for an upset delivered by voters who twice elected her as governor.
Haley has three rallies scheduled in South Carolina in the coming days, and her campaign released two new ads as part of a $4 million ad buy in the state.
One attacks Biden, 81, as “too old” and Trump as “too much chaos,” and calls a reprisal of the 2020 election a “rematch no one wants.” The other says she delivered “thousands of jobs, lower taxes, tough immigration laws” as governor from 2011 to 2017.
Republicans have largely coalesced around Trump, however, putting pressure on Haley to drop out. Trump has racked up endorsements from most of South Carolina’s leading Republican figures. Opinion polls show him with a wide lead there.
Over the last several weeks, South Carolina U.S. Representative Joe Wilson, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and South Carolina Speaker of the House Burrell Smith have been calling state legislators and other local officials to push them to endorse Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the calls.
Trump senior adviser Jason Miller touted a new website focused on attacking Haley, haleyfacts.com, which criticizes her for her plan to scale back Social Security entitlements to keep the program solvent and for proposing a gasoline tax hike when she was governor.
Ford O’Connell, a Republican consultant based in Florida and a former Trump surrogate, said he expected the Trump campaign to pull out all the stops now against Haley.
“The plan in South Carolina is to embarrass Nikki Haley. The key is to make sure that the donors don’t fund her any further,” O’Connell said.
Joel Tenney, a Christian evangelist who was part of Trump’s faith coalition in Iowa, said he planned to travel to South Carolina next week as a volunteer to help target the state’s large base of evangelical voters.
Trump has remained popular with that voting bloc, winning a majority of white evangelicals as part of his commanding victory in Iowa earlier this month.
Haley has said she has a better chance of beating Biden than Trump, who faces multiple criminal charges, including for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.
Biden, who won the Democratic primary in New Hampshire after voters wrote his name in on the ballot, was endorsed by the United Auto Workers on Wednesday.
“Instead of talking trash about our union, Joe Biden stood with us,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a fiery speech that referred to Trump as a “scab.”
Trump is the first Republican to sweep competitive votes in both Iowa and New Hampshire since 1976, when the two states cemented their status as the first nominating contests.
Tuesday’s vote was the first one-on-one matchup between Trump and Haley, after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, once seen as Trump’s most formidable challenger, dropped out on Sunday and endorsed the former president.
Haley, who placed third in Iowa and lost to Trump by 11 percentage points in New Hampshire, refused to bow out.
“This race is far from over,” Haley told supporters at a post-election party in Concord, challenging Trump to debate her.
At his own party in Nashua, Trump opened his speech by mocking Haley, calling her an “imposter” and saying: “She’s doing, like, a speech like she won. She didn’t win. She lost. She had a very bad night.”"

During a ceremony in Beijing, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nauru counterpart Lionel Aingimea formally signed a document to restore bilateral relations, with ties at the ambassadorial level resuming with immediate effect.
Democratically governed Taiwan lost Nauru, one of its few remaining diplomatic allies, to China on Jan. 15, just days after a new Taiwanese president was elected. China claims Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taiwan strongly disputes.
Nauru’s government said it was seeking full resumption of diplomatic relations with China “in the best interests” of the country and its people. Nauru had recognised China before, between 2002 and 2005.
“The government of the Republic of Nauru recognises that there is only one China in the world, the government of the People’s Republic of China is the only legal government representing all of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory,” according to the document signed. Nauru also promised not to have any official exchanges with Taiwan.
Taiwan’s 12 remaining diplomatic allies include the Vatican, Guatemala and Paraguay, plus Palau, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific."
C29BJN9YHC_Z3IPKPZ3O531J10,"After Jagannath shrine, Naveen Patnaik ready with another, Rs 200 crore temple showcase",Sujit Bisoyi,"Updated: January 27, 2024 08:48 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/jagannath-naveen-patnaik-rs-200-crore-temple-showcase-9129211/,"Barely a week after it strategically timed the inauguration of the Jagannath Temple Parikrama project in Puri with the Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya, the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government is rolling out the second phase of its temple gambit, this time in the BJP’s western Odisha stronghold.
On Saturday, Chief Minister Patnaik will inaugurate the Samaleswari Temple Area Management and Local Economy Initiatives (SAMALEI) project at Sambalpur. Samaleswari or Samalei is known to be the presiding deity of the western region of the state. At the temple, situated on the banks of the Mahanadi river, the Goddess has been worshipped as ‘adishakti’ for centuries.
Considering the sentiments attached to it, Patnaik had not only announced a Rs 200-crore upgradation plan for the temple months after unveiling the Jagannath scheme, but also ensured its completion on time.
Like with the Rs 800-crore Puri project, which was dedicated to people on January 17, Patnaik has sent his trusted bureaucrat-turned-politician V K Pandian to visit Sambalpur multiple times to oversee its implementation.
Saturday’s inauguration ceremony has been planned with the similar fanfare and enthusiasm as the Puri event, with many BJD leaders likely to throng Sambalpur.
Besides, schools and colleges across Odisha have been told to remain closed on Saturday for the inauguration. All government offices will be anyway shut as it’s the fourth Saturday of the month.
“Religious rituals leading to the inaugural ceremony will start from Friday. A yajna will start before the inaugural event. The redevelopment of the temple and better amenities for devotees will attract more pilgrims to the shrine,” Sambalpur Collector Ananya Das told The Indian Express.
The SAMALEI plan Under the SAMALEI plan, the Patnaik government has developed more than 100 acres around the popular shrine.
The key objectives are to “celebrate the grandeur” of the 500-year-old shrine, “enhance the devotees’ experience”, “boost Sambalpur’s tourism-based economy”, and develop various projects around the temple to “create economic opportunities” for locals, officials said.
“What the Jagannath Temple is for the people of coastal and central Odisha, the Samaleswari Temple carries equal significance for most people in the western region. The state government’s efforts signal that our government believes in inclusivity and nurtures all cultures and traditions,” a senior BJD leader said.
Western Odisha poll matrix According to BJD insiders, the western Odisha poll matrix was very much on Patnaik’s mind when announcing the SAMALEI project. Western Odisha mainly comprises 10 districts, many of which border Chhattisgarh. In the Assembly polls held simultaneously, 8 of the 23 seats the BJP won were in this region. Even the Congress performed well here, winning 4 of its total 9 Assembly seats in Western Odisha.
With the Opposition challenge in mind, Patnaik, for the first time during the 2019 Assembly polls, contested from western Odisha, from Bijepur, as his second seat along with his traditional bastion of Hinjili in Ganjam. He won both the seats and later vacated Bijepur.
Apart from the SAMALEI project, the BJD has also accommodated six MLAs from western Odisha as ministers in the 20-member Patnaik Cabinet, to woo the region.
Last July, in another initiative, Patnaik launched the Mukhya Mantri Sabha Gruha scheme for the region, under which the government plans to build 2,000 kalyan mandaps (ceremonial halls).
In 2021, Patnaik had also doubled the grant to the Western Odisha Development Council, a special body, to Rs 200 crore.
Temple run to continue In the run-up to the 2024 polls, the SAMALEI project isn’t Patnaik’s only temple initiative. While the redevelopment of ancient shrines was an area of focus during Patnaik’s fifth term, it has now lined up dozens of other popular temples across the state for their upgradation. Patnaik’s temple push is also an apparent attempt to counter the BJP’s Hindutva push in Odisha, official sources said.
Under the Ekamra Kshetra Amenities and Monuments Revival Action (EKAMRA) plan, the government is spending Rs 280 crore for a facelift of around 66 acres surrounding the 11th-century Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar.
For Maharshivaratri on March 8, the government will inaugurate a 183-foot tall statue of Lord Shiva, built at a cost of Rs 10 crore, in the Jajpur district near the Barahanath Temple, as part of the Baraha Khetra development project.
Nearly a dozen other shrines, including the Sun Temple at Konark, Chandi Temple at Cuttack, Nilamadhab Temple at Kantilo, are expected to see upgrades before the 2024 elections.
The government has also sanctioned funds for development of temples in every panchayat. Despite only a small minority population, the government has also sanctioned funds for the development of religious places of other faiths.
“Odisha is known to be land of art and culture, and people’s emotions are attached to ancient shrines. Development of the popular and ancient shrines is a potential way through which one can connect to the people’s emotions and an effort to showcase Odia pride,” a senior bureaucrat said."
C41O2XC395_JFW6X229C4KUWV2,"From the Urdu Press: ‘If Nitish switches sides, won’t be surprising’, ‘INDIA bloc seems to be drifting’",Shahid Pervez,"Updated: January 23, 2024 17:33 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/urdu-press-india-alliance-lok-sabha-polls-2024-bjp-ram-mandir-9123354/,"The Lok Sabha polls may be just a couple of months away, but the Opposition INDIA alliance still seems to be in disarray, struggling to find a common ground and purpose in its bid to take on the BJP juggernaut, which has turned more formidable in the wake of the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
Reflecting this state of play in national politics, some of the Urdu dailies underlined that the INDIA parties have not been able to resolve their differences and wrap up seat-sharing, especially in crucial states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, so far. The dailies also wondered how could the Opposition grouping set a common poll narrative against the BJP when they continue to sing different tunes.
Amid growing buzz over the tension in the relations between the JD(U) and its key Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) partner RJD in Bihar, the multi-edition Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, in its January 21 editorial headlined ‘Nitish phir badlein ge paala (Will Nitish again switch sides)?’, says that self-interest guides the politics of every party, which keeps shifting as per the changing situation. “When Nitish broke up with the BJP in August 2022 and joined hands with the Mahagathbandhan to lead its government, it was difficult to predict that he would always continue to be part of the coalition involving the RJD, Congress and Left parties and that he would never return to the NDA,” it says.
A few weeks after taking charge as the new JD(U) president after replacing Rajiv Ranjan Singh or Lalan Singh, Nitish has rejigged his party, appointing a new team of national office-bearers, the editorial notes. “Nitish has brought back his close aide Vashishth Narayan Singh as the new vice-president and elevated K C Tyagi to the position of political advisor and spokesperson,“ it states. “Lalan Singh has not been inducted into Nitish’s new team. He had to step down as the national party president last month to make way for Nitish amid reports about his growing proximity to RJD chief Lalu Prasad,” the edit says, adding that there has been an atmosphere of uncertainty and speculations in Bihar for some time. “Is the stage set for any shake-up in Bihar politic? Would the INDIA bloc remain united in Bihar? All these questions are up in the air.”
The daily also points out that Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav has claimed that there are no differences between the allies, which would fight the Lok Sabha polls together under Nitish’s leadership. “Tejaswi along with his father Lalu also called on Nitish. But, meanwhile, in an interview Union Home Minister Amit Shah has indicated that the BJP would consider if a proposal for return of erstwhile NDA allies like Nitish comes,” it says. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when Nitish was part of the NDA, the JD(U) had won 16 seats and the BJP 17 out of the state’s 40. “Without Nitish it would not be easy for the BJP to clinch Bihar this time. But if Nitish sticks to the INDIA alliance, the Opposition camp would still appear united. However, if Nitish switches loyalties it would not be surprising. Despite being an architect of the alliance, he has not got much out of it,” the edit adds.
Referring to the raging face-off between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Shiv Sena faction led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, the New Delhi edition of Inquilab, in its editorial on January 18, says that besides moving the Supreme Court to challenge Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar’s decision — recognising the Shinde Sena as the “real Shiv Sena” and rejecting petitions seeking disqualification of its MLAs — the Uddhav Sena has also started taking the battle to the people’s court. It says that Uddhav held a town hall to reinforce his group’s case in public, presenting documents, proofs and arguments in this regard. “The outcome of the case in the apex court would be very important, given that it would have implications for splits in the party and destabilisation of governments in future.”
The editorial states that with the BJP’s backing, Shinde led his group to rebel against the Uddhav-headed party in June 2022, toppled the Uddhav-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and took over as the CM. Both the Senas approached the Election Commission (EC), which declared the Shinde faction as the “real Sena”, it notes, adding that the Uddhav Sena has contested it by citing the provision of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution that stipulates a merger of the breakaway outfit with another party. The EC also allotted the Sena’s original name and election symbol to the Shinde group, it says. “The fact however remains that Sena was founded by Bal Thackeray and after his demise his son Uddhav was appointed as the party chief following due process.”
The daily writes that the Uddhav Sena knows that following the setbacks it got by the EC and the Speaker’s rulings the party will have to fight the real battle in the midst of people, with the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls lined up through this year. “That is why Uddhav has now intensified his public outreach while still pursuing his legal remedies,” it says. “There are reports that the Uddhav Sena continues to have a resonance among people on the ground. The public support would eventually prove to be the decider in the final reckoning.”
Commenting on the INDIA camp’s seat-sharing troubles, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its leader on January 20, writes that the BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership is looking to pull off a hat-trick in the Lok Sabha polls and that going by its attempts to take mileage out of the Ayodhya event, it is evident that “BJP wants to cash in on the Ram Temple issue instead of going to the people with the plank of its 10-year track record”.
On the other hand, the INDIA bloc seems to be drifting with its constituents not shying away from targeting each other, the editorial says. “Such a situation is especially glaring in Bengal and UP. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav seems to be cross with the Congress — he might still not have got over the snub dealt to him by Congress veteran Kamal Nath during the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls,” it says, adding that Akhilesh and RLD president Jayant Chaudhary have firmed up their sub-regional seat-sharing agreement, whereby the RLD has been allotted seven seats to contest in its western UP turf.
Such local seat-adjustments may benefit both the allies but the question is, why the larger INDIA alliance is not driving these pacts, the editorial asks. “This signals that all is not well within the INDIA group. The leaders of its constituents need to come forward and firm up a comprehensive seat-sharing formula so that their alliance could become meaningful,” the edit says, adding that by running down an ally a party might benefit to a degree but it would deal a blow to the alliance’s overall prospects. “The Opposition parties should make moves that could be a win-win for them individually as well as for the alliance collectively,” it says. “There could be significant differences among the INDIA partners over seat-sharing in some states. They need to resolve it by focusing on common ground. And they must work out a consensus soon to ensure the unity and stability of their coalition.”"

She further said due to the case she had received work after a long gap for a photo shoot in Thailand and hence wanted permission to travel abroad. The NCB opposed her plea stating the trial is yet to begin and if allowed to travel, she may abscond and delay the trial.
“Considering the submissions from both sides and the reason as assigned by the applicant that she is a model by profession and it is necessary for her to travel abroad for her work purpose, I think it is proper to allow this application,” the court said in its order on Saturday."

Social media sensation Orhan Awatramani has dropped a new video announcing a deep dive into ‘The Relevance Room’, which he first spoke about on the latest episode of Koffee with Karan.
In the video, which he captioned on Instagram as, “Introducing, THE ORRYs ! 🙋🏿‍♂️🙎🏻‍♂️🧟‍♀️🙎🏻‍♂️🙎🏻‍♀️👵🏻 #TheRelevanceRoom coming 🔜 on YouTube”. Orry begins by saying he is going to introduce the audience to his “minions” while wearing a t-shirt which reads, “Lol, you are not Orry.”

“I don’t know their names, and I don’t want to know their names. They are just known as,” he says while walking swiftly in his “office” as the video cuts to ‘Orry no 2’, ‘Orry no 4’. Then actor Ananya Panday makes an appearance as ‘Orry no 3’. “But we killed her for getting too relevant,” Orry says as a screen pop-up shows her profile being blocked and later her head from their picture is edited out with Orry holding a knife.
“I am Orry no 1,” he says towards the end of the video. “The only one that matters.” The satirical tone of the video, its setting naturally reminded users of something they had seen before. When an Instagram user wrote, “why does this look like a cheap copy of some english thing??” Orry replied, “copy yes, cheap no.” Several other users commented that the video was similar to the American black comedy Scream Queens, from where Orry’s idea of naming his minions after himself also comes from.

On his Koffee with Karan appearance, Orry spoke about his “minions” and said there is an “Orry office” which has a “relevance room” where all his minions have to “dress up like me and think like me and talk like me.”
“To be a minion, you have to be an Orry. You have to think like me, dress like me, work like me, struggle like me and hustle like me. In my relevance room, all my minions come up with ideas. We have mood boards, and they pitch ideas on how to keep me relevant, and that’s how I stay in the news. This is a hustle.” When asked how many minions he has, Orry said, “As of right now, we have Orry 2, 4, 5 and 6. There was an Orry 3, but she got more relevant than me, so we killed her off. She’s gone now,” which has now been revealed to be Ananya Panday.

Summoned to the ED office in the morning, the NCP MLA was released at 10.10 pm. He has been called again on February 1.
“I wholeheartedly thank everyone who waited here for the whole day. We have decided not to bend in front of anyone and I am going to follow the same,” he said after his release, adding that he would continue to co-operate with the officials. He addressed party workers from the window at the first floor of NCP office.
“During the 12-hour interrogation, I never felt tired because you all were chanting and sloganeering for me. I was instead getting re-energised. When our leader Sharad Pawar came here and waited for whole day, it was clear that Pawar saheb supports the one who fights and not the one who quits,” Rohit said.

“We all have decided that we will fight for the pride and rights of the people of Maharashtra. I have worked honestly in my business and only then joined politics. Just because I am cooperating with the probe does not mean I will tolerate unjust actions against us or our workers,” he said.
“No matter how much Delhi tries, we have decided not to bow down in front of Delhi. We have decided to fight and our fight is to win,” he added.
In the morning, before entering the ED office, Rohit Pawar paid tributes at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Vidhan Bhavan as well as in front of the Preamble of the Constitution. He also carried with him a book on Maharashtra’s first chief minister late Yashvantrao Chavan and a copy of the Constitution. He also carried with him a file with photos of social reformers and great personalities.
Meanwhile, hundreds of NCP workers along with MLAs and other leaders had gathered outside the party office in support of Rohit. He touched the feet of NCP chief Sharad Pawar before leaving for questioning. Sharad Pawar was present in the party office throughout the 11 hours when Rohit was questioned.
Baramati Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule, MLAs Sunil Bhusara and Sandip Kshirsagar accompanied Rohit till the ED office. Party workers had put up banners and posters in support of Rohit Pawar in Ballard Piers area in south Mumbai where the ED office is located.
“This is the period of struggle for us. We will fight it out and I am sure that the truth will prevail. Rohit Pawar is fighting for the rights of youth. The people have love and affection towards him. The data from Parliament shows that 95% of actions from the central agencies are against those from the opposition. Therefore, the notice to Rohit was not unexpected,” said Sule. She added that since Rohit is working for the poor, farmers and working class, certain powers are bound to be unhappy with him and this notice could be a part of the revenge politics."
C6BUSMECJX_XO5Q1JW0BRO3RQU,"Solving Crime: How technology helped crack 2 autorickshaw gangrape cases in Chandigarh, set free an innocent",Saurabh Parashar,"Updated: January 24, 2024 23:17 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/solving-crime-autorickshaw-gangrape-cases-chandigarh-9126075/,"An image-enhancing software worth around Rs 7 lakh proved to be a game-changer for the police in cracking the gangrape of a girl in an autorickshaw that shook Chandigarh in November 2017. Besides, it also helped exonerate an autorickshaw driver wrongly imprisoned for more than a year in connection with a similar crime reported in December 2016.
Reports from the forensic examination of DNA samples of the three suspects from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), Sector 36, also played a pivotal role in solving the two consecutive serial autorickshaw gangrape cases.
A man, among the three accused who were nabbed, was involved in both the cases. Autorickshaw driver Wasim Malik was wrongly arrested, solely based on the victim’s ‘identification.’
The three suspects, later awarded rigorous life imprisonment under rape charges in August 2018, were autorickshaw driver Mohammed Irfan and his associates Mohammed Garib and Kismat Ali. Irfan, along with another suspect Kamal Hassan, was involved in the rape of a call centre employee in December 2016.
“The November 2017 auto gang rape case compelled us to believe that the criminals who used to rape autorickshaw passengers were still at large. Then SSP (UT) Nilambri Vijay Jagdale mobilised almost all the SHOs in charge of independent investigation agencies, including Crime Branch, Operations Cell, and Vigilance, to crack this case. There are very few instances when the entire police force is mobilised to solve one particular case, and the autorickshaw gangrape case was one of them,” shared SHO PS 36, Inspector Om Parkash, who was in charge of Sector 61 police post at that time.
The officer said the police had a blurred, unclear footage of a suspected autorickshaw, but reading its registration number was impossible.
“I contacted a private forensic expert, Rajesh Rana, who advised us to procure the paid software ‘MotionDSP,’ worth $9,500 (Rs 7.03 lakh). The software worked, extracting a clear image from the DVR of CCTV cameras installed at the Sector 42 fuel station, where the accused autorickshaw driver Irfan had filled fuel,” he said.
He added the software clarified most aspects of the number plate – three digits along with an alphabet of temporary registration numbers were visible in the extracted footage.
“The temporary registration number was CH-78T-2740. The software helped us obtain a clear image of digits 7, T, 2, and 4, among the last four numbers. The CH was evident in the rough footage of CCTV cameras as well. Digits 7, T, 2, and 4 were blurred in the footage, and other digits and alphabets were covered under the hands of the accused. We identified the automobile agency that sold autorickshaws bearing CH 7 temporary numbers in the market,” Om Parkash said.
The specific vehicle was sold in September 2016, and the police shortlisted 380 autorickshaws out of around 6,000 plying on Chandigarh roads. The automobile company sold an average of 100 three-wheelers every month. “With the help of the last two digits, 2 and 4, we narrowed it down to at least 27 autorickshaws, including the one used by Mohammed Irfan,” he said.
Indeed, the software assisted in retrieving clear three digits of the registration number of the suspected autorickshaw. The real breakthrough came when constable Pawan Kumar, part of another police team led by the then Station House Officer of Sector 49 police station, Inspector Ranjodh Singh, received information about Irfan Mohammed, who was arrested on November 24, 2017.
“The intense questioning of hundreds of drivers during the course of investigation had built a pressure on the auto drivers. We knew that the information about the accused would come only from the autorickshaw drivers. And this was what exactly happened. The main accused, Irfan Mohammed, was residing in Zirakpur. Constable Pawan received a tipoff about him. A recce around the makeshift house of Irfan led to the recovery of an autorickshaw whose temporary registration number matched the numbers caught in the footage of CCTV cameras installed at Sector 42 fuel station”, a police officer requesting anonymity said.
The officer maintained, “It was heart breaking when Wasim Malik, who was discharged from the rape case, came to us at Sector 36 police station later. He was overwhelmed and tried to touch my foot but I stopped him. He was crying and thanked all of us who were the first to nab three actual criminals including Irfan involved in both the auto gang rape cases. The results of DNA samples of the suspects were matched with the swabs collected from the clothes of victims. In fact, Wasim Malik’s DNA samples did not match with the samples collected from the clothes of victim in December 2016 rape case.”
In the December 2016 rape case, the victim was raped in a secluded area behind Iron Market, Sector 29.
After languishing almost 15 months in the jail, Wasim Malik was released on bail in March 2018 and subsequently discharged from the case in July 2018 when the prosecution submitted in the court that no evidence beyond the mere identification by the victim was found against him. Later, the victim too had retracted from her earlier statement that she had identified him in the police custody. By then, Mohammed Irfan had reportedly confessed to his involvement in the two rape cases along with his associates.
Forensic and IT expert Rajesh Rana who had assisted Chandigarh Police to procure the software told The Indian Express, “The software was procured in 2017. Today there are many refined and upgraded softwares being used to retrieve erased/deleted data from digital devices. Merely procuring software does not work. It requires an expert mind to apply the software on the right things including unclear images etc.”
Mohammed Garib and Kismat Ali who were arrested along with Irfan for raping a PG girl in August 2017 were not involved in December 2016 rape case. Mohammed Irfan, Mohammed Garib and Kismat Ali were convicted in August 2018 in connection with gangrape with a PG girl in November 2017.
Irfan and Kamal Hassan were convicted for the December 2016 gangrape in August 2019. The convicts are still lodged in Model Burail Jail. Earlier, Irfan had tried to end life inside the jail in 2018."

To protect her children, Aarya Sareen (Sushmta) needs full control of the drug business, from its transportation to its supply. But there are other players in the business, including the tough Ila Arun and the dangerous Russian mobster, who won’t let Aarya take full control. So, how will she assume the monopoly of the business while safeguarding her three children forms the crux of the remaining episodes of the series, which was nominated for International Emmy Awards.
The over two minutes-long trailer begins with several gunshots. Aarya seems to be trying hard to keep the Russian mobster away from her children, but his lost consignment has him swearing to kill them if Aarya doesn’t bring his consignment. Amid the chaos, Aarya starts to lose the trust of her children, for whom she got into the business in the first place. Her children call her selfish and leave her alone and miserable.

Just when Aarya is convinced about giving up on her life, her former faithful lieutenant (Sikander Kher) tells her to give up on her children, not herself. However, the end of the trailer has Aarya being shot at and falling to the ground, leaving the audience worried.
Created and co-directed by Ram Madhvani and co-produced by Amita Madhavni, Ram Madhvani, Ram Madhvani Films and Endemol Shine India, Aarya Antim Vaar boasts of an ensemble cast including Indraneil Sengupta, Vikas Kumar, Maya Sarao, Geetanjali Kulkarni, Shweta Pasricha, Viren Vazirani, Pratyaksh Panwar, Aarushi Bajaj, Bhupendra Jadawat and Vishwajeet Pradhan, among others.

Sushmita Sen said she gained strength from playing Aarya on-screen. She said, “Being Aarya Sareen on screen gave me a sense of power during times when I could not pick myself up. She gave me a new ground to explore as an actor and tune-in my emotional sensibilities and now that she gives her all and sacrifices everything for her family, it all feels more than personal. Aarya’s on-screen family is today my off-screen family and will continue to be. This trailer of Aarya Antim Vaar is just a peek into the showdown that Aarya is going to witness and how she meets her destiny with a bang!”
Aarya 3 Antim Vaar will start streaming on February 9."
CCRW5UQGAR_AOB17DRLORM2X7M,Harni boat capsize: Remand of 6 accused extended till January 31,_,"January 26, 2024 01:15 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/harni-boat-capsize-remand-of-6-accused-extended-till-january-31-9128160/,"A local court in Vadodara Thursday extended the police remand of six accused in the Harni boat capsize case by six days until January 31.
The six include three partners Bhimsinh Yadav, Vedprakash Yadav and Rashmikant Prajapati, and employees — manager Shantilal Solanki, and boatmen Nayan Gohil and Ankit Vasava. They were arrested on November 19.
The Special Investigation Team (SIT) had sought an extension of their remand by nine days. On Wednesday, the SIT was also granted the remand of Binit Kotia, owner of M/s Kotia Projects, until January 31.
“The SIT produced the six arrested accused in court at the end of their five days remand. The police have told the court that 12 more accused are yet to be arrested in the case. There is grave negligence in the case and the investigation needs getting into the depths of the operation of the Lake Zone, for which the remand of the accused is essential,” said District Government Pleader Anil Desai.
On Thursday, the Vadodara SIT also formally arrested Gopal Shah and Paresh Shah.
While Gopal was arrested after he was brought to Vadodara from Chhattisgarh, from where he was apprehended Wednesday, Paresh was nabbed by a team of the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Vadodara city police from Halol in Panchmahal district, the SIT said.
Both were arrested around 3.30pm Thursday and will be produced in court on Friday, the SIT said.
“The SOG, Prevention of Crime Branch (PCB) as well as the Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) are continuously looking for the accused. We have nabbed Gopal Shah and Paresh Shah based on technical surveillance. We nabbed Shah from Raipur in Chhattisgarh and Paresh Shah was nabbed from Halol in Panchmahal district. Their locations were constantly changing,” said
Joint Commissioner of Police Manoj Ninama who is heading the SIT.
According to the police, Paresh first escaped to Anand, then came to Panchmahal and went back to Anand before he was in Panchmahal again. He was nabbed while he was in his car in between Halol and Kalol in Panchmahal.
Meanwhile, the SIT has sent VMC a second reminder to submit relevant documents related to the project to help in the investigation, Ninama said. “We have asked the VMC to submit documents related to the contract (with M/s Kotia Projects), including certifications, permissions and other documents (regarding inspections) of the project. We have only received the contract document and we have sent a written reminder for the second time to the VMC to submit the documents. When we investigate the contents of the documents and the project in detail, we will be able to decide the liability of the civic body.”
The police have now arrested nine of the 20 persons booked for culpable homicide and negligence in the Harni boat tragedy that killed 12 students and two teachers on January 18. One of the accused is now deceased.
Ninama added that teams are now on the lookout for the 10 other accused, who are at large, including the wife, son and daughter of Paresh Shah. “Our teams are out in the field since the day of the tragedy and are tracking down the accused based on the technical surveillance.. We will be investigating who all sheltered the accused while they were on the run. Paresh Shah was at the centre of the operations of the Lake Zone and it has been verified by the Manager Shantilal Solanki, who was arrested on January 19,” he said.
“We will investigate whose account the income of Lake Zone was being transferred to, whether it was to Paresh Shah’s account or to the accounts of his family members. We have sought details of the properties owned by the family in the city as well as their passport details to mitigate their chances of escaping abroad… Look out circulars have been issued for the other partners,” Ninama added.
According to SIT, while Gopal is a partner of M/s Kotia Projects that was awarded the contract of the redevelopment of Motnath Harni Lake, Paresh, who was booked in the case on January 20 after police investigations revealed that he was in-charge of handling day-to-day operations at the Lake Zone, was not a partner in the firm.
Since the news of Paresh landing in police custody became public Thursday, videos of him at the spot soon after the boat accident on January 18 went viral in Vadodara. In the videos, Paresh is seen on the spot while VMC’s fire department carried out the initial rescue operation. A video of Paresh evading questions from mediapersons during the rescue operations on January 18 also became viral.
However, it was on January 20 that the Vadodara SIT began a search for him after booking him."

This week, the EU will hold a second round of talks on a free trade agreement with Thailand, with Bangkok keen on negotiations being wrapped up by early 2025.
Thailand’s economy, which has been languid for years, could be given a shot in the arm by the trade pact.
The pact would also solidify the EU’s pivot to Southeast Asia, with Brussels already having secured trade deals with Vietnam and Singapore. Other agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines are currently under negotiation. The latest discussions between the EU and Thailand are likely to be tense.
Both sides want to protect their own fishery industries, which is proving to be major stumbling block. And Bangkok says the EU is asking for a more comprehensive and higher-caliber deal than Thailand has entered into with any of its existing free trade pacts.
The first round of negotiations took place last September in Brussels. The EU is Thailand’s fourth largest trading partner, after China, the US and Japan, and bilateral trade was worth around €32 billion ($34.8 billion) in the first 10 months of 2023.
Speaking after a meeting with the EU-ASEAN Business Council and the European Association for Business and Commerce in December, Thailand’s Commerce Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said he thinks “it’s feasible for the EU-Thailand trade talks to be concluded by 2025, assuming the Pheu Thai party stays in power throughout and has a relatively stable political outlook,” said Syetarn Hansakul, senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Pheu Thai is the largest party within the 11-member ruling coalition that was controversially formed last August following a general election in which the largest nationwide party was prevented from forming a government by military-appointed senators.
“They are keen to have the EU-Thailand free trade agreement signed, hoping that it will be a big win for the coalition government,” Hansakul added.
Brussels and Bangkok agreed to relaunch negotiations last March, almost a decade after an earlier talks collapsed because of the EU’s opposition to a military coup in Thailand in 2014.
Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, who is also finance minister, held talks with European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month. Other high-ranking trade officials from the European Parliament visited Bangkok in December to discuss the trade pact.
Prime Minister Srettha has put trade deals at the heart of his economic policy. Bangkok intends to conclude free trade talks this year with Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and the European Free Trade Association, a trade bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
Thailand’s economy has been in the doldrums for several years because of a particularly bad experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. It grew by just 2.5% in 2023.
Among Southeast Asian nations, Thailand currently faces one of the highest import duty rates from the EU, at 11.5%, compared to 5.6% for Malaysia and 8.1% for Indonesia, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. A free trade agreement with the EU would boost Thailand’s annual economic growth by 1.2%, while yearly exports and imports would grow by 2.8%, according to the Institute of Future Studies for Development, a Thai non-profit academic research organization.
Chotima Iemsawasdikul, director of Thailand’s Trade Negotiations Department, admits there are “challenges.”
She said a trade agreement with Brussels “would be comprehensive and [of a] high standard in all areas,” particularly in intellectual property, state-owned enterprises and market access for government procurement. These are areas that “have never been committed” to by Bangkok before in its existing free trade agreements, she told DW.
According to sources familiar with the negotiations, Brussels wants Bangkok to make the bidding process for government contracts more transparent. The EU is also looking for better market access for the service sector and improved environmental standards.
Meanwhile, Thai negotiators want the EU to ease restrictions on agricultural and fishery imports, the latter of which is likely the biggest source of contention.
Last June, months after the resumption of the trade deal talks, the European Parliament passed a resolution arguing that “a free trade agreement with Thailand could pose a serious threat to the EU canned fish and seafood industry,” which is a leading source of wealth and employment in coastal regions.
Equally, Bangkok is wary of impairing its own fisheries industry.
A month after taking office, the Srettha administration said that it would review the Fisheries Act, which had cracked down on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. However, fishing industry bodies say this has created too many regulations and is now impairing the industry, which was worth around €3.3 billion to the Thai economy in 2022.
But almost 90 non-governmental organizations co-signed a letter in November that argued the Thai government’s potential deregulation of the sector risks seeing the return of day-rate salaries, permitting child labor and the weakening of the punitive measures designed to deter illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.
In 2019, the European Commission delisted Thailand from the group of “warned countries” in recognition of its progress in tackling illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, having previously been given a so-called yellow card in 2015. “Despite the challenges, the Thai government considers establishing the Thailand-EU free trade agreement a top priority,” Chotima said.
“Thailand is eager to engage in productive discussions with the EU in the upcoming meetings, aiming to explore innovative and mutually beneficial solutions. Thailand’s preliminary goal is to conclude the deal by 2025,” she added."

As a gesture of gratitude, Modi, after the rituals of idol consecration were over, showered rose petals on each worker – ranging from artisans to project managers.
The group included 150 workers and 150 staff members of Larsen & Toubro and 50 staff members of Tata Consulting Engineers. While L&T is the construction company, Tata Engineers provided project management consultancy for the construction.
Two other key persons the PM met are Arun Yogiraj, the sculptor from Bengaluru who made the Ram idol, and Sharad Babu of Anuradha Timbers, Hyderabad, who carved the main doors of the temple.
Modi met the men around 3.20 pm, shortly after visiting the lord Shiva temple at Kuber Teela. Carrying a basket full of rose petals in one hand, he moved through the rows where the workers were sitting on chairs, showering petals on each one.
L&T Deputy General Manager Srinivas A, who was in the group, recalled the PM as saying, “Aap sab se milne aaya hoon. Aap sabne punya ka kaam kiya hai. Aur kuchh bhi banna hai, jaise tez gati se abhi banaya hai, aage bhi banayein (I have come to meet all of you. You have done a pious job. More has to be built. The way you have completed this work at the earliest, continue the work in the future).”
Srinivas said the PM stayed with them for five-ten minutes and thanked them for completing the work in record time to ensure the consecration happened as per schedule.
A senior official said the background and personal details of each labourer, contractor and artisan who met the PM were verified for security reasons. The workers included project directors, section in-charges and construction managers.
Srinivas said more than 5,000 people are engaged in the construction, including skilled and unskilled workers and artisans. There’s also a workshop nearby where work for carving and inscription is being done."

CJB5EYZ4TH_7U4PKHL32TTXWVA,Naresh Goyal seeks court’s permission to undergo medical procedure in pvt hospital,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 00:59 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/naresh-goyal-court-permission-undergo-medical-procedure-pvt-hospital-9124389/,"Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal on Tuesday sought permission to undergo an endoscopy test as prescribed by a doctor. An application was moved on behalf of Goyal through his lawyers to undergo the procedure on Friday, which may require him to be admitted at the private hospital for the day. The plea seeks permission for this and states that he will return to the jail on the same day once the test is done. The special court has directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file its reply on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, the court had permitted Goyal to visit five specialist doctors for the various ailments the 75-year-old has. Subsequently, the doctors prescribed further tests. The court said that no prejudice will be caused to the ED if Goyal is permitted to visit his private doctors again and get the tests done as prescribed by them. The court noted that one of the doctors had also expressed an apprehension that if proper treatment is not given to him, there is likelihood that he may suffer a stroke or paralysis.
Goyal was arrested on September 1, 2023 by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which claimed that he had laundered money, siphoning off loans given to Jet Airways by Canara Bank to the tune of Rs 538.62 crore. The court on Tuesday also heard his bail application. Goyal’s lawyers submitted that while the ED had claimed that he was running the company, this was misconceived as there was a professional management team and board of directors which took decisions and he was not the ‘one man army’ the agency was alleging. The court will continue to hear his bail application on Thursday. Goyal is currently lodged in Arthur Road jail."
CJJ8US2JEW_CP8M37UD03LGFS2,"Donald Trump cruises in New Hampshire primary election, Haley vows to fight on",_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 11:46 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/trump-defeats-haley-new-hampshire-white-house-nomination-9124837/,"Donald Trump cruised to victory in New Hampshire’s Republican presidential contest on Tuesday, Edison Research projected, marching closer to a November rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden even as his only remaining rival, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, vowed to soldier on despite her loss.
“This race is far from over,” she told her supporters at a post-election party in Concord, challenging Trump to debate her. “I’m a fighter. And I’m scrappy. And now we’re the last one standing next to Donald Trump.”
At his own party in Nashua, Trump opened his speech by mocking Haley, calling her an “imposter” and saying, “She’s doing, like, a speech like she won. She didn’t win. She lost. … She had a very bad night.” His remarks followed a series of angry posts on his Truth Social app, calling her “DELUSIONAL.”
Haley had hoped the Northeastern state’s sizable cadre of independent voters would carry her to an upset win that might loosen Trump’s iron grip on the Republican Party.
Instead, Trump will become the first Republican to sweep competitive votes in both Iowa – where he won by a record-setting margin eight days ago – and New Hampshire since 1976, when the two states cemented their status as the first nominating contests.
With 41% of the expected vote tallied, according to Edison, Trump held a comfortable 54.7% to 43.7% lead.
While the final margin was still unclear, the result will likely bolster some Republicans’ calls for Haley to drop out of the race and allow the party to coalesce behind Trump. Her campaign vowed in a memo earlier on Tuesday to push forward until “Super Tuesday” in early March, when Republicans in 15 states and one territory vote on the same day.
The next competitive contest is scheduled for Feb. 24 in South Carolina, where Haley was born and served two terms as governor. Despite her ties, however, Trump has racked up endorsements from most of the state’s Republican figures, and opinion polls show him with a wide lead.
In Iowa, Haley finished just behind the second-place Florida Governor Ron DeSantis while focusing much of her early campaign on New Hampshire, where the more moderate electorate was expected to offer perhaps her best chance of winning a state over Trump.
DeSantis, once seen as Trump’s most formidable challenger, dropped out on Sunday and endorsed Trump. Though DeSantis had only marginal support in New Hampshire, his voters were far more likely to switch allegiance to Trump, rather than Haley, according to polls.
Meanwhile, Edison projected Biden would win the New Hampshire Democratic primary based on write-in votes, after he declined to appear on the ballot due to a dispute with the state about the election’s timing.
Despite Trump’s win on Tuesday, exit polls hinted at his potential vulnerabilities in a general election campaign. He faces four sets of criminal charges for a range of offenses, including his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat and his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021.
About 44% of voters who participated in the Republican primary said he would not be fit to serve if convicted in court, according to exit polling by Edison.
More than half said they do not believe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, echoing Trump’s false claims that the result was tainted by fraud. There were also warning signs for Biden, however. Nearly three-quarters of Republican primary voters said the economy was either poor or not good, an area where Biden has struggled to highlight his administration’s accomplishments.
Republicans made up a smaller share of voters in the primary relative to the state’s 2016 Republican contest in the state, the exit polls showed. Some 49% of voters considered themselves Republican, compared to 55% in the 2016 primary. Six percent said they considered themselves Democrats, compared to 3% in 2016. The share of independents was little changed at 45%.
Biden was not on the ballot in New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, having supported an effort by his party to move their first primary election to the more diverse state of South Carolina.
New Hampshire supporters were still able to vote for him by writing Biden’s name on the ballot, offering a barometer of his political strength. With 18% of the estimated vote counted, according to Edison, Biden had 66.8%, far ahead of U.S. Representative Dean Phillips at 20%.
The Democratic president, whose advisers are anticipating a rematch with Trump, took aim at Republicans over their efforts to curb abortion rights in a Virginia speech on Tuesday, but his remarks were interrupted repeatedly by hecklers protesting his policies toward Israel.
The US Supreme Court, with a conservative majority made possible by three justices who joined the court under Trump, eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in 2022, galvanizing Democratic voters in that year’s congressional elections.
Biden also has cast Trump as a would-be dictator and a threat to democracy.
“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,” Biden’s 2024 campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, said in a statement, referring to Trump’s slogan, Make America Great Again.
Trump, who is balancing campaign stops with appearances in various criminal and civil courts, denies wrongdoing and has used the criminal charges against him to bolster his claim of political persecution.
New Hampshire, while also a mostly white state with a small population like Iowa, has a more moderate Republican electorate and a better record of predicting the eventual nominee.
Haley had stepped up her attacks on Trump as the election drew near, criticizing his affinity for strongmen such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Haley, 52, has also gone after Trump’s age – he is 77 – and mental acuity, attacks she has also regularly leveled at Biden, who is 81. She took up the theme again on Tuesday, saying the country needs to put someone in the White House that can put in eight years to get it back on track.
“Do you want two 80-year-olds running for president?” Haley asked."

She also appreciated the efforts of the poll panel in ensuring inclusive elections by enhancing the participation of women, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups.
The president was addressing the 14th National Voters’ Day event here.
The Election Commission was established on January 25, 1950, a day before India became a republic. For the last 14 years, the EC’s establishment day is observed as National Voters’ Day.
The president expressed confidence that the effective use of technology by the Election Commission will be further enhanced in all activities related to the poll process.
In the last 75 years, Murmu noted, the poll authority has organised 17 Lok Sabha elections and over 400 assembly elections.
Describing the process of holding Lok Sabha elections as the biggest logistics exercise in the world, she noted that people voted in over 12 lakh polling stations with the exercise being managed by 1.5 crore polling personnel.
The president said the youth are the future leaders of our democracy. Congratulating young voters who have got their Elector Photo Identity Card, Murmu said after getting the right to vote, their duties have also increased.
The young voters present at the event are representatives of crores of youth of the country who will play a decisive role in building India of 2047, she said.
The president also referred to the efforts undertaken by the Election Commission in ensuring that no voter is left behind.
To mark the occasion, the first copy of the EC’s publication “ECI initiatives for General Elections 2024” was presented to President Murmu by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.
The book provides a comprehensive overview of the initiatives undertaken by each division of the EC to ensure free, fair, inclusive, accessible and participatory conduct of elections.
A short voter awareness film ‘My Vote My Duty’ produced by the ECI in association with filmmaker Raj Kumar Hirani was also screened.
The short film features several celebrities with their messages evoking the spirit of democracy and power of one vote.
In his address, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal credited B R Ambedkar for ensuring that women are allowed to vote in elections. He said Ambedkar flagged the issue of women’s right to vote as back as 1928.
Meghwal said during Constituent Assembly debates, Ambedkar pitched for the principle of ‘one vote, one person, one value’."

According to postmortem report, she was raped and murdered.
The victim – a Class 3 student – had gone missing since January 19. She was found murdered in a semi-nude condition on Monday, according to police. The postmortem examination on Tuesday confirmed that she was raped before being murdered.
A source said that the body was discovered hidden under a pile of garbage, approximately 600 metres from the victim’s house. “A neighbour, who is a suspect in the case, was caught on a CCTV camera in the area, carrying a handbag. His rented room was found locked since January 19,” the source said.
“The room of the suspect, who is absconding, was found locked on the first day. Cops were with us. But nobody opened the room. Had the room been searched, the victim could have been saved,” a relative of the victim told the media persons.
Demanding justice, the victim’s father, an employee with a private company at Derabassi, said that the perpetrator of the crime must be hanged. “Five days have gone, police have failed to catch the suspect. They have all the details about the suspect,” he added.
Kin and local residents threatened to sit on a huge protest and block the Dakshim Marg Road from Hallomajra light point to Airport light point if the suspect is not arrested soon.
The victim had reportedly gone missing on January 19 when she went to a shop near her house to buy some material. Her mother had sent her to the shop.
Meanwhile, police said that the suspect, who is in his 20s and is the neighbour of the victim’s family, has been identified. The accused is a native of Bihar. They have recovered the slippers of the victim from the room, which was locked since January 19, along with a blood-stained bedsheet.
“The suspect has been identified. He is a painter. He is in his 20s. Preliminary investigation suggests that he has escaped to Bihar. Our teams are after him. He will be arrested shortly,” a police officer said.
A special panel of doctors conducted the postmortem of the victim at GMCH-32. Sources said the panel mentioned – in the postmortem report – about injury marks on her neck and private parts. Sources said the victim’s throat was slit. Parents of the victim identified her from the clothes. The body was cremated.
Police said in the FIR, apart from murder charge, many charges under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were mentioned.
Sources said prima facie, the neighbour abducted the girl and committed the crime inside his one-room rented accommodation.
“The suspect has escaped to Bihar. Two teams have been despatched to nab him. We have lodged an FIR against the house owner who rented the accommodation to the suspect but did not submit his verification report to the police station concerned,” a police officer said.
“The girl had gone to a nearby shop but she did not return. The one-room house, where the missing neighbour resides, was found locked. Police forcefully opened the door and observed some red-coloured stains on the bedsheet. A team of forensic experts was called to collect samples,” the source added.
Police have registered a case of murder at Sector 31 police station."

While the ruling denied Palestinian hopes of a binding order to halt the war in Gaza, it also represented a legal setback for Israel, which had hoped to throw out a case brought under the genocide convention established in the ashes of the Holocaust.
The court found that Palestinians were protected under the convention, and that there was a case to be heard about whether their rights were being denied in a war that the court said was causing grievous humanitarian harm. It also called for Palestinian armed groups to release hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attacks that precipitated the conflict.
Palestinian officials largely hailed the decision. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said it was a welcome reminder “no state is above the law”. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official told Reuters the decision would contribute to “isolating the occupation and exposing its crimes in Gaza.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the court had “justly rejected the outrageous demand” to deprive Israel of what he called the “basic right to defend itself”, by ordering it to halt fighting.
“But the mere claim that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians is not only false, it’s outrageous, and the willingness of the court to even discuss this is a disgrace that will not be erased for generations.”
Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir mocked the ruling in a two-word social media post with a Yiddish-style putdown: “Hague shmague”.
South Africa brought the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) earlier this month, asking it to grant emergency measures to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians and displaced the majority of the population in a more than three-month campaign of intensive bombardment.
It accused Israel of state-led genocide in its offensive, begun after Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 240. Israel sought to have the case thrown out.
The judges ordered Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent its troops from committing genocide, punish acts of incitement, take steps to improve the humanitarian situation and report back on its progress in a month.
It did not decide the merits of the genocide allegations, which could take years. Although the ruling cannot be appealed, the court has no mechanism to enforce its decision.
Israel had demanded the case be thrown out, calling South Africa’s allegations false and “grossly distorted”. It says it has acted in Gaza in self defence against a foe that attacked first, and blames Hamas for harm to civilians for operating among them, which the fighters deny.
The South African government, allowed to make the case under the legal principal that genocide is such a grave crime that all countries are duty-bound to prevent it, hailed the court order as a “decisive victory” for international rule of law.
“South Africa sincerely hopes that Israel will not act to frustrate the application of this Order, as it has publicly threatened to do, but that it will instead act to comply with it fully, as it is bound to do,” its foreign ministry said in a statement.
The country’s Deputy President Paul Mashatile and Justice Minister Ronald Lamola were seen cheering and dancing at a gathering of the governing African National Congress party following the court’s verdict, which was televised live.
ASSAULT ON KHAN YOUNIS
On the ground in Gaza, the war has entered a particularly destructive phase, with the heaviest fighting in weeks now taking place in crowded areas jammed with hundreds of thousands of people who fled elsewhere.
On Friday, Israel kept up its bombardment of the main Southern city of Khan Younis, where it said it was involved in “intensive battles”, with forces striking dozens of Hamas fighters and infrastructure from the air and ground. Residents said gunbattles raged overnight, with Israeli forces blowing up buildings and houses in the western part of the city in what has become one of its biggest offensives so far, waged among hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians.
Israel said it had discovered some 200 tunnel shafts and destroyed more than 130 militant infrastructure sites in its latest operations, as well as killing “numerous militants”.
Palestinians say Israel has blockaded hospitals making it impossible for rescuers to reach the dead and wounded. Israel denies blockading hospitals and says Hamas fighters are to blame for fighting near them for operating there. “We believe many victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, the occupation prevents ambulance and civil emergency teams from reaching them,” Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said."
COII75L70K_451P6TUK26HSRIK,Ram temple landmark in re-discovery of heritage: President,Divya A,"January 26, 2024 04:04 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ram-temple-landmark-in-re-discovery-of-heritage-president-9128244/,"CALLING THE consecration ceremony at the new Ram temple in Ayodhya a “landmark in India’s continued re-discovery of its civilisational heritage”, President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday said the temple was an expression of people’s faith, and a testament to their trust in the judicial process.
Addressing the nation on the eve of the 75th Republic Day, Murmu said: “Earlier this week, we witnessed the historic consecration ceremony of the idol of Prabhu Shri Ram in the glorious new temple constructed at his birthplace in Ayodhya… When this event will be seen in the wider perspective, the future historians will consider it a landmark in India’s continued re-discovery of its civilisational heritage.”
“The construction of the temple commenced after the due judicial process and the decision of the highest court of the land… Now it stands as a grand edifice, giving a befitting expression not only of people’s faith but also as a testament to people’s enormous trust in the judicial process,” she said.
On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet had adopted a resolution congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the consecration ceremony, stating that while “the body of the country attained independence in 1947, the Pran Pratishtha of its soul was done on January 22, 2024,” and “everyone experienced spiritual bliss”. The resolution said Modi had fulfilled a dream that the “Indian civilisation had dreamt for five centuries”.
On the eve of the consecration ceremony, the President had also penned a note to the Prime Minister, calling the event an uninhibited expression of the eternal soul of India. “We are fortunate to witness the commencement of a new cycle in the resurgence of our nation,” she had said.
In her televised address on Thursday evening, Murmu said her heart was filled with pride at seeing “how far we have travelled despite adversities”. “The 75th year of the Republic is truly a historic milestone in the journey of the nation in many ways. This is an especially festive occasion, just as we celebrated the unique greatness and diverse culture of our nation during the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, when we completed 75 years of Independence,” she said.
“Tomorrow is the day when we celebrate the commencement of the Constitution. Its Preamble begins with the words ‘We, the People of India’, highlighting the theme of the document, namely, democracy. In India, democratic system is much older than the concept of western democracy. That is the reason why India is called the ‘mother of democracy’,” she said.
Murmu said the country is in “the early years of Amrit Kaal, the period leading to the centenary of Independence”, the time of “an epochal transformation”. Reminding the citizens of their fundamental duties, she said: “These duties are essential obligations of every citizen towards making Bharat a developed nation when it completes 100 years of independence. Here, I think of Mahatma Gandhi who had rightly said, ‘No people have risen who thought only of rights. Only those did so who thought of duties’.”
The President also made a special mention of the birth anniversary of former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur, who has been awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously, calling him the “tireless champion of social justice”. “Karpoori ji was one of the greatest advocates of backward classes who dedicated his life for their welfare. His life was a message. I pay my tribute to Karpoori ji for enriching public life through his contributions,” she said.
“Democracy implies diversity of culture, beliefs and practices. Celebrating diversity implies equality, which is upheld by justice. Freedom is what makes it all possible. The totality of these values and principles is what makes us Indian. Guided by the sagacity of B R Ambedkar, the spirit of the Constitution, imbued with these foundational values and principles, has led us invariably on the path of social justice to put an end to all kinds of discrimination,” she said.
The President also made a mention of several landmark events over the last one year, including the G20 Summit, Chandrayaan landing on the Moon and passage of the women’s Bill.
“The G20 Summit also boosted India’s emergence as the voice of the Global South, adding a necessary element to the international discourse,” she said.
On the women’s reservation Bill, she said: “When more women will be involved in matters of collective importance, our administrative priorities will be more in tune with the needs of the masses.”
And on India’s space achievements, she mentioned the proposed Gaganyaan mission, the country’s first manned space flight. “We have always been proud of our scientists and technology experts, but now they are aiming far higher than before and delivering too,” she said.
“The period of Amrit Kaal is also going to be the period of unprecedented technological changes. Technological advances like Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have moved from headlines into our daily lives at a breathtaking speed. There are numerous areas of concern in the foreseeable future, but there are also exciting opportunities ahead, especially for the youth. They are exploring new frontiers. We need to do all we can to remove hurdles from their path and let them unleash their full potential. What they want is equality of opportunity. What they want is not the same old rhetoric of equality, but the realisation of our cherished ideal of equality,” she said.
“India is moving ahead with confidence, which comes from and is also reflected by the robust health of the economy. Our GDP growth rate has remained the highest among major economies in recent years, and we have all reasons to believe that this extraordinary performance will continue in the year 2024 and beyond,” she said.
The President also spoke about the Centre’s welfare schemes. “The government has decided to provide free foodgrain to over 81 crore people for five years. This may be the biggest welfare initiative of its kind in history,” she said.
“The government has not only expanded and enhanced the welfare schemes, but has also redefined the idea of welfare itself. It will be a proud day for us all when India becomes one of those few countries where homelessness is a rarity,” she said.
Towards the end of her speech, Murmu mentioned the “conflicts that have emerged around the world and how several parts of it have been suffering from violence”. In this regard, she recalled how India has shown that non-violence “is not just an ideal that may be difficult to achieve” but “a lived reality for many” — from Mahavir to Mahatma Gandhi."
CYU2RJAPGV_CEC1NX464WOICST,Statue vs statue: Sardar Patel vs Ambedkar leaves Ujjain on edge,Anand Mohan J,"Updated: January 26, 2024 09:08 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sardar-patel-ambedkar-statue-vandalised-ujjain-9128444/,"Two groups pelted stones at each other Thursday as the statue of former Union Home Minister Sardar Vallabhai Patel was broken with tractors and an unruly mob set it on fire in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain district, the police said.
The clashes erupted between the dominant Malviyas, belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) and the Patidars, belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) Thursday morning when Patidar community members installed Patel’s statue in Makdone tehsil in Ujjain district.
For over a decade, the two communities have been divided over installing Dr BR Ambedkar or Patel’s statue. However, the local nagar panchayat did not take any action over the installation of Patel’s statue.
According to police, the two groups pelted stones at each other in which two policemen and two other people sustained injuries. The statue was broken with a tractor and an unruly mob set it on fire, the police said, adding that saffron flags were also set ablaze.
Videos of the incident surfaced on social media. Additional SP (Ujjain Rural) Nitesh Bhargava told The Indian Express, “We have lodged three FIRs. The first FIR was lodged by the police under sections of rioting. The FIR lodged on behalf of the SC community has sections pertaining to the SC/ST Atrocities Act. The FIR lodged on behalf of the Patidar community has sections related to promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and Injuring or defiling place of worship, with intent to insult the religion of any class. We are questioning over a dozen people. No one has been arrested. There is peace in the area so far.”
The local police station in-charge was suspended for being unable to control the situation. On Thursday evening, the town wore a desolate look with heavy police deployment in riot gear. Police personnel also held flag marches and area domination exercises to maintain peace. At the local police station, members of both communities waited to file their complaints.
Ashok Gami, a senior Patidar leader, said his community had permission to install Patel’s statue at the main square of the tehsil. “We had informed the police about this (installing the statue). It was installed around 4 am to avoid inconveniencing the public. We were not doing anything illegal.”
Pankaj Bohra, another Patidar community leader, said, “Around 30 of us were there and after the statue was installed, members of the SC community protested against us. They pelted stones at us. We have been trying to install the statue since 2017 but due to communal tension, it could not be done.”
Sevaram Malviya, a local SC leader who is also the president of the local SC/ST Adhikari Karamchari Sangh, said, “This has been a decade-long fight to install the statue. We have no issue with Vallabhbhai Patel, we accept him as our national hero. But they don’t have the permission. The local BJP leaders in their election manifesto for the local panchayat elections promised Patel’s statue. I sent a complaint a day before that they would do this. The police failed to maintain law and order. Most of those who protested were local Bhim army members and they were all rounded up by the police.”
Narendra Malviya, whose brother was detained by the police, said, “Since the local panchayat body was established, there has been tensions over his issue. But apart from the statue, the daily discrimination we faced at the hands of the Patidar community has kept the tensions simmering.”
BJP leader Gokul Malviya said his party had promised a Patel statue but the permissions had not yet been granted. “We had tried to pass a resolution at the nagar panchayat twice and failed. People have also suggested Mahatma Gandhi, Maharana Pratap and Parashuram statues as an alternative but the people are divided between Patel and Ambedkar. What happened was wrong,” Malviya said.
Tarana Congress MLA Mahesh Parmar spent several hours in the day talking to members of both communities. “Patel united the country and Ambedkar wrote the Constitution. They both are my national heroes. The two communities were divided between Ambedkar and Patel, which is wrong. If the BJP promised a Patel statue why was the permission not granted? Why was the statue installed at night? They are both my family and we can’t be divided.”"
D050VTA3JH_60PI87C05WRPML0,"As Lord Rama returns to Ayodhya we will see a stronger, more confident India",G Kishan Reddy,"Updated: January 26, 2024 09:39 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-lord-rama-returns-to-ayodhya-we-will-see-a-stronger-more-confident-india-9128078/,"On January 22, 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the pran pratishtha ceremony for the Ram mandir under the guidance of distinguished pandits and vedic Brahmins at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya. As the Prime Minister performed the first aarti of Lord Ram, many devotees across the world prayed either at local temples or from their homes. This spontaneous outpouring was not just because this was a matter of pride for all Sanatanis, but also because Hindus across the world secured the right to build a temple for Lord Ram constitutionally, after waiting for an agonising 500 years.
The wait has not been without its hardships and tribulations. For generations, individual and community memories have surfaced and come together as collective anguish. Take the case of Ayodhya’s Suryavanshi Kshatriyas who are considered to be the descendants of Lord Ram. It was the Suryavanshi Kshatriyas led by Raja Gajraj Singh who offered stiff resistance to Babur’s army led by General Mir Baqi, when Ayodhya was seized and the mosque built. The Suryavanshis of Ayodhya vowed to not cover their heads with the ceremonial turban till the temple at Ayodhya was restored. Some even shunned footwear. After many generations, the Suryavanshis of Ayodhya are once again donning turbans today. Other faiths have contributed to the reclaiming of the temple and are now joining in the celebrations as well. The Sikh founding Guru, Sri Guru Nanak Dev is said to have visited the Ram temple in 1510 and the Supreme Court considered this as key evidence in its 2019 judgement. In the run-up to the pran pratishtha, the “Akhand Path” that involves the continuous recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib for 48 hours was also observed.
Across India, from Kutch in the west to Kohima in the east, from Kashmir in the north to Kanyakumari in the South, communities are celebrating in their own way, just as they recorded the 500 year wait in their own unique way. Several communities worldwide too are cherishing this moment. From Korea and Cambodia in the Eastern Hemisphere to the island nations of Antigua and Barbuda, people are celebrating this momentous occasion.
These celebrations are anchored around the rejuvenation of our civilisational heritage. Hence, the decision of some to not participate in this sacred ceremony is regrettable. This refusal to share the joy of the people on the ground primarily arises from a mindset of minority appeasement. In order to placate and polarise some minority communities and treat them as vote banks, a select few are willing to go to any levels. This included the boycott of a momentous occasion such as the pran pratishtha ceremony. This tendency to look at everything related to Sanatan Dharma through a deeply skewed political prism shows an utter lack of civilisational pride. Those who issued these boycotts refuse to acknowledge the role of Hinduism and the Hindu way of life in binding this great and diverse nation.
One such periodic offender is the Congress Party. Congress has a known history of being ashamed of India’s civilisational past and looks at Hindus and Hinduism with complete disdain. For example, in November 1947, Sardar Patel wanted to reconstruct the Somnath Temple. This was also favoured by Mahatma Gandhi. At that juncture, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru vehemently opposed the move. In May 1951, he wrote several letters to President Rajendra Prasad to dissuade him from participating in the pran pratishtha of Somnath Temple. When President Rajendra Prasad wanted to collect water and twigs from other countries to consecrate the temple, he termed it as rash. In the notes to the Foreign Secretary and others in the embassies abroad, Pandit Nehru termed it as fanciful and instructed embassies to not entertain such requests.
Similarly, in September 2007, in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the Congress government wanted to dismantle the Ram Setu to build the Sethusamudram shipping canal project. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court it stated that “mythological texts, which formed an important part of ancient Indian literature cannot be said to be historical records to incontrovertibly prove the existence of the characters or the occurrence of the event”.
In a way the run-up to the pran pratishtha at Ayodhya is a replay of the events that took place in the run-up to the revival of Somnath just after India attained her independence. Even then the Congress party was totally uncomfortable with our civilisational heritage and mixed this with a bizarre political calculation of shunning the moment thinking it will endear itself to the minority population. This twisted thinking is an insult to the minorities of this nation. A live example of this playing out poorly is the Shah Bano incident in the mid-1980s. The Supreme Court of India decided that Shah Bano, a divorced muslim woman, be paid maintenance by her husband. The government led by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi diluted the judgement by enacting a law. Till today, this single incident has led to the continued marginalisation of the rights of Muslim women.
Moments such as the restoration of the temple for Lord Ram in Ayodhya are epochal events that alter the very journey of nations and their people. This will indeed go down in our collective history as a pivotal moment in civilisational awakening. As Lord Ram returns to Ayodhya, we will see a stronger, more confident India that works for the welfare and upliftment of everyone of her citizens. This is the true promise of Ram Rajya.

The SIT was formed in July 2023, two years after the arrest of international hacker Srikrishna Ramesh or Sriki during the BJP regime in 2020.
The latest arrests are in connection with a new case filed by the SIT this month on charges of criminal breach of trust, mischief and destroying of evidence.
SIT chief Manish Kharbikar said, “Prashanth Babu, a former police inspector of the Bengaluru police Central Crime Branch (CCB), (who is currently posted at the Bengaluru commissionerate), and a private cyber expert, Santhosh Kumar K S, who runs a private firm, have been arrested.”
The police said that at the early stage of the investigation in 2020-21, a sum of around Rs 3 lakh was found to have been transferred by an associate of Sriki to a cyber expert called in to help with the investigations. The funds were allegedly transferred by a friend of Sriki (who was also his accountant) who dealt with crypto currency conversions for the hacker.
Vanishing of Bitcoin seized by police
Among the persons held by the SIT on Wednesday, Babu is considered to be a technical expert while the private cyber expert was one of the witnesses for the seizure of 31 Bitcoins from Sriki in January 2021.
The police seizure of the 31 Bitcoins – when a Bitcoin was valued at over $50,000 – on January 8, 2021, turned out to be a fraud with the transfer to a police wallet being declared as bogus by experts later on January 31, 2021.
Incidentally, Kumar was one of the persons who had provided a report to the Bengaluru police about the fraudulent seizure.
In November 2021, the Bengaluru police officially claimed that Sriki deceived them into believing they had seized 31 bitcoins from his personal electronic wallet in January 2021.
“On inquiry, cyber experts opined that the said account claimed by the accused as his personal account, was in fact a live wallet of an exchange and the accused did not have a private key for this. Hence, the said account was left untouched and as a result, no Bitcoins were transferred to the police wallet,” a police statement said in November 2021.
Cases registered by SIT since taking over probe
The CID SIT has filed two new FIRs since starting investigations into the Bitcoin scam in July 2023.
In August 2023, the SIT filed an FIR against unnamed CCB police officers for alleged tampering of devices that were seized as evidences from Sriki and his associates in November 2020. The FIR, filed at the Cottonpet police station, quoted a digital forensics report dated February 20, 2023, that two pen drives seized from the accused on November 9, 2020, at the time of the first batch of arrests, had been manipulated in police custody.
The report added that an Apple Macbook and a hard disk seized on November 17, 2020, and a second Macbook seized on November 19, 2020, was tampered with after the seizure.
The CID has found that the electronic and computer devices were tampered with at the premises of the CCB office in Bengaluru between November 9 and December 12, 2020.
In October 2023, the SIT conducted raids and searches in nine different locations, including places belonging to four police officers — Sridhar Poojar, Prashanth Babu, Chandradhar S R and Lakshmikanthaiah — and two private cyber experts K S Santhosh Kumar and Gagan Jain.
All the police officers and cyber experts were called in by the CCB in 2020 to study and analyse devices seized from Sriki and his associates for evidence of hacking activities and stolen crypto currency. All the officers and experts have been questioned several times by the CID SIT in the recent months.
Later, in September 2023, Poojar obtained a High Court order against precipitative action without evidence against him by the police in the tampering of evidence case.
Sriki and his accountant’s arrest
Sriki and his accountant Robin Khandelwal were initially arrested by the CCB in November 2020 on charges of ordering drugs on the internet using Bitcoins. Sriki is accused of transferring stolen funds to Khandelwal, who ran a Bitcoin trading service.
The case involving the purchase of drugs through the darknet, which was unearthed by the crime branch in November 2020, eventually led to the cracking of several cybercrimes in Karnataka involving Sriki. One of the cases that was solved was a Rs 11.5 crore heist from the Karnataka e-governance cell in July-August 2019.
The political ramification of the alleged Bitcoin scam
The handling of the cases involving the hacker by the police under the BJP regime in Karnataka since the arrests in November 2020 resulted in allegations of corruption by the Congress when it was in the Opposition.
The Congress has suggested that the police and politicians collected payment of bribes through cryptocurrencies from the hacker and his associates to water down the cases. The hacker himself has said in his police statements that are on record in charge sheets filed by the CCB that he was forced to handover all cryptocurrencies in his possession to the police.
“I understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So, post consultations I voluntarily accepted (sic) to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,’” reads a statement attributed to the hacker which is a part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against Sriki in 2021.
In October 2021, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had said on social media, “There is information about the involvement of influential politicians of Karnataka in the drugs and Bitcoin scam. It is concerning that the investigating officers are trying to close the case to help those politicians.”
The CID SIT was formed by the Congress government in July 2023 shortly after coming to power in the state for “investigating cases connected to laundering of Bitcoins and other cases”."

He also stated that the government is in the process of inviting tender for the white topping of major roads in the city.
“In order to find a permanent solution to the congestion of Bangalore city, it is proposed to construct tunnel roads at selected places. The process of preparation of Detailed Project Report with the help of international agency for construction of tunnel road of 2 km area has been initiated,” the Governor further said.
Notably, the tunnel road project proposed by Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar and the white topping of roads in Bengaluru’s already developed Central Business District (CBD) area has come under sharp criticism from mobility experts and institutions like the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Experts are of the view that building tunnel roads will only encourage more people to use private vehicles which will further lead to traffic congestion.
Meanwhile, the Karnataka government on January 9 issued a government order approving the BBMP’s request to white-top proposed roads in Bengaluru. The government approved white-topping work worth Rs 800 crore for 64 km of road network in Bengaluru.
The Governor also emphasised on the ‘Brand Bengaluru’ project of the Karnataka government under which 70,000 suggestions were collected on key urban policy matters. He said that a committee is examining the suggestions and will soon make recommendations to the government.
The governor also highlighted the five guarantee schemes of the ruling Congress government and the impact on the beneficiaries. He stated that over 3.5 crore women in Karnataka including gender minorities are benefiting from Shakti Yojane (free travel for women), around Rs 2,900 crore has been transferred to eligible candidates under Annabhagya Yojane wherein the state is distributing an additional 5 kg food grain to households, and 1.50 crore consumers are benefiting from Gruha Jyoti (free electricity up to 200 units) schemes.
The Governor added that under Gruha Lakshmi (Rs 2,000 cash incentive for woman head), 1.17 crore women have benefited and a total grant of Rs 8,181 crore has been released to beneficiaries under the Yuva Nidhi scheme wherein the government is providing unemployment allowance of Rs 3,000 and Rs 1,500 for graduates and diploma holders, respectively."

Acting upon specific intelligence, the DRI Pune officials mounted surveillance at the arrival area of the Pune airport. The woman was identified and found to be carrying a white-coloured belt containing around 5,482 grams of gold paste and one pouch with around 1,432 grams of gold paste in her clothes.
Officials said the total gold weighing 5.67 kg was extracted out of the gold paste weighing 6.9 kg and seized under the Customs Act, 1962.
Several recent seizures of gold in smuggling cases have revealed that the traffickers are using malleable gold paste, which is generally finely powdered gold mixed with some liquids."
D57EY1PSIA_VG6LNGUFTTV9M3R,"In Viksit Bharat, rural real wages are in decline",Ashok Gulati,"Updated: January 22, 2024 22:32 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-viksit-bharat-rural-real-wages-are-in-decline-9120808/,"As this article appears, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many in his government, along with the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, would be busy in pran pratishta at the Ram temple in Ayodhya. One hopes that with the consecration, the country will also see the beginnings of Ram Rajya in the true sense, where communal harmony and safety of all people, especially women, is secured, and poverty is abolished.
While PM Modi has given a clarion call for a Viksit Bharat by 2047, the NITI Aayog has recently come up with a report estimating that 248.2 million Indians have been lifted out of poverty in the nine years of the Modi government. This is based on the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI). While UNDP’s methodology of MPI has 10 indicators under three dimensions – health (nutrition and child mortality), education (years of schooling and school attendance) and standard of living (cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, housing, electricity and assets), NMPI adds maternal health and bank accounts to this list making it 12 indicators.
NITI Aayog argues that NMPI is a better measure to estimate poverty than the traditional estimates based on income/consumption. We welcome the improvement in the standards of life of people in India based on 12 indicators. It has been driven largely by government investments. But household incomes are as important. What is the point of enrollment in schools if the quality of education remains poor, as pointed out in Pratham’s ASER report. The education system may create “educated unemployable youth”. Similarly, what is the point in having accounts if the poor have low incomes and hardly any savings.
This raises questions about the sustainability of a development model that provides better access to public utilities (education, health, and even gas) but does not work towards improving its quality or income levels.
We are not sure whether the publication of the index is a calculated move to replace income poverty by NMPI, but we do feel there is an equal need to track income poverty, real wages, and unemployment in the country to make sure that the development pathway to 2047 helps people improve their incomes significantly. India still has the largest number (160 million) of people under extreme poverty in the world as per the World Bank’s estimate based on $2.15/capita/day income (at 2017 purchasing power poverty). True Ram Rajya will be established only when these poor people come out of income poverty and are also not poor as defined by NMPI.
What occupations are these extremely poor engaged in? The majority of them are in rural areas, working both in agriculture as well as in the non-farm sector as labourers. So, it is important to see what is happening to employment in agriculture and the real wage rates in rural areas over the last two government regimes.
Our research shows that during UPA-1 (2004-05 to 2008-09), real agricultural wages for men (deflated by CPI-AL) grew at a meagre 0.2 per cent per annum, while real rural non-agricultural wages (deflated by CPI-RL) declined at -0.9 per cent per annum. But we observe spectacular growth during UPA-2 (2009-10 to 2013-14) with real agriculture and non-agriculture rural wages growing at 8.6 per cent and 6.9 per cent per annum respectively. In contrast, during the NDA-1 period (2014-15 to 2018-19), growth of real farm and non-farm wages in rural areas decelerated to 3.3 per cent and 3 per cent per annum respectively. However, most concerning has been the situation in the last five years of NDA-2 (2019-20 to 2023-24), when the annual growth rate of real rural wages has become negative for both agriculture (-0.6 per cent) and non-agricultural (-1.4 per cent). It may be the impact of Covid-19 and its aftermath, giving credence to the K-shaped recovery.
The share of the workforce engaged in agriculture had seen a secular decline — from 69.7 per cent in 1951 to 54.6 per cent in 2011 (Census), then to 42.5 per cent in 2018-19 (PLFS). But in 2019-20, it reversed to 45.6 per cent and then increased to 46.5 per cent in 2020-21 (reverse migration due to Covid), before falling to 45.5 per cent in 2021-22. This may be one reason why growth in farm and non-farm rural real wages has become negative during Modi-2 period.
As far as the unemployment rate is concerned, the ILO data suggests that it averaged around 8.4 per cent during 10 years of the UPA government (2004-05 to 2013-14) and roughly 7.9 per cent during the 10 years of the Modi government. So, the growth model under both governments has not seen a significant reduction in unemployment. During the UPA government, the BJP was at the forefront saying that it was “jobless growth”, and the same criticism is being flung at it by the Congress and other opposition parties.
Interestingly, government data from the PLFS, which started collecting information on unemployment from 2017-18, shows a much lower level and a clear declining trend. It has come down from 6 per cent in 2017-18 to 4.1 per cent in 2021-22. The difference between ILO estimates and PLFS estimates, says Santosh Mehrotra, Economic Adviser in the erstwhile Planning Commission and a prolific writer on this topic, is due to difference in the definition. PLFS tends to include some work as employment even when it is not paid for. That makes PLFS estimates non-comparable with other countries, which follow ILO criteria. Mehrotra further argues that CMIE estimates are on the lines of ILO, and it shows much higher levels of unemployment compared to PLFS.
For us, the litmus test of employment hinges on real wage rates, and we have seen from the government data itself that in rural areas, real wages in fact have had negative growth in the last five years of Modi-2 period. This needs urgent attention and further research to create more employment-intensive growth processes.

Officials have said at least 66 people from Gujarat were among the 303 on board the plane operated by Romania’s Legend Airlines that flew from Fujairah in the UAE and was headed to Nicaragua. The plane was supposed to eventually take the passengers to the US via the Mexico border “illegally”, they said. The flight was grounded at the Châlons Vatry airport, 150 km east of Paris, in December last year over suspected “human trafficking”.
Pushpak Raval, 29 and Falguni Raval, 28, who are the first people to be arrested in the case, were taken on police remand until January 24.
Ashvin Patel, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Gujarat CID, told The Indian Express, “The couple from Mehsana facilitated the travel of Meshva Patel who was among the 66 Gujaratis on the flight. The couple told the boy that they would send him illegally to America as they had contacts with the agents in Delhi”.
“They finalised the deal at Rs 55 lakh and took Rs 10 lakh in advance from the boy. After keeping him in Dubai for three months, they sent him on a Nicaragua flight. After he returned from the Châlons Vatry Airport and asked for his money back, the couple refused to give the money back,” said Patel.
“The couple stated in the interrogation that they have been doing visa consultancy for the past year. Further investigation is underway,” he added."

CA Bhushan Arora, a Powai resident, was abducted on Wednesday and later the accused made a ransom call to his family asking for Rs 5 crore to be paid to them.
DCP (Zone X) Datta Nalawade said, “We have arrested four persons in connection with the kidnapping case. The four had invested huge amounts in Arora’s company Divine Power which they lost. It was in order to recover the money that they had invested that they abducted him and extort his family members.”
As per police, Arora’s wife Medha had said that Bhushan had left for office on January 17. When he did not return home by January 18, she approached the local Powai police where a missing person’s complaint was registered. As the police started probing the matter, the wife received a call from an unidentified person who demanded Rs 5 crore if she wanted Arora to be alive. The woman accordingly informed the police which began an investigation in the matter.
His wife informed the police that Arora had invested a large amount of money belonging to his relatives and friends in the stock market. However, he suffered losses in the stock market and soon investors started demanding the money back. When he expressed his inability to return the money, they had started threatening them, his wife told the police. The police then registered an FIR and began the probe.
During the course of investigation, the police found the accused had taken Arora to Navi Mumbai and the team started searching farm houses in the Panvel taluka. Later on Sunday, based on information, a team laid a trap in Kamothe area of Navi Mumbai and found two of the accused in a four-wheeler who were detained. The police found Arora in the same vehicle who was then rescued and reunited with his family.
Investigations revealed that Arora had invested large sums belonging to the accused in his company Divine Power which was lost. It was in order to recover the lost money that the accused committed a serious crime. Based on the interrogation of the duo, the police arrested two others who were involved in the crime. The accused have been identified as Amol Mhatre (49), Niranjan Singh (32), Vidhichandra Yadav (31) and Mohmand Suleman alias Salman Shaikh (20)."
DG3HXTZ5YO_W0I3TK0OJ71EK9H,US Presidential elections: Who will be Donald Trump’s running mate?,Arjun Sengupta,"Updated: January 25, 2024 11:13 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/who-will-be-donald-trumps-running-mate-9125979/,"With a win in the New Hampshire Republican primary, Donald Trump is all but certain to secure the Republican presidential nomination.
Experts say that the real battle in the GOP fold is now about who will be Trump’s running mate. Unlike the Republican presidential race, which has narrowed down to only two candidates — Trump and India-origin Nikki Haley — there are over half a dozen Republicans in fray to be vice president.
We take a look.
The US Constitution provides for both a president and a vice-president. While the president is the head of the executive and the most powerful person in the country, the VP is next in line (if the president dies in office or is incapacitated), and acts as an advisor and representative to the president.
A running mate is simply a particular party’s vice presidential candidate, chosen by the presidential candidate during the campaign. Voters vote for the president and vice-president as a team.
“The presidential candidate generally wants to choose a running mate who will help them get elected,” Chris Edelson, Assistant Professor of Government at the American University in Washington DC, told The Indian Express in 2020. There are no hard and fast rules, but political considerations are generally kept in mind while making the choice.
A system of running mates can also be seen in countries such as Indonesia and Brazil.
Following are some names that have been doing the rounds in the media. Note that Donald Trump has not himself made the decision, or dropped any hints, although Politico reported this week that “Trump has told his inner circle he has made a selection”.
A former George Bush aide, who also worked in Mitt Romney’s unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign, Stefanik, 39, was once seen as a rising young moderate Republican. However, she has taken a sharp turn to the right in recent years. She made national headlines in 2023 for lambasting university presidents over their handling of anti-Israel protests on campuses. She has been highly critical of Nikki Haley for continuing her campaign, calling it an “effort to divide Republicans” and “assist Joe Biden”.
Noem, 52, is a long-time Trump loyalist who became South Dakota Governor in 2019 with an endorsement from Trump. Her devotion to Trump is such that in 2021, she gifted the former president a replica of Mount Rushmore with his likeness imposed alongside presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Prior to her governorship, she served multiple terms in the House of Representatives, and the South Dakota statehouse.
A Yale Law School graduate and venture capitalist, Vance, 39, rose to fame as author of Hillbilly Elegy in 2016, a memoir about his family’s experience of rural poverty in Appalachia. While once a prominent Trump critic, even publicly calling him “America’s Hitler”, Vance became one of the former president’s loudest supporters and secured his endorsement for his 2022 Senate bid. In an interview earlier this week, he called Trump “more electable” than Haley.
Lake, 54, had a decades-long career as a TV presenter before entering politics. A former Democrat who publicly supported Barack Obama, Lake later became a committed Trump supporter and one of the most vocal voices of Trump’s Maga movement. She unsuccessfully ran to be Arizona governor in 2022, though refused to accept the results of the election. She is now seeking a GOP nomination to challenge incumbent Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz).
Scott, 58, led a campaign to become Republican nominee for president, but dropped out soon after failing to generate much traction in the polls. One of the GOP’s black faces, Scott is the only black Republican in the US Senate. He endorsed Donald Trump on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. Experts say choosing Scott as running mate could help undermine Democrats’s accusations of racism against Trump and the GOP.
Sanders, 41, came into national prominence as White House press secretary in the Donald Trump administration, from 2017-19. She was also senior advisor to Trump’s 2016 campaign, and a hardcore loyalist. She was elected as Arkansas governor in 2022, and has made headlines off and on for her anti-abortion, anti-climate change views and policies. She is the daughter of Mike Huckabee, two-time Arkansas governor and former Republican presidential candidate.
India-origin Ramaswamy, 38, dropped out of the Republican primary field earlier this month. An entrepreneur-turned-politician, he claims that the United States is in the middle of a national identity crisis precipitated by “new secular religions like COVID-ism, climate-ism, and gender ideology”. While he has been both critical and laudatory of Trump in the past. He claims that Nikki Haley is being propped up by her “donor puppet masters” to keep Trump off the ballot.
Indian-origin Haley, 52, is the last person standing against Trump in the Republican field. The former South Carolina governor, and US Ambassador to the UN (during the Trump administration), has been extremely critical of Trump in recent weeks. According to Politico, people close to Trump have privately warned him that choosing Haley as running mate would effectively set himself up for an intra-party coup. However, others see someone who could make a Trump nomination more palatable to moderate Republicans and independents. Haley herself has said that she will not be a part of a Trump administration, in any capacity."

There were three major attacks on the security forces in 2023, and over the past few years, 20 soldiers have been killed in terrorist ambushes in this area. Most terrorists here are believed to be foreigners.
At least three brigades of additional troops are being deployed in the sector from various reserve and strike corps formations in order to increase the density of troops and, therefore, the likelihood of contact with terrorists, recalls an earlier operation by the Army in the same forests more than two decades ago.
Back in 2003, Indian forces launched Operation Sarpvinash to flush out terrorists who had infiltrated from across the border and set up camps in the thick forests south of the Pir Panjal range, especially in the Hilkaka area in Poonch.
Following several encounters in the area, the Army carried out, from April 2003 onward, what was until then its biggest counter-insurgency operation in Jammu and Kashmir.
The roughly three-month-long operation took place in high forested mountains, in an approximately 150 sq km area bound by three major ridges. Some 10,000 troops under the 15 Corps and 16 Corps were involved in the operation that lasted about two weeks.
Mi-17 helicopters were used to airlift soldiers to Hilkaka, a Bakerwal village that had been taken over by terrorists, and Lancer attack helicopters were used to bust concrete bunkers built by the infiltrators, The Indian Express reported earlier.
About 100 terrorists were killed in the operation. A large number of weapons of various kinds, dumps of explosives, and stores including some 7,000 kg of ration, medicines, and communication equipment were recovered. Some 40-50 terrorist hideouts were demolished in the operation.
The Kargil war of 1999 was still fresh in memory and, in the aftermath of the December 13, 2001 terrorist attack on Parliament, the Indian armed forces had carried out Operation Parakram, a massive mobilisation exercise on the border with Pakistan that lasted well into the summer of 2002.
Preparations for the assault began in early 2003 after inputs suggested that more than 300 foreign terrorists who had infiltrated across the Line of Control (LoC) had established secure camps in the areas of Surankote and Hilkaka. The terrorists, who belonged to several Pakistan-based outfits, had created a demilitarised zone in the region, and were dominating the area.
They had created multiple hideouts inside caves, built bunkers in the dhokes (shelters for humans and cattle) of the migrant Bakerwals, and established a communication network.
The areas south of Mendhar leading to the Pir Panjal range through Hilkaka constitute among the shortest routes of access for infiltrators from across the LoC into the Kashmir valley.
The terrorists chose this region to set up camps because dominating this area can potentially provide a conduit to personnel in the event of a military operation by the Pakistanis, and easier infiltration of terrorists.
The dense forests and steep mountain slopes offer both adequate cover and visual domination of the area. Terrorists were able to merge with the foliage whenever Indian troops carried out searches in the area, and to inflict casualties in case of contact. All of these locational advantages for terrorists remain intact to some degree even now.
The operation flushed out terrorists and brought peace to the area that lasted until 2017-18, even as terrorist incidents continued to take place in the valley. But since 2021, this region has seen several high intensity attacks on security forces."
DJ7Y0GIBO3_SYS22ZOBFXUEGWZ,OnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24+: Which flagship phone wins?,Vivek Umashankar,"Updated: January 28, 2024 15:23 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/oneplus-12-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-9127546/,"If you are looking for a new flagship Android smartphone under Rs 1,00,000 in 2024, the newly launched OnePlus 12 and the Galaxy S24+ should be on your radar. Despite lacking the “Pro” moniker, these two smartphones offer premium design, top-of-the-line specifications, and the latest software experience. However, there is a drastic price difference between the two phones. Here is how OnePlus’s latest flagship stacks up against the Samsung Galaxy S24+.
The OnePlus 12 (review) and the Samsung Galaxy S24+ are two drastically different-looking smartphones. While both mimic their predecessors, there are enough minor but important changes that help them stand out from the crowd.
Both the OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24+ feature a glass-metal sandwich design. The OnePlus 12 has a curved display and a curved back panel, whereas the Galaxy S24+ has a more subtle but practical flat display and a flat frame, reminiscent of the iPhone 15 (review).
In terms of ingress protection, the Galaxy S24+ is ahead of the OnePlus 12 with its IP68 rating. Both phones make use of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for protection. The OnePlus 12 boasts additional features like an alert slider and an IR blaster, providing added advantages. From their design ID, one can easily identify the brand from a distance.
As mentioned earlier, the OnePlus 12 not only has a curved display but also packs in a slightly bigger 6.82-inch screen, while the Galaxy S24+ has a 6.7-inch screen. Both phones support LTPO technology (variable refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz) and offer QHD+ resolution, making these some of the sharpest smartphone displays on the market.
Considering the different implementations, some might feel the OnePlus 12 is a more premium smartphone, while others might prefer the flat display of the Galaxy S24+. It’s also worth noting that it is easier to find and install a screen protector on a flat display compared to a curved display. Additionally, for gamers, the Galaxy S24+ with a flat display could be an added advantage.
The OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24+ feature a triple camera setup at the back. The OnePlus 12, with its Hasselblad branding and a periscope-type zoom lens, looks unique, while the three individual cameras on the Galaxy S24+ are all about practicality.
The OnePlus 12 boasts a 50 MP wide-angle lens, a 48 MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 64 MP telephoto lens. Similarly, the Galaxy S24+ features a 50 MP primary wide-angle lens, a 12 MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 10 MP telephoto lens. The OnePlus 12 comes equipped with a 32 MP selfie camera, while the Galaxy S24+ has a 12 MP shooter. Both phones can shoot up to 8K videos with the primary camera and 4K videos with the selfie cameras.
The camera performance of these smartphones will depend on software tuning, and it is expected that the Galaxy S24+ will have a slight edge over the OnePlus 12’s camera setup in real-world scenarios.
The OnePlus 12 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and the Galaxy S24+ is based on the Exynos 2400 SoC (in India). Both being based on the flagship processors should deliver a great performance and premium smartphone user experience. Both phones ship with Android 14 OS but with different skins. The OnePlus 12 offers OxygenOS 14, while the Galaxy S24+ comes with OneUI 6.1.
Even for heavy users, these devices should deliver great performance on tasks like gaming or even video editing. While the OnePlus 12 is promised to receive four major OS upgrades, the Galaxy S24+ will get seven years of software support, the highest in the industry.
The AI-powered Galaxy S24+ offers several generative-AI packed features such as live call translation and transcription, wallpaper generator, image editing, and a new feature called Circle to Search, which was recently made available on the Google Pixel 8 series of smartphones.
Some of these features make use of on-device AI capabilities while the others depend on the cloud, however, despite having the required hardware, the OnePlus 12 does not have any on-device generative AI capabilities as of now.
The OnePlus 12 not only has a bigger 5,400 mAh battery, but it also supports fast 100W fast charging and 50W fast wireless charging. The Galaxy S24+ on the other hand has a significantly smaller 4,900 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging and 15W wireless charging, the bigger battery and the fast charging should give the OnePlus 12 an edge over the Galaxy S24+ both in terms of battery life and charging speed.
The OnePlus 12 is currently the best non-foldable phone that the company has ever made. However, while the Galaxy S24+ isn’t the best from Samsung, it is clearly one of the best from the South Korean tech giant. The hardware on the OnePlus 12 is undoubtedly more impressive than that of the Galaxy S24+, while the software experience on the Galaxy S24+ is on another level, thanks to the Galaxy AI features.
If you are looking for a smartphone with cutting-edge hardware, then the OnePlus 12 will be a good pick. For those who value software and want to experience the latest generative AI features on a smartphone, the Galaxy S24+ is the one to get."

“The special court on Tuesday rejected the appeal filed by Azam Khan against his conviction,” said Joint Director (Prosecution), Rampur, Shiv Prakash Pandey.
Azam Khan’s lawyer Nasir Sultan said they would move the Allahabad High Court against the special court’s order rejecting the appeal.
The senior SP leader was booked in a hate speech case that was registered at Shahjad Nagar police station in Rampur in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
The FIR was lodged on a complainant accusing Azam Khan of making an “inflammatory” speech targeting Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the then Rampur District Magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh, who was also the returning officer, at a public meeting in the Milak Vidhan Sabha area.
Last July, a Rampur court convicted Azam Khan under IPC sections 505 (1) B (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity) and 171-G (False statement in connection with an election). He was also convicted under Section 125 in The Representation of the People Act, 1951. The court also imposed a fine on him.
At present, Khan is lodged in Sitapur jail. Last October, a Rampur court sentenced him, his son and former MLA Abdullah Azam Khan, and wife Tanzeen Fatima to seven years of imprisonment for the alleged forgery of Abdullah’s birth certificate."

Now, his trainer Kris Gethin has revealed that Hrithik started training for Fighter almost 5-6 months before the shoot of the film and his training schedule was so demanding that he did not have any cheat days for many months.
Kris has been training with Hrithik for over a decade now and he revealed that he had never even heard of the actor when he first got a call from his team back in 2011. “I had never really heard of him but when I met him for the first time, probably a month after that phone call, it was very special,” Kris shared with Bollywood Hungama and added, “I had no idea who he was.”
The actor is now 50 years old and Kris shared that for Fighter, Hrithik’s body was able to “change and adapt like it did 12-13 years ago” and it looked like “the body had not aged in that sense.” He shared that Hrithik is solely focused on getting a healthier body which allows him to achieve his aesthetic goals as well. He said, “It’s because he has prioritised his health over aesthetics and when you focus on health, the aesthetics come very easily.”

Kris also opened up about the lack of any cheat days and said that Hrithik does not eat “any bad food” for “months on end.” On days when he has a cheat day, he continues to eat his “clean food but just much more of it.” He recalled that when he accompanied Hrithik on a trip to Dubai during New Year’s, the actor was in bed by 9:30 pm even though everyone wanted him to stay up and party. The next morning, Hrithik was up and running on the beach at 6 am.
Kris also trains with Vicky Kaushal and said that the actor takes his work and workouts very seriously and is usually operating on less sleep. Describing him as a “high achiever,” Kris said, “He takes everything seriously like his work, his workouts. I’d like him to take his sleep a bit more seriously. The guy is very dedicated and even though he is on little sleep because of the shoot schedule and the workouts, he has not complained once.”

E62F4Z1E8B_QTTKRCV6L22GJVD,Plan for one-month Gaza truce makes progress as Israel hits Khan Younis,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 07:56 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas-hostages-truce-9124853/,"Israel and Hamas have moved closer to agreement on a 30-day ceasefire in Gaza when Israeli hostages and Palestinians prisoners would be released, sources told Reuters, as Israel pressed ahead with its assault on southern Gaza’s main city of Khan Younis.
Qatar, the US and Egypt have held shuttle diplomacy since Dec. 28 seeking to bridge differences between Israel and the Palestinian militant group on a framework for a break in hostilities, which would also allow an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. But the two sides remain at odds over how to permanently end the Gaza war, and Hamas has refused to move forward until this is resolved, the sources said. The US State Department and White House, Qatar’s foreign ministry and Egypt’s State Information Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Reuters report.
Meanwhile, in its biggest operation in a month, the Israeli military pressed ahead with encircling Khan Younis where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.
Israeli tanks on Tuesday shut the road from Khan Younis towards the Mediterranean coast, blocking the escape route for civilians trying to reach Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge bordering Egypt – now crammed with more than half the enclave’s 2.3 million people.
Israeli forces killed more than 100 militants in western Khan Younis in 24 hours, military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday evening. Israel says it has killed around 9,000 militants in total. Reuters was unable to verify the number.
On Monday, Israel’s military suffered its deadliest day in over three months of conflict as 24 soldiers were killed in two incidents, bringing the Israeli military death toll in Gaza since late October to 220. Hamas claimed responsibility for a rocket attack that killed 21 of the soldiers. The latest deaths prompted Israeli officials to reiterate that the objectives of the war against the Palestinian Hamas movement that runs Gaza were unchanged and that efforts were being made to gain the release of more than 100 hostages.
“In the name of our heroes, for the sake of our lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said there would be no ceasefire that left Hamas in power and hostages in Gaza, following the militant group’s cross-border rampage on Oct. 7 in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed.
Palestinian health officials said at least 195 Palestinians were killed over the prior 24 hours, raising the documented death toll to 25,490. Thousands more are feared lost in the rubble.
“The entire population of Gaza is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council. “Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” he said, denouncing Israel’s opposition to creation of a Palestinian state that would exist alongside Israel.
Over decades, the two-state solution has been traduced, undermined & left for dead many times.
However, it remains the only way to achieve durable & equitable peace in Israel, in Palestine & in the region. pic.twitter.com/4pAdfF75Ui

Diplomacy around a ceasefire deal appeared intense. Qatar said on Tuesday the country had “presented ideas to both sides, we are getting a constant stream of replies from both sides, and that in its own right is a cause for optimism.”
Later, White House spokesperson John Kirby said US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in Cairo and would travel in the region for “active” discussions on ensuring release of hostages and securing a humanitarian pause. “The conversations are very sober and serious about trying to get another hostage deal in place,” Kirby told reporters.
Each side blamed the other for the collapse of a seven-day truce in November by rejecting terms to extend the daily release of hostages held by militants in exchange for Palestinian detainees. Women, children and foreign hostages were freed, but mediators failed at the final hour to find a formula to release more, including Israeli soldiers and civilian men.
In southern Gaza, Israel has blockaded hospitals, which Palestinian officials say makes it impossible to rescue the wounded. Israel says Hamas fighters operate in and around hospitals, which hospital staff and Hamas deny.
At the European Hospital, reached by Reuters in southern Khan Younis, Ahed Masmah brought in five corpses, piled on a mattress on his donkey cart. “I found them face down in the street,” he said.
At Khan Younis’ main Nasser hospital, the biggest still functioning in the Gaza Strip, bodies were being buried on the grounds because it was unsafe to go to the cemetery.
Martin Griffiths, UN coordinator of emergency relief, said on Tuesday that 24 people were killed in strikes on an aid warehouse, UN centre and humanitarian zone in the Khan Younis area. A distribution centre where families receive aid came under heavy bombardment, he said on social media platform X."

Some leaders of the outfit – including its self-styled ‘commander-in-chief’, were also permitted to enter the premises amidst heavy security deployment, including VDF (village defence force), Home Guards, CAPF (Central Armed Police Forces) and Army/Assam Rifles personnel in and around the fort.
While Chief Minister N Biren Singh did not arrive at Kangla, all other Meitei MLAs as well as Minister of State for External Affairs and Inner Manipur Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Ranjan Singh and Manipur Rajya Sabha MP Leishemba Sanajaoba were present.
Arambai Tenggol is a radical group with a large number of armed volunteers in valley areas of the state. While they maintained a shadowy presence at the beginning of the conflict, the developments on Wednesday were a visible show of strength and legitimacy for the group. A large number of civilians also gathered in the streets to show their support.
A statement by the Superintendent of Police, Imphal West, detailing the security arrangements in and around Kangla confirmed that the Arambai Tenggol “has summoned all the ministers and MLA belonging to the valley districts at Kangla at 10 am” and were “planning to enter Kangla with arms before the programme”. The security deployment was to stop the entry of armed members into the premises.
Thousands of volunteers from the group had gathered in Imphal on Wednesday, ahead of the meeting which had been called for at 10 am, and the elected representatives began trickling into Kangla by around 9:30 am. The meeting ended at around 11 am. The representatives were reportedly made to take an oath inside Kangla.
Soon after the meeting, Korounganba Khuman addressed a large gathering at Khwairamband Ima Market, where he claimed that the representatives, including Biren Singh who was not present, were made to sign a set of demands and told to pressure the Central government to translate them into action.
This is even as a special Ministry of Home Affairs team is in Manipur with the aim of peace talks with both the communities and to assess the current situation in the state. The team met leaders of the outfit on Monday.
Demands made by the Arambai Tenggol include delisting of Kukis from the Scheduled Tribes list, deportation of refugees to camps in Mizoram, border fencing, replacement of Assam Rifles with other paramilitary force and revoking Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement between the Centre and Kuki militant groups."

These “zombie viruses,” also called Methuselah viruses after the biblical figure, have already been isolated by researchers who have raised concerns about a new global emergency, according to The Observer. To counter the potential of diseases from the distant past coming back to haunt us, scientists are proposing an Arctic monitoring network that could pinpoint early cases of a disease caused by ancient micro-organisms.
This network could also provide quarantine help and expert medical treatment for infected people in an attempt to prevent infected people from leaving the region.
“At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread north. By contrast, little attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far north and then travel south – and that is an oversight, I believe. There are viruses up there that have the potential to infect humans and start a new disease outbreak,” geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University told The Observer.
Permafrost refers to the soil or underwater sediment that has been at temperatures below freezing for long periods of time. Some of the oldest permafrost has been frozen for around 7,00,000 years. It covers about one-fifth of the globe’s northern hemisphere and it is cold, dark, and lacks oxygen.
This makes permafrost excellent at preserving biological material. Last year, scientists brought microscopic worms back to life after they were frozen in the Siberian permafrost for 46,000 years.
In 2014, Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University and a team of scientists isolated live viruses in Siberia and showed they could still infect single-cell organism despite the fact they have been buried in permafrost for thousands of years. Those viruses can only infect amoeba and pose no threat to humans, but it opens up the possibility of other dangerous viruses lurking in the permafrost.
According to Claverie, the researchers have identified genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses in the permafrost, and those pathogens are known to infect humans."

The incident unfolded after a routine safety briefing for passengers on the Airbus A330 aircraft.
Hardy, an experienced flyer, noticed four missing screws on the wing, raising immediate concerns. His quick thinking and action proved critical in preventing a potential disaster.
Hardy expressed his initial concern for his partner, stating, “I’m a good flyer, but my partner was not loving the information I was telling her and starting to panic, and I was trying to put her mind at rest as much as I could.”
Faced with a crucial decision, Hardy informed the cabin crew, leading to a series of events that resulted in the flight’s cancellation.
Engineers were promptly dispatched to conduct thorough maintenance inspections on the damaged Airbus A330. A Virgin Atlantic official assured customers that safety is the airline’s top priority and that no passengers or crew members were at risk during the incident. The decision to cancel the flight allowed for additional engineering maintenance tests as a precautionary measure.

EBUGG7DUSO_XUNZQDBB1PSXYUS,Why Punjab govt moved Supreme Court against the expansion of BSF jurisdiction,Ajoy Sinha Karpuram,"Updated: January 25, 2024 11:11 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/why-punjab-moved-sc-against-the-expansion-of-bsf-jurisdiction-9124717/,"The Supreme Court is set to hear the dispute over the expansion of the Border Security Force (BSF) jurisdiction in Punjab. Final hearings in this case will commence next week.
On October 11, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a notification expanding the jurisdiction of the BSF in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. This was challenged by the Punjab government the following December.
Why was the BSF jurisdiction extended?
The BSF was created after the enactment of the Border Security Force Act in September 1968. The BSF is meant to secure India’s borders with its neighbouring nations and is empowered to arrest, search and seize under a number of laws, such as the Criminal Procedure Code, the Passports Act, the Passport (Entry into India) Act, and the NDPS Act, to name a few.
Section 139(1) of the BSF Act allows the central government, through an order, to designate an area “within the local limits of such area adjoining the borders of India” where members of the BSF can exercise powers to prevent offenses under any Acts that the central government may specify.
Prior to the notification issued in October 2021, the BSF could exercise its powers within 15 kilometres of the border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. The Centre expanded this to within 50 kilometres of the border.
The notification states that, within this larger 50-kilometre jurisdiction, the BSF can only exercise powers under the Criminal Procedure Code, the Passport (Entry into India) Act and the Passports Act. For other central legislations, the 15-km limit remains.
On December 7, 2021, the Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai clarified in writing that this expansion was in response to the increased use of drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, which have long-range capabilities and enable surveillance and the smuggling of arms and fake currency. He also highlighted the ‘menace of cattle smuggling’ and pointed out that smugglers often seek refuge outside BSF jurisdiction.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta also claimed that the notification makes the BSF jurisdiction uniform across states, as the 50-kilometre limit was already in place in Rajasthan. The same notification reducted the jurisdiction in Gujarat from 80 km to 50 km.
Why has Punjab challenged this?
The state of Punjab filed an ‘original suit’ against the central government in the Supreme Court in December 2021. The Supreme Court has ‘original jurisdiction’ in disputes between the central government and states under Article 131 of the Constitution, which means cases of this kind can only be heard for the first time at the SC “to the exclusion of any other court”.
The Punjab government claimed that expanding the jurisdiction of the BSF would compromise the state’s exclusive powers to legislate on matters involving the police and public order. These powers are provided in Entries 1 and 2 of the State List under Article 246 of the Constitution. They also claimed that the notification was issued without consulting with any of the states concerned. Shortly after the notification was released, the then Chief Minister of Punjab Charanjit Singh Channi called it “a direct attack on federalism”.
Arguing before the SC in December 2023, Additional Advocate General for the state of Punjab, Shadan Farasat, claimed that in Punjab, a large number of cities and towns would fall within this 50-kilometre jurisdiction, whereas in Gujarat and Rajasthan, most areas along the international border are sparsely populated, primarily containing marshlands or deserts.
Have other states joined the challenge?
Currently, no other challenge is tagged with the Punjab government’s, though the notification was met with pushback from West Bengal when it was released. Shortly after the October 2021 notification, the West Bengal Assembly had passed a resolution demanding its withdrawal.
What are the issues that the SC will consider?
The court will decide if the notification expanding the jurisdiction of the BSF was arbitrary or backed by legitimate reasons. Further, the court will determine if this notification interferes with the powers of the local police and encroaches upon states powers under the Constitution.
The SC will also decide what factors have to be considered when deciding which areas are “within the local limits of such area adjoining the borders of India” and whether all states must be treated alike when determining these local limits. Finally, the court will decide if the notification can be challenged through an original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution."

🚨Big Story
The Archaeological Survey of India, tasked by the Varanasi district court in July 2023 to conduct a scientific survey of the Gyanvapi mosque complex, has concluded that “there existed a Hindu temple prior to the construction of the existing structure” at the site. The Hindu litigants have claimed that the mosque was built on the site of the original Kashi Vishwanath temple after its destruction in the 17th century.
We take a look at what the report states and the legal challenges that lie ahead.
🇮🇳 Republic Day 2024
Calling the consecration ceremony at the new Ram temple in Ayodhya a “landmark in India’s continued re-discovery of its civilisational heritage”, President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday said the temple was an expression of people’s faith, and a testament to their trust in the judicial process.

When the film was first announced, Nadigarthilagam Sivaji Samooganala Peravai, a fan association of the actor wrote a letter to the makers to change the title as it is a moniker of the legendary actor.
It was argued that Nadikar Thilakam is synonymous with Sivaji Ganesan and the title must only be used for a biopic of the actor. Heeding the request, the makers have removed the word ‘Thilagam’ from the title and are calling the film Nadikar, which means actor.
Mythri Movie Makers, the production house of the film, invited Sivaji’s son Prabhu to be part of the promotional event as the chief guest. The actor was seen all smiles with the cast members Tovion Thomas, Lal, Soubhin Shahir. The film will be directed by Jean Paul Lal.

There have been quite a few reports of tension and a growing rift between the two parties over the past few weeks, and the JD(U) and other parties of the INDIA alliance have also had differences.
* Comments of Lalu’s daughter
The latest point of friction was Nitish’s remarks on Wednesday in which he appeared to target dynastic rule while paying homage to former Bihar CM and socialist icon Karpoori Thakur at his centenary celebrations.
“Karpoori never promoted his family,” Nitish said at a public meeting in Patna on Wednesday. “It was only after his death, we pressured his son Ramnath to join politics. He is now Rajya Sabha MP and we respect him very much. Lekin aajkal to log parivar karte rahte hai … aaj log bahut parivar ko badhate rahte hai (these days, people keep promoting their family members in politics). But like Karpoori, I have not promoted my family in politics.”
Though Nitish did not name any party, the BJP has targeted the RJD and the Congress in the past for allegedly promoting “dynastic politics”. On Thursday, Lalu’s Singapore-based daughter Rohini Acharya posted, subsequently deleted, on social media platform X: “Samajwadi purodha hone ka dawa karta wahi dawa hai, hawaon ki tarah badalti jinki vichardhara hai (One whose ideology changes with the direction of the wind claims to be the patron of socialism).” There was also said to be little interaction between Nitish and Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav at Thursday’s Cabinet meeting, which went on for about just 20 mins.
* Changing the Education Minister
The RJD is said to have sensed unease in the Mahagathbandhan and on January 20 readily agreed to replace Chandra Shekhar with Alok Kumar Mehta as the Education Minister to not ruffle Nitish’s feathers. Chandra Shekhar was known for making controversial remarks — from referring to some verses of the Ramcharitmanas as “casteist” and “potassium cyanide” to backing fellow RJD MLA Fateh Bahadur Kushwaha on his remarks against Hindu goddess Saraswati — and his relegation was seen more as a matter of the RJD seeking peace with Nitish than to effect a change for better governance.
* Simultaneous polls a point of friction?
On the evening of January 20, Nitish rejigged the team of national office-bearers of the JD(U). He announced a 21-member team, dropping six of the party’s seven Lok Sabha MPs from it. Some of them are said to be close to former party national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh or Lalan Singh who lost his post to Nitish last month amid reports that the CM had been upset with him over his alleged proximity to Lalu Prasad.
Lalan Singh’s removal as JD(U) chief was said to have not gone down well with Tejashwi cancelling his official Australia tour, which was to begin on January 6. A key RJD leader said the party “did not want to take any chances by sending its key leader out of the country at a time with the uncertainty in state politics”.
Sources in the RJD and JD (U) at the time said Nitish had been “pressuring” Lalu to agree to simultaneous Assembly polls along with the Lok Sabha elections slated for April-May. Nitish is said to have come under increasing pressure from within his party to go for synchronised elections so that the party could improve on its tally of 43 constituencies in the 2020 Assembly elections, when it emerged as the third-largest party behind the RJD and the BJP.
“Nitish looks desperate for simultaneous polls because he is afraid of exodus in his party. But why should we force Assembly polls on the state one-and-a-half years before schedule?” an RJD leader said at the time.
* Credit for jobs and hospitals
The Bihar government on January 20 also put out a full-page advertisement in local newspapers about the state health department’s key initiatives, which did not make any reference to Tejashwi, who holds the health portfolio among other ministries.
The ad said that while Bihar previously had only six medical colleges (until the Lalu-led RJD’s tenure in 2005), the state now had 15 medical colleges and hospitals and that the government had sanctioned another 15 medical colleges and hospitals for the future. “Everyone knows health is the key department under RJD. Even if there is no photograph of the health minister with the ad, there should have been a mention of the health minister,” an RJD leader told The Indian Express at the time.
There was also unease in the alliance over credit for the jobs generated by the government. On January 13, the Bihar government ran advertisements on its employment drive with the slogan: “Rojgar Matlab Nitish Kumar (employment means Nitish Kumar).” That day, appointment letters were distributed to 96,823 teachers offline and virtually. The CM, at an event at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan, handed out appointment letters to 12 teachers.
“Everyone knows that the 10-lakh jobs initiative was our idea and promise during the 2020 polls,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari told The Indian Express back then. “We should have been given equal credit and a picture of the deputy CM should have been included in the government advertisement. People know that it is the Nitish-Tejashwi government and not just a Nitish Kumar government. The employment drive is our baby and it cannot be hijacked.”
In November 2023, during the first phase of the teachers’ mass recruitment, the government appointed 1,20,336 teachers. The state government claims to have achieved a teacher-student ratio of 1:5, with 51 women teachers being among the newly appointed ones in the two phases.
* Differences in INDIA alliance
The lack of consensus in the Opposition alliance may have also played a role in pushing Nitish away and led him to question his future with the grouping. He turned down an offer to become its convener till there was agreement on his role. Last year, he had taken the initiative to get all the anti-BJP parties together on a common platform, helping in the formation of the INDIA bloc.
The Bihar CM is said to have always pushed for a consensus regarding his role in the coalition, but a meeting between West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal last month before the meeting of the INDIA bloc in Delhi is said to have strengthened his reservations. He was said to have been left upset with Banerjee proposing Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge’s name for leader of the alliance.”
Kharge’s statement earlier this month that the INDIA alliance would meet in “10 to 15 days” to make decisions about key posts did not sit well with the JD(U) that claimed that the INDIA alliance was “running out of time and ideas” to outthink the BJP. “INDIA is still in a confused state. What if Lok Sabha polls are announced soon after the Ram Temple opening? We still do not have clarity on seat-sharing, agenda, and leadership roles,” JD(U) spokesperson K C Tyagi told The Indian Express at the time."

Jarange-Patil made the statement after the Maratha Reservation Morcha, which is headed to Mumbai, reached Lonavala on Thursday.
“I am ready to hold discussions with Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and two deputy chief ministers…They should come and meet me,” Jarange-Patil told reporters after reaching Lonavala along with hundreds of Maratha community members.
A delegation of government officials had met Jarange-Patil and conveyed a message from the chief minister. “I held discussions with officials. I put forth my demands. The officials said they will speak to the chief minister. If every time, they want to say the same thing, then why is the chief minister himself not talking to me? He should come and meet me… I am ready to hold discussions with them,” Jarange-Patil said.
The activist, however, said there will be no closed-door talks. “The discussions should be held in full public view,” he said.
Jarange-Patil said he was in favour of holding discussions so that the demands put forth by the Maratha community were met. “’We are interested in the resolution of our problems. We do not want to go on and on. It is very cold. Everyone has to suffer. The government should meet our demands, then we will take a call about our hunger strike. Let them first hold discussions,” he said.
“I will begin my fast at Azad Maidan and not in Navi Mumbai as is being suggested. We have come prepared to stay put in Mumbai for a longer period. The fast will be held only at Azad Maidan. I do not know whether permission has been given or not,” Jarange-Patil said earlier in the day. Later on Thursday, the Mumbai police denied permission to Jarange-Patil to hold a hunger strike in the city.
Government sources said Shinde is likely to hold a discussion with Jarange-Patil through video-conferencing."

The new initiative will be unveiled Thursday in an event for school principals with first lady Jill Biden and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. Also participating will be Stefanie Feldman, who runs the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
“We know safe storage of firearms can save lives, especially by reducing suicide by firearms and school shootings,” Feldman told reporters.
Guns are the leading cause of death for American children, and most guns used in school shootings are taken from the shooter’s home.
“I know that there are some parents who wake up every day, drop their kids off for school and while they’re watching their kids walk through that door, there’s just a little part of them that worries about gun violence during the school day,” Feldman said.
As part of the announcement, the Justice Department will release a guide to safe firearm storage, and the Education Department will distribute materials to schools that can be shared with families.
The administration has relied on initiatives like this one, which involves limited executive action and promoting voluntary measures, at a time when tougher gun control proposals are nonstarters in Congress.
There’s no federal law requiring gun owners to lock up their firearms, although the White House has encouraged such rules to be implemented at the state level."
EXT97SRIWF_NEMUGA1U5TTD84U,"From Ram to Akbar to Gandhi: Artwork on the Constitution, who painted them",Vandana Kalra,"Updated: January 26, 2024 09:29 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/illustrations-constitution-who-painted-9127795/,"The Indian Constitution is not just the lengthiest written Constitution in the world but also the most richly illustrated, with all 22 parts carrying hand-painted images and its pages adorned with elaborate borders.
While the Constitution was handwritten by calligrapher Prem Behari Narain Raizada, the paintings were conceived and implemented in Santiniketan by artist-pedagogue Nandalal Bose and his team.
When placed in sequence, the narrative scheme of the paintings represents different periods in Indian history, from the Indus Valley civilisation to the freedom struggle, also including scenes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
The illustrations also showcase the diverse geography of India, from camels marching in the desert to the mighty Himalayas. “It is a sequence of images which is his (Nandalal’s) vision of India’s history. He is not illustrating the content of the Constitution, but he is placing the history of India as he saw it. Present-day scholars and historians might have some disagreements about the sequence but that was the broad chronology talked about back then,” said art historian R Siva Kumar.
The appointment of artists
Siva Kumar said Bose was approached with the task of illustrating in October 1949, just before the final session of the Constituent Assembly and the signing of the draft Constitution on November 26, 1949. “It is difficult to say how long the illustrations took and if they were completed before the signing…. in some instances, the signatures breach the space allotted for them and the borders skirt them, suggesting they were added later,” he said.
Two copies of the Constitution, one in English and one in Hindi, are handwritten and bear the paintings.
Bose was probably entrusted with the task due to his long association with the nationalist movement. A close aide of Mahatma Gandhi, he had designed posters for the Congress session at Haripura, near Bardoli in Gujarat, in 1938.
On the Constitution, Bose worked with a team of collaborators which included close family members, his students and fellow-artists, including Kripal Singh Shekhawat, A Perumal, and Direndrakrishna Deb Burman.
The Preamble page has intricate patterns sketched by Beohar Rammanohar Sinha and bears his signature, while Dinanath Bhargava sketched the National Emblem, the Lion Capital of Ashoka.
Siva Kumar said a note found among Nandalal’s papers suggests that the artists who painted the historical scenes were paid Rs 25 for each page.
It is believed that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who wanted the Constitution handwritten, and therefore Raizada, a graduate from Delhi’s St Stephen’s College, was approached. The calligrapher, who had learnt the art from his grandfather, immediately agreed. Not charging a penny for the task, his only request was to have his name on each page and alongside his grandfather on the last. Allotted a room in the Constitution Hall, he reportedly took six months to complete the task, writing on parchment sheets both in Hindi and English.
The ideation of the artwork
According to Siva Kumar, the text and images in the Constitution have no direct correlation, as Nandalal was not illustrating the text or studying its details while planning the visual narrative. “A preliminary plan was drawn up, which saw deletions and additions,” Siva Kumar said. For instance, ‘portraits of Akbar and Shahjahan with Mughal architecture’ was replaced with an image of Akbar.
Ashish Anand, CEO and Managing Director of DAG, said: “Nandalal Bose’s career varied across his watercolour washes to his expressionist subaltern works in Santiniketan, and, indeed, the selection and style as well as imaging spans this spectrum in terms of subjects and influences. Illustrating the Constitution was a task that would survive for centuries, an onerous responsibility — and Nandalal Bose’s stamp exemplifies as well as expands the vision of the document it represents.”
Borrowing from history and religion
The Bull Seal, excavated from the Indus Valley region, is the first pictorial representation in the Constitution, appearing in ‘Part I: The Union and its Territory’. ‘Part II: Citizenship’ features a hermitage scene with male ascetic figures offering prayers in a meditative environment. In another scene of hermitage that appears in Part V, Buddha is the central figure, surrounded by disciples, animals, and birds in a serene setting.
Out of the select representations in colour is an image in Part VI of Mahavir, the 24th Jain Tirthankara, seated crossed-legged in meditation.
In Part XIII, we see sculptures from Mahabalipuram and the descent of Ganga to Earth.
Part IV on Directive Principles of State Policy begins with a scene from the Mahabharata, with the discussion between Arjun and Krishna before the onset of the war. For Part III on Fundamental Rights, the artists turned to the Ramayana, drawing a sketch of Ram, Lakshman and Sita returning home after the battle in Lanka.
India’s monarchs
While Emperor Ashoka is seen seated on an elephant, propagating Buddhism, in Part VII of the Constitution, Part IX has a scene from King Vikramaditya’s court with musicians and dancers, representing him as a patron of art.
The only female figure illustrated prominently in the Constitution, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, is sketched in her armour as she shares the page with Tipu Sultan, the king of Mysore, in Part XVI of the Constitution. Chhatrapati Shivaji and Guru Gobind Singh are featured in Part XV.
“Portraits of Rana Pratap and Ranjit Singh were also meant to be there but were not included probably due to space constraints,” Siva Kumar said.
The country’s freedom struggle
Gandhi appears twice, leading the Dandi March and visiting riot-hit Noakhali in Bangladesh. He is being welcomed by women with an aarti thali and Muslim peasants wearing kufi caps.
In Part XIX, Subhas Chandra Bose is seen against a mountainous backdrop, saluting the flag, with members of Azad Hind Fauj marching ahead.
Nehru was also supposed to be included, but was eventually omitted.
Siva Kumar said three landscapes in the Constitution are a homage to Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore and the National Anthem he composed, which also celebrates the diverse geographical landscapes of India."
EYST60B17V_1QRSOT850CFDTOE,Uttarakhand Assembly will hold special session on Feb 5 to pass Uniform Civil Code,Liz Mathew,"Updated: January 27, 2024 08:49 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/uttarakhand-uniform-civil-code-special-session-9128813/,"The Uttarakhand Assembly has been convened for a special one-day session on February 5 to discuss and pass the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill.
Sources said a five-member committee, led by former Supreme Court judge, Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, that was set up by the state in May 2022, is expected to hand over its report to the government on February 2 or February 3.
The report is learnt to have placed emphasis on gender equality and equal rights for daughters in ancestral properties. It does not, however, suggest raising the marriageable age of women to 21 years. It has recommended retaining the marriageable age for women at 18 years.
Sources also said once the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly passes the UCC, two other BJP ruled states – Gujarat and Assam – will pass more or less a similar Bill in their Legislative Assembly. If everything goes as per plan, three states will have enacted the Uniform Civil Code before the Lok Sabha elections in the next few months.
A note issued on Friday from the Uttarakhand Assembly Secretariat states: “Whereas Honourable Governor, Uttarakhand had summoned the Fifth Vidhan Sabha of Uttarakhand to meet for the second session of the year 2023 at 11AM on Tuesday, the 05th September, 2023, in the Sabha Mandap, Vidhan Sabha Bhawan, Dehradun and which as adjourned sine die on 08th September 2023 in continuation there of the Honourable Speaker of Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly again summoned the House from Monday, 5 February, 2024 at 11 am in the Sabha Mandal, Vidhan Sabha, Dehradun.”
Sources indicated it will be a one day session and the House is expected to be adjourned after the Bill is passed. “A similar draft will be discussed and passed by both the Gujarat and Assam assemblies,” the source said.
Sources in the state government said the report and the draft Bill were ready, but “since all legislative work in Uttarakhand is in Hindi, three members of the committee – social activist Manu Gaur, ex-chief secretary and IAS officer Shatrughan Singh, and Doon University Vice-Chancellor Surekha Dangwal have been asked to translate the report into Hindi from English in their office in Dehradun.” “The translation work is in the process. Designing and printing are also in the process,” a source said.
The BJP’s political strategy is to ensure states ruled by the party first implement the Uniform Civil Code, with the focus largely on gender equality and equal rights for daughters in ancestral property, keeping out the more contentious issues. This will face less resistance, it hopes, setting the stage for a national law.
The panel had two sub-committees, one — including Delhi High Court Judge Pramod Kohli, Gaur and Singh  — to draft the Bill. The second sub-committee with Gaur, Dangwal and Singh was involved in discussions with the stakeholders, designing, and printing of the report. “The committee members were asked to translate the report and the draft Bill into Hindi in order to keep the originality,” said the source.
Although there were indications that the state Assembly could meet for a special session in November post Diwali, the collapse of Silkyara-Barkot tunnel in Uttarkashi district on November 12 had thwarted the plan. “Then the suggestion for translation came up by the committee itself. That’s why it is taking time,” the source said.
The UCC was one of the major poll promises of the BJP in the run-up to the state Assembly elections in February 2022. The committee was announced after the first Cabinet meeting of the newly-formed Uttarakhand government."

F1LWXJLD4S_HBS7DB0OFKC43DM,Nitish Kumar didn’t target RJD by speaking about dynasty: JD(U)’s Tyagi,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:14 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/nitish-kumar-not-target-rjd-dynasty-jdu-tyagi-9127725/,"Senior JD(U) leader K C Tyagi on Thursday rejected a suggestion that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the party’s national president, had targeted ally RJD by speaking out against “dynasty politics” the day before.
Tyagi, the JD(U)’s political advisor and spokesperson, was replying to queries about the suggestion that followed Kumar’s speech at a party rally here on Wednesday.
“Nitish Kumar was addressing a programme organised on the birth anniversary of Karpoori Thakur, whom he has idolised. Like all great socialists, Thakur abhorred dynastic succession in politics. This was the simple fact Nitish Kumar wanted to underscore. Nothing more should be read into it,” asserted Tyagi.
Notably, the RJD is headed by Kumar’s former arch-rival Lalu Prasad whose younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav took over as Deputy CM when the JD(U) supremo dumped the BJP less than two years ago and joined hands with the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, which includes Congress and three Left parties.
Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is also a minister in the state cabinet while his eldest daughter Misa Bharti is a Rajya Sabha member.
Tyagi, however, said, “Nitish Kumar had no desire to condemn any regional party or leader”.
He, however, cryptically added: “Those who think a dynasty is essential for the nation, are free to draw their own conclusions”.
The JD(U) leader declined to comment on several posts on X by Prasad’s daughter Rohini Acharya, which have since been deleted, leading the BJP to allege that she had attacked Kumar, though he was not mentioned by name.
BJP leader Nikhil Anand alleged in a statement that Acharya had used the word “badtameez” (ill-mannered) against the Chief Minister and if she thought it was a mistake, she must “publicly express regret and apologise”.

A Karnataka delegation, which he led, engaged in over 50 meetings with global industry leaders in Davos.
“Karnataka successfully signed eight MoUs worth Rs 23,000 crore with global companies. Noteworthy agreements include Web Werks’ Rs 20,000 crore investment for a hyper-scale data centre and Microsoft’s commitment to digital skilling interventions,” Patil told reporters here.
The Minister said Hitachi signed an MoU to “stimulate” economic growth in Karnataka, particularly focusing on rural areas.
The partnership with emphasis on developing sectors such as healthcare, education, and Panchayat E-Governance aims to create more opportunities and employment for the people of the state, Patil said.
Further, MoUs have been signed by five companies across sectors of digital healthcare, smart city infrastructure, renewable energy and data centres worth Rs 3000 crore, he said.
Additionally, several companies pledged to set up facilities in north Karnataka, contributing to equitable development beyond Bengaluru such as Lulu Group’s expansion in Vijayapura and Kalaburagi and BL Agro’s food processing unit in Vijayapura, the Minister said.
“Artificial Intelligence emerged as a prominent theme, with discussions held with companies like HCL, HP, Cisco, and Sony,” the Minister noted.
Sustainability and Citizen Services were also key areas of focus, with engagements with companies such as Planet, Volvo and Nestle, Patil said.
He added that the delegation explored collaboration in sectors like global capability centres, with discussions involving companies like HP, Rockwell, Sony, and Volvo looking to expand their capabilities in Bengaluru.
“Our subsequent focus will be on realising these agreements, converting discussions into concrete investments, and addressing feedback for the smooth implementation of these projects,” Patil said."
F2PXQRIZZL_9H9CJN5TK9TEEV6,Moti Mahal vs Daryaganj: Who invented butter chicken? Delhi HC to decide,Khadija Khan,"Updated: January 26, 2024 11:40 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/moti-mahal-daryaganj-who-invented-butter-chicken-9126175/,"The Delhi High Court is set to decide who “invented” butter chicken and dal makhani, as it adjudicates an ongoing dispute between Moti Mahal and Daryaganj, two Delhi-based restaurant chains.
Moti Mahal has long claimed that its late founder, Kundal Lal Gujral (1902-97), invented butter chicken and dal makhani, bringing the dishes to India from Peshawar’s Moti Mahal restaurant after Partition.
More recently, Daryaganj, of Shark Tank India fame, also started advertising itself as the “inventor” of both the dishes. Its proprietors claimed that it was their forefather, Kundan Lal Jaggi (1924-2018), who invented both the dishes instead. They also displayed a picture of Peshawar’s Moti Mahal on the restaurant’s website.
Consequently, Moti Mahal filed a legal suit at the Delhi High Court, claiming that Daryaganj was passing off Moti Mahal’s invention as its own.
What has Moti Mahal alleged? How do trademarks work? And what is passing off? We explain.
Moti Mahal’s suit alleges trademark infringement and passing off (more on that later), and seeks a temporary injunction against Daryaganj. A temporary injunction is an order by which a party to an action is required to do/refrain from doing a particular thing until the suit is disposed of, or until further orders of the court.
Moti Mahal’s proprietors have contended that not only is Daryaganj misleading the public about who invented butter chicken, it has also wrongly used a manipulated photograph of the Peshawar restaurant on its website.
Moti Mahal’s plea seeks to restrain Daryaganj from claiming that their “predecessor” invented the two dishes, as well as from using the tagline “by the inventors of butter chicken and dal makhani” on their website, on social media platforms, and any print or electronic media.
The plea also seeks to restrain Daryaganj from claiming that it is, in any way, related to Moti Mahal, whose first branch was opened in Old Delhi’s Daryaganj neighbourhood. Moti Mahal’s plea said that it solely owned the trademark “MOTI MAHAL” along with other related marks, used for restaurants operating nationally and internationally since 1920.
On January 16, in the Delhi HC, the counsel for Daryaganj opposed Moti Mahal’s claims, labelling the entire suit as “misconceived, baseless, and lacking a cause of action.”
Regarding a photograph of the Peshawar restaurant, the defendants’ counsel said that the restaurant was jointly established by the “predecessors” of both parties — Moti Mahal’s Gujral and Daryaganj’s Jaggi — and that the plaintiffs had no valid claim of exclusive rights over the image.
Daryaganj’s counsel argued that the website used a cropped picture, specifically to exclude the term “Moti Mahal”, and thus not infringe on its trademark. Despite this, the counsel said, the defendants agreed to remove the disputed photograph from their website within a week as a “conciliatory gesture” to “alleviate the plaintiffs’ concerns” without conceding to any of their claims.
Daryaganj, however, is yet to file its complete response to Moti Mahal’s suit. In the January 16 hearing, Justice Sanjeev Narula asked Daryaganj’s proprietors to file their response within 30 days, and listed the matter for hearing on May 29.
A trademark is a symbol, design, word, or phrase that is identified with a business. When a trademark is registered, its owner can claim “exclusive rights” to its use.
The Trademarks Act of 1999 governs the regime of trademarks, and their registration. The Act guarantees protection for trademarks registered with the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks, also known as the trademark registry.
According to Section 25 of the Act, once registered, a trademark is valid for 10 years and can be renewed by the owner periodically.
Using someone’s registered trademark without their authorization amounts to a violation or infringement of the trademark. Using a substantially similar mark for similar goods or services can also amount to infringement.
A mark is considered “deceptively similar” to another, if it nearly resembles that other mark, confusing the consumer in the process. Such deception can be caused phonetically, structurally or visually — as decided by the courts.
There is, however, another way in which trademarks can be infringed.
In Cadila Healthcare Limited vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (2001), the Supreme Court said that passing-off is a “species of unfair trade competition or of actionable unfair trading by which one person, through deception, attempts to obtain an economic benefit of the reputation which other has established for himself in a particular trade or business”.
The apex court ruled  that the infringing products need not be identical, but the similarity in the nature, character, and performance of the goods of the rival traders has to be established to sustain a claim of ‘passing off’.
Take a situation where a brand logo is misspelt such that it is not easy for a consumer to discern — for instance, ‘Adidas’ and ‘Adibas’. In the present case, Moti Mahal is arguing that Daryaganj’s claims that its forefather Jaggi ‘invented’ butter chicken, and use of the manipulated photo of Moti Mahal restaurant in Peshawar, amounted to passing off Moti Mahal’s trademark as its own.
In infringement cases, the trademark owner can take legal action against anyone who infringes on or violates their copyright and is entitled to remedies such as injunctions, damages, and accounts. An injunction is “an official order given by a law court, usually to stop someone from doing something.”"

The police said the murder could be a result of a five-year-old rivalry between the deceased and one of the accused. According to the police, the incident took place at the Baraula village that falls under the jurisdiction of Sector-49 police station. The deceased has been identified as Mehdi Hasan, a resident of the village.
Police have arrested the two accused, Anuj and Nitin. The two had allegedly tried to run away during their arrest after snatching a service pistol from the police and were injured in retaliatory action. They are undergoing treatment at a hospital.
Hasan is survived by his wife and four children. Hasan, who was earlier involved in scrap work, used to drive an e-rickshaw to support his family. The accused are also residents of the same village as Hasan. While Anuj works at a private hospital, Nitin is in the business of supplying milk.
Officials said that in 2018, Hasan had allegedly stabbed Anuj’s father but he survived. The case is still in court.
Police said Anuj was still nursing a grudge against Hasan regarding the attack, and thus planned to avenge it with the help of a friend.
Describing the sequence of events, police said an altercation took place between the accused and the deceased on Saturday night, after which they stabbed Hasan, tied him to a bike and dragged him across the village.
“The two had an encounter with Sector-49 police around 5 am in the morning. Hasan was stabbed yesterday (Saturday) by Anuj and Nitin, and died during treatment. When the police were returning with the accused after recovering the evidence of murder, they attacked the cops near Baraula culvert. The police fired back and the two accused were injured,” Manish Kumar Mishra, Additional DCP, Noida, said. CCTV footage of the incident went viral on social media. After the incident, many people gathered at the Baraula police outpost and raised slogans against the administration.
Police carried out a flag march in the village on Sunday to maintain law and order. A police unit has been deployed to prevent any untoward incident."

Gaza’s health ministry said 178 Palestinians had been killed in the past 24 hours, one of the deadliest days of the war so far. Israel’s military said a soldier was killed in fighting.
Israeli forces and Hamas fighters clashed in several places, from Jabalia in the north to Khan Younis in the south, the focus of recent Israeli operations. Israeli planes resumed heavy bombing on Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip and explosions echoed throughout the city. Explosions lit the skies in parts of the Khan Younis refugee camp, and Palestinian health officials said one Palestinian was killed and seven wounded in one air strike as night fell.
Israel said its troops had cleared much of northern Gaza of Hamas’ military network and more than 1 million residents of that enclave have moved south to flee the bombardments. Fighting, however, has continued in the Jabalia refugee camp and other areas around Gaza City.
Israel unleashed its campaign to eliminate Iran-backed Hamas after the militants burst into Israel on Oct. 7 and rampaged through southern towns and bases, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 253 hostages back to Gaza. Israel says it is fighting a threat to its very existence.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 25,105 Palestinians — many of them women and children — had been killed and 62,681 have been wounded in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7. It does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but says most of those killed have been civilians.
The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable.
The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all.
— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) January 21, 2024
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday denounced Israel for what he called the “heartbreaking” deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. “Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary-general,” Guterres said.
Israel says it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, but accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the Islamist group denies. Guterres also said it was unacceptable for Israel to resist statehood for Palestinians and such a stance would indefinitely prolong a conflict.
His comments followed remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that appeared to rule out the so-called two-state solution to the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict — as urged by the US and other governments.
Netanyahu’s office said that in talks with US President Joe Biden on Friday, he “reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.”
On Sunday, Netanyahu rejected conditions presented by Hamas to end the war and release hostages that would include Israel’s complete withdrawal and leaving Hamas, an Islamist group dedicated to Israel’s destruction, in power in Gaza.
On Monday, the Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers are to meet their European Union counterparts in Brussels as the EU considers potential steps toward a comprehensive peace.
Hamas said Washington was ignoring Palestinian suffering and deaths while supporting Israeli actions financially and militarily. Hamas called its Oct. 7 assault a “necessary step”.
“It was a defensive act in the frame of getting rid of the Israeli occupation, reclaiming the Palestinian rights and on the way for liberation and independence,” Hamas said in a statement. The Oct. 7 attacks, in which many women and children were murdered and bodies mutilated, drew worldwide revulsion and condemnation.
Most of the Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million people have since been displaced from their homes. With large areas razed to the ground and hospitals and humanitarian agencies struggling to cope, Palestinians described dire conditions.
“We struggle to survive bombs, but frankly we try to survive hunger more,” Amer, 32, a father of three from northern Gaza, told Reuters. “Finding food for the family, for the children, has become a more challenging adventure than surviving war.”
Israel’s military said soldiers had killed 15 Palestinian gunmen in the north while snipers, backed by air support, had killed a number of militants in Khan Younis. Hamas dismissed this account.
Palestinians said fighting has raged in Jabalia for the past three days. Some buildings caught fire and smoke rose where bombs had fallen.
Along Gaza’s southern coast, witnesses said Israeli warships shelled the beach.In the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million displaced people are concentrated, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a car. Another car was hit in Gaza City, killing three people, health officials said.
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Hamas’ rival, the Palestinian Authority, has limited self-rule. The Palestinian Health Ministry there said Israeli forces have killed 360 Palestinians since Oct. 7."

“…Why the need for such anti-constitutional actions to stop him (Gandhi)? Are you scared of him? Or Does the shadow of corruption allegations still linger, influencing decisions under BJP’s directive?” Siddaramaiah said in a post on X. Sarma was yet to respond to the allegation.
Shri @himantabiswa avare,
Focusing on numbers misses the point. Even if it were only Shri Rahul Gandhi, the question remains: Why the need for such anti-constitutional actions to stop him? Are you scared of him? Or Does the shadow of corruption allegations still linger,… https://t.co/pYYtaZLN6l
— Siddaramaiah (@siddaramaiah) January 24, 2024
Siddaramaiah also accused the BJP leader of “succumbing to party pressure” instead of prioritising the “rights and identity of Assam”. Earlier too, he had targeted Sarma for orchestrating attacks on people taking part in the Yatra, threatening them, and “blocking temple visits” in an attempt to please his “higher-ups”.
“Assam deserves a leader who champions its rich language, culture, and history, not one who succumbs to party pressure like you. It’s time to prioritize the rights and identity of Assam over party lines,” Siddaramaiah said on X.
Siddaramaiah asked Sarma to take inspiration from the Congress governments in Karnataka and Telangana where the party upholds regional interests within the Indian framework.
“Look at Karnataka, Telangana, where Congress upholds regional interests within the Indian framework, embodying true unity in diversity. It’s not about numbers; it’s about principles and courage to stand for what’s right. Congress will continue to fight for justice everywhere,” he said.
Siddaramaiah’s post came in reaction to the Assam CM taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi, saying that not even 2,000 people came to see Gandhi throughout his journey which extended more than 500 kilometers.
“Throughout the 500+ km journey, not even 2,000 people came to see him at one place. Please look at the video you have posted and count the number of people. Assam is with Ram and not with Ravana,” Sarma said in reaction to Siddaramaiah’s post sharing video clips of police trying to stop the Yatra at the Guwahati border.
An FIR was registered on Tuesday against Gandhi, party General Secretary KC Venugopal, National Students’ Union of India All India Congress Committee in-charge Kanhaiya Kumar and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.
“With reference to wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Congress members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals,” Sarma said in a post on X. The FIR was filed under several IPC sections, including those dealing with criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and rioting."
FEMIINWK4P_HJPMUPUTQGVR03E,Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury reason for alliance not working out in Bengal: TMC’s Derek O’Brien,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:15 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-reason-alliance-not-working-bengal-tmc-derek-obrien-9127397/,"Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien Thursday held West Bengal Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury responsible for an alliance not working out between the two parties in West Bengal.
The remark came a day after West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee announced that her party will fight the Lok Sabha polls “alone” in the state.
“Three reasons for the alliance not working in Bengal – Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury,” O’Brien told reporters here.
He also claimed that the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) had many detractors but only two — the BJP and Chowdhury — have repeatedly spoken out against the bloc.
The TMC leader further alleged that Chowdhury was working at the behest of the BJP.
“The voice is his, but the words are being dictated to him by the duo in Delhi. In the past two years, Adhir Chowdhury has spoken the language of the BJP. Not once has he raised the issue of Bengal being deprived of central funds,” O’Brien said.
“He even endorses ED actions in Bengal when they are against Trinamool. He holds special press conferences to belittle Mamata Banerjee and barely speaks against BJP leaders,” he added.
Asked whether the TMC remains part of the INDIA grouping, O’Brien said, “After the general elections, if the Congress does its job and defeats the BJP on a substantial number of seats, the Trinamool Congress will very much be a part of the front that believes and fights for the Constitution and plurality.” Banerjee’s sudden comments on Wednesday forced the Congress to adopt a conciliatory approach with party general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA “cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee”.
O’Brien, however, stressed that the TMC has “turned the page”.
The Trinamool Congress had been upset with Chowdhury’s repeated attacks on Banerjee. The Congress leader recently called the West Bengal chief minister an “opportunist” and said that his party would fight the polls alone. The party has also been upset over seat-sharing talks with the Congress. The ruling party in West Bengal had offered two Lok Sabha seats to the Congress for the elections. Later, sources said the party could have accommodated another seat.
After Banerjee’s announcement that her party has decided to go solo in the state, party sources said there had been no communication with the Congress for at least the past two weeks on seat-sharing.
During the December 19 meeting of the INDIA bloc in Delhi, the TMC had given a December 31 deadline for finalising seat-sharing arrangements. The party later agreed to wait a bit longer as the Congress’ National Alliance Committee was holding meetings at the beginning of January.
However, the TMC’s offer of two seats did not go down well with the Congress, which said it was too little."

Once the Governor’s convoy reached the university gate, members of Trinamool Chhatra Parishad (TMCP), the students’ wing of Trinamool Congress, and the All India Democratic Students’ Organisation (AIDSO) allegedly showed black flags to him and shouted “go back” slogans. The police, however, helped the convoy go inside the campus and  the protestors were kept at a distance.
“The Governor is responsible for the deteriorating infrastructure in Calcutta University as the institute does not have a full-term permanent Vice Chancellor. The Governor is not serious about appointing a permanent V-C which is the need of the hour,” said a protesting TMCP member.
The AIDSO, the students’ wing of SUCI (Communist), also made similar demands apart from scrapping the New Education Policy 2020.  CU has been functioning without a permanent V-C since March last year and the Higher Education minister has opposed the appointment of Santa Dutta as the officiating V-C by Governor Bose, who is the ex-officio chancellor of the state university.
The students also held placards which read “Go back Governor”, and “we demand permanent vc for CU”."

Speaking at the Election Commission of India’s National Voters’ Day celebrations here, Meghwal recalled the reforms over the years – reduction of the voting age from 21 years to 18 years and the introduction of the voter ID card.

He told Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar that during election campaigns, people often complain of having their names struck off the electoral rolls or they find it difficult in getting enrolled.
“There is discussion on two-three issues right now. There should be a single voter list. Rajiv Kumarji, I want to tell you that this is a big issue. When we go for elections, people say their names have been struck off or they are having trouble in adding their names. If we move towards a single voter list, it will be a big step in that direction,” he said.
As of now, the Election Commission of India (ECI) prepares the electoral rolls for the Lok Sabha and state elections through the Chief Electoral Officers of states and Union Territories, while the State Election Commissions prepare the electoral rolls for the local body elections.
The proposal of the government has been under consideration since 2020 when the Prime Minister’s Office had organised a meeting with the Law Ministry and EC officials to discuss the matter.
The Law Ministry in 2023 then set up a high-level committee under President Ram Nath Kovind to look into the ways to hold simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha, Assemblies, municipal corporations and panchayats. Among the terms of reference of the committee is to “examine and recommend the modalities of use of a single electoral roll”. The committee is in the process of holding consultations with stakeholders and is yet to submit its report.
Earlier during the National Voters’ Day event, the CEC said the Law Ministry had always been supportive towards the ECI and in Meghwal’s tenure in particular, the ECI’s proposals had been supported with “responsiveness”. He added that the EC’s attempt in 2024 would be to ensure peaceful elections, with less “shor-sharaba” (noise) and “clutter”.
During the event, which marks the anniversary of the foundation of the ECI on January 25, 1950, President Droupadi Murmu awarded election officials for their performance in 2023. Chhattisgarh won the award for the Best State in Election Management in 2023.
In his address, Election Commissioner Anup Chandra Pandey said the electors had increased from 17 crore in 1952 to 96 crore now, of which 47 crore are women. He said the ECI had intensified “vulnerability mapping” to increase participation from the vulnerable sections of society.
Election Commissioner Arun Goel said the ECI had recently introduced the concept of “most convenient” location for setting up polling stations, particularly in urban areas. He said this would lead to higher turnout. For example, polling stations are being set up in community centres of multi-storied residential societies, making it more convenient for electors to cast their votes."

Paresh was caught by a team of the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Vadodara city police, officials said.
Paresh was booked in the case on January 20 after police investigations revealed that he was in charge of handling day-to-day operations at the Lake Zone boating facility without being a partner in the firm M/s Kotia Projects that was contracted by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to redevelop the lake.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Yuvrajsinh Jadeja, who is a supervising officer of the SIT, told The Indian Express that Paresh had been detained from outside Vadodara. “Paresh Shah and Gopal Shah will be arrested formally during the day on Thursday. We are also expecting the Crime Branch officials to arrive with Gopal Shah, who was apprehended on Wednesday in Chhattisgarh, to arrive in Vadodara soon. Paresh Shah was nabbed by the SOG from outside Vadodara,” Jadeja said. Nine of the 20 accused booked in the case are now in the police net.
After the news of Paresh landing in police custody became public, videos of Paresh at the spot soon after the boat accident on January 18 became viral in Vadodara. In the videos, Paresh is seen at the spot while the fire department carries out the initial rescue operation. A video of Paresh evading questions from the media also became viral.
Paresh is said to be a relative of Gopal, a former town development officer of the VMC and a partner of M/s Kotia Projects. On Wednesday, the SIT had caught Gopal from Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
Gopal, an architect by profession, ran a firm named Planning Solution and allegedly joined M/s Kotia Projects as a consultant partner in 2016, which helped the developer to qualify for the bid of developing the Motnath lake in Harni in the second attempt of the bidding process after being initially disqualified by VMC for “having no experience” in the field."

The sentencing of Harmanpreet Singh, 30, and Kulbir Kaur, 43, who forced the victim, their cousin, to provide labour and services at their store, including working as the cashier, preparing food, cleaning and managing store records, for May 8. They face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, up to five years of supervised release, a fine of up to USD 250,000 and mandatory restitution for the forced labour charge.
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said the Singh couple exploited the victim’s trust and his desire to attend school in the United States, and then inflicted physical and mental abuse against him, all so they could keep him working for their profit.
Singh and Kaur used various coercive means, including confiscating the victim’s immigration documents and subjecting the victim to physical abuse, threats of force and other serious harm and, at times, degrading living conditions to compel him to work extensive hours for minimal pay, said the Department of Justice.
“These defendants engaged in an egregious bait-and-switch, luring the victim with false promises of an education in the United States and instead subjecting him to grueling hours, degrading living conditions and a litany of mental and physical abuse,” said US Attorney Jessica D Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia.
“Forced labour and human trafficking are abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society, and I am grateful to our team of prosecutors, agents and support staff for ensuring that justice was done in this case,” Aber said.
In 2018, the defendants enticed the victim, then a minor, to travel to the United States with false promises of helping enrol him in school, federal prosecutors alleged. After arriving in the United States, the defendants took his immigration documents and immediately put him to work.
They also left the victim at the store to sleep in a back office for days at a time on multiple occasions, limited his access to food, refused to provide medical care or education, used surveillance equipment to monitor the victim both at the store and in their home, refused his requests to return to India and made him overstay his visa.
According to court documents, the evidence further showed that Singh pulled the victim’s hair, slapped and kicked him when he requested his immigration documents back and tried to leave, and on three different occasions threatened the victim with a revolver for trying to take a day off and for trying to leave."

More than two years after Independence, and after nearly a century of nationalist struggle, India was finally a sovereign, democratic republic, free to chart its own course into the future.
On the eve of the 75th Republic Day, we remember the chilly January morning in 1950 when India became a republic.
Although British rule in India ended on August 15, 1947, India was yet to sever all ties with the Empire. For over two years after Independence, India remained a British dominion, governed by the British-era Government of India Act of 1935, and officially still owing allegiance to the Crown.
All this changed on January 26, 1950. On that day, the newly drafted Constitution of India came into effect, replacing the Act of 1935 as the supreme governing document of the country. Dr Rajendra Prasad began his first term as the President of India, replacing the British monarch as the ceremonial head of the state.
And finally, the Constituent Assembly, which had drafted the constitution over a period of roughly three years, became the Parliament of India until the first general elections would take place in 1951-52.
Military parades are symbolic expressions of state authority and prestige. During the British Raj, royal parades and processions were common occurrences, projecting colonial power to Indians and the world.
The new republic decided to continue with this tradition — and reclaim it for Indians. Thus, since 1950, Republic Day celebrations have been headlined by a military parade in New Delhi, which has become ever grander and more spectacular over the years.
The 1950 parade was held in the Irwin Ampitheatre opposite the Purana Qila, now known as the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium. President Dr Rajendra Prasad inspected the parade, and Indonesia President Sukarno was the chief guest.
According to historian Ramachandra Guha, more than 3,000 men of the armed forces marched in front of the president. (India After Gandhi, 2007). The parade saw participation of marching contingents from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Delhi Police.
After inspection of the parade by the President, the Artillery, deployed behind the East Stand, fired a 31-gun salute, in three instalments. Between these instalments, the parade fired a ‘Feu-de-joie’ or the fire of joy — a formal celebratory gunfire — thrice, and then gave three ‘jais’ to the President of the Republic. Indian Air Force’s Liberator planes flew overhead, to cap the spectacle.
After the last massed bands had marched past, the President’s horse-drawn carriage entered the stadium, flanked by the President’s Bodyguard on horses (a tradition which continues till date). After the Bodyguard saluted the President, Dr Prasad entered his carriage and headed back to Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhawan).
Describing the day’s events, Guha wrote: “Gandhi’s India was announcing itself as a sovereign nation-state.”
While January 26 was indeed a day of celebrations, the leaders of the nascent country knew that they had a hard task ahead. As Dr B R Ambedkar, chairman of the Constituent Assembly’s drafting committee, remarked in his final Constituent Assembly speech on November 26, 1949:
“On the 26th of January 1950, we are going to enter into a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality… We must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy which this Assembly has so laboriously built up.”"

Ambassadors of both countries have also been asked to return to their posts by Jan. 26, the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement. Iran’s foreign ministry confirmed that Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian would visit on Monday, and said its ambassador would resume duties in Islamabad on Friday.
Pakistan had recalled its ambassador to Tehran and had not allowed his counterpart to return to Islamabad, as well as cancelling all high-level diplomatic and trade engagements.
“At the invitation of Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani, Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, will undertake a visit to Pakistan on 29 January 2024,” a Pakistani foreign office statement said.
The tit-for-tat strikes by the two countries were the highest-profile cross-border intrusions in recent years and have raised alarm about wider instability in the region since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted on Oct. 7. The two Muslim nations have had a history of rocky relations, but the intrusions amounted to the highest level of attacks in decades.
Islamabad said it hit bases of the separatist Baloch Liberation Front and Baloch Liberation Army, while Tehran said its missiles struck militants from the Jaish al Adl (JAA) group. The militant groups operate in an area that includes Pakistan’s southwestern province of Balochistan and Iran’s southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province. Both regions are restive, mineral-rich and largely underdeveloped.
Iran said the strikes in a border village on its territory killed nine people, including four children. Pakistan said the Iranian attack had killed two children."

Stating that his government was inspired by the concept, Kejriwal said it had sought to work on 10 principles of Ram Rajya —ranging from free ration to the poor and shelter to the homeless to free electricity, water, education, health, bus travel for women and pilgrimages to the elderly.
“We believe in establishing a governance system where everyone has equal rights and opportunities, and everyone lives with love towards each other,” Kejriwal said on the eve of Republic Day celebrations at the Chhatrasal Stadium.
“On 22nd January this year, Shri Ram Lalla was consecrated in Ayodhya, and this is a moment of pride for the country and the world. On one hand, we ought to worship Lord Shri ‘Ram Chandra’, on the other we should take inspiration from his life… it teaches us lessons of love and sacrifice,” Kejriwal said.
Recalling episodes from Lord Ram’s life and quoting couplets from religious texts dedicated to him, Kejriwal underlined how he willingly chose exile over governing his kingdom out of a sense of sacrifice.
His era, the Chief Minister said, defined as ‘Ram Rajya’, was the one underlined by happiness, peace and prosperity, which also finds mention in the Ramayana.  “In Ram Rajya no one suffers from physical, or spiritual pains, and everyone lives in harmony abiding by their ‘dharma’ (duties)…Today we are drawing inspiration from the concept of ‘Ram Rajya’ to run our government…we have formulated it on the 10-point principles,” he said.
The AAP-Delhi government, Kejriwal said, sought to ensure that no one should die of hunger, which it was ensuring through free ration to the poor and night shelters for the homeless. “I’m not claiming that we have attained 100% of our goals, but we’re trying…children of the poor get the best education in Delhi. They are getting equal education, now rich people are withdrawing their children from private schools and getting them admitted in Delhi’s government schools,” he said.
Free power, water, pilgrimages for the elderly in addition to enhanced pension for them, the CM said, were all components of ‘Ram Rajya’. “We take elderly people on pilgrimage…we will try to take as many trains as possible to Ayodhya,” he said, adding that there had been many requests for it following the consecration ceremony earlier this week.
“If you are a doctor or a sanitation worker, you must work hard, honestly, patriotically, work for the society and at the same time worship Lord Ram. I have full faith that if we follow the path shown by Lord Ram, then no power can stop India from becoming the number one country in the world,” he said."
G41HBT5TM1_FJO9VUQNGQJTFOD,Meet Punjab’s Drone Didis – rural women set for career as drone pilots,Divya Goyal,"Updated: January 23, 2024 11:32 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-drone-didi-women-career-9121047/,"“Bina aadmi ton uddan vaali vastu (an object that flies unmanned),” is all that Kiranpal Kaur (34) knew about drones until just a few months ago.
Now a trained drone pilot, Kiranpal, from Sekha village in Punjab’s Barnala district, describes the feeling when she successfully flew a drone for the first time as like having “a little part of the world, which I owned and controlled, in my hands”.
“I have never travelled in a plane, but it felt like I was flying one. It gave me confidence that I could achieve anything. It was all in my hands,” said Kiranpal, who studied until class 10.
Soon, she will be taking her drone and travelling across her district in an e-vehicle to spray fertilisers and pesticides in agricultural fields under the NAMO Drone Didi Scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November last year.
The scheme was launched after Modi, during his Independence Day speech, had announced a plan to train at least 15,000 ‘Drone Didis’ across the country, ushering a tech revolution in agriculture by spraying fields using drones. The scheme aims to reduce labour costs, as well as save time and water, apart from empowering women in rural areas.
Modi had announced that the goal was to create at least two crore Lakhpati Didis (rural women earning in lakhs) in the country through self-help groups (SHGs).
Kiranpal is among the first batch of 300 women to have been trained by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), the largest manufacturer of chemical fertilisers in the country. The cooperative will also be providing drones and e-vehicles to the trained women pilots free of cost.
For Kiranpal, the journey was not easy. Her husband is a construction worker who earns around Rs 500-700 a day, and she herself had been earning around Rs 3,000 a month from selling homemade pickles through a self-help group.
Nearly a month ago, she left her quaint village for the training centre in Gurgaon’s Manesar, along with her three-month-old child.
“When we reached the training centre, I realised everything was in English, including theory classes and the notes they had provided. I am only a 10th pass, and it was almost 18 years since then that I was touching books again,” she said.
She also said that back in her village, questions were raised about whether she would have to compromise on her motherly duties. However, she said that once she got back from training, having become a drone pilot, there was a massive sense of pride.
“Before practically handling a drone, we first had to clear theory. Our trainers were extremely cooperative, and they helped us in translating the notes in Hindi and Punjabi. Once I cleared the theory exam, there was no looking back. Now, when we have returned after successful training and a certificate in hand, everyone is feeling proud that the word ‘pilot’ has been attached to my name,” she said.
“Now, the word ‘pilot’ seems like a trophy I have earned in life,” she added.
Women from various different backgrounds and educational qualifications, from those who stopped at class 10 to those who have postgraduate degrees, applied to be trained as drone pilots. They were contacted by a network of organisations working in the agricultural sector at village-level, including GT Bharat, Farmer Producers Organisation (FPO) and others, who further connected them to IFFCO.
Their selection process included interviews, in which they were tested for basic knowledge regarding farming.
Among the first to be selected from Punjab was Jaswinder Kaur Dhaliwal (46) from Rattian village of Moga district, who has studied up to class 12 and is involved with at least 15 women’s self-help groups in her village.
“Before training, I had only seen drones clicking pictures and recording videos during Punjabi weddings,” Jaswinder said.
She said that after clearing theory, the trainers showed them how to pilot a drone on computers, before eventually giving them control of an actual drone.
“A drone takes just around seven minutes to spray one acre. There are three zones – red, yellow, and green – to look out for when flying drones, and we cannot fly in the red zones. There is a tank fitted on the drone, which we fill with 10 litres of water and one litre of fertiliser or pesticide,” she explained.
Preeti Sharma, a 20-year-old from Moga’s Sosan village who has done a diploma course on computers, used to work as a receptionist earning Rs 6,000 a month, before her father, a peon at a cooperative bank, motivated her to get trained as a drone pilot
“I had seen on the Internet that drones were used in fields in foreign countries. I was scared that it will crash when I handled it for first time, but later we realised it wasn’t that tough. Now, all the farmers in my village are waiting for me to get the drone and start spraying their fields” she said.
Mandeep Kaur Pannu (40), who grows cucumbers on her five-acre field with her husband in Ludhiana’s Barundi village, said she knew drones were making in-roads into agriculture.
“We already work with FPO to help small farmers and provide them seeds, pesticides, urea, etc. So, we thought if we get a drone, it will benefit a lot of farmers in our area. I felt my college days were back when we studied for the theory exam till late at night,” she said.
The scheme also caught the interest of women such as Zeenat Sharma (37), from Nagraon in Himachal Pradesh’s Mandi. Her family owns apple orchards and her husband has a chemical fertiliser/pesticide business. A postgraduate in microbiology and a former teacher, Sharma did not face any issues during drone training.
“We spray fertilisers such as DAP and urea in apple orchards, too, and since orchards are on hilly slopes, there are a lot of issues in hiring manual labour. I have know-how of apple farming since childhood, so I wanted to learn something new related to it,” she said.
“What amazed and inspired me was the determination of rural women from Punjab for whom trainers first translated entire lectures into Hindi and then they would further translate them to Punjabi,” she said.
According to the estimates prepared by IFFCO, the scheme is expected to generate an income of at least Rs 7 lakh per annum for the Drone Didis, even if they work for just 200 days in a year and manage to spray 20 acres a day. They would be charging farmers Rs 300 per acre or more.
“Drone Didis will earn Rs 12 lakh a year if they spray 20 acres for 200 days at the cost of Rs 300 per acre. They will easily earn (a profit of) Rs 7 lakh if we exclude the cost of drone maintenance and if they hire an assistant to drive the vehicle (on which they travel to farms),” said Yogendra Kumar, marketing head, IFFCO.
He said the trained women drone pilots would be provided with a medium class drone that has a 25,000 MAH battery – enough for a flight of 20-25 minutes – as well as four extra batteries and a three-wheeler e-vehicle that will also include a genset and space to carry fertilisers and pesticides.
“The entire setup, being given for free, would otherwise cost Rs 13-14 lakh for each woman,” he said, adding that the plan is to buy 2,500 drones for the country in a phased manner. The women are expected to get the drones by January 26 or earlier.
The first batch of women trained by IFFCO in association with Gurgaon-based Drone Destination, a training company, include 22 from Punjab, 20 from Haryana, 24 from Rajasthan, 29 from Maharashtra, four from Himachal Pradesh, 18 from Gujarat, 23 from Madhya Pradesh, 28 from Uttar Pradesh, two from Kerala, 10 from Bihar, three from Uttarakhand, 20 from Karnataka, nine from Assam, 11 from Telangana, 16 from Tamil Nadu, and 13 from Andhra Pradesh, among others.
The Centre’s Department of Fertilisers said in a statement that while the traditional manual method used to spray fields uses 100-200 litres of water per acre, the same could be done with just 10 litres of water using a drone."
G6Y0RXFXLF_QRWNUKF6QP7D314,Express View on antibiotics: The right treatment,_,"Updated: January 22, 2024 07:18 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-antibiotics-the-right-treatment-9120832/,"The Centre has done the right thing in asking doctors to be more responsible when they prescribe antibiotics. The Union Health Ministry has asked physicians to write down the exact reasons for advising patients to use these medicines. It has also asked pharmacists to not dispense antimicrobials without a prescription. The country has had a policy to prevent the overuse of antibiotics for close to a decade. However, the use of such medicines is still not monitored by the government. A Lancet study in 2022 noted that “India consumes a large volume of broad-spectrum antibiotics that should ideally be used sparingly”. Antibiotic overuse is the primary reason for bugs developing resistance to these medicines. That is why patients with severe diseases like tuberculosis are increasingly not responding to the first line of treatment.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics target a wide variety of bacteria and are antidotes to serious infections. However, anecdotal evidence shows that doctors tend to err on the side of caution and prescribe these medicines without diagnosing whether an infection is viral or bacterial. They also advise antibiotics to prevent secondary infections even when the threat of such a malady is remote.
Individual doctors, though, are only one part of the problem. Medical protocols require hospitals to have a policy for rational use of antibiotics — this is important because studies show that these healthcare facilities are major breeding grounds for antimicrobial resistance. But only a few big hospitals follow this mandate.
A recent study by the National Centre for Disease Control revealed that three out of four patients who went to a tertiary care centre were prescribed an antibiotic, often to prevent an infection rather than to cure it. The study conducted between November 2021 and April 2022 under the National Programme of Antimicrobial Containment found only a 10 percentage point difference in antibiotic use between intensive care units that have the sickest patients and the other wards.
Given the heterogeneity of the country’s healthcare settings, a one-size-fits-all approach might not be apt to regulate antibiotic use. In 2013, the Chennai Declaration by a group of concerned doctors suggested strict control of the use of such medicines in areas with relatively well-provisioned medical facilities and a more liberal system based on the strict monitoring of select oral antimicrobials in other areas. Another school of experts believes that medical experts must create more awareness within their community. Some others advocate that healthcare centres must have more microbiologists to guide doctors. The government’s nudge to doctors should spur such conversations. The medical community must now step in to tackle the problem in all its dimensions."

The latest measures — after three major attacks on Indian security forces in the region last year — stall the earlier plan to reduce the strength of Rashtriya Rifles (RR) battalions from six to four companies. RR is the counter-terrorism force deployed in J&K.
According to sources, over three brigades of additional troops are being inducted in the sector from various reserve and strike corps formations. A brigade comprises approximately 3,500 personnel.
The additional deployment will not increase the density of troops in the area and fill the voids left by the withdrawal of an RR force in 2021, but will strengthen Road Opening Parties (ROP) for better protection against ambushes. An ROP comprises troops responsible for safe passage of military vehicles.
“An enhanced deployment is aimed at putting pressure on the terrorists and increasing the likelihood of contact,” said a source.
The recent attacks on Army vehicle convoys have led to a recalibration of the ROP and an increase in the number of security pickets.
In another major change, 48 RR – the unit which was deployed in the sector – will be sent to the Corps Battle School in Sarol to retrain and regroup under a new commanding officer.
As reported by The Indian Express, three officers — the brigade commander, commanding officer of the unit and company commander —  were moved out after three civilians were allegedly tortured to death during questioning. The civilians had been picked up for questioning after four soldiers were killed in a militant attack on an Army convoy in Poonch on December 21.
Additionally, increased use of satellite imagery and more helicopter and drone sorties by the latest Israeli Heron Mk 2 alongside other smaller UAVs are being carried out to strengthen surveillance of the Rajouri-Poonch area.
THE Additional deployment comes in the wake of high-impact terror incidents in the area. According to the Army, 20 soldiers were killed in the Rajouri-Poonch belt in the last three years, while seven were killed in Kashmir.
Last week, Army Chief General Manoj Pande had said the security situation in the Rajouri-Poonch belt was a cause for concern. “With the situation in the Valley getting normal, this is one area our adversaries have been active in, in terms of abetting terrorism, encouraging proxy tanzeems to operate,” he had said.
He had said terrorism was wiped out from the area in 2003, and the region saw peace till 2017-18. But, in the last three years, while seven soldiers were killed in Kashmir, 20 were killed in ambushes in the Rajouri-Poonch belt.
He had said the Army’s focus was on strengthening the existing intelligence network, including human and technical intelligence, in coordination with other agencies, and outreach to the local population.
Speaking about changes in troop deployment in the region, Gen Pande had said the Army has increased deployment in these areas and reoriented some units which were operating there.
As reported by The Indian Express, the Army has launched Operation Sarvashakti in the region – on the lines of Operation Sarpvinash – to flush out militants/ terrorists. As per sources, the region has more foreign terrorists than local militants."
GD6KIAV4B8_3MMNBLZWCTWIWA2,Danish Sait dubs Mohanlal’s Malaikottai Vaaliban as ‘mind-blowing cinema’; recalls struggling with loneliness on the film’s set,Anandu Suresh,"January 23, 2024 11:04 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/malayalam/danish-sait-dubs-mohanlal-malaikottai-vaaliban-as-mind-blowing-cinema-recalls-struggling-with-loneliness-on-the-films-set-9120400/,"An RJ-turned-comedian-turned-TV host-turned-content creator-turned-actor; however, one thing Danish Sait has not turned into is unoriginal. This is precisely why you see his face pretty much everywhere these days, from Instagram and Royal Challengers Bangalore’s official social media handles to the Koffee With Karan couch.
But, when The Indian Express caught up with him in Kochi, he was actively promoting his new avatar — a role he has high hopes for and can’t wait for people to watch. Marking his debut in the Malayalam film industry, Danish is playing a key role in Lijo Jose Pellissery’s period fantasy film Malaikottai Vaaliban, starring Mohanlal in the lead. Set to hit the screens on January 25, 2024, Malaikottai Vaaliban is one of the most anticipated Indian films of the year.
“It’s cinema,” Danish enthusiastically declares about the LJP directorial. “In all honesty, everything in Malaikottai Vaaliban is absolutely mind-blowing.”
“I remember a particular instance during our filming in Pokhran, approximately a month and a half into our shooting journey from Jaisalmer. I was nearing a point of mental breakdown due to the loneliness. The shoot was physically and mentally demanding and I’m not saying this just for myself; it was a challenging experience for everyone involved. Being away from my family for an extended period and the impracticality of our families visiting, added to the difficulty. We were shooting in an old fort. So, I approached Lijo and shared my mental struggles. He acknowledged it and invited me to meet him later that evening.”
“I later visited his room, where he showed me the rough edit of the first 10 minutes of the film. I went back feeling energised. I called my wife and told her that though I was feeling very down, those visuals showed me what I was working towards. I realised this was not vanilla but a black swan event. It’s a once-in-a-generation experience, stunning, and unlike anything I’ve ever seen. With the release of the trailer, everyone is buzzing about the visuals — the very same visuals that uplifted me.”
“Every person involved in this film, both in front of and behind the camera, has contributed equally to the hard work. Despite our diverse backgrounds and origins, we collaborated diligently on this project. We all placed our trust in Lijo,” he adds.
Reflecting on his decision to join the movie, Danish Sait mentions that, prior to Malaikottai Vaaliban, he had never encountered a more nuanced character brief. “It was an 8-10-slide PowerPoint presentation converted to PDF that was sent to me. It included references for me to watch, details about the character and a comprehensive overview of the character’s journey, among other things.”
“Yes, I’ve done stuff digitally, I’m available online, I make videos, and so on, and I am aware of what my primary profession is. But when you are switching to this genre, which is drama, you’re not performing for just 60 seconds or a minute or three. Here, you are performing in a film where you have to keep growing. There’s an arc, a fall, a peak, a trough and more. Sometime in 2021, I had already begun envisioning stepping into the space of drama.”
“I have always been mesmerised by Bob Odenkirk, who played Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul. Odenkirk’s book Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama detailing his journey from sketch comedy to drama and how he got into the character of Saul Goodman, profoundly impacted me. It made me realise this was a path I wished to pursue. So, Lijo coming into my life felt like a godsend.”
On working with Mohanlal and sharing the screen with him for the first time, Danish explains that establishing rapport with the Malayalam superstar was effortless and organic. “From my experience of working with icons like Virat Kohli, Puneeth Rajkumar, AB de Villiers, etc, and meeting them at very close quarters, I have noticed that the responsibility for creating a comfortable atmosphere doesn’t fall on the person interacting with them; instead, it, unfortunately, rests with them. And I have realised that all these people are icons because they make you comfortable,” he observes.
“The first time I met Mohanlal was on the first day I landed in Jaisalmer. I first met Lijo and informed him that I had reported for duty. Then I saw Mohanlal walking out after giving a shot, and I went up to him and introduced myself, and he said, ‘Welcome to the family.’ That was enough because it was so warm. Later, after he watched some rushes of the film, Mohanlal reached out to commend me, pinpointing specific instances,” Danish says, emphasising that these interactions, along with similar supportive gestures from cinematographer Madhu Neelakandan, significantly contributed to boosting his confidence.
“I will tell you this with full confidence: I was the most underqualified guy to be on that set. Everyone else involved has excelled in some aspect of filmmaking. Some have won state awards, while others have received national awards. Despite their achievements, they were all very chill and generous. Also, working with such large set pieces and numerous artistes, I didn’t want to be that guy who messed up everything. When working on such a scale, if one person makes a mistake, the entire process has to be reset. Therefore, I made a concerted effort to avoid being the cause of any such setbacks.”
Recalling that he never returned to his vanity van after completing his scenes or during breaks, Danish shares that he devoted all his time on the sets, closely watching the different facets of the creation of Malaikottai Vaaliban. He pondered, “Where else on Earth and for what cost would you get to see, up close, the making of a film by one of India’s most talented directors? So, I remained seated, observing every detail of his actions. The entire process and the film itself are dream-like. I will be eternally grateful to Lijo for the rest of my life for this opportunity because he saw something in me that I hadn’t seen in myself,” he concludes."

“We made kheer, dal and roti… the way we make langar during gurpurab. The same way we did on this occasion as well. Harphool Singh Mann was very kind as he gave all the space in his house to cook the langar,” Narayan Chaudhary, a farmer, told The Indian Express.
Balraj Singh, president of the gurdwara’s management committee, was seen serving langar to the residents sitting in pangat in the village’s common area also called sathh.
“Though the village has five temples, a common programme was organised at the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, where the entire village gathered. Satsang was organised in the open area of sathh. The langar was started at 12 pm. Our gurdwara and temple committees jointly decided the menu of the langar,” said Rajinder Kumar, who was serving the langar.
Serving kheer to devotees, Gurnam Singh, secretary of the gurdwara management committee, said, “God is one. So our purpose is to do sewa in any form. We live in the village in complete harmony.”
“We are always together in all festivals or special occasions,” Balraj added.
Chanan Singh Mann, who also did langar sewa, said the entire village had contributed funds for the programme.
“We are together in our thick and thin. Political ideologies do not affect our harmony,” Surinder Kumar, a schoolteacher said of the village of 1,200 houses.
The occasion was celebrated together in neighbouring Kallar Khera village, also with a Hindu majority, as well.
Mahinder Kumar Kulchania, block president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Rajewal, said, “Though ours is a Hindu-majority village, we celebrate every occasion together. On Monday, a yagya was organised in the Baba Ramdev temple and kirtan was held in a common area where LED screens were put up to watch the live telecast of the ceremony. Our farmers of nearly 30 villages of the Khuian Sarwar block came to be part of this big day irrespective of their religious beliefs.”
Joginder Singh, sarpanch of Kaller Khera, said, “Most of the residents belong to the Sikh and Bagri communities. We have a gurdwara and four to five temples. The entire village is one unit on every occasion. Each one of us contributed in langar sewa and we all ate together.”
A Ram Darbar of new idols of Ram, Lakshman and Sita was unveiled at the Baba Ramdev temple.
Giddranwali village has a population of about 6,000 and nearly half of them are Hindus and the rest Sikhs.
“A common programme was organised in the Hanuman mandir of the village and villagers participated wholeheartedly,” said Darshan Singh, who attended the programme. “Such programmes have been organised in many villages of Punjab. Religion teaches us to respect each other’s faith and live in harmony. Political ideologies and religious beliefs should not be mixed.”
Sandeep Kumar, another resident of Giddranwali, said, “In the evening most houses will do a deepmala. On the langar, our committee had a meeting with the village gurdwara committee. Dal-sabzi, roti and kheer were made and served together.”"

The CPI(M)-ruled state did not declare any holiday for government offices and educational institutions to mark the temple ceremony on January 22. However, Sri Gopalakrishna high school at Kudlu in Kasaragod declared a holiday for its students.
Taking a serious note of it, General Education Minister V Sivankutty sought a report from the director general of public education. The minister, in his Facebook post, said the director general was told to submit a report within 24 hours on why the particular school had announced a holiday despite no official direction from the general education department.
The school at Kudlu is situated at Madhur panchayat, which is ruled by the BJP. Of the 20 wards in the panchayat, 13 are represented by the BJP.
Sources said the headmaster of the school was forced to declare a holiday on Monday due to the “pressure from the BJP-ruled panchayat and a section of parents” of the students. The school had sought a permission from the department for declaring a holiday on Monday, but the district-level authorities at the general education department had rejected the demand, said the sources.
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had declined to observe the Pran Pratishtha ceremony as a state event. “As those who pledged to preserve and protect our Constitution, let us reaffirm our commitment to its secular character by declining to participate in the event and upholding our constitutional responsibilities,’’ he said."
GFH85RL83J_93BDDH2UP72TYVP,Today’s rulers have forgotten the concept of welfare state espoused by Mahatma: Congress’ Ramesh Chennithala,_,"January 26, 2024 14:25 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/welfare-state-mahatma-gandhi-ramesh-chennithala-9128950/,"Criticising the Modi Government and its policies, senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, who is in charge of the party’s Maharashtra affairs, said on Thursday that Mahatma Gandhi espoused the cause of a ‘welfare state’ which the incumbent government has forgotten.
“Mera Jeevan, Mera Sandesh… Bapu’s concept of the ideal life was in this mission statement. Behind this were hidden the five principles of truth, non-violence, humanity, justice and equality and the ‘values of democracy’ behind Indian Independence. Through this mission, Mahatma Gandhi had envisioned the concept of a welfare state but today’s rulers have forgotten about it. The rulers are misleading people by raising the pitch for Ram Rajya when the welfare state or Ram Rajya already existed in the country,” Chennithala said.
Chennithala was speaking at the prize distribution ceremony of the Mala Samajlele Babu contest in the city where he distributed the prizes. The contest was organised by Rajiv Gandhi Smarak Samiti and Pune City Secondary and Higher Secondary School Principals’ Association for students from Class 8 to Class 10.
Addressing the gathering, Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Nana Patole said, “The Gandhian ideology is not compulsion but is strength. Reading the essays of the winning students showed how effectively Gandhian thought has been ingrained in the students”.
Patole thanked the Rajiv Gandhi Samarak Samiti and the teachers for organising the essay competition.
Senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat also praised the students for writing the essay on Mahatma Gandhi. “A Class 9 student writes that the title Rashtrapita was bestowed on Mahatma Gandhi by Subhash Chandra Bose only shows that there was no dispute between them and is a befitting reply to those raking the issue of their differences,” said Patole.
On the occasion, Smarak Samiti president Gopal Tiwari and Association president Sujit Jagtap felicitated the dignitaries.
In his address, Gopal Tiwari said the essay on Mahatma Gandhi inspired students about India’s freedom struggle and patriotism. “The essay competition gave the students an opportunity to ponder over the way our freedom fighters fought for the country’s independence, the sacrifices they made, and the lives laid down… Several schools gave an overwhelming response to the competition,” he said."
GGSVLM6EBG_7WS47ZX8Z3MR884,‘Lord Ram has taken his seat in Ayodhya’: Ex-Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala sets 373-seat target for BJP,Parimal A Dabhi,"Updated: January 24, 2024 01:23 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/lord-ram-ayodhya-ex-karnataka-governor-vajubhai-vala-bjp-9124034/,"A day after the mega consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, BJP leaders on Tuesday raised the poll pitch in Gujarat and referred to “Ram Rajya” (the vision of an ideal state) as the party unveiled new central election offices for all 26 constituencies in the state in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections.
Inaugurating the Gandhinagar office in Ahmedabad’s Thaltej, where he also unveiled 25 other central election offices virtually, BJP chief JP Nadda exuded confidence that the party will secure a third straight win. In Rajkot, former Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala, while addressing the inauguration event, declared a “national target of 373 seats” in the Lok Sabha elections.
Invoking “Lord Ram”, Vala said, “Now what are you waiting for? Lord Ram has taken his seat in Ayodhya and to usher in Ram Rajya, we have to install Narendrabhai on the seat of Delhi…If your voice isn’t loud enough, it won’t do.” Vala, who vacated his Rajkot Assembly seat in 2001 for Modi to fight his first election, was addressing a meeting of party workers organised in the city for the inauguration of the BJP’s central election office for the Rajkot Lok Sabha seat.
The Rajkot Lok Sabha seat has been a BJP stronghold for nearly three and a half decades. Except for 2009, the party has maintained a stranglehold over the seat since 1989, winning it eight times. Vala, who was elected as the MLA from Rajkot seven times between 1985 and 2012, further asserted that nothing could hold back his party. “In 1967, the late Chiman Shukla was the lone MLA (of the Jan Sangh) in the Gujarat Assembly. From that, today, the number has swelled to 156. Similarly, in the Lok Sabha, we had only two members… From those two, we have reached (the figure of) 303 and don’t we want to make it 373 now?” he said. A resident of Rajkot, Vala had served as the state finance minister and the speaker of the Assembly before being appointed governor of Karnataka in 2014.
Meanwhile, in Ahmedabad, Nadda took a jibe at the Opposition over the issue of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Addressing the public meeting in Thaltej, the BJP chief said, “Congress leaders are asking us if we are trying to be champions of Lord Ram. I said that we are not trying to be champions, but yes, when you were creating hurdles in the creation of the Ram Temple, every BJP worker was chanting slogan — ‘Mera jivan kis kaam ka, kaam hain to Ram ke naam ka (What is the worth of my life, it is for the name of Ram)’.”
“So, it is our saubhagya (good luck)… we are not capitalising on it…Our ancestors have struggled for 500 years (for the temple)…When we were saying ‘Mandir wahi banayenge (We will build the temple there)’, you people used to tease us with ‘Tithi kab bataoge? (When will you tell the date?)’ So, now, we have told you the date and also registered it in the history,” Nadda added.
The BJP national president also accused the Opposition of indulging in “caste-based and vote bank politics”. “Narendrabhai has changed the definition of politics and he has changed the political culture of the country. When I say it, I do so not because he is our leader, but because for 70 years… Congress and other parties did politics based on caste and region. They did politics of dividing the country based on casteism and register gain for their families,” said Nadda.
“But, ever since Narendrabhai became PM of India, he has changed the definition of politics. Now, only that person will be able to do politics who goes to the people with his report card based on works done by him. Today, there will be politics of accountability and credibility. Today, people have decided to vote on the issue of the credibility of leadership. Today, (people have) begun to vote on the working style of a party and its works,” he added.
Nadda also lambasted leaders of Congress and I.N.D.I.A (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc for demanding caste census. “What were leaders of Congress and I.N.DI.A saying? They were demanding a caste census. They have nothing to do with caste. (It was) to do politics of taking votes based on caste census. The BJP has justified the caste census. But the PM has said that there are only four castes in India — GYAN. G for Gareeb (poor), Y for Yuva (youth), A for Annadata Kisan (farmer) and N for Narishakti (woman power)…The PM has united the country in the name of GYAN.”
Nadda also came down heavily on Congress and other allies of I.N.D.I.A for promoting dynastic politics. “These days, there is a lot of discussion about I.N.DI.A. They abuse Modi a lot…Their agenda is to get rid of Modi. And Modi talks about taking India forward and making it developed,” he said.
“There are three agendas of I.N.D.I.A. The first is to save the family. The second is to save property. And third is to escape allegations of corruption,” the BJP chief said. Former chief minister Vijay Rupani, who addressed the gathering along with Vala in Rajkot, also referred to the Ayodhya consecration ceremony. “Ram Rajya began yesterday and in the coming days, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Ram Rajya will prevail in the country. Even though no (Lok Sabha) candidate has been announced, party workers start working, inaugurate offices in all parliamentary seats in Gujarat —this is possible only in the BJP,” he said."
GIIQL4WA8G_0MZ7SWENLBVOMDC,Supreme Court issues notice on Uddhav Sena plea challenging Speaker’s refusal to disqualify Shinde MLAs,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 03:36 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-uddhav-sena-plea-challenging-speakers-refusal-to-disqualify-shinde-mlas-9122159/,"The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice on a plea by Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) challenging Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar’s decision recognising Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led faction as the real Shiv Sena and rejecting petitions seeking disqualification of MLAs of the faction.
A three-judge bench presided over by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud issued the notice that is returnable in two weeks. Initially, the bench, also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, wondered if the petitioners should first approach the high court.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the Thackeray faction, said that would mean that elections would be over by the time the plea was finally decided. He also pointed out that the matter involves the interpretation of the Supreme Court order and, therefore, the apex court would be appropriate to take it up.
The Shiv Sena (UBT) plea said the Speaker’s order is patently unlawful and perverse in nature, and sought a provisional stay on it. The plea sought interim relief to restrain the Shinde faction whip or any other leader from issuing any directions to the group of Shiv Sena (UBT) MLAs to avoid being forced to follow Bharat Gogawale, whom the Speaker recognised as the chief whip, or any other leader from the ruling Sena faction.
“Grant interim relief restraining the respondents, either through Sh. Bharat Gogawale or any other person, from issuing directions to the group of Shiv Sena MLAs led by Sh. Uddhav Thackeray; and Pass such other/further order(s) as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit and proper in the interest of justice,” the petition stated.
Moreover, the Sena (UBT) sought interim relief to restrain Shinde faction MLAs from attending the Assembly and to suspend their Assembly membership pending disposal of the present petitions.
“Grant interim relief restraining the Respondents from attending the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and suspend their membership of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly during pendency of the present petitions,” said the plea.
Narwekar, in his January 10 verdict, had said that as the Shinde faction was held to be the “real Shiv Sena” when the rival factions emerged, Sunil Prabhu (representing the Uddhav faction) “ceased to be the duly authorised whip from June 21, 2022” and Gogawale was validly appointed chief whip.
The Shinde faction had filed counter petitions seeking to disqualify the Uddhav Sena MLAs. Dismissing the plea, the Speaker had held that the grounds taken by them that the MLAs had “voluntarily given up” the party’s membership was “allegation” and no material was provided to substantiate it.
He had also held that the whip was not duly served to the Sena (UBT) faction. Narwekar held the whip issued by Gogawale on July 3 “didn’t contain words indicating that the said Whip, if not followed, would result in disqualification, so Gogawale’s plea must be rejected”."

Raja Mohan,"Updated: January 24, 2024 10:32 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-emmanuel-macron-meeting-india-france-challenges-9123612/,"Will there be anything more than pomp and show during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to India this week? To be sure, the two leaders could do with some uplifting pageantry. For Macron, struggling to reinvent his presidency, the enthusiastic reception in India would be a relief. The royal Rajputana welcome in Jaipur to Macron should look good back in France. The French presidency is Republican by nature but imperial in style.
For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is riding high at home, Macron’s visit marks continuing high-level political engagement from the Western chancelleries at a time when the liberal Anglo-Saxon media is going ballistic about his temple project and India’s retreat from secularism. It is always wrong, though, to conflate Western geopolitical interests with the media articulation of liberal ideology. In any case, you can’t be more secular than the French in the East or the West.
But what about substance? The two leaders had met last July when Modi travelled to Paris to participate in the Bastille Day celebrations. They had issued an ambitious new framework — Horizon 2047— to advance cooperation in many areas, including defence, space, and nuclear energy over the next quarter of a century.
My Dear Friend President @EmmanuelMacron, we eagerly look forward to receiving you as the Chief Guest at the 75th Republic Day. We will also celebrate India- France strategic partnership and shared belief in democratic values. Bientôt ! https://t.co/jvzvOY2NNa
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 22, 2023

It is not easy to top up that expansive agenda in six months. But it should certainly be possible to showcase progress in implementing the plans unveiled last July. What about the in-principle deals that were announced — on India buying 26 Rafale Marine aircraft and building three Scorpene submarines or the plans to transfer jet engine technology to India?
It is not clear if sufficient progress could have been made in the last six months either on these deals or on advancing defence industrial collaboration between the two countries. Unlike the US, the French executive is strong and can push through agreements purposefully. In Delhi, the Modi government does not see itself as a lame duck before the impending elections and can get things done until the last day of the current term.
Irrespective of the concrete outcomes of the visit, Modi and Macron have something to ponder over — the rapidly changing regional and international context since the two leaders met in Paris. That discussion could lend greater urgency to the implementation of their plans. It could also help the two leaders go beyond the traditional slogan of “strategic autonomy” that has long provided an ideological bond between Delhi and Paris.
Three new features stand out in the international situation. First, Ukraine’s counter-offensive against the Russian invasion has stalled, and the question of war and peace in the heart of Europe is back in debate. Many of the recent assumptions are up for reconsideration.
Second, the Middle East, which appeared quiet six months ago, is now on fire. The terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7 last year by Hamas and the massive retaliation by Israel have enhanced the prospects for a wider war in the region. The attacks on Red Sea shipping — one of the most important commercial arteries of the world — by the Houthis of Yemen are having a big effect on the global economy.
Third, the prospects of the return of Donald Trump to the White House have generated fears of renewed political chaos and radical redirection of policies in Washington. US domestic politics has become a major variable in international politics today.
Adapting to the new dynamic in the US will be a great challenge for Europe, which is worried about renewed hostility in Washington to the trans-Atlantic military alliance NATO. Equally worrisome for Europe is the Republican Party’s opposition to further military support for Ukraine and Trump’s presumed predilections for deal-making with Russia.
Although PM Modi has had a decent working relationship with Trump, Delhi will have challenges managing the many consequences of Trump’s regional and global policies.
Trump has promised to junk the focus on climate change, introduce across-the-board tariffs on all imports into the US, and demand a renegotiation of the terms of engagement with the allies and partners in Europe and Asia. His style of governance is also likely to generate problems for India.
Meanwhile, Trump’s America First policies will test two big ideas that have traditionally bound India and France. One is the idea of a multipolar world, and the other is the notion of strategic autonomy.
Well before Russia and China championed the idea of a multipolar world, France pushed for it in the late 1990s. Describing the US as an unconstrained “hyperpower”, French leaders called for coalitions to limit the dangers of American unilateralism. India, too, was anxious about the dangers of a unipolar world and the potential harm that the US could do to India. US activism on Kashmir and its declared objective of rolling back India’s nuclear weapons programme dispelled all doubts in Delhi. France, in contrast, suggested that isolating India made no sense and that it should be integrated into the global nuclear order. After India’s nuclear tests in 1998, Paris helped India deflect the non-proliferation pressures from the other members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia. More recently, France has extended rock-like support in the UNSC in blocking China’s attempt to internationalise the Kashmir dispute in 2019.
The notion of strategic autonomy is also dear to the foreign policy establishments in Delhi and Paris. To them, it has symbolised many things, including an independent foreign policy and maintaining political distance from the US.
But what sense do the two concepts make if the US retreats from an expansive international role in the increasingly likely second presidential term of Trump? It is not that American power has declined in real terms, but domestic politics could compel American retrenchment in many areas.
Defining their core foreign policy identities with reference to the geopolitical orientation of the US would make little sense for Delhi and Paris. The challenge for Modi and Macron does not lie in abstract conceptions like “mutipolarity” and “strategic autonomy”. It is about addressing the real questions at hand.
How to bring peace to Ukraine and arrange a stable security order in Central Europe? How can India contribute to European security? How can France boost India’s capabilities for deterring war in Asia? How to protect the SLOCs in the waters of West Asia in case the US, which is doing the heavy lifting now, pulls back? Trade through the Red Sea is more important for India and Europe than the US.
For nearly a century, the distant power, America, has underwritten the security of Eurasia. If the Trump phenomenon is about the US rethinking the costs and benefits of that role, the regional powers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia must step forward in addressing the current crises as well as develop long-term plans to stabilise Eurasia and its waters.

GU0TSVKUIB_FACEJWSOS44RVUI,Nitish Kumar as CM and two Deputy CMs from BJP: JD(U)-BJP govt starts taking shape,Santosh Singh,"Updated: January 27, 2024 08:48 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/nitish-kumar-cm-deputy-cms-bjp-jdu-9129202/,"With the BJP dropping clear hints of being open to tying up with the Janata Dal (United) again, Nitish Kumar looks set to return as Chief Minister at the head of the NDA government in Bihar. Nitish may have two Deputy CMs from the BJP, along similar lines as the post-2020 Assembly polls formula.
Nitish is most likely to tender his resignation and then stake a fresh claim to form the government with the NDA on Sunday. The BJP and JD(U) are likely to hold party meetings and then convene a meeting of the alliance to choose Nitish as its leader.
Sources said that the BJP would choose an Extremely Backward Class (EBC) leader for one of the Deputy CM posts, and that is likely to be Renu Devi. The Nonia leader was one of the Deputy CMs after the 2020 polls – becoming Bihar’s first woman to hold the post – till Nitish switched sides in August 2022 to the RJD-Congress alliance.
BJP insiders said that as of now there is no unanimity over the choice of the second Deputy CM. Among the leaders being considered are Sushil Kumar Modi, who has served a long stint as Nitish’s Deputy CM in the past and is currently a Rajya Sabha MP; current Leader of the Opposition Vijay Kumar Sinha; and Union Minister of State, Home Affairs, Nityanand Rai.
“The BJP is mulling over a combination of OBC-EBC or EBC-upper caste. While Renu Devi looks the obvious choice for an EBC face, the party has not yet finalised its second deputy CM,” a BJP leader said.
Sushil Modi and Sinha told The Indian Express that they would go with whatever decision the BJP’s central leadership takes in the interest of the party. “In politics, no gate shuts permanently,” Sushil Modi, who Thursday said he had no idea regarding Nitish’s plans, said. Sinha said: “We have collective leadership and we will go by what our top leaders decide.”
Asked if he was ready to accept Nitish as Bihar CM again, Union minister Giriraj Singh, a voluble BJP leader who Thursday ruled out the possibility, said: “I am a simple worker of the party.”
The JD(U)’s 45 MLAs and the BJP’s 78, along with the support of one Independent legislator, together make up 124 MLAs, more than the simple majority of 122 in the Bihar Assembly.
However, as per sources, the JD(U)’s current partner RJD may not let Nitish have an easy walk. With 79 of its own MLAs, plus the Congress and three Left parties, the RJD can count on 114 MLAs – just 8 short of a majority. Sources said the RJD might reach out to some JD(U) MLAs to stop Nitish from forming the government with the BJP.
Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) patron and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, who has 4 MLAs, denied that he was among NDA members in touch with the RJD. “I am very much with the NDA. I welcome Nitish Kumar,” Manjhi, whose ties with Nitish have been bitter since the JD(U) leader appointed and then summarily removed him as CM in nine months in 2014, said.
RJD national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Kumar Jha, however, strongly dismissed the possibility of his party trying to wean away MLAs to form the government. “We do not engage in such things. But we also want Nitish Kumar to clarify things. There is an atmosphere of uncertainty among the people as well,” he said.
JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said to this: “There is no confusion in state politics. Nitish Kumar is very much at the helm of affairs.”
Sources in the BJP said while the details had been finalised between Nitish and the party’s top central leadership, the ground had been laid by a survey conducted by it in Bihar for the Lok Sabha polls. The survey didn’t paint a very rosy picture for the BJP, indicating that the NDA tally in the state would be below 25 this time. In 2019, when the JD(U) was a part of it, the NDA had won 39 of Bihar’s 40 Lok Sabha seats.
While that survey was done before the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the BJP’s calculation was that even with the boost provided by this, it might add 7-8 seats at best in case the JD(U), RJD and Congress fought together.
The BJP’s target for this Lok Sabha election is bettering its 2019 tally, and it has been clear that this means mopping up as many seats as possible in states where it did well, as the South may see a slide in its numbers.
A source said that the final nitty-gritty was wrapped up in discussions “between the top leaders of the BJP – Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and party chief J P Nadda – and Nitish”.
Another leader admitted that while the BJP state unit had reservations about Nitish heading their alliance again, the JD(U) supremo was unlikely to have considered any proposal that did not include him returning as CM. “But the BJP was clear that it would have two deputy CMs,” the leader said, adding that in the party, everyone bows to the eventual decision of the top leadership.
In another sign of the fast-unravelling situation in Bihar, Nitish attended the customary high tea organised on Republic Day by the Governor, with his Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav absent. A JD(U) minister occupied the chair next to Nitish which was kept for Tejashwi, after removing his name plate.
To the beleaguered Opposition INDIA alliance, which first came together under Patna with Nitish’s blessings, JD(U) Bihar president Umesh Kushwaha had a message: “Though we are still with the INDIA bloc, it should introspect why things are going wrong.”"
GUAZCCRX12_P1R6A171J9DZZR5,‘Return excess salary credited to your account’: Karnataka govt issues letter to priest; withdraws after BJP calls it anti-Hindu,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 07:52 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/return-excess-salary-karnataka-govt-priest-bjp-anti-hindu-9125663/,"The Karnataka government faced criticism for serving a notice to Hiremagaluru Kannan, a priest of the Kodanda Ramachandra Swamy temple at Hiremagaluru in Chikkamagaluru, asking him to return an excess amount of Rs 4.74 lakh credited to his account between 2013 and 2022 as salary.
The letter was issued on December 2 by the Chikkamagaluru tahsildar but the issue came to light only on Tuesday and was withdrawn within hours.
According to the notice, the government had “inadvertently” released Rs 8.1 lakh as tasdik or honorarium to Kannan between 2013 and 2022 instead of the stipulated Rs 3.36 lakh. Thus, the tehsildar asked Kannan to return the excess amount of Rs 4.74 lakh.
The notice also added that during 2013-2022, the revenue earned from the temple stood at Rs 9.34 lakh but the expenditure was recorded at Rs 12.96 lakh. The amount included Kannan’s salary of Rs 7,500 per month.
The notice also mentioned that the temple falls under category C or a low earning religious place.
On Tuesday, while speaking to the media, Kannan said, “I have been asked to return the amount as the revenue of the temple is less than the expenses towards the tasdik.”
“I was supposed to get an annual tasdik of Rs 24,000 between 2003 and 2017 but I was credited Rs 90,000 per year. Likewise, I was supposed to get Rs 45,000 per year between 2017 and 2022 but I received Rs 90,000 per year. I was paid an additional amount of Rs 4.74 lakh over a period of 10 years and I was asked to return the money as the temple was not generating good revenue. However, I wish to mention that it is because of priests like me, the government hundi collections have increased,” Kannan said.
As the issue gained attention, BJP state president B Y Vijayendra took to social media and said the Congress-led government’s attitude shows that it is “targeting Hindu religious sentiments”.
Later, Minister of Transport and Endowment Ramalinga Reddy said the notice served to the priest would be withdrawn. “I have directed officers to hold an inquiry against the tahsildar and other officers responsible for wrong payment and recovery of excess amounts.”
Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said since it was the tahsildar’s mistake, the excess money “will be collected from the tahsildar”.
However, an official on condition of anonymity said some of the government officials who were involved in incorrect payments have retired from service.
Notably, payments to the priests were stopped in March 2022 as the process to recover excess amounts paid to them had begun."
GYTPP0WF6U_FY3UWMUZ7VXOQ06,"Today in Politics: Will Opposition respond to ASI report on Gyanvapi, what stand will RSS take?",Sattwick Barman,"Updated: January 26, 2024 23:06 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/today-in-politics-opposition-asi-report-gyanvapi-mosque-case-rss-9128358/,"With the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report on the Gyanvapi mosque complex concluding that “there existed a large Hindu temple prior to the construction of the existing structure”, the response of the BJP-RSS and the Opposition will be among the things to watch out for on Friday.
The initial reaction to the report came from AIMIM leader and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi who posted on X late on Thursday night, “This (ASI’s findings) wouldn’t stand academic scrutiny before any set of professional archaeologists or historians. The report is based on conjecture and makes a mockery of scientific study. As a great scholar once said ‘ASI is the handmaiden of Hindutva’.”
With RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat earlier this week calling for “hosh (reason)” at a time of “josh” (excitement) — he was speaking at the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration event — the Sangh is most likely to stick to the position of leaving these other temple disputes up to the courts, something it has repeatedly emphasised since the Ayodhya judgment in 2019.
How a beleaguered and divided Opposition responds, if it does at all, will also be crucial. When it came to the Ayodhya Ram Mandir, the parties of the INDIA alliance could not come up with a unified response. While some such as the Congress and the Left labelled it a political event and stayed away, others such as the NCP and the SP said they would visit the temple at a later date. As this dispute looks set to simmer and make its way through the courts, along with the dispute in Mathura, how the Opposition deals with it will be crucial in the long run.
In context: For the Hindu Right, the temple disputes in Mathura and Varanasi (the latter is also known as Kashi) are part of a larger ideological project as encapsulated in the slogan “Ayodhya toh bas jhanki hai, Kashi, Mathura baki hai (Ayodhya is just a glimpse, Kashi and Mathura are yet to come)” that gained currency amid the tumult of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in the 1980s and 1990s.
However, in June 2023, Bhagwat, in his first comments on the Gyanvapi case, questioned the need to “look for a Shivling in every mosque (har masjid me Shivling kyun dekhna)” and said the Sangh was not in favour of launching any other movement (andolan) on these issues. After the November 9, 2019, judgment of the Supreme Court on Ayodhya, Bhagwat suggested that the Sangh would keep away from Mathura and Kashi and focus on “character building (vyakti nirman)”. The temple disputes, he said, need to be sorted out amicably between the two sides and if the two sides decide to go to court they need to respect the court’s verdict.
After the Supreme Court earlier this month stayed an Allahabad High Court order that had allowed a court-monitored survey of the Shahi Idgah Mosque adjoining the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple in Mathura — another contested structure — Asad Rehman noted in an article that the progress in the case so far mirrors what has happened in Varanasi and Ayodhya. Like in Mathura, the appointment of a court commissioner to survey the site was the first step in the case of Ayodhya and Varanasi too.

Maratha reservation protests
Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange-Patil is scheduled to begin his hunger strike at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai on Friday along with his supporters. But there is a hitch. The Mumbai Police have denied him permission to hold a hunger strike in the city. Jarange-Patil — who was expected to stay overnight in Vashi, near Mumbai, along with his supporters — has said that he is determined to march to Mumbai unless Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar meet with him to discuss ways to fulfil his demand.
Jarange-Patil and his supporters want Kunbi status for the Maratha community so that they can avail of reservation benefits available to OBCs. However, the government is not open to giving all Marathas Kunbi status since that will set off OBC groups against it. The OBC community does not want its share of the reservation pie to be reduced so that Marathas get quota benefits. But the government, which has filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court against the top court’s decision to strike down a 2018 law providing quota to Marathas, has assured OBCs that it does not want to dilute their reservation. The government has said that Maratha reservation will be separate and over and above the existing OBC quota."
H1HZTMRMQX_WWPRC2W65JDTZDW,"PM Modi launches new rooftop solar power scheme: What it is, why it is needed",_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 09:53 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/modi-launches-new-rooftop-solar-scheme-pradhan-mantri-suryodaya-yojana-9122514/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday (January 22) announced the ‘Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana’, a government scheme under which one crore households will get rooftop solar power systems.
This isn’t the first scheme for promoting the installation of rooftop solar power systems, though. In 2014, the government launched the Rooftop Solar Programme that aimed to achieve a cumulative installed capacity of 40,000 megawatts (MW) or  40 gigawatts (GW) by 2022 — watt is a unit of power and is calculated as the amount of energy used over time, specifically one Joule per second.
However, this target couldn’t be achieved. As a result, the government extended the deadline from 2022 to 2026. The Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana seems to be a new attempt to help reach the target of 40 GW rooftop solar capacity.
Here is a look at the new scheme, India’s current solar capacity, the Rooftop Solar Programme, and why solar energy is important for the country.
Essentially, it is a scheme that will involve installing solar power systems at rooftops for residential consumers.
In a post on X, Modi said: “Today, on the auspicious occasion of the consecration of life in Ayodhya, my resolve has been further strengthened that the people of India should have their own solar rooftop system on the roof of their houses. The first decision I have taken after returning from Ayodhya is that our government will launch ‘Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana’ with the target of installing rooftop solar on 1 crore houses.”
He added that the scheme would help not only reduce electricity bills of the “poor and middle class”, but also push India’s goal of becoming self-reliant in the energy sector.
According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s website, solar power installed capacity in India has reached around 73.31 GW as of December 2023. Meanwhile, rooftop solar installed capacity is around 11.08 GW as of December 2023.
In terms of total solar capacity, Rajasthan is at the top with 18.7 GW. Gujarat is at the second position with 10.5 GW. When it comes to rooftop solar capacity, Gujarat tops the list with 2.8 GW, followed by Maharashtra by 1.7 GW.
Notably, solar power has a major share in the country’s current renewable energy capacity, which stands at around 180 GW.
India is expected to witness the largest energy demand growth of any country or region in the world over the next 30 years, according to the latest World Energy Outlook by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
To meet this demand, the country would need a reliable source of energy and it can’t be just coal plants. Although India has doubled down on its coal production in recent years, it also aims to reach 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.
Therefore, it is essential to expand solar power capacity — the country has increased it from less than 10 MW in 2010 to 70.10 GW in 2023, as mentioned before.
Launched in 2014, the scheme aims to expand India’s rooftop solar installed capacity in the residential sector by providing Central Financial Assistance — the financial assistance to the eligible projects as per MNRE Guidelines — and incentives to DISCOMs (distribution companies).
The programme’s goal is to increase rooftop solar installed capacity to 40 GM by March 2026 and it is currently in its second phase. Owing to the scheme, the country’s rooftop solar has increased from 1.8 GW as of March 2019 to 10.4 GW as of November 2023.
A consumer can avail of benefits of the scheme through DISCOM tendered projects or through the National Portal (www.solarrooftop.gov.in), Minister of New and Renewable Energy RK Singh said in a written response to a query raised in Lok Sabha last year.
“On the National Portal, the consumer has the choice to select any vendor and choose the brand and quality/efficiency of solar equipment. The DISCOMs role is limited to issuing of technical feasibility approval, installation of net-meter and inspect the system,” he added.
After installation and inspection of the system, the subsidy is sent directly to the bank account of the consumer.
Moreover, “surplus solar power units generated from the rooftop solar plant can be exported to the grid as per the metering provisions issued by respective SERCs (State Electricity Regulatory Commissions)/JERCs (Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission). The consumer can receive monetary benefits for the surplus exported power as per the prevailing regulations.”"

According to advocate Shail Awasthi, who is involved in counselling the couple at the local family court in Bhopal, the couple left for Ayodhya in October, but the woman was not kept in the loop. “This was the main crux of her petition. She was angry over being taken to Ayodhya instead of Goa. I am counselling the couple currently,” Awasthi told The Indian Express.
In her divorce petition, the woman said her husband works in the IT sector and gets a good salary. She is also employed and earns well, so going abroad for a honeymoon would not have been difficult for them, the petition states.
Despite no financial constraints, the woman’s husband refused to take her abroad and insisted on visiting a place in India itself. He allegedly claimed that he had to look after his parents, following which the couple agreed to visit Goa or South India for their honeymoon.
However, he later booked flights to Ayodhya and Varanasi, allegedly without telling his wife. He informed her of the changed travel plans only a day before the trip, saying that they were going to Ayodhya as his mother wanted to visit the city before the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony.
The woman has alleged that her husband took more care of his family members than her. Once they returned from the trip, she filed for divorce, the lawyer said."
H7AHJ8XREH_REE81VWBPM15OVQ,Explained: Sri Lanka’s church plans to declare Easter attack victims as ‘saints’,Rishika Singh,"Updated: January 23, 2024 11:15 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sri-lankan-church-easter-attack-saints-meaning-9122350/,"Sri Lanka’s Catholic church is planning to begin the process of declaring all the 273 people killed in the 2019 Easter Sunday suicide bombings as “saints”.
Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, announced the move while addressing a mass on Sunday (January 21). “A person can be named a saint only after the completion of 5 years since one’s sacrifice. Therefore, we will move towards declaring Easter Sunday victims as saints on April 21 this year,” he said, according to a PTI report.
On April 21, 2019, nine suicide bombers belonging to the Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ), believed to be linked to ISIS, carried out a series of blasts in three churches and three luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. Among the dead were foreign nationals, including 11 Indians.
How does the process of declaration of saints work? Can anyone be accorded the title? Who is tasked with doing so? We explain.
Multiple religions recognise saints as holy figures, who are believed to be associated with divinity. In Catholicism, the Roman Catholic Church designates saints after a process to verify their sainthood. It is believed to have declared around 10,000 saints over time.
Essentially, saints are people who are believed to have led virtuous lives, performed “miracles” (such as healing someone) and ascended to heaven after death. Their names are written in the Book of Saints. The veneration of saints started as early as 100 AD, with Christians honouring other Christian “martyrs” (those who died for the cause of religion).
After canonization, the saint’s name is added to the Catalogue of Saints and can be invoked in public prayers, Holy Mass can be offered and churches dedicated in their names, and their images can have a halo. Then, churches and church-run institutions can be named after such people and Christian children can adopt the names of these saints at the time of baptism. The saint’s relics are venerated and festivals are held in their names. Their places of birth, death, and burial become centres of pilgrimage.
Ranjith said that the process for sainthood can happen only five years after their death. This gap is to ensure that enough time has passed to evaluate their actions and study their life. In some cases, the period has been cut short for certain people, as was done for Mother Teresa. Nevertheless, the process takes years.
Generally, five years after a person’s death, the bishop of their diocese (the area under his jurisdiction as a religious leader that can include multiple churches) can begin looking into their life for evidence of their sainthood. The miracles they performed and other kinds of testimonies can be considered. This is called “Postulation”.
According to a BBC report, the bishop then asks the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Vatican’s department that makes recommendations to the Pope on saints, for permission to open the case. If they agree, the person who is being considered is called a “Servant of God”.
As part of this body, 9 theologians scrutinise the evidence and documentation. If a majority passes it, it goes to the Pope to decide if that person lived a life of “heroic virtue”. Once recognised by the Pontiff, the candidate is called “Venerable”.
In the next stage of beatification, the miracle needs to be adjudged for a person to be declared “Blessed”. The Diocese where it is claimed to have occurred carries out an investigation. The Scientific Commission must decide by accepted scientific criteria that there is no natural explanation for the alleged miracle.
The Theological Commission will judge whether what happened was indeed a miracle and whether it was due to God acting through the Venerable Servant. Again, the Pope is to confirm this. Once beatified, the candidate can be privately venerated.
To move towards formal canonization, a second miracle must be confirmed. The same procedure is followed and ends with the Pope’s decision. For example, in the case of Mother Teresa, the Pope acknowledged the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of a Bengali tribal woman, Monica Besra, as the first miracle and a second miracle involving a Brazilian man with brain tumours was recognised. Many doctors and rationalists rejected the so-called miracles, and several questions were raised.
According to the BBC, “During the canonisation ceremony, the Pope conducts a special Mass, reading aloud the individual’s life history and then chanting a prayer in Latin that declares the person a saint.”
Another type of declaration of saints is for “martyrs”. Writing in The Conversation, Mathew Schmalz, Associate Professor of Religion, College of the Holy Cross in the US, said: “Martyrs have a different path to sainthood. They become “blessed” when the pope makes a “Decree of Martyrdom.” After a single miracle, martyrs are “raised to the glory of the Altars,” a phrase that refers to the public ceremony in which a person is formally named a saint.”
Therefore, a martyr can be beatified without a verified miracle. But it is required to canonise someone as a saint. “Those who died in churches in April 2019 sacrificed their lives for what they believed in. They came to church because they believed in Christ,” Cardinal Ranjith said on Sunday.
On the matter of the blasts, Christian groups have expressed displeasure with the investigation so far. As of December 2023, no criminal convictions have happened. Then Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena was also ordered by the country’s Supreme Court to pay money for the victims’ fund, for “failing to prevent” the bombings “despite receiving intelligence ahead of the attack”.
In some cases, multiple people have been accorded the title at once. According to Britannica, a group of 45 Anglican and Roman Catholic martyrs were executed during the persecution of Christians under Mwanga, the ruler of Buganda (now part of Uganda) in the late 19th century. “The 22 African Roman Catholic martyrs were collectively beatified by Pope Benedict XV in 1920 and canonized by Pope Paul VI on October 18, 1964,” it added."
H9DW6O4KKV_V9FLK4L0Q3U8BDN,PM Modi Ram Mandir Speech Highlights: ‘Our Ram has arrived’ says PM after completion of Ram Temple consecration ceremony,_,"Updated: January 22, 2024 20:27 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-ram-mandir-speech-highlights-9121495/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday said that after years of wait, our Ram has arrived. “Ram Lalla won’t have to live in a tent anymore, he will live in a grand temple,” PM Modi said in Ayodhya.
The PM was addressing the gathering at the Ram Temple after the completion of the consecration ceremony. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath accompanied PM Modi for the rituals.
“The sunrise of January 22 has brought a wonderful glow. January 22, 2024, is not a date written on the calendar. It is the origin of a new time cycle,” Modi added.
The ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony, or the act of ‘giving life’ to an idol, transform it into a deity, giving it the capacity to accept prayers and grant boons. At least 8,000 invitees, including dignitaries, celebrities and industrialists, took part in the event.
“Our Ram has arrived today after the wait, patience, and sacrifices of centuries,” said PM Modi.
“January 22, 2024 is not merely a date but marks the advent of a new era. Even after thousands of years, people will remember this date, and moment. It’s Ram’s supreme blessings that we are witnessing it,” he said.
The Prime Minister also thanked the Supreme Court of India for “doing justice” and said that the temple was built in accordance with the law. “
“Today, I also apologise to Lord Shri Ram. There must be something lacking in our effort, sacrifice and penance that we could not do this work for so many centuries. Today the work has been completed. I believe that Lord Ram will forgive us today…” he stated further.
Speaking about the 11-day special ritual that he had taken up ahead of the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ rituals, the PM said that he tried to visit the places where Lord Ram had set foot.
“Over the last 11 days, I have had the opportunity to listen to Ramayana in different languages and in different states. Defining Lord Ram, saints have said that Lord Ram resides in everyone.

As per the education department notification, which applies to all government, government-aided and recognised private schools, the schools may organise online classes for these students.
As for students in Class 6 and above, the department said schools can choose whether or not to call back children for classroom learning, but they should take appropriate precautions to ensure that no child suffers from exposure to cold weather during their commute. It also said the schools should not open before 9.30 am and must close before 4 pm.
Director of School Education H P S Brar had earlier told The Indian Express they were considering extending the holidays due to the chilly weather prevailing in the city and the public holidays (Republic Day on January 26, followed by Saturday and Sunday) coming up later this week. “To call the students for just three days (January 23, 24 and 25) will not be a practical decision, that too in this intense cold,” he said.
Red alert again
On Sunday, the maximum daytime temperature plummeted to 9.4 degrees Celsius, 7 degrees less than the normal. However, the temperature during the early morning hours on Monday was 6.5 degrees Celsius, up from 5.2 degrees Celsius the previous morning.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for Chandigarh, warning of severe cold and very dense fog, till January 23 and an orange alert till January 25."

These included the demand for immediate abrogation from Suspension of Operations (SoO) with armed militants who have allegedly killed civilians and calling for replacement of the Assam Rifles.
This development comes on the day a special team of the Union Home Ministry arrived in the state for talks between the Meitei and Kuki communities, who have been engaged in a protracted standoff since May last year.
The statement by the MLAs argued that the SoO agreements with Kuki armed militant groups, and the resulting immunity they provide against a “firm reaction” from Central forces, is the “main cause of the never-ending cycle of violence”.
The SoO militants who “indulge in killing of innocent civilians and violation of ground rules should be abrogated immediately,” it said.
The statement also added that SoO agreements with militant groups “who also indulge in anti-state activities” should not be extended beyond their expiry date of February 29, 2024.
The joint statement further demanded a “complete disarmament of all illegal arms in the possession of miscreants and unauthorised persons in the entire state at the earliest by the Central and state forces”.
“Armed attacks (using sophisticated weaponry such as Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers) on Indian soil, Indian citizens and state security forces by Myanmar based armed Militants must be stopped at all costs. It will be to the detriment of the prestige of the Republic of India if this cannot be achieved in short order,” it stated.
The MLAs also accused the Assam Rifles, a central armed police force, for not being “responsive”. They alleged that members of the force were “mute spectators when unarmed civilians (particularly farmers) are being indiscriminately fired upon frequently”.
They said that the “Assam rifles and their leadership (chain of command) need to give strict instructions and be held accountable”. It suggested the Assam Rifles be replaced with “forces that have the ability to act by returning suppressive fire when they observe that unarmed civilians are being fired upon”.
“Such a reaction, which is wholly appropriate to safeguard the lives of civilians under fire, has been non-existent, which is why the public’s faith and trust in the forces presently deployed at places such as Moreh, Bishnupur, Imphal West, Kakching among others has been shattered,” added the statement.
The MLAs urged the Centre to take up “appropriate action at the earliest”. “Failing this”, the statement said, the “legislators will take appropriate action in consultation with the public.”"

The incident happened on Wednesday afternoon when about 50 ABVP activists from Osmania University arrived at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University (PJTSAU) campus in Rajendranagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad to join an ongoing student protest against acquisition of land for the High Court complex.
While classes have been suspended, the students say they won’t go back until the government order, GO-55 dated December 31, that allotted 100 acres of land from PJTSAU and the adjoining Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticulture University (SKLTSHU) in Rajendranagar Mandal for the proposed High Court is revoked.
The recent incident involving Telangana police is deeply concerning and absolutely unacceptable. Dragging a peaceful student protester and unleashing abrasive behaviour on the protestor raises serious questions about the need for such aggressive tactics by the police.

“A video of Improper action by certain police personnel has come to the notice of Cyberabad Police. A detailed enquiry is being conducted to take appropriate action in the matter,” Cyberabad police later said in a note.
In the video, one of the female student leaders from Osmania University could be seen running while two uniformed police women chase her in a two-wheeler, hold her by the hair and drag her down to the ground. About 50 of the protestors were taken into preventive custody. Later, student activists of SFI joined the protest along with former CPI(M) MLA Julakanti Ranga Reddy. Students say more politicians, including some sitting legislators, have agreed to join the protest now.
The viral video triggered widespread outrage on social media. MLC Kalvakuntla Kavitha in a post on X urged the National Human Rights Commission to take swift and strict action.
“The recent incident involving Telangana police is deeply concerning and absolutely unacceptable. Dragging a peaceful student protester and unleashing abrasive behaviour on the protestor raises serious questions about the need for such aggressive tactics by the police. This arrogant behaviour demands an unconditional apology from the Telangana Police. Urging the Human Rights Commission to take swift and strict action against those involved. This behaviour cannot become a norm and must be condemned by all alike,” she said in the post tagging NHRC.
The students here have been on a protest for over two weeks against a recent government decision to allot 100 acres of the university’s land for the construction of the new Telangana High Court complex.
Pointing that the 100-acre earmarked for the new High Court complex would destroy the ecology and biodiversity of the area, the students want the land meant for agricultural research to be left alone and instead, asked the government to identify barren land elsewhere."

Barring the Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav and the CPI’s D Raja, who condemned the “attack” on the convoy and came out in support of Rahul after he was stopped from visiting a revered shrine, the others showed a marked indifference.
Adding to that is the open rancour among the INDIA allies in West Bengal — the next state in the Yatra itinerary. All seems to be not well in the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar either. The Congress nevertheless is relieved to hear assurance from both Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and Deputy CM and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav that they will join Rahul’s Yatra in Purnea, its first stop in Bihar, later this month.
All this at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP have framed a new, and complex, challenge to the Opposition with the grand celebrations around the opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. On Tuesday, the party also sealed Mandal firmly with Kamandal by announcing the Bharat Ratna for socialist icon Karpoori Thakur.
On Monday, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee accused the CPI(M) of controlling the meetings of the INDIA alliance. And then, having led an all-faith rally on the day of the Ram Temple consecration, she interestingly added: “How many politicians today have taken on the BJP frontally… hit the streets? Somebody went to a temple and thinks that is sufficient. It is not so. I am the only one who took out a rally and visited a temple, a gurdwara, a church and a mosque.”
It was as much a message to the CPI(M) as to the Congress, which has been flirting with soft Hindutva. A big part of Rahul’s Monday was spent on a collision course with the BJP government in Assam over the shrine visit.
Mamata’s INDIA allies are hardly likely to take this lying down. The CPI(M), which conversely blames the TMC for helping the BJP grow in Bengal due to its politics, has practically ruled out any seat-sharing pact with the TMC in Bengal. It has also told the Congress that it will not attend the Yatra in the Bengal leg if the TMC is on the stage. The seat negotiations of the TMC with the Congress too have been in choppy waters.
The Congress central leadership is still hopeful. “We, me personally and the party, have good relations with Mamataji. Haan thoda-thoda hota rehta hai (Yes, there are minor tiffs). Sometimes somebody from her party says something, sometimes someone from our party says something, these are natural things. These are not things that are going to disrupt anything,” Rahul said at a press conference in Assam Tuesday.
Talking to The Indian Express, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said his party did not see Mamata’s claims worthy of a response, pointing out that the TMC had days ago called them a terrorist organisation. “Everybody knows the absurdity of calling us a terrorist organisation… Everything that is done in the INDIA meeting is done collectively. So there is no question of anybody’s dominance or anything,” Yechury said.
However, he also signalled that the CPI(M) may not share the Yatra stage if the TMC was present. “We have asked them (the Congress) to tell us the route and timing. We will see. We have not made a decision yet. In Assam, we were there. In Bihar, they have invited the Mahagathbandhan. We are part of that, so we will be there. Wherever we already are in some sort of an arrangement, where the Congress is also there, we will attend.”
Agreeing with Rahul that rumblings within an alliance were not surprising, Yechury added: “The TMC has to decide where it will stand – with the BJP or with INDIA. It is up to them. It is up to every party to take that call.”
However, while Bengal differences are in the face, seat-sharing arrangements in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra between the Congress and other parties have not made much headway either.
Congress allies such as the JD(U) are keeping a wary eye on this. While in Bihar the pact is more or less sealed (17 seats each for the JD-U and RJD, 5 for the Congress and one for the CPI-ML Liberation), JD(U) leaders hold the Congress is responsible for the delay in other states by insisting on an “unreasonable” number of seats in states where it is a marginal player and not willing to share enough in states where it is a dominant force.
Nitish has also questioned the fact that Rahul Yatra was conceived as a Congress programme and not as a joint INDIA campaign.
He had earlier expressed his open displeasure at the delay in finalisation of leadership roles within the INDIA bloc by turning down the convener position. A week has passed even since the INDIA bloc online meeting where this came to pass – skipped incidentally by Mamata, Akhilesh and the Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Uddhav Thackeray.
The fact that the alliance is yet to even formally announce the decision at the meeting to appoint Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge as the chairperson of INDIA signals that the consultations are either underway or that there is lack of unanimity on the decision.
Mamata, for one, is said to be not happy with the decision, having indicated in her Monday’s speech that the TMC felt sidelined. She also underlined in the speech that it was she who suggested the name INDIA for the alliance.
Meanwhile, fumbling to frame its response, the INDIA alliance is looking at another prospect of the BJP stealing a march: the party’s first list of 150-160 candidates for the Lok Sabha elections is expected in the next fortnight."
HQTPQ1PHPU_73VZ1SI0U9Y0A8O,Where is Parashurama? 33-ft ‘bronze’ statue unveiled by previous Karnataka BJP govt ‘vanishes’ within a year,Kiran Parashar,"Updated: January 25, 2024 08:01 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/33-ft-bronze-parshurama-statue-in-karantaka-vanishes-9123351/,"A 33-foot ‘bronze’ statue of Parashurama, believed to be an avatar of Lord Vishnu, which was unveiled at a theme park in Karnataka’s Udupi district ahead of last year’s Assembly election, appears to have gone “missing” – at least three-quarters of it – according to local officials and Congress workers.
At present, all that remains of the statue is the part below the knees.
The previous BJP government in the state had unveiled the 15-tonne statue as part of the theme park in the coastal area of Karkala. Rs 7 crore was spent on the park out of the total Rs 11.05 crore cost of the project initiated by the Department of Tourism, the Ministry of Kannada and Culture, and other related departments. Of this, Rs 2.4 crore is said to have been spent on the statue alone. Then Karkala MLA V Sunil Kumar was also the Kannada and Culture minister of the state.
Inaugurating the Parashurama statue on January 27, 2023, the then Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai had said, “This is a historic day, especially in coastal Karnataka, as the statue of Parashurama has been installed and a theme park is inaugurated. Parashurama is the creator of Tulunadu and had the personality of Karna. He was very brave, received the blessings of Shiva and was very strong. The people of this region must remember him.”
However, after September last year, the statue fell into controversy after activists in the region alleged that it was made of fibre and not bronze as claimed, and that parts of the structure had started to fall.
The Siddaramaiah government later constituted Justice H N Nagamohan Das committee to look into several allegations of irregularities during the previous BJP government’s tenure, which included complaints regarding the Parashurama statue from the Congress unit in Karkala.
In several police complaints, Congress workers have alleged that three-fourths of the statue was missing. K Sadashiva Devadiga, president of the Karkala Block Congress Committee, said in one complaint, “Eight months after its unveiling, the statue was covered with tarpaulin without bringing it to anyone’s notice. Later, its parts were taken away at night in containers by Nirmithi Kendra staff Sunil, Arun Kumar and Sachin, and Art World Bengaluru owner Krishna Naik.”
According to a local Congress worker, “We checked whether that part of the statue was with Krishna Naik at his workplace, but it has been closed for a long time. We suspect that the parts have been thrown into the Arabian Sea to destroy the evidence as there were a lot of irregularities.”
Udupi Superintendent of Police K Arun, who spoke to The Indian Express, said they had received several petitions in this regard and sought the government-run Nirmithi Kendra’s response. “Nirmithi Kendra said the statue is still under construction and it will be erected after completion. We have not registered any FIR related to the incident. However, earlier we had registered two cases against those who spread rumours in connection with the statue,” he said.
However, Arun Kumar, Project Director of the Udupi Nirmithi Kendra, told The Indian Express that the artist took out parts of the statue with their permission. “The statue was unveiled but some modifications were needed. The artist had taken back the statue for the modification. We are yet to receive it back from him,” he said.
A local district administration official said the statue was inaugurated in a hurry and no one knows what material was used. “As the election code of conduct was to be enforced, the BJP government unveiled the statue though none of the government officials wanted it to be done in such a hurry. The axe installed as part of the statue weighs more than a tonne and it did not have proper support. We received instructions not to remove it till the end of elections.”
“Later, we could not do anything during the monsoon. The statue was eventually removed part by part. From day one, the 33-foot statue – which was installed at a height of 57 feet from the ground – posed a threat to the public. Till date we do not know whether bronze was used in the statue,” said the officer.
The Justice Nagamohan Das committee has issued a notice to the deputy commissioner of Udupi to respond to the matter. A source in the Udupi district administration confirmed that they received the notice and added that they have asked the district tourism department officials to submit a report."

Goswamy’s illustrious academic career began after he resigned from the Indian Administrative Service in 1958, went on to do his PhD at PU, and then joined as a lecturer here in 1960.
At the event, in remembrance, well-known Bharatanatyam exponent Malavika Sarukkai and celebrated author William Dalrymple will give a performance and talk, respectively. Sarukkai, who has been honoured by the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2002 and is the recipient of the Padma Shri in 2003, is trained in Odissi as well. She will present a dance choreography titled, ‘Celebrating Myth in Miniature Painting’ – a tribute to Goswamy’s immense contribution to the corpus of knowledge on Indian painting through his research.
William Dalrymple, a recognised historian writer, broadcaster, curator and critic, will give a talk titled, ‘Taking Forward BNG’s Legacy – Forgotten Masters: Indian Painting for the East India Company’ which moves forward Goswamy’s seminal work on lifting the cloak of anonymity off Indian miniature painters.
The programme is scheduled for January 23, at 4 pm at PU Auditorium near Arts Block IV.
Apart from being the founding chairperson of the Department of Art History and Visual Arts, Goswamy also served as dean of University Instruction and was Professor Emeritus in Art History at PU. His research straddled several areas from Indian painting to aesthetic theory onwards to modern art movements.
His early work on ‘Family as the Basis of Style’, published in the dedicated issue of Marg, retains to date, its fundamental referral importance. Having authored 26 books on a range of areas and issues, Goswamy’s work opened up new vistas and new directions in studies about Indian painting. He lectured all over the world and received prestigious fellowships, awards and honours. In recognition of his immense research output and path-breaking work, the Government of India bestowed upon him with Padma Shri in 1998 and Padma Bhushan in 2008."

“The Prime Minister said exactly what should have been said…he said the right thing,” says Ansari, a response that marks the enormous distance he has travelled. As the son of Hashim Ansari who spent a lifetime in courts as a litigant in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit case before he died aged 95 in 2016.
It was that case in which a bench of the highest court unanimously ruled in favour of the temple in 2019.
From the time Iqbal Ansari showered petals on Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he came here last month to unveil the town’s new airport, its upgraded railway station and a slew of development projects, he’s had no respite from reporters knocking on the doors of his little house.
He knows why — the tyranny of the soundbite. “They want me to say something controversial. I have no time for reporters who try to dig up the past. That battle is over. My father and I had said long before the ruling that whatever the verdict, we will accept it. And the Supreme Court gave an order which we accepted.
There’s no point raking up the past,” he says.
“Ask anyone around. There’s no ill-will between Hindus and Muslims of Ayodhya. This is holy land. People come here from different parts of the country. Their gods are here. The Muslims of Ayodhya have never been stopped from any of their bhandaras (free meals for devotees), festivals…The town’s present and future is in vikas, forget the past.”
How do you forget the past in a town where history sneaks up on you in the narrow lanes? By looking ahead, says Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, scion of the erstwhile royal family of Ayodhya and a member of the temple trust.
“Ayodhya’s glory has returned (Ayodhya ka vaibhav lauta) and so has the self-respect (swabhiman) of the Hindus,” says Mishra, a leather-bound copy of the SC verdict on his table. “This temple is not about Ayodhya…Ram’s appeal has always been global… It has been a long struggle. And a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court gave a unanimous verdict in favour of the temple. The matter is settled. It’s over.”
On the street, Ayodhya’s transformation has been rapid. The hum of electric buses and e-carts has replaced the staccato bursts of the smoky Vikrams. The narrow road that cut through the heart of town, forking past decrepit buildings and overflowing drains, has given way to a four-lane thoroughfare called the Ram Path, a 13-km stretch from Saadatganj in adjoining Faizabad to Naya Ghat on the Saryu river.
Encroachments, mostly shop fronts, have been cleared to widen the road. Work’s underway to make it a corridor with a uniform facade for buildings on either side, in peach and saffron, and brown boards with names of shops in white letters.
The Ram Janmabhoomi Path is the new approach to the new temple. There are also the Dharma Path and Bhakti Path. The winding lane from the Hanuman Garhi crossing that climbed up to the then disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site, past the Raj Dwar temple and the Amawa Ram temple, no longer exists, replaced instead by a wide stretch lined with shops selling temple souvenirs, trinkets, ladoos, pedas, Gita Press books.
This area, like the rest of Ayodhya, was for long a decaying urban sprawl. It was here in October-November 1990 that police fired on kar sevaks trying to force their way past barriers – the official death toll was 16.
Two years later, an army of kar sevaks returned and razed the Babri Masjid on December 6, then raced against time to build a makeshift temple on the debris mound before melting away.
That single act, which lit flames and deepened the communal divide, froze Ayodhya in courtroom battles until November 2019 when the Supreme Court made its decision, clearing the decks for the construction of the Ram temple.
In the town today, there’s a generation that was born around or after that turbulent phase. Mohammed Azam, 35, was a child then, too young to remember the violence that convulsed the town, and many parts of the country. He has stuck to the family trade – of handcrafting khadaus (wooden slippers) for sadhus and sants frequenting the temples.
“My father, forefathers made khadaus. And I am doing the same – mine is the fifth generation in this trade, and I want my children to take this forward. The front portion of my shop was demolished during the road-widening work. I am getting the repairs done, so business is down. But I sit in my room and make khadaus to meet orders from Pratapgarh, Allahabad, Jaunpur, Deoria.”
“Some people ask me why should a Muslim be making khadaus. I always say why not? People who buy the khadaus go back happy and I sell it cheap, knowing that those who wear these are holy men who have very little money. So these are priced up to Rs 100 a pair,” says Azam.
The lack of hotels and the rush for the inauguration has led to the sprouting of homestays – around 600 such lodgings have come up in Ayodhya. The city and adjoining Faizabad are counting on speedy construction of hotels, and the influx of tourists, not just pilgrims, via air and rail to boost incomes. “The new Ayodhya Dham railway station and the Maharishi Valmiki International Airport should be the springboards for the town’s development. The coming months will provide a clearer picture” says Sharad Kapoor of Shane Avadh, one of the two hotels in Faizabad that used to be the haunt of reporters and photographers covering the Ayodhya developments in the 1990s.
Faizabad is now part of Ayodhya and the Faizabad railway station has become the Ayodhya Cantonment station. The talk in town is about the temple in Ayodhya and all that should follow. After all, it was here that the Nawabs of Awadh established their first capital.
Under Shuja-ud-Daula – most remember the third Nawab for his roles in the Third Battle of Panipat and Battle of Buxar – Faizabad prospered. But the city lost its sheen soon after his death in 1775 – Shuja-ud-Daula’s tomb in Gulab Bari and that of his wife, the Bahu Begum, are city landmarks – when his son and successor Asaf-ud-Daula decided to move the capital to Lucknow. Faizabad remained neglected, forgotten, more so after the annexation of Awadh in 1856.
It was the Ayodhya dispute, especially the chain of events in the last century, that returned the spotlight to Faizabad. At the Kutchery, the Collectorate, Advocate Nadeem Siddiqui, who is also the state president of All India Muslim Majlis, says the battle was hard and long but the chapter is over. “Of course, there are sentiments. Let’s not go there. Because in this case, there’s no going back. The highest court of the land has ruled, and its ruling has been accepted.”
Siddiqui points to the old courtroom where District Judge K M Pandey ordered the unlocking of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid premises on February 1, 1986. “I was there that day. I tried to oppose the unlocking but the judge didn’t listen. It was a long legal battle. But it’s over…Now if the focus is on development, who is going to object? It is for the good of everyone.”"

A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Manoj Jain directed the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) to place on record the action taken by it to compensate injured students as recommended by the NHRC. The direction came after it was informed that the Delhi Government was the authority concerned with the disbursement of compensation.
The NHRC had recommended the chief secretary of the Delhi Government should provide “suitable compensation to injured students” commensurate with their injuries. It had also recommended the Centre to direct the Commissioner, Delhi Police, as well as the CRPF for Rapid Action Force (RAF) to “identify members of force as seen in CCTV footages involved in damaging CCTV Cameras, unnecessarily caning inside the reading rooms of libraries of JMI and also using tear gas shells inside the close compound of the library which has no bearing on the task of controlling law and order” and further recommended to take “suitable action”.
On this point, the bench asked the Delhi Police’s counsel, “In the inquiry conducted against police officers was any action taken? Were you able to identify any police official? Was any disciplinary action taken?”. To this, the police counsel submitted that he would “seek instructions on this point” and place it on record. He was also permitted by the bench to place the original complaint filed before the NHRC as well as other relevant documents on record.
The order was passed in one of the petitions which forms part of a batch of petitions seeking various reliefs including a Special Investigation Team (SIT), Commission of Inquiry (CoI) or a fact-finding committee and registration of FIRs against the allegedly erring police officers among others.
The Delhi Police counsel said the same petitioner in one of the petitions before the High Court had also filed a complaint before the NHRC and that these prayers had already been decided by the Commission. He submitted the NHRC is a “statutory body” and passed a report with “factual findings” after the inquiry by its “in-house team”. He pointed to portions of the commissions’ report as per which, “the protest of students” which took place on December 15, 2019, was “not peaceful as they claimed”.
The counsel read the report which stated that “many appeals were made by the police, including senior officers, which were ignored by protestors”. The report also said, the counsel pointed out,that, “There is every apprehension that outsiders also entered the university. It is beyond doubt that students of JMI, local residents…political leaders were actively involved in various violent protests in the Jamia area”.
Meanwhile, Senior Advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for one of the petitioners, submitted that the NHRC had also conducted an investigation, which he said was a “very poor investigation and casual treatment of the whole thing, given the evidence that existed”. In the NHRC report, there is “hardly any reference to the statements given by students to the injuries reports” and “91 students” were injured in the incident, Gonsalves said.
Gonsalves further argued, “In December 2019, the students of Jamia wanted to take out a procession to Parliament to protest against CAA-NRC…The police intervened and stopped them in an unusually brutal manner and a lathi charge started. Took the police force inside the campus. They went into the library first and beat students who were studying there brutally. We have video footage which we would like to show.
“They then went to the women’s hostel and toilets…This beating continued for many hours…Fractures on the arm and head and one student was blinded in one eye. Immediately after this petition was filed which contained the complaint by students, the videos, the proctor and VC’s protest,” he added.
“As time passed, we found that FIRs were not being registered. Some investigations began with respect to areas outside Jamia. But no FIR with respect to the incident in Jamia. There should be an FIR registered and investigation done by police outside of Delhi police,” Gonsalves submitted."

As reported by New York Post, the punishment was handed down on Tuesday by Ventura County Superior Court Judge David Worley, who said that Bryn Spejcher seemed to have “no control over her actions” when she entered into the psychotic episode, which led to the stabbing of Chad O’Melia, a 26-year-old accountant, at his apartment in Los Angeles on May 28, 2018.
Both the prosecution and the defence confirmed that a marijuana bong hit had triggered the deadly episode, according to the report.
Spejcher and O’Melia had been in a relationship for a few weeks prior to the incident. The crime scene revealed that Spejcher had harmed her own pet also during the rampage. Despite efforts to save him, O’Melia was pronounced dead at the scene.
Spejcher’s legal team argued that their client, an inexperienced marijuana user, was “involuntarily intoxicated” at the time of the killing. They claimed O’Melia pressured her into taking additional hits from the bong after she did not feel the effects of the initial dose.

During the sentencing hearing, Spejcher broke down as she addressed Sean O’Melia, the victim’s father, offering a heartfelt apology for the tragedy.
The lenient sentence has sparked outrage and reignited online debates about the legal and societal implications of cannabis use, especially in cases involving extreme outcomes such as violence and loss of life.
A netizen wrote, “This is why things will only continue to get worse. When there is no price to pay.” Another said, “This is a pathetic outcome and verdict… especially sad for his family.” A third user wrote, “his judge belongs in prison.”"

“The war in Ukraine has become a battle of ammunition,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after a signing ceremony at the Western military alliance’s headquarters in Brussels.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said last week a shortage of ammunition, which he described as “shell hunger”, was a big problem for Kyiv’s troops nearly two years after Russia’s full-scale invasion.
The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) struck the deal on behalf of several allies who will either pass on the shells to Ukraine or use them to stock up their own depleted inventories.
A NATO official identified the buyers as Belgium, Lithuania and Spain, which pooled together to benefit from the lower prices ensured by buying in bulk.
The contract is likely to yield about 220,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, with the first deliveries expected at the end of 2025, the official told Reuters.
The shells will be supplied by French arms maker Nexter and Germany’s Junghans, according to an industry source.
Since NATO began a programme to address shortfalls in allies’ military stocks last July, the NSPA has agreed deals worth some $10 billion (9.19 billion euros), Stoltenberg said. This included artillery and tank shells, and Patriot air defence missiles.
At a meeting in February, NATO defence ministers are set to discuss other ways to step up industrial production which the NATO chief described as absolutely necessary to enable continued Western support for Kyiv."

Rahul Gandhi, along with other Congress leaders, was stopped at Haiboragaon and not allowed to proceed further. The former Congress chief was scheduled to pay obeisance to the local deity before starting his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on Monday.
According to news agency PTI, Gandhi slammed the authorities for stopping him from visiting the temple and questioned if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would now decide who will visit the temple and when.
“Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when,” Gandhi said. “We do not want to create any problems, simply pray at the temple,” Gandhi told the police authorities.
The authorities have only allowed local MPs and MLAs to travel beyond Haiboragaon, around 20 km from the temple spot.

The Batadrava Than management, according to PTI, asked Gandhi to visit the shrine “after 3 pm” when the Ayodhya Ram Temple’s ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony would be over.
Congress Sewa Dal chief Lalji Desai, speaking to PTI, called the act “shameful.” “This is atrocious. It is unfortunate that the prime minister will decide who will pray at what time in the country,” he said.
“Till the time the prime minister does pooja (in Ayodhya), no one is allowed to pray anywhere,” Desai claimed. “There is no ‘loktantra’ (democracy) here and the government will decide when people will pray at temples,” he added.
The Assam leg of the march will continue till January 25. It will travel 833 km in 17 districts. The Yatra, led by the Congress MP, commenced from Manipur on January 14 and will culminate on March 20 in Mumbai. It has been planned that the Yatra will cover 6,713 km in 67 days while passing through 110 districts in 15 states."
HYCXILUJMJ_8FGEG7DKZ8LFN9B,How the cow came to be debated in Constituent Assembly and why Article 48 was added to Constitution,Adrija Roychowdhury,"January 25, 2021 18:18 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/research/india-republic-constitution-cow-constituent-assembly-article-48-7161165/,"On November 16, 1949, as the Indian Constituent Assembly was nearing its end, it made room for the inclusion of a clause in the Directive Principles of State Policy.“That the State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern scientific and shall, in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.”
The clause to prohibit the slaughter of cows in the Constitution has been a matter of intense controversy and debate since the new republic was formed, and more so in recent years. But the inclusion of the clause must be seen in the background of the significance the animal held during the nationalist movement and the shades of majoritarian sentiment carried within it. It also needs to be understood in context of the Partition and the atmosphere of religious animosity that it created.
The cow has had an intriguing presence in the Indian psyche. There are mentions of devotion to cows appearing in Hindu scriptures, even though there is evidence to suggest that complete abstinence from beef eating did not exist in the ancient Indian way of life. In the political life of the Indian subcontinent, the cow has come up on numerous occasions before the nationalist movement of the 20th century. Although the Indian National Congress, which spearheaded the freedom struggle saw itself as an inclusive party, from the 1890s, it increasingly turned to predominantly Hindu-related imagery as a means to connect with the masses. For instance, the imagery of Hindu deities like Ganesh and Ram, religious epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata were appropriated to that end. A similar use was made of the holy cow.
“The purity of cow’s milk was likened to the purity and strength of the nation, and cow killing connected to the British consumption of beef was used to portray the British Raj as a regime indifferent to Hindu values,” writes historian Ian Copland in his 2017 research paper titled, ‘Cows, Congress and the Constitution: Jawaharlal Nehru and the making of Article 48’.
Accusations of the British slaughtering cows in large numbers would be spoken about in public gatherings. Historian William Gould, in his book, ‘Hindu nationalism and the language of politics in late colonial India’, notes, “In a city Congress meeting in Agra on June 14, 1930, Hari Narayan and Narayan Lal Bohra described how the British were killing cows in thousands every year.” He adds: “In Kanpur in the first week of September, Raj Narayan estimated that Europeans alone had slaughtered 44,000 cows. In Bhedpur, Etawah, on September 19, one Ram Dutt speaking at a Congress gathering, claimed that the government was responsible for the death of three crore cows.”
To protect the cow was seen as a means of protecting ‘Mother India’. In 1925, Mahatma Gandhi helped establish the first all-India cow protection organisation, the Gorakha Sabha. Cow protection, urged Gandhi, “was one of the important duties enjoined upon Hindus as a part of their religion.”
Consequently, a group within the Congress asked for a legislation for a complete ban on cow slaughter. However, the higher authorities in the party, vary of Muslim alienation, rejected the claim.
But as discussions of cow slaughter gained momentum, there emerged a feeling of alienation among Muslims. As Gould notes, “it heightened awareness of ‘Muslim rights’ in relation to animal slaughter”.
In the centuries before Independence itself, the tendency in rhetoric was to combine foreign rule as both British and Muslim and cow slaughter as being a practise among both. But with the Partition of the country, and the creation of Pakistan, the Hindu right both within the Congress and beyond assumed that the newfound Indian nation would be a land based on Hindu ideals including that of safeguarding the cow. Consequently, a public convention in Delhi in early August recommended that the new polity “provide in its constitution for the stoppage of cow killing.”
“Previously, that part of the cow protection movement bent upon resolving the problem through legislation had been loosely coordinated by the Goraksha Sabha; now it gravitated into the orbit of industrialist Seth Ramkrishna Dalmia and his newly minted Govak Nivak Sangh (Anti- cow slaughter league),” writes Copland. He notes further how the first act as president of the league, Dalmia set up headquarters in the Delhi house formerly owned by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and told his supporters that the green flag of Islam had been replaced by the ‘sacred flag of the cow’.
Consequently, the league arranged for a throng of sadhus to carry out regular sit-ins in front of the house of the prime minister-elect Nehru. August 10 was nominated as National Cow Day. Lastly, a rhetoric was built around saving the cow for the economic needs of the country. “To boost the production of food in India, we have to increase the cattle wealth in our country and we can do that only by stopping cow slaughter,” noted Dalmia, as reproduced in Copland’s work.
Dalmia’s petition found many takers. By August it had attracted around 164,000 signatories. Anti-cow killing resolutions were passed by independent organisations like the Ahmedabad Bullion Association and All India Varnashrama Swarajya Sangh. Several state assemblies and municipal bodies served notices of bills to prohibit cow slaughter. Meanwhile, senior leaders within the Congress were flooded with requests to legislate against cow slaughter.
Correspondence between prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the newly-elected president of the Constituent Assembly, Rajendra Prasad, is noteworthy here. Nehru confided in Prasad that while he had no problem with protecting cattle, he was deeply worried about the tone the proposal was taking. “India is a composite country. If any such step is taken purely on Hindu sentiment, it means that the governance of India is going to be carried on in a particular way which thus far we have not done,” he wrote to Prasad. Nonetheless, Prasad referred the question to the Constituent Assembly with a request that it be looked as part of its deliberations on ‘Fundamental Rights’.
One of the most vociferous among the cow lobbyists in the Constituent Assembly was Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava from East Punjab. Arguing from an economic point of view, he asked the question: “How can you improve your health and food position, if you do not produce a full quota of cereals and milk? This amendment is divided into three parts. Firstly, agriculture should be improved on scientific and modern lines. Secondly, the cattle breed should be improved; and thirdly, the cow and other cattle should be protected from slaughter. To grow more food and to improve agriculture and the cattle breed are all inter-dependent and are two sides of the same coin.” Others who supported him included Seth Govind Das, Shibban Lal Saxena, Ram Sahai and Raghu Vira.
R V Dhulekar, on the other hand, made his argument on more religious grounds. “And our Hindu society, or our Indian society, has included the cow in our fold. It is just like our mother. In fact, it is more than our mother. I can declare from this platform that there are thousands of people who will not run at a man to kill that man for their mother or wife or children, but they will run at a man if that man does not want to protect the cow or wants to kill her.”
But the proposal was met with stiff resistance from the chairman of the Drafting Committee B R Ambedkar who informed that it cannot be included as part of Fundamental Rights since ‘rights’ properly applied only to citizens and cows were not citizens. Finally, it was Prasad who came up with a resolution and proposed the needs of the holy cow in the chapter devoted to Directive Principles of State Policy. Thus was born Article 48.
As a consequence of Article 48, several state governments hastened to enact laws prohibiting the killing of cows. At present, 24 out of 29 states in India have laws criminalising cow killing.

I45QDKSLE2_N24OS016KLQ32EA,Thane communal clashes: Here is what happened,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 19:01 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/thane-communal-clashes-here-is-what-happened-9127077/,"Over a dozen people have been held and some establishments demolished in Thane district of Maharashtra in the last five days after communal clashes broke out at several places, including Mira Road, Naya Nagar and Bhayander amid the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
According to police, the first of the clashes broke out in Naya Nagar on Sunday night in which a few people were reported injured. A mix of provocative slogans, rumours and a surprising absence of local police is what is said to have led to the violence in the area. Here is what we know happened:
January 21 night: In Naya Nagar, violence first flared after a procession of vehicles, including modified bikes with saffron flags, passed in front of Taini villa masjid and Mohammed masjid on Lodha Road. The bikers were said to be shouting religious slogans. Locals said that some of the bikes had modified silencers which emitted a sound that many felt was like a gun being fired. A few locals rushed to see if bullets were being fired towards the masjid and that led to panic with the bikers trying to escape. One of the bikers bumped into a bystander leading to a fight, according to eye witnesses. The incident subsequently escalated with locals assaulting members of the procession. Police have confirmed the same sequence of events behind the first incident. At least 13 people were held in this connection, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said.
January 22:   Hours later, on Monday evening, two groups were also involved in stone pelting during a procession taken out on the occasion of the Ram temple idol consecration on Mira Road, police said, adding additional forces had to be called in for security. In a video pertaining to the incident, an injured motorist, who was part of Sunday’s Hindu Shobha Yatra, was seen saying that the attackers were armed with swords and knives. From more videos that were shared widely, unknown people were seen vandalising the vehicles with rods, pelting stones at the windscreen and hitting people sitting inside the vehicles. A vehicle was seen attacked by the mob while a few policemen present at the scene were unable to control the situation. The videos could not be individually verified.
January 23: The Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation used bulldozers on Tuesday afternoon to demolish about 15 structures in the Muslim-dominated Haidary Chowk area in Mira Road, where the clashes had broken out.
On January 24, in a similar exercise, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) razed encroachments from around 40 shops on Mohammed Ali Road in Mumbai. BMC said that the shops were “illegal encroachments” and were pulled down to free up space on the footpaths. Some of the key commercial entities affected by Wednesday’s drive include Noorani Milk Centre and Suleman Usman Mithaiwala, whose origins date back to the 1930s. There were no reports of any such drive by the civic body in any other ward.
Multiple FIRs filed, 23 detained, questioning underway
In Thane, at least 12 FIRs were filed and nearly 19 people were arrested and four minors detained by the Naya Nagar, Kashi Mira, Navghar Bhayander and Pelhar police stations in connection to the clashes. More people may be arrested soon, police said. The police have also identified 52 objectionable and inflammatory posts on social media and managed to take down 20 of them and are in the process of taking down others. Two FIRs pertain to posting and spreading objectionable content on social media. Police have also placed barricades on entry and exits of key roads at many places, mainly with high Muslim population."

He was accompanied by BJP’s Lingayat strongman and former CM B S Yediyurappa, and state BJP chief B Y Vijayendra for a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah to script the return.
“The national leaders (of the BJP) also said I should return, and this morning I spoke to Amit Shah,  who welcomed me affectionately. I am now an MLC of the Congress and I have resigned via email. I have spoken to (Legislative Council Chairman Basvaraj) Horatti on the phone and also communicated my decision to D K Shivakumar. I am joining the BJP,” Shettar said.
Shettar, 68, a BJP veteran with a long family lineage in the party, said he was returning to “strengthen the hand of Prime Minister Narendra Modi” in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. “The party gave me a lot of responsibilities in the past. Due to some issues, I went to the Congress. In the last nine months, there were a lot of discussions. Also, BJP workers asked me to come back to the party. Yediyurappaji and (Karnataka BJP president B Y) Vijayendraji also wanted me to come back to the BJP. I am rejoining the party with the belief that Narendra Modi ji has to become the prime minister again,” he said after joining the BJP.
The move is seen as another feather in the cap of Yediyurappa, who is once again in full charge of the party state unit. The move is likely to strengthen Yediyurappa’s standing as a leader of Lingayats and counter efforts by Shettar’s rivals in the Hubbali region, like Union minister Pralhad Joshi, to achieve ascendancy in the region.
“It was the desire of all party workers that he must return to the party. This (move) will strengthen the party and give it a big boost for the Lok Sabha elections to win 25 to 26 seats,” Yediyurappa said.
Vijayendra too echoed his father’s views and termed the move a homecoming for Shettar.
Union minister Bhupendra Yadav said Shettar wanted to rejoin due to his past association with the party and the relentless efforts of Modi towards bringing “Ram Rajya” in the country.
A six-time MLA from Hubli Dharwad region, the support of Shettar will prove critical for the BJP in retaining the Dharwad Lok Sabha seat, with sitting BJP MP Pralhad Joshi, who is a Brahmin, relying heavily on his clout for winning the seat.
Shettar, a soft-spoken politician who enjoys good relations with leaders across the political spectrum, had quit the BJP in April last year after Mahesh Tenginakai was preferred by the party over him for the Hubbali-Dharwad seat. At the time, he had said: “I have worked for the party for more than 30 years and have built it. They could have intimated to me two or three months ago, and I would have accepted it… I will not blame the senior leaders of the party like PM Narendra Modi. I will not blame Amit Shah. I will not criticize Nadda Ji. I feel that the real developments in Karnataka have not been brought to the notice of central leaders.”
His exit from the BJP was seen as a fallout of the tussle between Yediyurappa and the party’s national secretary, B L Santhosh.
The former CM had also alleged that the ticket distribution process was under the control of a handful of people in the BJP and that there was an organised effort to sideline him as he was a possible CM face.
However, Shettar had failed to win from his bastion of Hubbali Dharwad on a Congress ticket in the Assembly elections that followed.
Shettar’s switch expectedly prompted fierce reactions from Congress leaders. Karnataka Congress chief and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar said the party had treated him respectfully even though he lost the polls by over 35,000 votes and that the trust that the party had shown in him had been broken. “I spoke to him yesterday morning and he assured me that he will not leave the party as Congress had given him another life in politics,” he said, adding that he had learnt about Shettar rejoining the BJP from the media and they were yet to receive his resignation.
On Shettar’s comments that he was rejoining the BJP in the interest of the country, the Deputy CM asked whether he had not considered the interests of the country while joining the Congress in April.
Shivakumar also ruled out the possibility of other former BJP leaders like Laxman Savadi, who had joined the Congress ahead of the polls, following suit.
CM Siddaramaiah said Shettar had joined the Congress alleging insult by the BJP, and the Congress had fielded him since he was a senior leader. “He has not faced any injustice or insult in the Congress,” he said.
Shettar’s departure had been a big loss for the BJP given his stature in the Lingayat community and his long stint in the party. He had led the party as CM at a turbulent time in 2012 when Yediyurappa had left to float his own outfit – the Karnataka Janata Paksha.
Shettar’s uncle Sadashiv Shettar was the first member of the BJP — albeit in its Jana Sangh avatar — to be elected to the Karnataka Assembly in 1967 (from the Hubli constituency). His father S S Shettar was a five-time councillor in the Hubli-Dharwad City Corporation and served as the first Jana Sangh mayor of any city in southern India.
The Hubli region of Mumbai Karnataka, with nearly 20% of its population Lingayat, has hence been seen widely as a fiefdom of the Shettars.
Shettar’s exit will be a blow to the Congress bid to consolidate the Lingayat vote bank ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. With Yediyurappa calling the shots and son Vijayendra as state chief, the Lingayats are set to rally behind the BJP again.
Meanwhile, the Vokkaliga end is already stitched for the BJP courtesy its tie-up with the JD(S)."
I4ZTFP5DW9_6157ML9VIAPHYG4,Ways to recognise efforts of employees and create healthier workplace,Jayashree Narayanan,"Updated: February 17, 2024 11:15 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/workplace/workplace-wellbeing-recognise-employee-efforts-need-motivation-employers-tips-9121442/,"In many workplaces, there might be a communication breakdown between management and employees. Often, leaders are caught up in between the daily demands of running a business and acknowledging individual contributions. This can create an environment where employees feel undervalued and overlooked.
Suchandra Sarkar, QC specialist from the entertainment industry, rues that despite “consistently contributing my best efforts at work, recognition seems elusive.” “I believe acknowledgment fosters a positive work environment, motivating individuals to excel. But a lack of it creates feelings of undervaluation, potentially resulting in disengagement and a higher likelihood of seeking opportunities elsewhere,” adds Sarkar.
Recognising employees is not just a feel-good gesture; it directly contributes to a healthier and more productive work environment. “Employee recognition is critical to fostering a positive workplace culture. Understanding why a lack of employee recognition occurs is pivotal in addressing the issue. Several common reasons include inadequate communication, oversight, or a need for more awareness regarding the impact of recognition on employee morale,” says Mansi Poddar, psychotherapist, and founder, Heal. Grow. Thrive Foundation.
There can also be a gap in training for managers on the importance of recognition and how to effectively convey it, says Neel Juriasingani, CEO and Co-Founder, Datacultr.
As mentioned, oversight plays a big part. In larger organisations, it’s easy for the achievements of individual employees to get lost in the shuffle. Managers may only sometimes be aware of the day-to-day accomplishments of their team members, leading to a lack of recognition for noteworthy efforts. “Generally speaking, most people do want to recognise good work, but often, it gets lost amongst daily priorities,” admits Deepti Sagar, chief people officer, Deloitte India.
However, many companies are slowly realising the importance of recognising their employees. They understand that acknowledgment fosters a sense of appreciation and motivates employees to excel.
Moreover, employee recognition contributes to a sense of belonging and loyalty. Baldev Raj, founder, and chief, Prius Communications, says, “When individuals feel recognised and appreciated, they are more likely to develop a strong connection with their organisation. This emotional connection fosters loyalty and reduces attrition rates, as employees are less inclined to seek opportunities elsewhere when they feel their contributions are genuinely valued.”
“I believe employees should be motivated periodically, and acknowledgment should be expressed through appreciation, bonuses, salary increments, off-site events, picnics, or tours. This not only maintains a strong bond between the company and existing employees but also attracts talent from the industry,” Raj adds.
According to Juriasingani, recognition leads to higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates. “Recognition also fosters a positive work environment, encourages team spirit, and can even enhance the company’s reputation as a desirable employer,” says Juriasingani.
Through firsthand experience, Zeeshan Ali, a senior communication consultant, says he has witnessed a “remarkable transformation in team dynamics, a shift in work ethos, and a surge of positivity” that recognition injects into the workplace. “Furthermore, this acknowledgment enhances loyalty and integrity, to take the organisation to new levels of accomplishment,” says Zeeshan.
As a result, many organisations are implementing structured recognition programs.
Leadership has a crucial role in setting the tone. “We have a special reward called the President’s Bonus, where the senior-most leaders in every business nominate professionals who have exemplified our shared values, for an extra monetary bonus, over and above the performance bonus they already receive,” says Sagar.
Then there are appreciation weeks where everyone comes together to express their gratitude towards someone who made a positive impact in their life during the year. “Considering the size and scope of our organisation, we have bespoke awards done at the business or team level too. For instance, for the top recruiter and people who have completed the most learning programmes,” mentions Sagar.
Here are some of the steps you should implement in your organisation, according to Poddar.
Establishment of formal recognition programs – Implement formal recognition programs highlighting outstanding achievements. These can include regular awards, shout-outs in team meetings, or even monetary rewards. By creating a systematic approach to recognition, companies ensure that no employee’s efforts go unnoticed.
Juriasingani mentioned creating a platform for public acknowledgment further reinforces a culture of appreciation.
Conduct leadership workshops and seminars – Educate managers on the positive impact of acknowledging and appreciating their team members. This helps in creating a culture where recognition becomes an integral part of the organisational ethos.
Integrating recognition into performance reviews – Linking employee recognition with performance reviews can be a strategic move. Acknowledging and rewarding achievements during performance evaluations not only motivates employees but also reinforces the connection between individual contributions and organisational success.
Seeking employee feedback – Engaging employees in the process by seeking their feedback on recognition initiatives is vital. Companies can conduct surveys or hold focus group discussions to understand what forms of recognition resonate most with the workforce. This inclusive approach ensures that recognition efforts are well-received and aligned with employee preferences.
Celebrating milestones and achievements – Beyond day-to-day recognition, celebrating significant milestones and achievements is pivotal. Whether it’s work anniversaries, project completions, or personal accomplishments, marking these occasions with special recognition events or rewards adds a layer of appreciation and demonstrates the company’s commitment to its employees’ growth and success.
Thus, addressing the lack of employee recognition involves a multifaceted approach. “By implementing a strategic approach, organisations can establish a comprehensive and effective framework for acknowledging and appreciating their workforce. This commitment not only boosts morale but also contributes to creating a workplace where employees feel valued, motivated, and integral to organisational success,” Poddar further shares.

The police said one person was injured in the incident even as heavy security was deployed to escort the yatra.
The incident occurred around 4 pm when villagers were participating in the yatra, passing through a sensitive neighbourhood. According to the police, some miscreants pelted stones at the procession from the alleys and a clash ensued. This comes amid the police deploying personnel in the village due to ongoing tension in the run-up to the Ram temple consecration ceremony.
Vadodara SP Rohan Anand said, “Eyewitnesses said that around three to four persons threw stones from the alleys at the procession. We are also investigating complaints that some of the miscreants had weapons but are yet to get any evidence of the same…”
“Police personnel were present in the village, as there had been some tension in the last few days… Police inspector had also held a meeting with local leaders to ensure that law and order is not disrupted during the Pran Pratishtha of the Ram Mandir,” he added.
Anand, who rushed to the village after the incident, said that the police have begun combing operations and are rounding up suspects. “The police have ensured that the yatra proceeds on its planned route and no further disruptions occur. We have also spoken to members of both the communities to restore peace,” he added."

Parinav, a student of Deens Academy in Gunjur and resident of Prestige Mayberry in Whitefield, left home for his tuition class around 8.30 am on January 21 but did not return home. While police registered a kidnapping case and started looking for the boy, the social media campaign had a huge number of volunteers coming forward to help his anxious parents.
After going through hundreds of CCTV cameras, it was found that Parinav had been to Majestic and the police suspected that he might have left the city.
On Wednesday morning, Vandana Menon, a media professional who had reached Hyderabad for work, noticed Parinav and informed his parents. Vandana, who is also from Whitefield, has been constantly getting updates on the search for Parinav through WhatsApp.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Vandana said, “I was at Nampally metro station to take a train to Gachibowli. I noticed Parinav standing in the line to buy tickets. As he was wearing the same uniform from the day he went missing and photos of him wearing the same dress did rounds on social media, it helped me to recognise.”
“I took some time and started speaking to him and then he opened up that he was from Bengaluru and lives in the Whitefield area. Then I also said that I lived in the same area. I called my husband and asked him to alert the volunteers to reach his parents. As I spoke in Malayalam, Parinav did not understand. He was calm and composed and so was I. We had a good conversation and I informed the metro authorities as well. By then, his parents came on a WhatsApp video call and spoke to him. His father’s friend who lived in Hyderabad came and took him,” she said.
In a video posted on X, Parinav’s mother Niveditha was seen thanking everyone for the support. “Now we are going to pick him from Hyderabad,” she said.
FOUND!
Parinav is not lost anymore. His family is on route to Hyderabd to find him.

A teacher at Deens Academy described Parinav as a “strong and social person” and a student who never shied away from mingling with others. However, the teacher suspects that an incident at the tuition centre might have forced him to run away.
“We learnt that he was humiliated at the tuition centre on Sunday either for not completing his homework or for malpractice during an examination. We also learnt that the tuition centre threatened to inform his parents about the same, which might have instilled fear in him and forced him to run away,” said the teacher.
The teacher added, “Officials at the tuition centre are not coming out clean on what happened on Sunday with Parinav, despite our school making efforts to reach out to them. However, as a student he is very strong and a social person. He was a naughty child three years ago, but he has changed as a person now.”"
IA1YKJBVDK_JP6VX2VK0JILDEI,"Bill Gates is excited about rapidly advancing robotics, says it won’t be taking all jobs",Bijin Jose,"Updated: January 26, 2024 09:34 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/bill-gates-on-robotics-artificial-intelligence-9127474/,"Robotics is the next frontier in technology. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence in recent times have accelerated the integration and deployment of AI. Numerous companies around the world have integrated AI into their robots that have been developed for various use cases. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, who is a vocal proponent of AI, took to his blog to share his thoughts about the advancements in robotics technology.
In his post, Gates expressed his excitement about the rapid progress in robotics technology and the potential for robots to transform how we live and work. While the billionaire outlined some limitations, he also stated that the innovations in AI are enabling them to demonstrate human-like capabilities in domains such as learning, understanding, and thinking.
The 68-year-old believes that robots can undertake dangerous and unfulfilling jobs, making people safer, healthier, and more productive. He went on to highlight some of the robotics companies that are at the forefront of developing humanoid robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. He also sees the possibility for robots to be active in healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and even in homes in the future.
On robots taking jobs
Gates acknowledged the fear of robots taking over jobs; however, he feels that governments and the private sector will need to help people brave this transition.
“I understand concerns about robots taking people’s jobs, an unfortunate consequence of almost every new innovation—including the internet, which (for example) turned everyone into a travel agent and eliminated much of the vacation-planning industry. If robots have a similar impact on employment, governments and the private sector will have to help people navigate the transition,” he wrote.
The billionaire said that considering the shortages in the economy and the dangerous and unrewarding nature of certain jobs, robots are unlikely to take jobs that we love, and more likely, they will take over jobs that people are unwilling to do. “I believe it’s less likely that robots will replace us in jobs we love and more likely that they’ll do work people don’t want to be doing. In the process, they can make us safer, healthier, more productive, and even less lonely.”
The limitless possibilities
When it comes to robotics, Gates feels if the technology is used the right way, there would be limitless use cases. According to Gates, robots can help during natural disasters where first responders would have to risk their lives or during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic when human interactions may spread the disease further. Robotics can help in manually pulling out weeds from farms instead of toxic chemical herbicides. They can also help move massive loads on factory floors. They can also be beneficial in prosthetics.
Gates went on to list some of the robotics companies that are doing something remarkable. In Agriculture, Tevel’s fruit-picking robots can work round the clock to address labour shortages and prevent crop wastage. Similarly, Apptronik is developing general-purpose humanoid robots that can be programmed to do various tasks. UCLA’s RoMeLa lab has developed ARTEMIS, one of the world’s fastest-running robots. Startups like Field AI are focused on developing AI software to improve robots’ perception, navigation, and communication abilities.
Gates, who frequently shares his thoughts on AI, had, in a recent interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that generative AI had plateaued and that GPT-5 will not be much different. In the same interview, the Microsoft co-founder also predicted that in the next two to five years, the accuracy of AI software will witness a considerable increase along with a cost reduction. This will lead to the creation of new and reliable applications."
IC2K0K2DQB_7K3BYMF1CFHP56I,SC notice to UP on plea against ban on manufacturing food products with halal certification,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:14 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sc-notice-up-plea-ban-manufacturing-food-products-halal-certification-9127774/,"The Supreme Court on Thursday sought a response from the Uttar Pradesh government and others on a plea challenging the notification prohibiting manufacture, storage, sale and distribution of food products with halal certification within the state, except for items produced for export.
The November 18, 2023 notification was issued by the office of the Commissioner, Food Safety and Drug Administration, Uttar Pradesh, under the provision of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.
The apex court issued notice to the state government and others seeking their responses on a plea filed by ‘Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind Halal Trust’.
A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta also directed that no coercive steps will be taken against the trust and its office bearers in connection with the FIR lodged in Lucknow in a case related to Halal certification.
Advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for ‘Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind Halal Trust’, told the bench that the petitioner has already joined the probe and furnished all necessary documents sought by police. Still, he claimed, the state police want to summon the president of the trust.
“We direct that no coercive steps be taken against the petitioner or its office bearers,” the bench ordered, while issuing notice on the plea.
Besides seeking quashing of the notification, the petition sought a direction to ensure that no coercive action was taken against the petitioner trust or its employees in connection with the FIR. The plea has also sought quashing of the FIR.
The bench said the plea would be heard along with two separate petitions raising similar issues.
On January 5, the apex court had sought responses from the Uttar Pradesh government and others on two separate pleas challenging the notification.
In its petition, the trust has said Halal is an Arabic term which means “lawful” and “permissible”. “Halal means everything which is not prohibited. The opposite of ‘Halal’ is ‘Haram’ which means ‘unlawful’ or ‘prohibited’. This concept of prohibited and lawful cannot be confined to products of non-vegetarian items only. The concept of ‘Halal’ has been misunderstood by relating it with only the process of slaughtering of animals,” it said.
The plea said Halal certification is not only limited to India but is also applicable in various other jurisdictions like the United Kingdom, various European countries, Japan, Russia etc.
“The petitioner Trust was established in the year 2009 under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, to inter alia work for Halal Foods products and for this purpose, petitioner also issue voluntary certificate for facilitating export of Halal foods, animal products, ingredients and other related product after proper inspection, testing, analyzing and examination as per established norms,” it said.
The plea claimed the allegations levelled in the FIR were completely baseless and malicious in nature.
It said the trust is recognised globally and within the country for carrying an unblemished reputation for Halal certification.
“The issuance of Halal certificates by the petitioner trust for a range of products, including food (meat and non-meat) as well as non-food products is as per the law of the land and in no contravention to any law thereof,” it said.
The plea said there is no compulsion for any company, body and manufacturer to seek Halal certification for products by the petitioner trust under the law.
“Similarly, there is no compulsion for the consumers in the market to buy products with Halal certification and thus the process, both of seeking Halal certification and buying products with Halal certification, is entirely based on the choice of manufacturers and consumers. As such, the allegations against the petitioner of polarizing the market on communal lines is entirely malicious and concocted,” it said."

The Dial-108 project, set up by the state’s National Health Mission and operated by BVG India is a free-of-cost service with a centralised call centre in Pune. State health authorities have planned to double the number of ambulances apart from setting up boat ambulances and special ones for newborns.
Presently, a total of 937 ambulances are in service, including 233 advanced life support and 704 basic life support ambulances. So far 94.40 lakh emergency patients have been attended to between Jan 26, 2014 and December 31, 2023. In the last ten years, maximum calls for service have been from cases of pregnancy (16,02,567), health (56,50,990) and accidents (5,11,845). As per MEMS data of Dial 108 project —this includes providing emergency medical services to 6,01,726 suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients and more than 39,707 babies delivered in the ambulance.
The toll-free number 108 is accessible across Maharashtra wherein the control room takes down information including name, address and medical details of the patient from the caller, and quickly dispatches the nearest 108 ambulance for the patient.
Dr Dnyaneshwar Shelke, Chief Operating Officer of BVG MEMS, told The Indian Express that on any given day, the MEMS 108 emergency control room receives over 8,000 calls every day.
In Pune district, emergency services have been provided to a total of 8,73,707 patients in the last ten years, and 6,36,310 patients have been attended to in Mumbai, and 5,17,808 patients in Solapur. Dr Shelke also said that the public health department has initiated boat ambulances in the sea-shore and backwater areas of dams for emergencies. As per MEMS officials, at least 36 boat ambulances and 25 neonatal ambulances will be deployed at district hospitals for transport of critical neonates. The present fleet of ambulances will be doubled and about 1,756 ambulances will now serve different parts of the state for quick response to emergency calls.
The Emergency Response Centre has been integrated with police and fire control rooms across the state and has integrated mobile apps of doctors and ambulance drivers for sharing live dispatch information with field staff. Ten years ago, a tender was floated to initiate 108 ambulance services. All capital expenditure towards it was done on behalf of the government. As per the new tender, the service provider will have to bear 51 per cent of the capital expenditure. Currently, the government spends Rs 33 crore per month to maintain the ambulance service. With more ambulances added to the fleet, the government will have to spend Rs 63 crore per month."

The accused, Surendra Choudary, 22, was apprehended from his hometown in Rajasthan’s Jaipur and is believed to have collected over Rs 1 lakh.  He was brought to Hyderabad on a transit warrant and produced before the court. He was then remanded in 14 days judicial custody.
Choudary had created a portal similar to the Congress’s original website – DonateINC.net – cheating the public into donating to the accounts mentioned on the fake site, the police said. The fake portal has been removed, they added.
“We will seek police custody of the accused for questioning. As of now, it is not clear how many people did he cheat or how much money did he collect. He is believed to have collected over Rs 1 lakh since December. We need to investigate,” a police officer said.
The Cyber Crime police station of Hyderabad on January 10 received a complaint from Congress workers alleging that imposters were creating fake donation portals of their party. They alleged criminal conspiracy behind similar content that was circulating on social media platforms and said fraudsters were using fake logos of their organisation to malign the party.
An FIR was registered under Sections 66C (identity theft), and 66D (cheating by impersonation) of the Information Technology Act, and Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.
On Friday, Congress leader Ajay Maken took to social media to talk about the alleged scam. “We’ve taken serious note of a recent phishing scam via a fake website impersonating our official donation portal,” he wrote on X. With hashtag zero tolerance for fraud, he added, “The Cyber Crime Branch Hyderabad, has arrested the individual behind this fraud from Jaipur. This serves as a stern warning: We’re on high alert, and any malicious attempts against our digital assets will be met with stringent legal action. Contribute to the INC responsibly at http://DonateINC.net.”"
IH4RK94OTT_A7904A46NELKKIR,"Macron in India: For Delhi and Paris, a common Indo-Pacific vision",Rajiv Bhatia,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:31 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/macron-in-india-delhi-indo-pacific-vision-9127168/,"With French President Emmanuel Macron as the chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations this week, it is apt to highlight the deepening bilateral affinity in worldview and foreign policy. France, a resilient nation that turned from a vanquished state into a victorious ally in World War II, understands the value of military alliances as well as the imperative of retaining independence in external relations. Driven by similar impulses, India has created its own equilibrium from the heyday of the Non-Aligned Movement to the present era of multi-alignments. The ability to maintain multiple strategic partnerships while safeguarding its “strategic autonomy” makes New Delhi, with its growing political and economic weight, a preferred partner for Paris. This mutual empathy and the steady growth in bilateral cooperation are vividly reflected in their  Indo-Pacific policies.
In the past decade, the salience of the Indo-Pacific has grown substantially for both regional and extra-regional powers. The US-China contestation, supply chain constraints, climate change, and technological challenges have made the Indo-Pacific a central theatre of global geopolitics. This trend has remained unchanged, despite other major developments in the 2020s such as the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza conflict and the persistent impact of the pandemic on the global economy.
India has little difficulty in recognising France as “a resident power” in the Indo-Pacific. The latter is the only member state of the European Union (EU) that has territories in the region: La Reunion, Mayotte, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and others. France has the world’s second-largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after the US. It also has 1.65 million people in its départements and territories. Besides, it maintains over 7,000 military personnel to defend its sovereignty and contribute to regional security. Paris made public its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2018, with updates in 2021 and 2022. It played a key role, together with Germany and the Netherlands, to help the EU fashion its Indo-Pacific strategy.
France views the region as marked by growing polarisation and rising tensions. It supports multilateral cooperation, based on respect for “all sovereignties.” It is committed to building “a multipolar Asia.” Policies and actions by the states today, it believes, will determine the balance of power in the region tomorrow.
At the core of France’s Indo-Pacific policy lies the conviction that France and Europe have “interests to defend, values to promote and partnerships to forge” in the region. President Macron has stated that as “a fully-fledged Indo-Pacific country,” France aims to be a stabilising force, promoting the values of freedom, rule of law, and “rejection of coercion.” Its Indo-Pacific strategy has four key pillars: Security and defence, economic development and connectivity, promotion of effective multilateralism, and the commitment to the “common goods” including the ability to meet strict climate and biodiversity requirements of the region. Energy transition, Blue Economy and sustainable ocean development are included. It advocates the idea that the Indo-Pacific must be “one of the main priorities of our European agenda.”
In recent years, the Indo-French dialogue has progressively assigned greater attention to developing convergences in their perspectives. In 2018, the two governments articulated a joint strategic vision of cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. Five years later, they broadened it, discovering ample commonality in their assessments of the larger Indo-Pacific region. Even their definitions matched: While the French view the Indo-Pacific as stretching from “Djibouti to Polynesia”, India defines it as extending from “Kilimanjaro to California”. While presenting a shared vision of their strategic partnership in the next 25 years in a historic document Horizon 2047, they agreed to provide “concrete solutions to make Indo-Pacific an area of stability and sustainable development.” Further, to emphasise that this vision needs translation into reality, a jointly agreed “Roadmap” was issued last September.
The two countries have committed to enhancing cooperation in five major segments of the region: Africa, the Indian Ocean region, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Since even their combined resources are not adequate to shoulder responsibilities for such a vast region, Paris and New Delhi are fully conscious of the need to forge stronger collaboration with other stakeholders like the UAE, Japan, Australia, and ASEAN. All relevant fora — bilateral, trilateral, and multilateral — will be utilised for this purpose.
With France joining the maritime resources pillar of India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative (IPOI), the way has been cleared for activating this forum through specific projects. A new India-France enterprise — Indo-Pacific Triangular Development Cooperation Fund (IPTDC) — has been announced. Its modalities are under discussion. This holds promise, as the two countries are already early partners in building new institutions like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resistant Infrastructure.
Finally, two more observations need to be made. First, India — progressively close to Western democracies and assiduously befriended by G7 — and France, a member of the NATO and EU,  need to talk to each other more about China’s role in the Indo-Pacific. France’s views are moulded by a mix of mercantilist and strategic considerations. Of course, what the two governments discuss on this sensitive subject cannot be brought into the public domain. This is where their premier think tanks can step in by conducting a regular dialogue on the nature and magnitude of challenges posed by China’s aggressive behaviour, especially relating to the Philippines, South China Sea, South Pacific, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.
Second, it is satisfying to note that Paris and New Delhi have developed an ambitious plan for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific for the next 25 years. What they now need to focus is on devising a set of timelines for steadily implementing the proposals included in the agreed roadmap. By keeping their people informed of the progress in this realm, the two governments will help their cause, enhancing the credibility of their joint strategy.

This will be India’s first helicopter final assembly line to be set up by private sector players. The helicopters produced at the facility, which is expected to take about two years to be built, will be for the Indian market as well as for export to a few countries in India’s neighbourhood.
“Under this partnership, Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), a subsidiary of Tata Group, will set up the facility along with Airbus Helicopters,” Airbus said Friday, while announcing the deal. The announcement was made in conjunction with the state visit of French President Emmanuel Macron.
Airbus and the Tata group said the location of the proposed facility will be jointly decided by the two partners, without giving further details on the sites that may be under consideration. The two also did not provide financial details about the project.
“The FAL in India will undertake the integration of the major component assemblies, avionics and mission systems, installation of electrical harnesses, hydraulic circuits, flight controls, dynamic components, fuel system and the engine. It will also do testing, qualification, and delivery of the H125 to customers in India and the region. The FAL will take 24 months to set up and deliveries of the first ‘Made in India’ H125s are expected to commence in 2026,” Airbus said.
The proposed helicopter manufacturing facility will be the second aircraft FAL to be established in India by Airbus and TASL. The two are already building an FAL in Gujarat’s Vadodara to produce the C295 military transport aircraft.
“This collaboration marks a significant milestone in promoting indigenous manufacturing and will also give a major boost to our economy by creating diverse opportunities for employment and job creation, unlocking the potential of the Indian aerospace sector, and further solidifying Indo-France relations,” Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia posted on X (formerly Twitter).
Airbus expects the H125 production in India to “catalyse” the use of helicopters in the country. The company expects the helicopter to “revolutionise” passenger and goods transportation in India, along with increasing use segments like emergency medical services, disaster management, law enforcement, tourism, aerial work missions, and even regional air connectivity.
“Providing last mile connectivity to remote areas, the H125 will significantly contribute to the Government of India’s regional connectivity scheme—Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) that will further promote the tourism sector in the country,” Airbus said.
Helicopter use in India lags many other countries where choppers are routinely used for a number of purposes. India’s massive population and notable economic growth make it an attractive potential market for increased civil helicopter use.
“The H125 is the world’s best-selling single-engine helicopter that outclasses other helicopters in its category. This high-performing versatile helicopter is a member of Airbus’ Ecureuil family, which has accumulated more than 38 million flight hours worldwide. It can operate in high-and-hot and extreme environments and can be easily reconfigured for various missions, including aerial work, firefighting, law enforcement, rescue, air ambulance, passenger transport, and many others,” Airbus said."

Workers also demanded action into sexual harassment allegations levelled by female employees against some officials.
Babli, a contractual sanitation worker, said they have not been getting the minimum wage of Rs 17,494 per month. “I got only Rs 2,600 despite working seven days. My husband got only Rs 14,000 despite working for the whole month,” she said.
Another worker, Kavita Jain, said she was paid Rs 14,000 for working the whole month. “I am the only earning member in my family of four. My husband does not work anymore. We have two children to look after. This is injustice, that we are not getting even the minimum wages properly,” she said, adding that other workers have not received even half their salary.
“Many employees sitting on strike have been getting irregular salaries… sometimes Rs 9,000 and sometimes Rs 10,000,” she added.
Hospital authorities, however, denied the claim. A senior official from the hospital said salaries have been disbursed. The administration, meanwhile, has hired new sanitation workers for the maintenance of the hospital on a per day basis.
Dr Ashish Goyal, medical director at the hospital, remained unavailable for comment.
According to Harish Gautam, state executive member of Safai Kamgar Union, a delegation of workers Tuesday met the OSD to Delhi Labour Minister Raaj Kumar Anand and was assured of action in the next 24 hours. “It is unfortunate that despite meeting top officials at the Delhi CM’s office and Health Minister, there seems to be an administrative paralysis as workers’ issues remain unaddressed. If their demands are not met in the next 24 hours, then workers have resolved to tonsure their heads and perform ‘mundan’, symbolising that they have been abandoned by the Delhi government,” he added.

The morcha received a rousing reception from not only the Maratha community but also from other communities. While around 15,000 people joined the morcha from other districts in Pune and beyond, scores of people joined the rally in the city, due to which traffic moved at a snail’s pace.
At every junction in the city, Jarange-Patil was felicitated, garlanded and showered with flowers. As the Maratha activist stood out of a black SUV and waved to the crowd, the traffic on Nagar Road in Yerawada, Vimannagar, Kalyaninagar, Pune station area and Khadki was affected.
Though the traffic in core city areas, epsecially on the Pune-Ahmednagar Road, was badly affected, the Pune police played it down. “The morcha was stopping after few metres. The activist was felicitated and at some places, he also addressed the crowd… The traffic was affected in the areas through which the morcha passed,” commissioner of police Retesh Kumaarr told The Indian Express.
An array of vehicles accompanied Jarange-Patil right from Antarwali-Saraati, where he started his morcha on January 20. On the way, members from the Maratha community joined him in Beed, Ahmednagar and Pune districts. Many carried household items, including blankets and bedsheets, as Jarange-Patil asked his supporters to prepare for a long haul in Mumbai, where he will begin his hunger strike on January 26 to press his demand for reservation for the Maratha community.
The Pune police said the morcha was moving so slowly that it was supposed to reach Pune city area around 12 noon on Tuesday. “But it reached at 4 this morning ,” said police, adding that after taking a halt in Kharadi, the morcha started marching towards the city around 11am.
While Maratha activists said lakhs participated in the morcha when it entered Pune city limits, police estimated the crowd to be in the range of 15,000-20,000. “We believe that over 15,000 accompanied the activist while a few hundred joined him at every chowk in the city,” said the police chief.
Police said they had asked the participants of the morcha to avoid the routes near hospitals. ”They immediately cooperated,” said the police commissioner said.
On his part, Jarange-Patil said they had no objection to the police request and therefore, immediately agreed. “We didn’t want patients to suffer,” he told journalists.
While addressing the media, the Maratha activist also said that he did not nurse any hopes of joining politics. “I am an ordinary human being. I do not want to enter politics. One needs a lot of money to make it into politics…I am fighting for the common man. We are fighting only for reservation,” he said.
Jarange-Patil said the mammoth participation in the march showed the mood of the crowd. “The government gave us the word but is not keeping it. We gave seven months’ time to the government, but it failed to meet our demand. The government claims that it has found lakhs of Kunbi records but is doing nothing to issue caste certificates. The government has said that it will bring in a law for reservation but has done nothing. The OBC community is not asked to produce any records but the government wants Kunbi records from the Maratha community,” he said.
Asked about the restrictions imposed on entry of vehicles in Mumbai, the Maratha activist said there are no such restrictions. “We are going to Mumbai with a purpose of securing reservation for the Maratha community…The government has said that it has found 54 lakh Kunbi records…We want the government to issue caste certificates to those people, whose records have been found.”
Stating that the Maratha community was not holding anyone to ransom, the activist said, “We are seeking reservation so that the Maratha community also lives in peace. We are urging citizens only to provide us as glass of water as we pass through their streets and march towards Mumbai.”"

The Indian Express spoke to a few of them:
The Pran Pratisthan is not just a grand temple event. Ayodhya is a melting pot that is full of energy, with unity in diversity, and rediscovering the identity of an emerging Bharat marching towards Vishvaguru. Today was about taking spirituality beyond borders for a global good. There is a great amount of enthusiasm all over the city. It is like a second Diwali. People are on the roads distributing ladoos. Many devotees who have come here have walked long distances, even all the way from Lucknow. This is an unbelievable experience and a supercharged environment.

The Pran Pratisthan was a historic event where the connection with the past was established.
— Dr Nitin Karmalkar, former VC, SPPU
Ayodhya showed that great things happen when people come together with a purpose. Can we channelise this energy to bring in a Ramrajya of peace and happiness and a nationalistic spirit in each one of us to rise to the occasion beyond religion? There was so much positivity in the city, it was unbelievable. The streets were lined with people and we witnessed a shower of rose petals. The entire experience was phenomenal.
— Lt-Gen (retd) Madhuri Kanitkar, VC, Maharashtra University of Health Sciences
I have a project in Ayodhya, the Ramyana Wax Museum, and we have finished the foundation. The museum is one km from the main temple so, due to traffic controls, we have not been going there. I went to the main temple a few days ago and had a fantastic experience. Today, although I did not go to the temple, the whole of Ayodhya looks like heaven as it is decked up with fresh flowers and garlands. Every home is lit, like Diwali. There is a lot of VIP movement but shops are open and free food is being distributed all over the city. I, too, ate my fill. Tomorrow, I will go back to work.
— Sunil Kandalloor, Sunil’s Celebrity Wax Museum, Lonavala
We reached Ayodhya on January 17, having cycled from Pune on January 5. I could witness the city getting decorated as well as the Ram Mandir. Ayodhya Dham is so mesmerisingly beautiful with so much bhakti all around and seva being done by so many people. Although I am here in Ayodhya for the first time, I feel blessed to be able to witness history in the making. I didn’t go to the Ram Mandir in the day, but headed there in the evening. Though the city has been cordoned off for the last two days, with only VIP movement allowed, there are lakhs of devotees from all over the world. People are staying in temples, dharmashalas and tent cities that have been built for them. I have been to the Kar Sevak Puram, which has been built for the Kar Sevaks and other devotees who have come in.
— Deepak Bharadia, cyclist
I am truly honoured and grateful to be a part of an esteemed list of tall industry delegates called upon by the Prime Minister to witness this historic and monumental occasion at Ayodhya. It will forever be etched in the history of New India. As I seek the Lord’s blessings at this holy site, I look forward to cherishing this moment and to take back home with me blessings from this once-in-a-lifetime experience.
— Amit Kalyani, Joint MD, Bharat Forge
This was a historic occasion and I consider myself lucky to witness it. During Treta Yug, Lord Ram had ensured Ramrajya where everyone was happy. With the inauguration of the temple, I pray that such a kingdom of peace and equality also comes. May the problems of the farmers and the common people disappear. We need to work towards ensuring Ramrajya is established in our midst.

J1OJ64GL4K_2A3M0AQ456YJ01X,"India, US addressing Pannun controversy; Tesla awaits EV policy for entry: Mukesh Aghi",Divya A,"Updated: January 24, 2024 16:31 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/india-us-addressing-pannun-controversy-tesla-awaits-ev-policy-for-entry-mukesh-aghi-9120870/,"India and the United States (US) have sandboxed the controversy around the alleged plot to assassinate Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun as both countries are geopolitically aligned — with most US firms such as Apple Inc looking at India to de-risk their supply chain, Mukesh Aghi, President and Chief Executive Officer of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum told Divya A and Ravi Dutta Mishra.
On the much anticipated electric vehicle (EV) major Tesla’s entry into India, Aghi, who was in India briefly to participate in the Vibrant Gujarat Summit recently, said that there is no discussion on the same as Tesla is awaiting India’s EV policy and that the company’s entry would involve a strong chip manufacturing ecosystem and not just a battery ecosystem. Edited excerpts:
How has the Pannun incident impacted the India-US economic relationship?
There are multiple factors driving the India-US relationship. The Pannun incident is isolated and it has been sandboxed. It has been sandboxed because there is enough maturity on both sides. There is a sense that an incident like that should not derail the broader relationship.
You have what is called a geopolitical alignment. The US companies want to secure the supply chain. That is driving the relationship. The access to each other’s market is critical. Another factor is the five million Indian American population in the US. They comprise 1.5 per cent of the population but generate about six per cent of the gross domestic product. So they are affluent and are deeply engaged in political appointments too.
Has there been concrete discussion on Tesla’s entry into India?
There hasn’t been a discussion on Tesla. Tesla is waiting for government policy to come. But we have to look at Tesla not just purely from the EV perspective but from the perspective of how it can build an ecosystem for chip manufacturing.
A Tesla car requires around 2,000 chips. And if they plan to have a production facility to manufacture five lakh cars, think about the ecosystem. Tesla’s storage technology is world-class. So once the government policy gets streamlined, Tesla may come in. But there is no discussion at the moment.
Do you think the US will restore Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) status to India?
A congressional act can restore GSP but it is an election year and the administration will not push for anything that may upset unions and people who are against these things. The US has a tremendous trade deficit. So, my thinking is that this year it will be very difficult to get GSP restored.
How are investor sentiments given it’s an election year for both the US and India?
The state elections (in India) took place and it sent a message to the global investor community that there will be political stability going forward. So, at least the global investors are pricing in their thinking that this government will come back again.
There are a number of factors that are driving sentiments. Primarily, geopolitics. The aggressive positioning of China is a big factor. Every boardroom in the US is asking what is your China-plus-one strategy? Apple Inc is a great example. Next year we expect them to do 25 per cent of iPhone 16 manufacturing in India. So if a world class company is succeeding in India, they’re sending a message to other companies to move production in India.
Are the US and India looking to mutually eliminate non-tariff barriers?
Both countries are looking to bring down non-tariffs barriers. India has done that (imposed barriers such as quality control orders) because of the China factor. And India and the US will find a solution. But the message to the US companies is that you cannot bring all the components from China. If you look at EV too, one of the conditions that have been put is that you can’t bring cars from China at lower duty and sell them here.
Visa has been a concern. Is it a political problem like in the United Kingdom?
It is not a political issue in the US. The US has already issued record number of visas to Indians. Generally their constraint was lack of staff (at embassy) during Covid-19.
Today, we have around 272,000 Indian students in the US. Our objective is to take it to 500,000. We have been putting in a lot of requests to improve the staff. They have got temporary staff too."
J2DJQK20CT_XP1XAM9D8G0Q79L,Is there hope for Israel’s two forgotten hostages?,_,"January 22, 2024 19:28 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/is-there-hope-for-israels-two-forgotten-hostages-9122241/,"Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed have been held as hostages in Gaza since 2014 and 2015, respectively. Unlike the roughly 240 people kidnapped in the Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, the campaign for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed has received little publicity.
The two cases, and the similarities between them, tell a bigger story about how Israel views its hostages.
‘It’s very hard,’ say relatives
Hisham al-Sayed is an Israeli citizen, a Bedouin from the southern town of Hura. In 2015, he crossed the Gaza border and has been held there by Hamas ever since.
It wasn’t the first time al-Sayed crossed the border into the Gaza Strip. On previous occasions, he had been returned to Israel. This time, though, Hamas chose a different course of action.
The Islamist militant group, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the European Union, Germany, the United States and other governments, has said al-Sayed is an Israeli combatant. But rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) has insisted this is not the case, noting that he is a civilian.
“Hisham crossed the border to Gaza due to his illness,” his father Sha’aban al-Sayed told DW.
His family did not know his whereabouts for three months after he disappeared, until Hamas released a statement announcing he was being held in Gaza.
“As a family, this hits you where it hurts the most,” said Sha’aban al-Sayed.
‘A mentally ill person who got lost’
An Israeli Jew of Ethiopian descent, Avera Mengistu is originally from the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon.
In 2014, Mengistu crossed the border into Gaza on his own, only to be caught by Hamas. As in the case of Hisham al-Sayed, Hamas has argued he’s an Israeli soldier.
And just as with al-Sayed, HRW has said Mengistu is a civilian, not a combatant.
The similarities don’t end there. Mengistu is known to suffer from what HRW deemed “serious” mental health issues.
“Avera crossed one of the safest borders in the world, under the eyes of the security services,” recalled Gil Elias, a relative. “We’re talking about a mentally ill person who got lost.”
Hostage videos provide signs of life
Both families have received glimmers of hope over the years in the form of video footage of their loved ones in Hamas captivity.
A video of Mengistu, released in January 2023, showed him calling on the Israeli government to negotiate for his release.
“I recognized him right away,” said Gil Elias. “He looked to be in good physical shape from what we could gather.”
For the al-Sayed family, however, the impression they took away from the hostage footage released by the terrorist organization gave them cause for concern about Hisham’s physical condition. In a Hamas video released in June 2022, the Israeli Bedouin was seen lying in bed, connected to medical equipment.
Sha’aban al-Sayed said the video is supposed to put the families and the Israeli government under pressure.
“This is all part of Hamas’ psychological warfare,” he said.
Finding fault with Israel and Hamas
While there are many similarities between the two cases, the most significant difference is how criticism is expressed by each family, and who they say is to blame.
Gil Elias recalled how the Mengistu family trusted the Israeli government to bring Avera home. He said the family did not speak publicly about the matter for a year.
“We’re talking about a staunchly Zionist family,” he said, adding that the family did what it had been told to do by the government and remained silent. “This naivete is what’s been keeping Avera in Gaza for more than nine years.”
While the Mengistu family lays the blame on the Israeli government, the al-Sayed family said Hamas, and only Hamas, is responsible for their son’s situation. In their view, Hamas is acting against the religion of Islam by holding al-Sayed and Mengistu hostage.
“In Islam, the sins of the mentally ill don’t count,” said Sha’aban al-Sayed. “If they are only willing to release mentally ill people if they get something in return, they’re acting against Islam. They should stop saying they are a Muslim organization. I say these things as a Muslim myself.”
Two communities discriminated against in Israel
But that’s where the differences end. The families are in regular contact with one another, and both described relations as respectful and warm.
But the cases of Mengistu and al-Sayed also tell the bigger stories of their two respective communities — and the discrimination both face in Israel. Both the Bedouin and the Ethiopian communities suffer from structural discrimination in Israeli society.
While the campaign for the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on October 7 has been hard to miss across Israel’s streets and on social media, calls for the release of Mengistu and al-Sayed have been barely audible during the many years they have been held captive in Gaza.
October 7 brought a new awareness for hostages
The Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7 brought an unexpected development, with the fact that the Islamist group had taken more than 240 hostages transforming the issue into a national priority.
All of a sudden, the al-Sayed and Mengistu families were not alone anymore.
“In the beginning, no one was interested in us. The Holocaust that took place on October 7 — and I insist on calling it a Holocaust — has intensified interest in our case,” said al-Sayed.
Gil Elias described a similar situation, saying the fact that Hamas holds so many Israeli citizens hostage has “increased Avera’s chances.”
“Today I feel the warm hug we receive,” he said. “Avera may not be the main reason for this hug, but people understand his case a lot more clearly now.”
Families no longer feel abandoned
Just recently, Mengistu and al-Sayed were added to the list of names represented by the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum, meaning their names are included in the worldwide campaign for the release of the Israeli hostages.
Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Yarden Gat was taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, summed up the sentiments of many Israelis on his Instagram feed, writing, “Gil [Elias] has been experiencing this for nine years already.”
“If we would have been there with him and his family, maybe we all would have been spared this nightmare of more than 100 days.”
Talking about Israeli society’s perception of Mengistu’s case, Gil Elias believes it is about something much more than a hostage being held by a militant group.
“I always say that Avera’s case is Israeli society’s citizenship test,” he said. “And it’s a test we have failed.”"

Some fans also felt like the song sounded quite like BTS’ “Dynamite”. Now, director Siddharth Anand has opened up about these similarities and said that the notes of “Sher Khul Gaye” and “Stayin’ Alive” are similar.
In a chat with Zoom, when the director was asked about the comparisons, he said, “I think it is those notes which are similar and that always will happen. Like you will have a song that is not inspired but has similar notes and similar progressions.” The director then hummed the “Radha” song from Student of the Year and said that the “scanning is very similar” to Aap Ki Kasam’s “Jai Jai Shiv Shankar”.
“It’s the same scanning but it’s not copied. The scanning is similar so you can’t say it’s copied. These are things you have to, as a technician and as a professional, you have to understand, recognise that this is okay. That scanning is similar but it’s not lifted,” he said. When asked about his opinion on the music of Fighter, the director said, “I think they are great songs to listen to, to see and once you see them in the film, you’ll get more attached to them. They are very hummable.”
Sung by Vishal & Sheykhar, Benny Dayal, Shilpa Rao, and composed by Vishal & Sheykhar with lyrics by Kumaar, “Sher Khul Gaye” released online in December. So far, the music of Fighter has generated a positive response from fans but the euphoria for the film’s album has been much lesser than Pathaan. Siddharth Anand’s 2023 film also had music by Vishal & Sheykhar.

J9DED8IRV6_E59NDY5OY9CIWKD,Google to deliver world’s most advanced AI in 2024? Leaked internal document reveals company’s AI goals,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 08:36 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-ai-leaked-documents-9123874/,"In 2023, we witnessed the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence in various industries. The invention of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its success led to an AI arms race with many tech giants working towards becoming the leader in the space. Meta, Google, and Microsoft were all seen scrambling to offer the most powerful AI in their products and services.
Even as OpenAI continues to lead the pack, Google has been making some rapid strides in AI. Now, a new leak seems to have indicated that Google has set the goal of delivering the world’s most advanced, safe, and responsible AI. This has been revealed by an internal document that was accessed by The Verge.
The internally shared document also included six other goals. These goals are “to improve knowledge, learning, creativity, and productivity; Build the most helpful personal computing platforms and devices; ⁠Enable organisations and developers to innovate on Google Cloud; Provide the world’s most trusted products and platforms, Build a Google that’s extraordinary for Googlers and the world; Improve company velocity, efficiency, and productivity, and deliver durable cost savings,” etc.
It needs to be noted that since the beginning of the month, Google has been laying off its employees. The goal of  “improving company velocity, efficiency, and productivity, and deliver durable cost savings” – points to more layoffs. The fact that Google’s Bard has not gained any ground and hasn’t succeeded yet as a standalone AI product on the levels of ChatGPT, has placed immense pressure on the tech giant. In order to catch up in AI and to maintain its momentum and dominance in search, Google is leaving no stone unturned.
Even though Google unveiled Gemini last year, based on the benchmarks, it is barely able to keep up with OpenAI. Also, it is rumoured that OpenAI has already started working on the next major update to GPT-4. Meanwhile, Google has been implementing its AI into existing suites of products such as Pixel smartphones, business apps, and generative AI search.
Although Google has not been able to create something on par with ChatGPT, there have been talks that the tech giant may be working on a new chatbot powered by the most capable Gemini Ultra model. Microsoft’s cloud business is growing rapidly thanks to OpenAI and is likely to outpace Google."

Following the incident, the Assam Rifles categorically emphasised that it is not an outcome of the ongoing ethnic conflict in the state.
According to sources, the incident took place on Wednesday morning after the personnel had returned from his home in Churachandpur after leave. It took place in an Assam Rifles battalion in South Manipur near the Indo-Myanmar.
On Wednesday morning, the personnel picked up a weapon and allegedly fired at his colleagues, injuring six. He then used the same weapon to shoot himself.
The injured personnel have been evacuated to a military hospital and are reportedly stable.
A statement from the PRO of the IG Assam Rifles (South) said that all the injured are non-Manipuri.
“In light of the ongoing ethnic strife in Manipur, it is important to share the details of the incident transparently to dispel any potential rumours and avoid any speculation. This unfortunate incident should not be correlated with the ongoing conflict, given the fact that none of the injured are from Manipur,” it said.
It added: “All Assam Rifles battalions have mixed class composition, including those belonging to various communities from Manipur. All personnel have been staying and operating together despite polarisation of society to maintain peace and stability in Manipur.”"

The complainant rushed to the spot when she saw that her son was hiding behind a wall.
When she inquired, the four-year-old told her that, “an uncle believed that I had knocked on the door, so he hit me with a stick due to which I am hiding”.
The 23-year-old inquired about the suspect in the locality, following which she came to know about the person and confronted him.
“The accused threatened her to do whatever she wanted to do. He further claimed that he is not afraid of anyone after which the woman arrived at the police station and lodged a complaint,” said an officer.
The officials from Navghar police station said that a case has been registered but the suspect has not been arrested. “Our investigation is still underway, we will probe the matter in detail and accordingly take necessary action against the offender,” said an officer."

The yatra was stopped for over two hours at Haibargaon in Nagaon, and around 9:30 am, only Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi and Batadrava MLA Sibamoni Bora were allowed past the barricades to visit the Than.
On Sunday, the president of the Than management committee had written to Bora, saying Rahul would not be allowed inside the premises before 3 pm on Monday since thousands of people would gather there in the morning to mark the pran pratishtha at the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma too had said Rahul should visit the Than after the Ayodhya ceremony had concluded.
Located in Nagaon district, the Batadrava Than, or Bordowa Than, is one of the most sacred sites for Assamese Vaishnavites. The Than is situated at the birthplace of revered Vaishnavite reformer-saint Srimanta Sankardeva (1449-1568).
According to the Nagaon district’s website, “Sankardeva founded the first-ever Kirtan Ghar at Bordowa in 1494 AD to practise and preach the neo Vaishnavite faith during the fifteenth century in Assam, and propagated the Ek Saran Naam Dharma.”
The Ek Saran Naam Dharma focussed on worship in the form of bhakti (devotion) to Lord Krishna, through singing and congregational listening of His name and deeds.
Sankardeva espoused a society based on equality and fraternity, free from caste differences, orthodox Brahmanical rituals and sacrifices. His teaching focused on prayer and chanting (naam) instead of idol worship. His dharma was based on the four components of deva (god), naam (prayers), bhakats (devotees), and guru (teacher).
The Neo-Vaishnavite reformist movement that Sankardeva started is behind the monastic institutions called Thans/Sattras that dot Assam. As the saint travelled across Assam, spreading his teachings, these Sattras/Thans were established as centres of religious, social and cultural reforms in the 16th century. Today, the Sattras promulgate Sankardeva’s unique “worship through art” approach with music (borgeet), dance (xattriya) and theatre (bhauna). Each Sattra has a naamghar (worship hall) as its nucleus and is headed by an influential “Sattradhikar”.
Are these Thans politically significant?
Identity has always been an important strain of Assam politics, and the Thans/Sattras are a component of Assamese identity. As one of the most prominent Thans, the Batadrava Than is often visited by politicians. The BJP, specially, has sought to make “land grabbing around Sattras by illegal settlers” an electoral issue.
In September last year, CM Sarma had said the Assam government was planning to bring in a law barring “non-indigenous people” from purchasing land in an eight-kilometre radius around the Batadrava Than. During an event to mark Sankardeva’s 575th birth anniversary, Sarma had said: “We are making efforts for a law so that people other than indigenous folks cannot buy land around it. In the meantime, I have told the DC also that till the Act is not finalised, they should not give permission to people other than indigenous people to buy and sell land around here.”
In 2021, Home Minister Amit Shah had launched a beautification project at the Batadrava Than, earmarking Rs 188 crore for its development."

The centre did receive a few nominations, but there were some technical issues with their applications as some of them have not attached the vigilance status report, a source said.
In a letter to these Chief Secretaries sent on January 15, Under Secretary Sanjeev Kumar said, “I am directed to refer to this Ministry’s letter subject; filling up of the post of Joint Secretary (Security) in Lok Sabha Secretariat on deputation and to say that the Lok Sabha Secretariat is in the process for filling up of the post of Joint Secretary (Security) in Level 14 in the Pay Matrix in Lok Sabha Secretariat to be filled up on deputation basis amongst officers of Indian Police Service empanelled to hold IG level posts at the Centre.”
In his last letter, Kumar had mentioned, “Post of JS in Lok Sabha Secretariat to be filled up on deputation basis amongst officers of Indian Police Service empanelled to hold IG level posts at the Centre.”
An official said the post of Joint Secretary (Security) has been vacant after incumbent Raghubir Lal, a 1997-batch IPS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre, was transferred to his home state as Additional Director General (ADG) in the first week of November last year. Last year, the deputation tenure of Lal was extended up to October 20. Since then, a director-level officer has been looking after the work of JS on a temporary basis.
On December 13, 2023, Lucknow resident Sagar Sharma and Mysuru’s Manoranjan D, jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the visitors’ gallery, shouted slogans, and opened canisters that emitted yellow smoke, triggering panic among parliamentarians.
After the Parliament security breach, the MHA ordered an inquiry into the incident and also asked the paramilitary outfit Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to carry out a survey of its premises for regular deployment on a comprehensive pattern."

In a statement, the Superintendent of Police, Imphal West, detailed the security arrangements in and around Kangla, and confirmed that the Arambai Tenggol — a radical group with a large number of volunteers in valley areas — “has summoned all the ministers and MLA belonging to the valley districts at Kangla at 10 am”.
The SP said “they are planning to enter Kangla with arms before the programme”. Kangla Fort served as the royal seat of the Manipur kingdom till 1891.
As per the statement, police officers and personnel including VDF (village defence force), Home Guards, CAPF (Central Armed Police Forces) and Army/Assam Rifles personnel have been deployed in and around Kangla since Tuesday morning “in order to deny and stop the entry of armed Arambai Tengil members at Kangla”.
Deployments have been made inside the fort and at all four gates of the complex.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a Facebook page purportedly run by Arambai Tenggol leader Kouranganba Khuman claimed that a team of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which landed in Manipur a day earlier, had met with unit commanders of the group.
A three-member special team from the MHA had reached Manipur on Monday with the aim of peace talks with both the communities and to assess the current situation in the state.
Claims that the group had met with the MHA team sparked discontent among the Kuki-Zomi community. The Kuki Inpi Manipur – the apex body of Kuki tribes in the state – stated that it is “profoundly disturbed” by the development.
“The unsettling meeting raises grave apprehensions regarding the Ministry of Home Affairs’ strategy for addressing the protracted ethnic crisis, now spanning eight months. Furthermore, it seems fitting for the Ministry of Home Affairs to take decisive action against terrorist organisations like Arambai Tenggol, its patrons, and sympathisers… The Kuki Inpi Manipur earnestly implores the Ministry of Home Affairs to not only scrutinise the alarming situation but also to proactively bring an end to the reign of terror imposed by entities such as Arambai Tenggol, its supporters, and those sympathetic to its chauvinistic cause,” it stated."
JR9XO6COEV_XJGIITD6H6J73J6,‘No devotee should go hungry’: Ayodhya godown turns hub of all donations as lakhs pour in after Ram Lalla consecration,Lalmani Verma,"Updated: January 25, 2024 08:05 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/ayodhya-godown-turns-hub-of-all-donations-as-lakhs-pour-in-after-ram-lalla-consecration-9126016/,"A makeshift godown of 1,500 square metre at Ramsevakpuram in Ayodhya – plenished with sacks of wheat flour and rice, tin containers of desi ghee, refined and mustard oil, roti-making machines, and water bottles – is acting as the feeder hub for lakhs of devotees pouring in at the temple town to have a darshan of the Ram Lalla.
Its purpose: No devotee should go hungry in Ayodhya.
The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) have received edible items, including grains, flour, vegetables, and spices in the form of donations from several North Indian states for running bhandaras (community feasts) and feed devotees and workers of the Sangh Parivar turning up at the town after the consecration ceremony of the Ram Lalla.
VHP national secretary Rajendra Singh Pankaj said nearly 4,500 volunteers were working to cook and serve meals at different bhandaras in the city. He said that a few lakh devotees were expected to turn up in Ayodhya after the inauguration of the Ram temple. “You can see the crowd turning up. No devotee should go hungry in Ayodhya. That is the objective of running these bhandaras. Several organisations are donating ingredients and vegetables,” said Pankaj, who is supervising the bhandaras on behalf of the VHP, adding that ration from the Ramsevakpuram godown is being supplied to the bhandaras according to their needs and demands.
As the footfall of devotees in the town started increasing ahead of the consecration ceremony, the VHP and various social organisations started running over 40 bhandaras in different parts of the town every day from morning to evening since January 14. These bhandaras will continue serving food to the devotees up to February 26 in the first phase. But VHP leaders are considering extending it up to March 31 seeing the influx of devotees.
Two bhandaras are running from mobile vans, which are moving on the streets in the town. In these bhandaras, people are served puri-sabji, daal-chawal, khichdi, sabi-roti, kheer, and sweets such as laddoos and doodh-jalebi. Tea with biscuits and rusk are also being served at different locations. It is estimated that more than a lakh people were having meals at these bhandaras everyday for free.
Between January 24 and February 23, workers of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP will be visiting Ayodhya according to a schedule for darshan of Ram Lalla. RSS volunteers from two prants (regional units), of 5,000 volunteers from each unit, will come daily from January 26. The RSS has 45 regional units across the country. RSS volunteers of Kashi and Kanpur prants will visit on January 30, and volunteers from Awadh and Gorakhpur region will arrive on February 1. Apart from them, the BJP will also bring devotees and workers from different states.
The Sangh Parivar will be organising a guided tour of the Ram temple for people from across the country to ensure that the temple fervour does not die down, and the momentum remains the same even after the consecration ceremony.
“The arrangement for their stay, food, and temple visits will be arranged by the VHP and BJP workers. They will stay in the tent city setup by the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Three people can be accommodated in each tent,” said a VHP functionary.
Donations for bhandaras are pouring in from different states. Social organisations in BJP-ruled Assam have sent tea, ginger, cinnamon leaf, and black pepper from Assam. The VHP has received 12 trucks of rice, three trucks of tomato, and two trucks of other vegetables, including cauliflower, and bottle gourd from the BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh.
Rice and arhar dal have come from the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh; three trucks of ghee, mustard oil, and refined oil have come from another BJP-ruled state, Rajasthan. Six trucks of sugar have come from Lakhimpur and Gonda districts of Uttar Pradesh. Over 2,100 tin containers of mustard oil and 1,000 containers of refined oil have come from Gujarat. One truck of desi ghee has come from Maharashtra.
A nationalised bank has donated flour mixing and automatic roti-making machines.
The VHP has also received 8 lakh ladoos from Madhya Pradesh, 56 varieties of pethas from Agra. They have also received biscuits, soya chunks, sooji, salt, disposable plates, glasses, water bottles, coal for cooking, quilts and blankets. A private company has sent 1,000 tubes of antiseptic cream for distribution among devotees. These donations for bhandaras started arriving earlier this month.
Pankaj, however, said donations were coming from the North Indian states only. He said that people from Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh were also sending donations. “State governments are not sending. Only social organisations were sending donations,” he said.
Ramadhar Shukla, the RSS district sanghchalak of Chitrakoot, maintains the record of supply of things from the godown for bhandaras. “Donations are coming from Ram bhakts for Ram bhakts. Various organisations are running the bhandaras at different locations such as Saraswati Mandir, Udaseen Ashram, Ramkatha Sanghrahaya, Hanuman Gufa, Karsevakpuram and other areas. Apart from Hindus, the bhandaras are also run by Sikh Sangats and Christian communities,” said Shukla, who has been camping in Ayodhya for the past one month."

“It is an unholy attempt for an unholy alliance, and its fate was destined. Keeping ‘INDIA’ as the name doesn’t bring the spirit of India,” Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar told PTI after Mamata’s statement. Significantly, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann also announced that AAP would contest alone in the state. However, this drew no immediate reaction from the BJP. Party spokespersons in Delhi also did not respond to messages seeking reactions.
At a press conference in Delhi, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) chief and the party’s Bengaluru South MP Tejaswi Surya said, “The INDI alliance is an unnatural alliance like a snake and mongoose. So it is dying a natural death. In Bengal, TMC, CPM and Congress keep fighting. In Kerala, the Left and Congress keep fighting. AAP and the Congress fight in Punjab and Delhi. It is a non-starter of an alliance.”
“The (INDIA) alliance was not politically viable in Bengal because the CPM and Congress are contesting against TMC,” said West Bengal BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar. “INDI alliance has broken apart. Without leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar and Akhilesh Yadav, what is INDIA, and this bickering is against the policy and attitude of the Congress. It is a big setback for the Congress,” former Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai told PTI."

“The Maldives has always been a welcoming destination for vessels of friendly countries and continues to host both civilian and military vessels making port calls for peaceful purposes,” an official statement by the foreign ministry said, and added that the vessel would not be conducting any research while in Maldivian waters.
“Such port calls not only enhance bilateral ties between the Maldives and its partner countries, but also demonstrate the centuries old tradition of the Maldivian people welcoming vessels from friendly countries,” it added.
It further stated that the Maldives continues to uphold international best practices, and relevant international maritime law on all such cases.
On Monday, open source intelligence researcher Damien Symon wrote on X that the Chinese vessel Xiang Yang Hong 03 was en-route to Male, and “is entering the Indian Ocean Region, displaying its destination as Male, the vessel is expected to run an ocean survey operation in the Indian Ocean Region raising concern in #India”.
According to a Reuters report, an Indian military official confirmed Symon’s finding and said they are monitoring its movement.
Meanwhile, India has not made any statement regarding the vessel’s movement.
New Delhi has in the past flagged similar visits by other Chinese research vessels with its other littoral neighbour Sri Lanka, which has denied permission for such vessels to dock on its ports since 2022.
The latest development also comes in the wake of a diplomatic row between the two countries, after three deputy ministers in the Maldivian government posted derogatory comments on social media against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over photographs of his trip to Lakshadweep.
Last week, Muizzu’s government announced that it has set a March 15 deadline for India to withdraw its military personnel from the country. “Indian military personnel cannot stay in the Maldives. This is the policy of President Dr Mohamed Muizzu and that of this administration,” Ahmed Nazim, policy director at the President’s Office said, according to the SunOnline newspaper.
The deadline, however, was not mentioned in the statements issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) as well as the Maldives Foreign Office.
Relations between traditional friends New Delhi and Male have soured since President Mohamed Muizzu took office in November riding an ‘India Out’ campaign."

JX5XWZ4MC0_IL7O3JDBE8SVBZI,Siddharth Anand says Fighter dialogues viewed ‘out of context’ as Pak actors slam trailer of Hrithik Roshan starrer: ‘Bharat ki picture hai ye’,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 10:28 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/siddharth-anand-fighter-dialogues-out-of-context-pak-actors-slam-trailer-hrithik-roshan-9125055/,"Filmmaker Siddharth Anand says his latest aerial actioner Fighter, whose trailer was met with divided reactions on the internet for being jingoistic, is not an anti-Pakistan film but a “happy Indian patriotic” feature that is against terrorism. The film is headlined by Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone.
When the trailer of Fighter was dropped online last week, X (formerly Twitter) users were divided, with a section appreciating its mammoth scale and VFX while the other calling out its jingoistic tone and dialogues. Some Pakistani celebrities like Hania Aamir, Adnan Siddiqui and Zara Noor Abbas said the trailer was aggressive with a strong anti-Pakistan sentiment with dialogues like “India Occupied Pakistan.”

During a media interaction on Tuesday, the filmmaker was asked his reaction on Pakistani celebrities calling out his film. The director said he is aware of the conversation and stated that Fighter is based on a true incident and what the team has depicted is what happened in real life.
“It is out there in public domain, so it is nothing new we have done. Somethings that you are talking about… which may have offended them, I would want them to see the film and see the context in which what has happened and what has been said and then react. This is out of context, because it’s in a trailer. If I play out the full story in it, why will you come to the theatre? I will raise some questions, and to get the answer you will come in the theatres. That’s what this has done, it has serviced exactly that motive. In a way I am happy it has done that, made people inquisitive.

“Come to the theatre, it will answer all your questions, you will understand the context of it, the emotion behind it, and you will be satisfied. Everyone will understand what we are saying. The primary thing I want to reiterate and what has been said in the film is that our war is not against a country, it is against terrorism. That is what Fighter stands for. It is a fight against terrorism, not against a particular country. That is emphasised throughout the film.”


A post shared by Hrithik Roshan (@hrithikroshan)
In a follow-up question, Siddharth was asked about the dialogues–especially the ones mouthed by Hrithik Roshan– being “borderline jingoistic”, especially coming from him after helming a progressive patriotic film like Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan last year.
When asked how would he justify the language, Siddharth said he would call the film “more nationalistic than jingoistic.” He continued, “Obviously, there are certain things that are being viewed out of context. jingoism is a matter of perspective. I call it nationalistic These lines in the context of a film are being told to a terrorist, that don’t keep pushing us… Like I said, please watch the film otherwise this can spur unnecessary controversy which the goal of the film isn’t.
“It is a happy Indian film, ‘Bharat ki picture hai ye’ and I would not want it to get any other attention other than the fact that it is a patriotic film,” he added.
The media interaction was attended by Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor. Fighter is set to release on Thursday.

JXCGHSVGTO_PHFQL2ASFABYB3G,"Lack of adequate police deployment at sensitive places, rumour of firing and some provocation saw unfolding of violence in Mira Road",Vijay Kumar Yadav,"Updated: January 29, 2024 20:46 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mira-road-communal-clash-amid-lack-of-adequate-police-force-how-violence-unfolded-in-naya-nagar-9126520/,"A mix of provocative slogans, rumours and a surprising absence of local police is what is said to have led to the violence in Naya Nagar on Sunday night disturbing the communal fabric of the distant suburb of Mira Road.
The violence first flared after a procession of vehicles, including modified bikes with saffron flags, passed in front of Taini villa masjid and Mohammed masjid on Lodha Road. “The bikers were shouting religious slogans. Some of the bikes had modified silencers which emitted a sound that many felt was like a gun being fired. A few locals rushed to see if bullets were being fired towards the masjid and that led to panic with the bikers trying to escape. One of the bikers bumped into a bystander leading to a fight,” said Shaukat Ali, 52, a taxi driver who witnessed the incident.
The incident subsequently escalated with locals assaulting members of the procession. A woman who is said to have been part of the procession was also injured. “In the heat of things one vehicle which was part of the procession, in a bid to escape, turned into a lane which had a mosque on it. The lane is a dead-end and locals felt that the people in the car had come with some ulterior motive which again led to violence,” Ali said. The police has confirmed the same sequence of events behind the first incident.
The police have registered a case based on the complaint of a car driver, Vinod Babulal Jaiswal, in which people have been booked for attempt to murder.
“Jaiswal, a Bhayander resident, told us he had come to tour the area. While we have registered a case against those who assaulted him, we are also probing why Jaiswal entered Naya Nagar carrying saffron flags and shouted slogans,” a police officer said.
Things subsequently went out of hand after the video of the initial assault was circulated throughout Mira Road. Violence soon engulfed various parts of the suburb with rampaging mobs targeting one community and shops.
At least 12 FIRs were filed and nearly 23 arrests were made by the Naya Nagar, Kashi Mira, Navghar Bhayander and Pelhar police stations. More people may be arrested soon. The police identified 52 objectionable and inflammatory posts on social media and managed to take down 20 of them and are in the process of taking down others. Two FIRs pertain to posting and spreading objectionable content on social media.
Locals, meanwhile, claimed the local police initially were unprepared to handle the situation that erupted in Naya Nagar. The Naya Nagar police chowki, which is a stone’s throw away from the spot where violence first erupted, did not have adequate manpower.
A senior police officer said in view of the Pran Pratishta ceremony in Ayodhya the police had anticipated areas with a high population of Muslims may require heavy security deployment.
“We anticipated it but missed deploying heavy security in the area. Rallies were being carried out one day prior to the incident. Intensifying patrolling in the area may have prevented the first incident and its further snowballing. And of course, the police were helpless too. Politicians were even asking the police why rally members were being lathicharged. We told them whatever we are doing is to prevent further violence,” a senior police officer said.
The Kashi Mira Road police station on Tuesday night filed an FIR against 15 people and arrested four persons. The police filed one FIR and mentioned four separate incidents of violence in it. On the complaint of Kashimira resident Nadeem Sortiya, a manager at Kareem’s hotel, the police arrested Ganesh Gupta, Sumit Savita, Saurav Koli, Bhavesh Kaya and 11 others. Nadeem said, “On Tuesday evening 10-15 people were traveling on two-wheelers. They stopped in front of our hotel, pelted stones at the hotel causing damages and injuring our delivery boy Wasim Kalmaniya.”
Dr Azimuddin Sayyed from Hum Bhartiya Mira Bhayander organisation said, “It was not a communal incident, but a political incident. The shouting of slogans in the area was being done for the past few days. People have to understand that some people want violence to happen. They are doing it intentionally as part of their political strategy to create rift in the two communities.”
After the incident, police placed barricades on entry and exits of key roads at many places, mainly with high Muslim population, in Mira Road. Meanwhile, Mira Road MLA Geeta Jain courted controversy stating the Hindu community needed only five minutes to show its power."

She hastened to add that issues concerning other states were not, entirely in her hands. “Even if I convince my partymen, other parties may not be ready to accept the solution,” she said.
Indo-Pak visas
India and Pakistan agreed to issue double-entry tourist visas and sign a protocol on the promotion of group tourism soon. These are among the decisions taken during the three-day meeting of the India-Pakistan Joint Commission’s two sub-commissions to expand cooperation in the fields of travel, tourism, information, education, culture and sports. One of the subcommissions decided that the two countries would also arrange exchange visits of artists, poets, writers and experts in various fields besides exchange exhibitions of paintings, photographs, handicrafts and folkcrafts.
Tax talks
The Union Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, and the top industrialists of the country spoke on different wave-lengths on matters of taxation when they met to discuss the forthcoming budget. While the Finance Minister favoured a more elastic tax system to fetch more revenues, the industrialists wanted the incidence of both direct and indirect taxes to be reduced.
Tarzan dies
Johnny Weismuller, the five-time Olympic swimming champion who thrilled millions as Tarzan of the Jungle, died at his home, a funeral home spokesman said. He was 79. Weismuller had been ill for a long time after a series of strokes.

“The Government will meet all his demands. A delegation will meet him to convey the government’s message that all his demands have been accepted,” Mangesh Chivate, Officer on Special Duty in Chief Minister’s Office, told The Indian Express Thursday evening.
Chivate said that a copy of the government resolution (GR) which will contain his demands as well will be handed over to him somewhere before Navi Mumbai where he is expected to reach past midnight and then land in Mumbai during afternoon to launch his hunger strike.
“Government officials will meet Jarange Patil before he heads for Mumbai. We will hand over a copy of the GR to him,” Chivate said.
Asked whether Chief Minister Eknath Shinde will meet the activist, Chivate said that will not be required as the government officials will meet him and tell him about the acceptance of all his demands.
One of the main demands of Jarange Patil includes issuing caste certificates to all 54 lakh citizens whose Kunbi records have been found. “This is among the other demands which have been accepted,” Chivate said.
On the other hand, Jarange Patil insisted that he will not meet any officials. He said he was ready to hold a discussion only with the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.
“I am ready to hold discussions with Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and two deputy chief ministers…They should come and meet me,” Jarange Patil told reporters after reaching Lonavala along with hundreds of Maratha community members.
A delegation of government officials had met Jarange Patil and conveyed a message from the chief minister.“I held discussions with officials. I put forth my demands. The officials said they will speak to the chief minister. If every time, they want to say the same thing, then why is the chief minister himself not talking to me? He should come and meet me… I am ready to hold discussions with them,” Jarange Patil said.
The activist, however, said there will be no closed-door talks. “The discussions should be held in full public view,” he said. “We are interested in the resolution of our problems. We do not want to go on and on. It is very cold. Everyone has to suffer. The government should meet our demands, then we will take a call about our hunger strike. Let them first hold discussions,” he said.
“I will begin my fast at Azad Maidan and not in Navi Mumbai as is being suggested. We have come prepared to stay put in Mumbai for a longer period. The fast will be held only at Azad Maidan. I do not know whether permission has been given or not,” Jarange Patil said earlier in the day."

The farmers, who were members of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), were detained as they wanted to show black flags to state Revenue and Water Supplies Minister Brahm Shankar Jimpa, who had arrived in the district to unfurl the national flag on the occasion of Republic Day.
“They have been taken to some undisclosed location but our tractor march will continue…it is on several demands but in Mansa, the Kulerian village issue has also been included,” social activist Narian Dutt, the president of the Punjab Inqlaabi Manch, told The Indian Express.
The farmers have been protesting outside the office of the Budhlada deputy superintendent of police for the past 20 days over the ownership rights for the farmland in Kulerian village where farmers have been tilling the fields for decades but the land ownership is in the government’s name.
Gurdeep Singh Rampura, senior vice-president of BKU Dakaunda (Dhaner faction) and Makhan Singh Bhainibagha, the state committee member of BKU Dakaunda are among those detained.
The detentions took place even as thousands of farmers across Punjab took part in the tractor parade – organised after a two-year gap on January 26 – following a call by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella organisation of farmer unions.
Thousands of farmers took part in the parade, displaying the tricolour and their union’s flag on the tractors. Many said they have taken a pledge “to fight against the diktat of the Union government”. The parade will be held in nearly 500 districts across the country.
In Bathinda, the tractor march was led by 20-year-old Baldeep Kaur, a young farmer from Mehma Bhagwana village in the district. “Even in the Kisan Andolan (farmers’ struggle) she had led the first tractor march of Punjab in July 2020,” Baldeep’s father Jagseer Singh said.
The tractor parade by 37 farmer unions in Punjab, under the banner of SKM, will continue at the district and tehsil level till 1 pm. Later, the BKU (Ugrahan) will hold a separate march. “We are not going to give any memorandum to anyone…but it is a reminder to the (Narendra) Modi government and the state government about our unfulfilled promises,” said Manjit Singh Dhaner, president of BKU Dakaunda (Dhaner).
“SKM is holding the tractor parade at the district level in all the states and Union Territories. It is expected that the parade shall be held in at least 500 districts. SKM appeals to farmers to join the parade in great numbers, and after the conclusion of the formal parade in Delhi, the tractor parade will be held,” Buta Singh Burjgill, member of SKM’s National Coordination Committee (NCC) said.
“Thirty-seven farmer unions in Punjab under the SKM banner held a meeting in Ludhiana on Thursday morning… We took an oath before kickstarting the parade, pledging that we believe in the Constitution of India. But the current government is acting against it so we took a pledge to fight against this diktat of the Union government,” Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of farmer union BKU Dakaunda, told The Indian Express.
In Barnala, the tractor march was held under the leadership of BKU Dakaunda (Dhaner) president Manjit Singh Dhaner. “The tractors were serviced and farmers will peacefully hold the parade,” Dutt said.
“The farmers will take a pledge to protect the principles of democracy, federalism, secularism, and socialism enshrined in the Constitution of India. Along with tractors, other vehicles and motorbikes will also take part in the parade,” NCC member Avik Saha said.
In Haryana’s Jind, SKM leader Azad Palwa said that farmers from different villages gathered at their respective district headquarters ahead of the tractor parade. “In Jind, the farmers have identified a 12 km route for the tractor march. We are expecting over 2,500 tractors during the Jind march,” Palwa said.
Besides farmer organisations, trade unions are also participating in the tractor march.
The farmers have been demanding a legal guarantee for MSP based on the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission report, an extension of MSP to other crops, withdrawal of cases registered against farmers during the farmer protest and for burning paddy, and provision of a Rs 10,000 pension per month for farmers aged 60 and above, among others.
The SKM had held the first tractor parade on Republic Day on the Delhi borders during the farmer agitation against the three contentious farm laws in 2021. Although the route of the parade was outside Delhi, many farmers had entered Red Fort and several farmers were booked. Many FIRs have not yet been quashed, as per reports. Although the farm laws were repealed on November 19, 2021, the SKM says that most of the demands have not yet been implemented, despite written assurances.
Key demands
* Legal guarantee for MSP based on recommendations of Swaminathan Commission report; extension of MSP to other crops
* Waiver of loans raised by farmers and farm labourers
* Provision of a Rs 10,000 pension per month for farmers aged 60 and above
* Withdrawal of cases registered against farmers during their 13-month-long agitation over 2020-21, and for burning paddy
* Compensation for families of farmers who died during the 2020-2021 agitation
* Action against the accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri case
* Free electricity, and withdrawal of Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2022"

The President’s greeting “from the Government and the people of the Maldives” to “the Government and the people of India,” came in the backdrop of a diplomatic row between the two nations over several issues that unfolded after China-leaning Muizzu took the oath of office in November last year.

Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer and two former presidents, Mohamed Nasheed and Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, too wished India on their social media platforms.
A statement from Muizzu’s office said the President sent greetings and good wishes to the President and Prime Minister of India in separate messages and conveyed greetings and extended his heartfelt felicitations.
Muizzu “underscored the Maldives-India bond nurtured by centuries of friendship, mutual respect, and a deep sense of kinship,” and expressed hope for “continued peace, progress, and prosperity” for the Government and people of India for years to come, the statement said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Zameer congratulated his counterpart S Jaishankar and the friendly people of India with “warmest greetings and sincere good wishes” and said, in a post on X, “I am confident that the close bonds of friendship and cooperation between Maldives and India will continue to flourish in the years ahead.”
Warmest greetings and sincere good wishes to Minister of External Affairs @DrSJaishankar and the friendly people of India, on the joyous occasion of the 75th Republic Day of India.
I am confident that the close bonds of friendship and cooperation between 🇲🇻 and 🇮🇳 will continue…
— Moosa Zameer (@MoosaZameer) January 26, 2024
The diplomatic row started with Muizzu demanding India to repatriate its military personnel from the island nation within 24 hours of his swearing-in, followed by his decision to make China the first port of call breaking the tradition of visiting India first, and a muddied atmosphere due to unruly comments by three Maldivian ministers on social media against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The latest in the series was the Maldives agreeing earlier this week to allow a Chinese research vessel to dock at Male port against India’s apprehension about the Chinese navy’s growing forays in the Indian Ocean.
Nasheed took to X to post: “A very happy Republic Day to the Prime Minister and people of India! Maldives-Indian friendship is eternal, and we are very grateful to India, its people and personnel, for all the assistance provided to us over the years.” So did Solih, who said, “May the unbreakable bonds of friendship that have long existed between Maldives and India go from strength to strength.”
A very happy Republic Day to the Prime Minister and people of India! Maldives-Indian friendship is eternal, and we are very grateful to India, its people and personnel, for all the assistance provided to us over the years. 🇲🇻🇮🇳🏝️ @narendramodi @PMOIndia @HCIMaldives

The Maldives’ proximity to India, barely 70 nautical miles from the island of Minicoy in Lakshadweep and 300 nautical miles from the mainland’s western coast, and its location at the hub of commercial sea lanes running through the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) gives it significant strategic importance.
The Maldives is India’s key maritime neighbour in the IOR and occupies a special place in its initiatives like SAGAR’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the Neighbourhood First Policy’ of the Narendra Modi government."

The police dismantled makeshift stages at Entally, Jorasanko and Shyambazar areas in north Kolkata, saying such programmes would hinder traffic movement in the area, the BJP said.
There was no response from the police over this development.
On the occasion of National Voters’ Day on Thursday, the BJP has organised Namo Nav Matdata Sammelans across the country where PM Modi will virtually interact with first-time voters in more than 5,000 locations.
“We had sought permission from the police to hold a live screening of the PM’s programme. The police did not give permission. At the same time, it also did not deny us permission. At the last moment, they stopped our programmes and even dismantled the stages in various places. We strongly condemn the police action as they have been reduced to TMC [Trinamool Congress] party cadre in West Bengal,” BJP’s North Kolkata district president Tamoghna Ghosh said.
“In the Entally area, the police first asked us to change the venue as it might lead to traffic snarls. We changed the venue as per their request. Now, the police stopped the live screening at the last moment. In Bengal, the Opposition does not have the right to hold party programmes and even programmes of the Prime Minister,” Suraj Kumar Singh, the BJP’s North Kolkata Yuva Morcha president, said."

The writer, known for his Tamil novels and poems, claimed that the story of Captain Miller is a blatant copy of his novel titled Pattathu Yaanai. He criticized the alleged adaptation of his novel without seeking proper authorization.
Expressing his dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in the Tamil film industry, Ramamurthy also stressed the importance of respecting intellectual property and condemned the practice of appropriating creative content without fair compensation. Speaking to Pudhiya Thalamurai, he said, “The film has been based on my novel Pattathu Yaanai. I need justice for this plagiarism. There’s not honesty in the film industry. I am going to approach Tamil cinema director’s union. Hope, filmmaker Bharathiraja sir will give justice to me.”
The writer also said that it is not fame and money that he is after as he has gotten both aplenty. On the other hand, he claimed that he is seeking justice for his work.
Vela Ramamurthy has acted in many films including Rajinikanth’s Annaatthhe, Sethupathi, and Kidaari. He has also played the father to Dhanush’s character in Gautham Vasudev Menon’s Enai Nokki Paayum Thotta.
Captain Miller, set in pre-independence era, is the story of a vigilante and a former British sepoy, who finally resolves to stand up for his people. The film was lauded for its cinematography and background score and turned out to be a successful venture for Dhanush. Also starring Kannada superstar Shivarajkumar and Telugu actor Sandeep Kishan, the film, produced by Sathya Jyothi Films, boasts music composed by G.V. Prakash."

Payment settlement mechanisms for the disrupted trade routes along with pending issues relating to vostro accounts are likely to be taken up in the meeting, officials said.
The meeting, which is to be chaired by Department of Financial Services (DFS) Secretary Vivek Joshi, will be attended by officials from the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry, External Affairs, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
“It is a coordination meeting planned between government departments, regulators and banks to discuss trade related payment issues. Objective is to hear from all stakeholders and find solutions for orderly trade transactions and settlement thereof,” a senior government official told The Indian Express.
“The RBI and the government interact with all stakeholders to facilitate resolution of vexatious issues. Subject to usual compliance requirements banks extend trade finance to all eligible traders,” the official added.
This comes a week after the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had asked the DFS to maintain credit flow to the exporters amid disruption in the Red Sea region that could impact over 80 per cent of the exports to Europe, following an inter-ministerial meeting on January 17.
Freight rates to Europe have more than doubled due to security tension in the Red Sea region. Fears of disruptions in the Red Sea region have risen and oil prices have begun inching up ever since the US and the UK earlier this month attacked Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for the attacks on their commercial ships in the Red Sea region.
Indian shipments of low value products such as agriculture and textiles to Europe are primarily expected to face the impact of disruption in the Red Sea region due to surging freight costs. Earlier, the government had asked Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) not to raise insurance premiums amid rising cost of shipping to Europe."

Actor-politician Kamal Haasan, while talking to the media in Chennai, was asked about the celebrations around the event. Kamal instead of giving a straight answer said that he holds the same opinion he had 30 years ago.
Kamal was referring to his statement made when Babri Masjid was demolished back on December 6, 1991. Kamal was one of the few celebrities who spoke out immediately after the demolition. He said, “No one had the right to destroy Babri Masjid. It was my building just like Tanjore Temple and Velankanni church are mine.”
In 2020, when the verdict of the Supreme Court acquitted all the accused of the Babri Masjid demolition including BJP leader LK Advani, Kamal Haasan shared a cryptic tweet. He tweeted, “Is it irresponsibility of the prosecution for not presenting compelling evidence and strong arguments before justice? Or is it a planned action? Indian’s hope for justice should not go in vain.”
Over the years, Haasan has been critical of right-wing extremism in his films like Hey Ram, which was based on the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. His films have courted controversy for hurting religious sentiments. A song in his film Manmadhan Ambu was censored for its line about Ranganathar (Hindu god Vishnu). The actor has also faced backlash from muslims for the depiction of the community in his film Viswaroopam.
On the work front, Kamal Haasan is working on Mani Ratnam’s upcoming film Thug Life and another untitled film with H Vinoth. He will next be seen in Indian 2, directed by Shankar."

Mamata slammed the BJP for its bid to “politicise” religion ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.
At the same time, she also said she felt sad to see the CPI(M) “controlling” the INDIA bloc’s meetings and that some people would not listen to her over seat-sharing for the upcoming polls.
In the context of Bengal, apart from the TMC, the Congress and the CPI(M) are the other major constituents of the Opposition INDIA grouping formed to take on the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.
The INDIA allies have run into a seat-sharing hurdle in Bengal, with the TMC having declined to engage in talks with the Congress’s national alliance committee over the issue while offering the party just two of its sitting seats – Berhampore and Malda Dakshin.
State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also the party MP from Berhampore, has rejected the TMC’s offer, saying the grand old party had won those seats on its own in 2019 fighting against the TMC and the BJP, and that the Congress does not need any “grace or generosity” from Mamata to win them again.
In the 2019 polls, the TMC bagged 22 seats out of the state’s total 42 as against the BJP’s 18, with the CPI(M)-led Left Front drawing a blank.
On her part, Mamata, while addressing a public rally in Park Circus Maidan where the Sanhati rally ended, rued that none of the Opposition leaders hit the streets in protest to counter the BJP head-on, like she did on the day of the Ayodhya event.
“I suggested the name INDIA. But I am sad to say that when I attend the INDIA meetings I see CPI(M) controlling it. I cannot agree with those with whom I fought for 34 years,” the CM said.
“I have been told what they think they will do. I tell them not to help the BJP. If you do so, the people of India will not pardon you. If I can have the guts to take on BJP why can’t you? I have shown courage. So many political parties, but did they show this courage?” Mamata asked.
She went on: “I have the power to fight with BJP and I do so. I have repeatedly said that whoever is in power in whichever state (regional parties) should decide. I had said you (Congress) fight in 300 seats, we will help you. But some people do not want to listen to us on seat-sharing. I am ready to give blood, but I will not let BJP have one seat.”
The TMC chief also asked: “How many politicians today took on the BJP frontally? How many politicians hit the streets? Somebody went to a temple and thinks that is sufficient. It is not so. I am the only one who took out a rally and visited a temple, a gurdwara, a church and a mosque.”
Referring to riots that had also erupted in Kolkata in the wake of the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, Mamata said she had reached out to the then CM and CPI(M) stalwart Jyoti Basu to ensure restoration of communal harmony and peace.
On Monday morning, Mamata offered puja and performed “arti” at the Kalighat temple and took out the Sanhati rally of thousands of TMC workers from Hazra in South Kolkata. She walked with people belonging to different religions. She was accompanied by her nephew and TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, ministers and other party leaders.
The CM also visited a gurdwara at Garcha and a church and a mosque in the Park Circus area."

Actor Deepika Padukone, who has been a fixture in filmmaker Siddharth Anand’s uber stylish world with Bachna Ae Haseeno, Pathaan and now Fighter, says actors in his films follow his vision out of absolute trust that the filmmaker will make it “aesthetically” pleasing.
With Ghungroo Toot Gaye in War, Besharam Rang in Pathaan and now Ishq Jaisa Kuch from Fighter, Siddharth Anand has continued his trademark of filming a glamourous beach party track. In Fighter, his muses are Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, who have teamed up for the first time.

During a media interaction, when asked how does he manage to convince his actors to follow his vision for his songs, the filmmaker said, “It stems from confidence. They (Hrithik and Deepika) are confident about themselves, their appearance.” To which Hrithik joked, “Sabse bada jhoot,” and Deepika added, “The most underconfident people are being labelled confident!”
Siddharth Anand said Hrithik and Deepika are two “gorgeous people”, who require nothing extraordinary out of him. ” I don’t need to do anything. Roll the camera at 48fps and make them walk and put great music.  Jokes apart, they work very hard. It is not easy to look like this. They put in a lot of effort and the one word I would actually use is sacrifice. There is a lot of sacrifice that goes into looking like this. They are relentless.”


A post shared by Hrithik Roshan (@hrithikroshan)
Adding that she would like to “correct Sid”, Deepika said it is not about the “size” or fitness of a person but something else which makes one take up the task of being in a sizzling Siddharth Anand dance track.
“It is because you trust that he has the right sensibility and that it is going to be presented in the right way, is why then actors like us will make the effort or even allow for that conversation to happen. You trust the director, his aesthetic sense, you trust that it will be presented in the right way,” she added.
Fighter, which also stars Anil Kapoor and features Hrithik and Deepika as Air Force pilots, is set to release on Thursday. It is the first big Hindi film release of the year.

PM Modi will virtually interact with first-time voters across 5,000 locations in the country on Thursday, which marks the National Voters Day. The programme, Namo Nav Matdata conference, being organised by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP, hopes to reach one crore first-time voters between the age group of 18 and 25 years.
“The Namo Nav Matdata conference will take place tomorrow (Thursday) at 5,000 places in India. Registrations have been done for the youths to interact with Modiji. Lakhs of youth will interact directly with the PM tomorrow. This is the first time that a PM is interacting with first-time voters at this scale. One crore first-time voters will be touched,” BJYM national president and BJP MP Tejaswi Surya said on Wednesday.
Underlining the importance of the youth vote bank for the BJP, Surya said, “Youth voters played a major role in the election and re-election of Modiji. There are many youth-centric policies of this government. The new education policy has come after 36 years. There are new IIMs and IITs. Digital India, Start-up India, aerospace, the drone sector are growing, and the private sector has also been involved. Niti Aayog stated that around 25 crore people have come out of poverty.”
PM Modi is also set to inaugurate development projects worth more than Rs 19,100 crore in Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh, where he will also address a rally. These projects include a 173-km-long double-line electrified section between New Khurja and New Rewari, a fourth rail line connecting Mathura-Palwal and Chipiyana Buzurg-Dadri sections, Indian Oil’s Tundla-Gawaria pipeline and an “integrated industrial township at Greater Noida (IITGN)”.
In a move that will have great symbolic value, the PM will also inaugurate a medical college in the name of former chief minister Kalyan Singh who was the BJP’s face at the peak of Ram Janmabhoomi movement in Uttar Pradesh.
Meanwhile, the PM will hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron — who will be the chief guest for the Republic Day celebrations — in Jaipur on Thursday evening. The topics of conversation are expected to be shoring up cooperation in areas of defence and security, trade, climate change, clean energy and mobility of students and professionals.
President Murmu address
President Droupadi Murmu will address the nation on the eve of the Republic Day at 7 pm on Thursday. In her first such address as President last year, Murmu had said that India has succeeded as a democratic republic because various creeds and different languages have not divided it, but only united the country. She had added, “That essence was at the heart of the Constitution, which has withstood the test of time.”
Murmu had also said that those who shaped the modern Indian mind had welcomed progressive ideas from abroad and from all directions. “Following the Vedic advice, let noble thoughts come to us from all directions,” she had said. Her message had also touched upon the Constitution-making process.
INDIA bloc tensions
Two new developments between the INDIA bloc partners that occurred on Wednesday might have far-reaching implications on how the seat-sharing talks between the already fraught allies could shape up.
First is the statement from West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday morning, ruling out any talks with the Congress and declaring that the TMC would go solo for the Lok Sabha polls.
Just hours later, Punjab CM and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann joined in, speaking in a similar voice, stating that his party will not stitch up an alliance with the Congress in the state.
Despite this “unravelling”, Manoj CG writes that the Congress, which is being blamed for the cracks in Bengal and Punjab, appeared hopeful of placating at least Mamata. As for Punjab, the Congress leadership appeared resigned to the fact that an alliance with the AAP was difficult.
Hours after Mamata declared that her party would contest the Lok Sabha polls alone in Bengal, sources in the Congress said its top leadership was trying to get in touch with her, and asserted that there would be at least a tactical alliance in the state. Seeking to placate her, the party said it could “not imagine” the INDIA bloc without Mamata. It also hung on to her remarks that she was determined to fight the BJP.
This is a big blow to not just to the Opposition but also to the Congress that had been aiming at becoming the prime partner in the alliance.
How the allies will douse these fires, who will take the lead, who will concede and budge, and what the major leaders of the alliance will say — all of this will be tracked very closely in the days to come.
Amid Rahul-Himanta standoff, Yatra to enter Bengal
Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Wednesday said the state police would arrest Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after the Lok Sabha elections, a day after an FIR was registered against him and other Congress leaders following a confrontation between people taking part in the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and the Assam police.
On Wednesday, Assam DGP G P Singh said the case has been transferred to the state CID and a Special Investigation Team would be constituted “for a thorough and in-depth investigation”.
“We will arrest him after the Lok Sabha elections, if we do it now it will get very politicised. The SIT will do its investigation now… Yesterday there could have been a major incident going by how they had instigated the mob to break barricades. Before the Lok Sabha elections, we will not do much because we will be winning from Assam anyway and there’s no point in making too much political noise here. It’s better if the state remains peaceful,” said Sarma.
Wednesday was the seventh day of the Assam leg of Rahul’s Yatra, which has been fraught with confrontations between the participants and the state apparatus.
On Thursday, the Yatra will enter Cooch Behar in Bengal through the Assam-Bengal border. Two things will be tracked: how the Yatra fares on the final day of its Assam leg and how the TMC will receive the Congress in Bengal in the wake of the statements made by Mamata.

Nadda, who was accompanied by Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Gujarat BJP chief C R Paatil, was in Gandhinagar to unveil the office in person, while the other 25 offices saw a virtual launch. Notably, Union Home Minister and Gandhinagar MP Amit Shah, who was in Gujarat attending other events, was not present at the opening of the office in his constituency.
Although a party functionary said that being a disciplined party, sitting MPs were not likely to be present at any of the inauguration events of the 26 LS seats as these will be the offices of the party-nominated candidates, Rajkot MP Mohan Kundariya was present at the inauguration in his constituency.
The party is yet to announce any names for the general elections. However, in their speeches during the event, CM Patel and Paatil, wittingly or unwittingly, declared that Shah is set to contest again from the Gandhinagar seat. “Nadda has inaugurated the election office of ‘Amitbhai Shah saheb’,” both leaders said."

Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora has informed all Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) personnel that they can send their children to Delhi Police Public Schools at Safdarjung, New Police Lines, and DPA/Wazirabad from 2024-25 academic session at concessional fee.
Arora said it will facilitate students who may be commuting long distances to school.

Talking to mediapersons in Cooch Behar district after his ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’ entered West Bengal from Assam, Gandhi said, “The word ‘nyay’ (justice) has been attached to the yatra because injustice is prevailing across the country. The INDIA bloc will fight against this injustice.”
His remarks came a day after Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s announcement that her party will go alone in the Parliamentary elections in the state caused ripples in the Opposition bloc.
“I thank our leaders and workers here for the warm welcome. I am happy to be here. I am here to listen to the people of Bengal,” added Gandhi who was welcomed at Baksirhat in Cooch Behar by state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury, party’s woman wing leader Pooja Roy Chowdhury, AICC member Biswajit Sarkar and others.
The former Congress president, who avoided commenting on the CM’s Wednesday remarks, was shown pro-Mamata Banerjee placards by some people claiming to be members of an organisation ‘Citizen Forum’ along the Yatra route. Some placards also attacked Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. Congress leaders claimed these protesters were local TMC workers.
After the roadshow, Gandhi left for New Delhi in the afternoon and the Yatra proceeded to Falakata in Alipurduar for a two-day halt.
“Gandhi left for New Delhi from the Hasimara air base in Alipurduar on a special flight. He had some urgent work,” state Congress leader Subhankar Sarkar said.
“After the recess, the Yatra will resume on January 28. Gandhi will come back by then and join it,” he said. Then the Yatra will traverse through Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur, and Darjeeling districts of West Bengal before entering Bihar on January 29.
The Yatra is scheduled to re-enter Bengal on January 31 via Malda and it will pass through Murshidabad before departing the state on February 1.
The Bengal leg of the yatra will cover 523 km across six districts and as many Lok Sabha constituencies — Darjeeling, Raigunj, North and South Malda, and two in Murshidabad — spanning five days. This is Gandhi’s first visit to the state since the April-May 2021 assembly polls.
TMC leader Kunal Ghosh on Thursday said, “Our party is serious about an alliance against the BJP. Mamata Banerjee herself named the alliance ‘INDIA’. But it was Congress’ Adhir Chowdhury who attacked the TMC in the BJP’s language. The Congress should have invited us before they decided on their Yatra schedule in Bengal. It is a basic courtesy expected from an alliance partner. As Mamata Banerjee said the Congress is in a damage-control mode.”

This time, he met a gangster and history-sheeter in Pune, invoking a reprimand from none other than his father.
“The meeting between Parth and Gajanan Marne was absolutely wrong. I am collecting information in this regard. It seems a party worker took Parth to a place where Gajanan Marne was present. Such a thing should not have happened. When I meet Parth, I will tell him that his behaviour was wrong,” he said.
Parth had reportedly met Marne on Wednesday. The photo of their meeting has now gone viral on social media.
When Parth met Marne, NCP city chief Deepak Mankar was apparently present with him. Marne was arrested in the murder case of Pappu Gawde and Amol Badhe. He was arrested and lodged in the Yerawada jail for three years.
Meanwhile, Ajit Pawar said such a thing had happened to him in the past. “This happened in Pimpri-Chinchwad. A local Pimpri-Chinchwad leader had brought a person to me to include him in the party. That individual joined the party. Later that day I learnt he is a goon. I immediately removed him from the party,” he said.
NCP leader Eknath Khadse said, “Parth’s meeting with Marne was wrong. As per my information, there are at least six criminal cases against Gajanan Marne. Parth’s father is a Deputy Chief Minister and I am sure he will take serious note of it.”
This is not the first time Parth has caused embarrassment to his family. Parth’s decision to contest from the Maval Lok Sabha seat in 2019 had caused a rift in the Pawar family. Parth, who is known to freely tweet his views, had run afoul of his grandfather Sharad Pawar, the NCP national chief.
After Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, he had demanded a CBI probe at a time when the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was in power. The MVA was against a CBI probe.
In 2019, Parth badly lost the Lok Sabha election from the Maval seat, a first for the Pawar family."

A division bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Manoj Jain issued notice on the appeals moved by Ravi Kapoor, Amit Shukla, Baljit Singh Malik, and Ajay Kumar. The bench also issued notice on applications moved by the four convicts seeking suspension of their sentence awarded by the trial court in November last year.
The matter is next listed on February 12.
On January 12, a single bench of the Delhi High Court had dismissed parole plea of Kapoor after taking into account his “criminal history, gravity of the offence” committed by him and his “overall conduct inside jail”.
In October 2023, the court of Additional Sessions Judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey had held the four men guilty of murder and committing organised crime resulting in the death of a person under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). A fifth man, Ajay Sethi, was convicted for receiving stolen property and conspiring to abet, aid in, or knowingly facilitate organised crime under the MCOCA.
In November 2023, the trial court had sentenced the four men to life imprisonment and the fifth convict to three years in jail. While rejecting the request for the death penalty, the trial court had held the offence committed by the accused does not fall in the “rarest of rare” category.
On September 30, 2008, Vishwanathan, who was working with India Today, was found dead in her car on Nelson Mandela Marg in South Delhi. A breakthrough came in 2009 during the investigation into the murder of BPO employee Jigisha Ghosh when one of the accused confessed to also being involved in Vishwanathan’s murder."

Sushil Kumar Modi will be taking oath as the deputy CM, JD(U) sources said.
The oath-taking ceremony will be taking place on Sunday, the sources added.
Amid talk of a deepening rift, the RJD and JD(U), on Thursday, held separate meetings while BJP state president Samrat Choudhary left for Delhi to hold discussions with top BJP leaders. He was accompanied by former BJP deputy chief minister Renu Devi.
While the RJD played down any such possibility, and there was no word from the Congress, INDIA bloc parties were bracing for the damaging blow should one of its tallest leaders exit. If Nitish crosses over, this would be the fourth time he would be switching sides.
On the BJP side, at least three state leaders told The Indian Express that for the party, this would be a “win-win,” as it would not just be a morale booster for the BJP but also undermine the INDIA bloc at the national level.
In the Bihar Assembly of 243, the RJD has 79 MLAs; followed by the BJP’s 78; the JD(U)’s 45’ the Congress’s 19, the CPI (M-L)’s 12, two each of the CPI(M) and CPI, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular)’s four seats, and the AIMIM’s one, plus one Independent legislator."

Saha warned youngsters against the drug menace and said that as responsible citizens, they would have to cooperate with the government in tackling it. “There is a big conspiracy involved in the drug trade—to destroy the young generation. We have to fight against this,” he added while speaking at an event in his Assembly constituency of Town Bardowali on Thursday.
Saha said the age group of 18-25 was highly crucial. “This is the real time for building one’s life well. If someone misses this time, it gets very tough to fill in the blank later,” he added.
He also said young citizens would have to develop themselves considering the country and how they can contribute to nation-building.
Saha said India had progressed exponentially since Narendra Modi became prime minister in 2014. “I attended the G20 summit in New Delhi and saw that all leaders from different countries were all praising Prime Minister Modi. He has taken the country to great heights of success, from exploring space to the depths of the ocean or on the surface,” the BJP leader said.
The chief minister said his government was following in the footsteps of Modi’s “corruption-free governance” model.
Attacking the Opposition Congress and Left, Saha said that dynastic politics, corruption and praise for nations like China were the norm under past governments. He said India’s surgical strikes against its enemies had shown that “New India” was not in a mood to take the decapitation of soldiers on the border or illegal incursions lightly.
Saha later interacted with a group of electors among nearly 1,200 new voters who gathered at the event. “We are trying to learn about their take on the country, the state and how they are going to shape the country in the future. They are our future responsible citizens. We have also shared our take on what is good or bad. This whole process was done to spread awareness among the new electors,” he said."

Responding to a media query in Patiala regarding four-time Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, Warring said, “She is currently not a part of the political folds of the Congress as she is suspended from the party. What she says cannot be taken as a statement from the party. Any person causing a disruption in the path of the Congress, will face consequences from the high command. Those within the folds of the party will have to focus on the collective growth of the party rather than their own personal goals.”
Warring further said, “Our collective endeavor transcends individual efforts. No one stands above the party; the Congress Party thrives not due to specific individuals but rather, individuals derive their standing from the Congress Party. Therefore, unity is paramount for our collective strength. No leader is bigger than the party. Anyone who wants to express their individual views from the stage can do that without being a part of the Congress. Preneet Kaur is a respectable leader but she is suspended from the party so she won’t be the party candidate from Patiala.”
Preneet, who is the wife of BJP national executive member and former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, was suspended from the Congress party for aligning with the BJP and “anti-party activities.” The couple’s daughter Jai Inder Kaur had also joined BJP and is currently Punjab BJP Mahila Morcha president. Jai Inder reportedly plans to stake claim as BJP nominee from Patiala Lok Sabha constituency in the upcoming election.
In February last year, Congress had suspended Preneet after Warring, in a letter to AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge, had accused her of “indulging in anti-party activities to help BJP”.
In her reply to the show-cause notice, Patiala MP had said, “As to action against me you are free to take whatever action you wish.”
Earlier, in November 2021, the Congress had issued her a show cause notice seeking an explanation for her alleged anti-party activities. Preneet had then said that she did not receive any such notice. In the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls, Preneet campaigned for Amarinder Singh who contested the elections as an ally of the BJP.
Preneet served as an MP in 1999, 2004 and 2009. She lost the Patiala Lok Sabha seat in 2014 but won it back in 2019. She also served as Minister of State for External Affairs from May 2009 to May 2014 during the UPA government.
Meanwhile, PPCC leadership including state affairs incharge Devender Yadav, Warring and district level leadership convened meetings for Patiala and Sangrur parliamentary seats, Tuesday, to engage with the office-bearers of the party including district presidents, block presidents, mandal heads, frontal heads and district committee members.
Warring emphasized the pivotal role of Congress workers, asserting, “The Congress party in Punjab stands at its current stature due to the unwavering dedication of our workers. They are the indispensable driving force, propelling our party forward with precision and momentum. We rightfully acknowledge the workers as the engine of the Congress.”
Yadav highlighted their essential role in shaping the party’s structure in Punjab. He emphasized, “The foundation of any political party must be robust to achieve our objectives. Congress workers, operating at the grassroots level, play a crucial role in ensuring our message resonates with the masses.”
Yadav further emphasized, “The workers are instrumental in disseminating our message, enlightening the public on the importance to diverge from the BJP’s tyrannous governance. This role cannot be replicated by any senior leader in the Congress party.”"
LGJ0A6L8UY_UWULUBWR7PTFXWC,Govt permits direct listing by Indian firms on GIFT-IFSC’s international markets,_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 15:43 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/govt-permits-direct-listing-by-indian-firms-on-gift-ifscs-international-markets-9126380/,"The government on Wednesday allowed direct listing of securities by public Indian companies on the international exchanges of GIFT International Financial Services Centre (GIFT-IFSC), and made the requisite provisions to provide “an overarching regulatory framework” to facilitate it. In July, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government had decided to enable direct listing of listed and unlisted companies on the IFSC exchanges. The move is expected to give Indian companies access to cheaper foreign capital, boost foreign investment, and broaden investor.
The Department of Economic Affairs of the Finance Ministry has amended Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, and notified the Direct Listing of Equity Shares of Companies Incorporated in India on International Exchanges Scheme. Additionally, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued Companies (Listing of Equity Shares in Permissible Jurisdictions) Rules, 2024.
“These, together, provide an overarching regulatory framework to enable public Indian companies to issue and list their shares in permitted international exchanges. As of now, the framework allows unlisted public Indian companies to list their shares on an international exchange. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is in the process of issuing the operational guidelines for listed public Indian companies,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
The international stock exchanges at GIFT-IFSC—India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange—are currently prescribed as the permitted stock exchanges. These exchanges are under the regulatory supervision of the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA). GIFT-IFSC is India’s first international financial services centre set up with the objective of connecting India with global opportunities while helping the Indian economy connect with the global financial system and facilitating seamless flow of global capital into India.
“This policy initiative…will reshape the Indian capital market landscape and offers Indian companies, especially start-ups and companies in the sunrise and technology sectors, an alternative avenue to access global capital beyond the domestic exchanges. This is expected to lead to better valuation of Indian companies in line with global standards of scale and performance, boost foreign investment flows, unlock growth opportunities and broaden the investor base,” the Finance Ministry said.
Public Indian companies will have the flexibility to access both markets—domestic for raising capital in rupees and international market at IFSC for raising capital in foreign currency from the global investors.
“This initiative will particularly benefit Indian companies going global and having ambitions to look at opportunities for expanding their presence in other markets. It is also expected to provide a boost to the capital market ecosystem at GIFT IFSC by provision of new investment opportunities for investors, diversification of financial products and by enhancing liquidity,” the ministry said.
According to the government, it is not mandatory for an unlisted company intending to list on international exchanges to also list on domestic exchanges. However, there is no restriction on such companies to opt for listing on domestic as well as international exchanges. The equity shares listed on international exchanges will be counted towards the foreign holding of the company. Also, public companies falling under sectors prohibited for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will not be allowed to issue shares under this scheme.
Indian residents will not be allowed to trade or invest in shares of Indian companies on international exchanges. Non-resident Indians (NRIs), however, will be allowed to trade. Individuals and entities from countries sharing a land border with India will also be allowed to trade, subject to approval from the government."
LGZDKOQDWC_TJ4VL9WWLMFZ33U,Decode Politics: Why a radical Meitei outfit chose Imphal’s Kangla Fort to ‘summon’ legislators,Vidhatri Rao,"Updated: January 25, 2024 15:54 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/why-meitei-outfit-chose-imphals-kangla-fort-to-summon-legislators-9127314/,"A meeting called by radical Meitei group Arambai Tenggol of Meitei MLAs on Wednesday was held at the historic Kangla Fort in Imphal. Nearly all Meitei MLAs of Manipur as well as Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs representing its valley areas were present at this meeting, attended by the outfit’s self-styled “commander-in-chief”.
Apart from the significance of the legislators making an appearance at the “summons” of a non-government outfit, the choice of the Kangla Fort – a symbol of Meitei pride – was critical.
Importance of Kangla What constitutes modern-day Manipur was and is home to Meitei, Loi, Yaithibi, Bamon (Brahmin), Bishnupriya and Pangan (Muslim) communities, as well as the Nagas, Kukis and other tribes who live in the hills.
A Meitei state, controlling primarily the valley regions, emerged under the leadership of the chiefs of the Ningthouja clan in the 13th century and was an independent kingdom until 1891, when the British took over the province of Manipur.
With the name of Imphal also Kangla, the Kangla Fort, built in 33 AD and spread over 200 plus acres, emerged as the centre of power of the Meitei kings and the site of its many rituals and festivals. The fort premises are also believed to house sites sacred to the Meiteis.
Before it came under British rule, the Meitei kingdom saw repeated attacks from the Burmese and fell under Burmese control in 1819. The three royal princes – Marjit, Chaurjit and Gambhir Singh – were forced to flee to Cachar in Assam.
In 1824, when a war broke out between the British and the Burmese, the British assisted Gambhir Singh in “recovering” the state. Manipur then became a protectorate state of the British.
In her memoir The Maharaja’s Household: A Daughter’s Memories of Her Father, the last princess of Manipur wrote that after the British took over, they proclaimed an eight-year-old Churachand as the child king but did not let the family reside in the palace within the Kangla Fort.
In 1891, following differences within the Meitei royal family, the British wanted to take over the princely state. A rebellion ensued from the people, but more and more British forces were deployed to the princely state, the rebellion quashed and Manipur was occupied.
The Kangla Fort was then taken over by the British troops, and remained under their control until Independence in 1947.
Post-Independence After Independence, the fort’s control went to the Ministry of Defence and it went on to become the headquarters of the Assam Rifles – which remained a sore point for the Manipuris who invested in the fort for their cultural and regional pride.
In the 1980s, there was a thinking in the Centre to remove the Assam Rifles from the historic fort, but the matter dragged on as the Centre was wary of the move being seen as a victory of radical elements in Manipur.
Then came the famous protest at the gates of the Kangla Fort on July 15, 2004, when 12 Meitei women members of the Meira Paibis staged a naked protest against the Armed Forces, holding placards that read: “Come Indian Army Rape Us”. They were protesting against the rape and killing of a Manipuri woman by allegedly members of the Assam Rifles.
Following this, the demand for withdrawal of the Assam Rifles from the fort and the rolling back of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) from the state gained a lot of momentum.
On November 20, 2004, as a gesture, the Centre transferred the control of the Kangla Fort to the state government of Manipur. In its statement, the Manmohan Singh government at the time said: “The Kangla Fort is revered as the holiest place by Manipuris living in the state and outside. Therefore, they consider it as a centre of pilgrimage. Woven into the history and mythology of the state, it casts a spell on the minds of its inhabitants and deeply influences them and their thinking. In response to popular demand and popular feelings, the Government of India, therefore, decided to pass on the ownership of this majestic Fort to the state government.” AFSPA was also removed from the Imphal valley.
Current day The importance of the fort in popular Meitei imagination as representative of its culture, history and tradition holds true to this day.
In February 2021, Rajya Sabha MP Maharaja Sanajoaba Leishemba, who is the titular king of Manipur, demanded that the fort be declared a world heritage site, arguing that it had served as the “seat of Manipuri civilisation” and had seen the rule of “70 kings”."

It will be the moment when a temple was consecrated in Ayodhya and when a country in the throes of a transition arrived at a seminal milestone. A political movement that began as a challenge to the ruling consensus, having made its way to the system’s centre, stamped its dominance and become the establishment, has now, almost 10 years later, brought a never-before convergence — of popular will, state power, religion.
In a country where secularism was defined not as the strict separation of the state and religion, but, in its best version, as equal respect for all religions, and where, 73 years ago, its first Prime Minister cautioned its first President against state involvement in a temple inauguration, the just consecrated temple in Ayodhya, the prime minister doing the honours, calls for a new word in place of the old. January 22 asks the nation for nothing less than a new self-description.
As consequential as this moment is, however, as transformative as it is in its larger significance, it has not caught the nation by surprise. The BJP’s serial electoral victories since it first won the Centre with a single party majority in 2014, steadily paved the ground for it. A Ram temple on the site where the Babri Masjid was felled in 1992 was the party’s promise to voters, even when its coalition allies forced it to push that commitment onto the backburner, and later when consecutive decisive mandates made it possible to bring it squarely front and centre. This was the manifesto with which the BJP rose and rose, politically and electorally. After the early years, its ascendance sidelined not its “core” issues, but its political opponents, who, even as another parliamentary election draws closer, have yet to find the language to fight it, or to regain their own lost equilibrium.
SPEAKING AT Ayodhya on January 22, both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, marked the end of a long wait and the present celebration. They also sought to expand the moment of the temple consecration into something more encompassing. Saying that it fell on him to inject a cautionary note, “josh ke mahaul mein hosh ki baat”, Bhagwat asked: “Ab ham kya karenge (now what will we do)?” He spoke of the need to sidestep “ahankaar” or arrogance, to act with “karuna (compassion)” and “sayyam (restraint)”, and to banish conflict and controversy. He spoke of “sahmati ka samvaad (dialogue that forges common ground)”.
The figure of Ram, PM Modi said, was the binding thread for the nation (“desh ko samayojit karne wala sutra”), and that this was a moment not just of victory but also of humility, “vinay” as well as “vijay”. Many countries get trapped in their own pasts, the PM warned, “kayi desh apne hi itihas mein ulajh jaate hain”. India must continue to untangle the knots of history, “itihas ki gaanth”, as it has already done, with “bhavukta” and “gambhirta”, seriousness and sensitivity, he said.
For PM Modi, the temple was joined to rashtra or nation, and together they would turn to the future. “Ram aag nahin, oorja hain”, Ram is creative energy, not destructive fire. “Ram hamare nahin, sabke hain (Ram is not ours alone, he belongs to everyone)”. “Dev se desh”, “Ram se rashtra” — the temple will inaugurate a new and better chapter for the whole of India, and for all its citizens.
THESE invocations of larger wholes, and those exhortations to face the future, will have to face the challenges of history and the imperatives of politics. The temple that has been consecrated at Ayodhya was built not on a clean slate, but on a troubled back story that must be acknowledged and remembered if it has to be transcended. It cannot be erased. The BJP-led movement has vanquished its political opponents and won the day, but its government’s slogan of “sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas” will not automatically segue into “sabka mandir” or “sabke Ram”. For that, much work still needs to be done.
The distance between Ram and rashtra, as the Prime Minister framed it, will be bridged not just by words but on the ground. It will call for outreach to the Muslim community; those who were not a part of the Mandir movement; and all those who remain apprehensive about the reverberations of temple consecration. It will require, in an age of polarisation, the determined exploring of common ground.
That task involves all — political parties, civil society, communities, the nukkad and the street — but it must necessarily be led by the BJP. A prime minister who performed the rituals of temple consecration has underlined the responsibility of tempering triumph with generosity and wisdom. He needs to hold that line and everyone to it. So that the winner does not take all, nor is seen to do so. And so that in a large and diverse country, every voice is heard and democracy’s argument can go on."
LJGG7N85D2_H3HBPG1UG72QI4W,Bharat Ratna for ‘Jan Nayak’ Karpoori Thakur: BJP bid to blunt JD(U)-RJD social justice pitch,Santosh Singh,"January 24, 2024 07:24 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bharat-ratna-for-jan-nayak-karpoori-thakur-bjp-bid-to-blunt-jdu-rjd-social-justice-pitch-9124805/,"Socialist icon and Bihar’s former Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur has been awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously, the Rashtrapati Bhavan announced Tuesday.
The BJP-led Centre’s decision to confer the country’s highest civilian honour on Karpoori comes at a time when Bihar is celebrating the centenary of his birth anniversary from January 22-24 and the opposition INDIA alliance has been pitching for a nation-wide caste census.
Popularly known as Jan Nayak i.e., people’s leader, Karpoori served as the Bihar CM from December 1970 to June 1971 and from December 1977 to April 1979. He passed away on February 17, 1988. Belonging to the Extremely Backward Class or nai (barber) community, he was not just one of the most respected social justice leaders in north India, but one who saw early on the cleavage within the backward caste — backward and most backward.
As the CM in 1978, Karpoori implemented a layered reservation regime, which was unparalleled at that time. It provided a 26 per cent reservation model in which EBCs got 12 per cent quota, OBCs got 8 per cent, women got 3 per cent, and economically backward classes (EBWs) from among upper castes got 3 per cent.
I am delighted that the Government of India has decided to confer the Bharat Ratna on the beacon of social justice, the great Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji and that too at a time when we are marking his birth centenary. This prestigious recognition is a testament to his enduring… pic.twitter.com/9fSJrZJPSP

Expressing delight at the government of India’s decision, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on social media platform X, “This prestigious recognition is a testament to his enduring efforts as a champion for the marginalized and a stalwart of equality and empowerment. His unwavering commitment to uplift the downtrodden and his visionary leadership have left an indelible mark on India’s socio-political fabric. This award not only honours his remarkable contributions but also inspires us to continue his mission of creating a more just and equitable society.”
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hailed Karpoori, stating on X that “I took inspiration from him when I was UP Chief Minister to pilot a law for reservation for the Ati Pichhda (extremely backward) and Ati Dalit (extreme Dalits)”.
Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) National President Nitish Kumar said the decision fulfils his party’s old demand, and would “create a very good impact among Dalits, deprived and underprivileged sections of society”.
Lalu Prasad-led RJD, which had also been demanding the Bharat Ratna for Karpoori, also welcomed the move. “We are very happy with the decision. But this is much delayed. We had carried a sustained campaign for this demand. But BJP’s decision also looks politically motivated as it is taken ahead of elections,” RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said.
For the BJP, evoking Thakur makes a direct appeal to the non-Yadav OBC politics that Nitish Kumar has come to represent in Bihar, and also break the singular OBC narrative the opposition is seeking to construct to wean away large sections of OBCs in Hindi-speaking states. It also subtly points at the intra-OBC cleavages between the RJD and JD (U) that made Nitish Kumar join hands with the BJP in the 1990s.
Significantly, soon after publishing the findings of the Bihar caste census survey — which showed Extremely Backward Class as the largest social block accounting for 36.1 per cent of the state’s population, Nitish Kumar had sent out teams of JD (U) leaders and workers across Bihar for Karpoori Charcha (discussions on Karpoori Thakur).
This was a bid to consolidate his EBC constituency and retain the advantage of most backward class votes, which he has been expanding ever since he became the CM for the first time in November 2005. A public meeting, to be addressed by Nitish in Patna, is also scheduled on Wednesday, on the occasion of Thakur’s anniversary.
Significantly, BP Mandal recommended a single OBC quota at the Centre in his 1980 report. Thus, the Mandal legacy and the Karpoori legacy, though similar in many ways, diverge in this crucial manner – one that is of increasing relevance now.
Following his demise in 1988, Karpoori became the biggest socialist icon after Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia. After the then V P Singh government announced the implementation of the Mandal Commission report in 1990, which ensured OBC reservation, Karpoori’s importance grew further.
The Modi government’s decision to confer the Bharat Ratna on Karpoori barely a couple of months before the Lok Sabha polls indicated the BJP’s attempt to stake claim over his legacy and its bid to take the winds out of the sails of its Bihar rivals, the JD(U) and RJD, which have been raising the social justice pitch by keeping Karpoori Thakur at the fulcrum of their EBC and OBC politics. The Centre also plans to release a postal stamp and coin in Karpoori’s name.
All the parties in Bihar have been wooing voters belonging to EBCs – a conglomerate of 130 smaller castes that often decides the winner in closely-fought elections. The decision to bestow the Bharat Ratna on Karpoori is BJP’s attempt to turn the tables on the Mahagathbandhan."
LL1XENJYFF_8DNHS4Z15P8743Y,The Middle East needs the UN. Will Israel listen?,Chinmaya R Gharekhan,"Updated: February 6, 2024 11:12 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/middle-east-un-israel-9129429/,"What is common between the war in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East? Both are a case study in miscalculation. Vladimir Putin thought he would subdue Ukraine within a matter of weeks. Benjamin Netanyahu thought he would crush Hamas within a matter of days. Both wars have run into a kind of stalemate. The more powerful countries in both are unable to impose their demands. The weaker party is dictating the political process. Ukraine will simply not agree to any solution short of the complete withdrawal of Russian forces from what Ukraine regards as “occupied territories”. Hamas is refusing to accept any proposal short of a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. Ukraine has won by not being defeated and Hamas has won by not getting destroyed and continuing to lob rockets into Israel after more than three months of war.
Of course, there is a huge difference between the two wars. Putin’s Ukraine war was unprovoked whereas Netanyahu had ample provocation to try and destroy Hamas when the latter carried out a brutal attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. That trauma, however, does not and cannot justify Israel’s no-holds-barred war on Gaza. The death and destruction it has wreaked on the civilian population of Gaza is equally unacceptable. South Africa’s case against Israel accusing it of committing genocide on the Palestinians in Gaza cannot be dismissed.
Israel, by its disproportionate, indiscriminate and nonstop bombardments on civilian targets in Gaza has managed to do two things: Alienate world public opinion against it and generate unprecedented support for a Palestinian state, something which Hamas could not have anticipated in its wildest dreams. It has also managed to annoy its most powerful and indispensable ally by openly defying Joe Biden’s call for restraint.
Netanyahu has also caused fissures in Israeli society which is focused on getting back the 130 Israeli hostages in Hamas’s custody. Worse, differences seem to have emerged within his own cabinet. Israel’s decision to withdraw some of its troops from Gaza is aimed at “giving” something to President Biden. As one of its ministers has said, Israel is not a star in the American flag, but it is equally true that without American support, it could not continue the war for such a long period.
What about President Biden? He too has failed in preventing the escalation of the conflict into a wider war. Israel’s northern border with Lebanon has become active with Hezbollah lobbing missiles and rockets into Israel. Iran’s proxies Houthis defiantly continue attacks on the Red Sea shipping lanes despite joint retaliatory strikes on Houthi’s missile and weapons depots by American and British navies in Yemen’s territory. Iraq has asked the US to pull out its troops from its territory, and now perhaps, even Pakistan is getting sucked into this mess through its attack on Iran.
Netanyahu is defiant. He tells his people that war will continue until both objectives have been achieved: The destruction of Hamas and the return of hostages. Can he achieve the first objective? Yes, he can, by following the strategy propounded by two of his senior ministers. His ministers of national security and finance have suggested what it inhumanly calls a humane solution — mass “emigration” of the Palestinian people from the strip. They advocate this “emigration”, they claim, on humanitarian considerations. They candidly admit that the war is a good opportunity to encourage mass emigration of Gazans; they will, thereby, create space for settling Israeli citizens, naturally only Jewish citizens, in the strip. In other words, depopulate Gaza and repopulate it with Israeli settlements. This is the only way in which the objective of destroying Hamas can be achieved. These statements of Israel’s ministers must be taken seriously. They are in line with the early Zionists slogan: “A land without people for a people without land”.
Which country will agree to absorb these “emigrants”? Egypt? No, thank you, will be Egypt’s response. As it is, Palestinians are not popular in any Arab country; the governments are anxious to normalise ties with Israel, as some have done under the so-called Abraham Accords. The current war will delay the realisation of their desire but will not derail it. Already, reports are suggesting that the secret talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel for normalisation of relations are continuing notwithstanding the war.
Israel could endeavour to follow Britain’s example of persuading one or two African countries to settle illegal migrants in return for a handsome financial reward. Governments and experts in many countries have been pondering and offering suggestions for establishing peace in the region, in a way that would assure Israel of protection against future attacks from Gaza.
Any proposal that calls for Arab states to deploy troops to monitor the Israeli-Gaza border is a non-starter. No Arab country will offer to act as Israel’s security guard. America has rejected Israel’s idea to create a buffer zone on Gaza’s side. Perhaps, the most practical proposal is the one Egypt is reported to have prepared and discussed with the main protagonists as well as with Qatar and the United States. It involves a phased exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, ending with a permanent ceasefire. A government of experts would be appointed — by whom is not clear — to run both the West Bank and Gaza. It would work with all parties and the Palestinian factions to agree on parliamentary and presidential elections. Israel is reported to have offered a two-month suspension of hostilities in return for getting back all the hostages. It is also willing to let the Hamas leadership emigrate to another country. But Hamas, in perhaps a miscalculation of its own, is insisting on a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of all Israeli troops before returning the hostages. In this writer’s view, the United Nations will have to be an indispensable part of any solution, Israel’s allergy to the international organisation notwithstanding.
In the Middle East, one must always expect the unexpected. There surely are secret talks and negotiations going on between several parties on all aspects of the highly volatile and complex situation in the region. Let us hope that we will all be pleasantly surprised one day when we read or hear about some breakthrough.

A large contingent of police and Rapid Action Force (RAF) was deployed and markets remained closed on Thursday as tension prevailed in the area.
The clash involving stone pelting took place between 10 pm and midnight near the Howrah railway station during a rally by members of the minority community.
Howrah Police Commissioner Praveen Tripathi said they are investigating the matter and a case of rioting has been initiated into the incident. However, no arrest has been made in this connection yet, the police said, adding that people from both sides pelted each other with stones.
According to the police, some members of a community took out a rally from Tikiapara to Fasitala. But in Belilious Road, slogans were raised by both sides and led to the clash.
All lanes and bylanes were heavily guarded by the police and barricades were put up at various places to restrict the movement of vehicles.
Sunil Sharma, a local resident, said, “Members of a community took out a religious procession from Tikiapara in Belilious Road. They wanted to go to Gorabazar area where a religious event took place two days back. However, the police stopped them at Vishti Para area and did not allow them to move in that direction. But some people from the rally went to the Gorabazar area and started pelting stones. Soon members of another community also pelted stones at them.”
The police personnel, who were few in number, were overpowered by members of both groups as stone pelting intensified. “Even some policemen were hit with stones. The stone pelting continued for one and a half hours. Some shops and a few e-rickshaws were damaged. Later, more police came and fired tear-gas shells to disperse the mob,” said another resident.
Union Minister Smirti Irani, who was in Kolkata, said, “Stones were pelted in Howrah yesterday. Goons who are sheltered by Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress tried to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere there. The police didn’t reach the spot where stone pelting was going on. But they appeared and stopped the live-streaming (in Kolkata) when the PM was addressing youth voters. INDIA alliance leaders’ disrespect towards Sanatan Dharam and Lord Ram is evident.”
The Union Minister also slammed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for holding all-faith harmony rally on January 22 to appease a particular community.
Hitting back at Irani, state minister Shashi Panja said, “The BJP always gives speeches to stoke communal tension and to create a division between religions. This does not happen in Bengal. On January 22, our party supremo Mamata Banerjee led a rally and said all religions are equal. The BJP’s communal game will not be allowed in Bengal.”
Accusing the ruling TMC of instigating violence, BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said the state police turned into a mute spectator when the clash broke out. “When the incident was taking place and turning violent with both sides pelting stones at each other, the police took no action. No arrest was made. The violence was instigated by a local TMC leader who asked his party workers to pull down all hoardings and posters of the BJP in the area. There was a resistance from the local people against an act of hooliganism,” said Bhattacharya.
Appealing to the people to maintain peace in the area, state minister and senior TMC leader Arup Roy said, “The police acted promptly and brought the situation under control. Section 144 of CrPC has been imposed so that no fresh violence takes place,” said Roy."
LLSXYGJM7K_MEZ5ATRK1YX95V5,"‘Will densify network, want to be at least no. 2 in any city pair’: Air India Express MD",Sukalp Sharma,"Updated: January 26, 2024 07:14 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/interview-with-aloke-singh-md-air-india-express-9128164/,"The merger of Tata group’s budget airlines Air India Express (AI Express) and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) into one carrier — AI Express — is on track for completion in the next three to four months, even as operational integration of the two is nearly complete. According to AI Express’s Managing Director Aloke Singh, the airline in its brand-new avatar aspires to double its market share by 2028, more than triple its fleet size to 180 aircraft, and build a dense network focussed on tier-two and tier-three cities, all while working in synergy with parent Air India to realise the group’s vision of emerging as a formidable player in India and beyond.
In an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Singh gives a lowdown of AI Express’s vision and strategy to chart ambitious growth in the coming years. Edited Excerpts:
The past year has been all about the integration, which involves integrating systems, processes, platforms, people, brand, networks and fleets. We have tweaked the combined network to facilitate flows between the two networks. That integration is now moving into a merger, which we hope to complete in three to four months. Simultaneously, a massive growth agenda has kicked in. We are now inducting aircraft at a rate of three-and-a-half per month, and it will continue for a while.
The new capacity will help us grow significantly. This growth will come from our existing markets as well as some new ones. In our existing markets, we will densify the network and plug gaps that we could not address earlier due to capacity constraints. The broad network strategy is that we will first consolidate our presence and become stronger wherever we already operate. We want to be at least the number two player in any city pair. We don’t want to open too many new stations together. We want to open one station, deploy capacity there to increase connectivity, and spread out from there. As we become firm in a market, it will also help us in rationalising costs.
If you put the two networks together, we roughly have 50 per cent capacity each on domestic and international. This will remain so for the next year or two. The domestic portion will then grow to some extent. We will probably end up with about 60 per cent domestic and 40 per cent international. The domestic market is much bigger and our capacity deployment will reflect that.
In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments—15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international.
It has started and will be a continuous process as the nature of markets is dynamic. Route rationalisation at the group level has begun. Different operational models suit different markets. If we see that a market is better served in financial terms by the low-cost model, then we will deploy the relevant product. There will be markets where operating premium products will offer an upside, so the full-service product will be offered there. In markets and segments that are big and deep enough, we would look at straddling both product offerings.
The market is big enough and deep enough, and has space for a number of players. The broad thrust of our network strategy will be a lot more focus on tier-two and tier-three cities. We will also focus on international operations from tier-two cities, because that is a space we understand very well. We will not be concentrating our capacity on large cities. Of course, there will be some capacity deployed there, but a large part will be for tier-two, tier-three cities.
Yes, it will not be focussed on a large hub. However, our network will have a number a focus cities, probably 10, where we will also transfer passengers. Like, Kochi may not be a hub per se, but it has significant potential for domestic-to-domestic, international-to-domestic, and even international-to-international transfers. Similarly, we are connecting Bangalore, where we have a dense network, to our points in Kerala. For example, we can offer travel from Ayodhya to Kochi via Bangalore, or a Lucknow-Bangalore-Trivandrum connection.
We will have a mixed fleet. You have to look at the fleet from the group perspective. The fleet will be fungible. We want that flexibility. Having a mixed fleet may have some sub-optimality, but with scale, fleet commonality benefits diminish. If you have 200 or 300 or 400 aircraft, due to the large scale of operations, a mixed fleet is not too different from a single-type fleet.
Our plan is to have a fleet size of about 180 aircraft by 2028. We have a legacy fleet of 26 737NGs (737 Next Generation), of which 10 are leased, and 28 A320s, all of which are leased. The leased aircraft will start going back to lessors starting this year.
So far, we have not taken that call at the group level. The aircraft deliveries will stretch over years. Some of the Airbus A320s and A321s (also part of the order) may even come our (Air India Express) way. Aircraft type within the group will remain fungible given the long delivery schedule and the decisions will be based on synergies within the group like aircraft engineering and maintenance. But certainly, Air India Express will operate under an all-economy model.
No, we have no such plans at present. We first want to grow and scale up with our current model (low-cost domestic and short-haul international operations), before thinking about anything else.
We are not going to change the livery on the legacy fleet. One reason is that many of those aircraft will be going back to lessors once the leases expire. Secondly, we want to prioritise the new aircraft, as the painting capacity in the MROs (maintenance, repair, and overhaul units) is limited. We want to paint the new aircraft first and then take a call on the older ones. In any airline’s livery change programme, it takes years for 100 per cent of the aircraft to get rebranded.
Certainly, we could look at it, if it fits into our route strategy. We would be really interested in international UDAN, but there could be some domestic routes also that could make sense for us."
LMTL1P3WU9_ROUQD49WGSWPLA9,Mohan Bhagwat writes: Construction of Ram temple marks the reawakening of national pride,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 08:48 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/mohan-bhagwat-writes-construction-of-ram-temple-marks-the-reawakening-of-national-pride-9121126/,"The history of our Bharat is the history of continuous struggle against the invaders for around the last one-and-a-half-thousand years. The aim of early invasions was to plunder and sometimes (like Alexander’s invasion) for colonisation. But the attacks from the West in the name of Islam only brought complete destruction and alienation of society. To demoralise the nation, society, it was necessary to destroy their religious places, hence foreign invaders destroyed temples in India. They did this not once but multiple times. Their aim was to demoralise Bharatiya society so that they could rule over Bharat unhindered with a weakened society.
The demolition of Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya was also done with the same intention and for the same purpose. This policy of the invaders was not limited to just Ayodhya or any one temple, but was a war strategy for the entire world. Indian rulers never attacked anyone, but the rulers of the world have done such misdeeds by being aggressive for the expansion of their kingdom. But in Bharat, it did not have the desired results, not at least as per their expectations. On the contrary, in Bharat, the faith, commitment and morale of the society never diminished, the society did not bow down, their struggle of resistance continued.
Therefore, repeated attempts were made to take control of the birthplace and build a temple there. There were many wars, struggles, and sacrifices for him. And the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi got ingrained in the minds of Hindus. In 1857, when a rebellion was being planned against the British, Hindus and Muslims together expressed their readiness to fight against them, and then there was mutual exchange of ideas between them. At that time, a situation evolved where there would be a reconciliation on the issue of banning cow slaughter and liberation of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi. Bahadur Shah Zafar also guaranteed a ban on cow slaughter. As a result, the entire society fought together. The Bharatiya people showed bravery in that war but unfortunately this War of Independence failed. Then, Bharat did not get independence, and the British rule remained uninterrupted, but the struggle for Ram temple did not stop.
The British “policy of divide and rule”, towards the Hindus and the Muslims that was already in practice, gained prominence after 1857. To break the unity, the British hanged the heroes of the struggle in Ayodhya and the question of liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi remained unresolved. The struggle for Ram temple continued.
After the Independence in 1947, when the Somnath temple was unanimously renovated, the discussion on more such temples started. A similar consensus could have been considered regarding the liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi, but the direction of politics changed. Selfish politics such as discrimination and appeasement became prevalent and hence the question remained as it is. On this issue, the governments did not even consider the wishes and sentiments of the Hindu society. On the contrary, they tried to destroy the initiative taken by the society. The legal battle related to this, which had been going on since pre-Independence, continued. The mass movement for the liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi began in the 1980s and continued for 30 years.
In 1949, the idol of Bhagwan Shri Ramchandra appeared at the Ram Janmabhoomi. In 1986, the temple was unlocked as per the court order. In the coming period, the struggle of the Hindu society continued through many campaigns and karseva. In 2010, the Allahabad High Court passed a judgment. The efforts had to be sustained for final resolution of the issue at the earliest. On November 9, 2019, after 134 years of legal struggle, the Supreme Court gave a balanced decision after examining the truth and facts.
The feelings and facts of both the parties (religions) were also considered in this decision. This decision has been given after hearing the arguments of all the parties in the court. According to this decision, a board of trustees was constituted for constructing the temple. The bhoomipujan of the temple took place on August 5, 2020, and now on Paush Shukla Dwadashi Yugabd 5125, accordingly on January 22, 2024, the installation and Pran Pratishtha ceremony of the idol of Shri Ram Lalla has been organised.
From the dharmic point of view, Shri Ram is the most worshipped deity in the majority society and the life of Shri Ramchandra is still accepted as an ideal way of conduct by the entire society. Hence, now the conflict that rose from the dispute should end. The bitterness that has arisen in the meantime should also end. The enlightened people of the society must see that the dispute ends completely.
Ayodhya means a city “where there is no war”, “a place free of conflict”. On this occasion, in the entire country, reconstruction of Ayodhya should be there in our minds. It is also our duty. The occasion of construction of Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya marks the reawakening of national pride. This also signifies the acceptance of the vision of life behind the character of Shri Ram by the modern Bharatiya society. Lord Shri Ram is to be worshipped in the temple with rituals of “Patram Pushpam Phalam Toyam” (leaves, flowers, fruits, and water) and at the same time, by establishing the image of Shri Ram in our minds, and in the light of the same, inculcating the ideal conduct we have to worship Shri Ram.
As “Shivo Bhootva Shivam Bhajet, Ramo Bhootva Ramam Bhajet” (to worship Shiva, be Shiva, to worship Ram, be Ram) is called true worship. If we consider this point of view, then according to the social nature of Bharatiya culture, we need to imbibe “Matravat pardareshu, pardravyeshu loshtvat. Atmavat sarvabhuteshu, yah pasyati sah panditah” (He is a wise man who sees the wives of others as his mother, the wealth of others like clod of earth and all beings as his own self). In this way we too will have to follow the path of Shri Ram. Integrity in life, forgiveness with strength and bravery, sincerity and humility, compassion and care in dealing with everyone, gentleness of heart and strictness towards oneself in performing the duty – these are the qualities of Shri Ram that everyone should emulate in their lives and in their families.
Efforts to bring it into everyone’s life will have to be made with honesty, dedication, and hardwork. Besides, keeping in view our national life, discipline will have to be instilled in social life also. We know that on the basis of the same discipline, Shri Ram-Lakshman had completed their 14 years of exile and successfully completed the fight against the powerful Ravana.
To once again spread the qualities of justice and compassion, equality with social harmony, fairness, and social virtues reflected in the character of Shri Ram; to once again build a pursuant and courageous society based on equal justice without exploitation, endowed with strength as well as compassion – this would be a social worship of Shri Ram. This world is destructive because of egoism, selfishness, and discrimination and is bringing infinite calamities upon itself.
The advent of Shri Ram Lalla in Ram Janmabhoomi and his Pran Pratishtha is the beginning of the campaign for reconstruction of Bharatvarsh which is for the well-being of all, accepting all without enmity, and showing the path of harmony, unity, progress, and peace. We are the active followers and implementers of that campaign. In the devotional celebration of January 22, along with the reconstruction of the temple, all of us have taken the resolve to reconstruct Bharat, and through it, pave the way for reconstruction of the entire world. By always keeping this guiding light in mind, moving forward is the need of the hour. Jay Siya Ram!

LQ7RCZBIVL_PPR57I7NQWQJQGW,"Kerala Governor Arif Mohd lashes out at ex-SC judge: ‘Father is receiving money, while son is blasting me’",Arun Janardhanan,"Updated: January 29, 2024 09:02 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/kerala-governor-arif-mohd-lashes-out-at-ex-sc-judge-father-is-receiving-money-while-son-is-blasting-me-9128117/,"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has made a conflict of interest allegation against former Supreme Court judge Rohinton Fali Nariman, who had criticised him over the “wholesale reference of Bills to the President after sitting on 23 Bills without a decision”.
Speaking at an education conclave organised by The New Indian Express on Wednesday, Khan expressed dismay at Nariman’s comments and said, “The judge’s whole anger was directed at me. He repeatedly referred to the ‘Governor of Kerala’, while ignoring governors of Punjab and Tamil Nadu, who have similar cases pending against them.”
Khan suggested that Justice Nariman’s allegations against him stemmed from the Kerala government sanctioning substantial legal fees to his father and senior Supreme Court advocate Fali S Nariman, and his associates. Going on to list the break-up of fees paid to Fali Nariman and his junior associates, the Governor said the payments were not made for appearances but solely for legal opinions during the time the state government and Khan were entangled in a legal tussle.
“Father is receiving the money while son is blasting the Governor,” Khan said. “This relationship is problematic, especially when Nariman’s father and his team were paid a significant amount by the Kerala government. Would it be appropriate to pay Rs 40 lakh just for an opinion? Is this even consistent with the principles of natural justice?” he said.
A senior CPI(M) leader in Kerala said the party did not want to comment on the matter.
In December, while delivering the Bansari Sheth lecture in Mumbai, Justice (retd) Nariman had said: “I am waiting for the day when the Supreme Court will lay down that it is only independent functionaries who are supposed to fill these great offices. Not the kind of people that we find today, like we have in Kerala, for example. In Kerala, after sleeping over the Bills, they have been given to the President in wholesale by the Governor.”
Justice (retd) Nariman’s remarks came a month after the Kerala government moved the top court against Khan, accusing him of delaying assent to Bills passed by the Assembly. Khan was also rapped by the apex court in the matter. “What was the Governor doing for two years sitting on the Bills?” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud had questioned.
Asked about some states moving Bills to remove Governors from the post of chancellors of state-run universities, Khan said at the event that there was no need to change the current system as it was “a very wise decision taken at that time”.
Khan and the Left-led Kerala government have been engaged in a tussle over a series of issues, including over the chancellor post. In the latest incident, on Thursday, the Governor wrapped up his policy address before the Budget Session in less than two minutes, choosing to skip the entire text barring the first and last paras."
LQHWZXRDC1_CHRM1SW46LYA2RA,"‘Suspend SoO agreements,’ ‘Hold Assam Rifles accountable’: Manipur MLAs issue joint statement after fresh violence",Jimmy Leivon,"Updated: January 23, 2024 10:03 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/suspend-soo-agreements-hold-assam-rifles-accountable-manipur-mlas-issue-joint-statement-after-fresh-violence-9122746/,"Following a fresh bout of violence this month in Manipur, 32 of the 60 MLAs in the Manipur Assembly unanimously adopted several resolutions on Sunday. These included the demand for immediate abrogation from Suspension of Operations (SoO) with armed militants who have allegedly killed civilians and calling for replacement of the Assam Rifles.
This development comes on the day a special team of the Union Home Ministry arrived in the state for talks between the Meitei and Kuki communities, who have been engaged in a protracted standoff since May last year.
The statement by the MLAs argued that the SoO agreements with Kuki armed militant groups, and the resulting immunity they provide against a “firm reaction” from Central forces, is the “main cause of the never-ending cycle of violence”.
The SoO militants who “indulge in killing of innocent civilians and violation of ground rules should be abrogated immediately,” it said.
The statement also added that SoO agreements with militant groups “who also indulge in anti-state activities” should not be extended beyond their expiry date of February 29, 2024.
The joint statement further demanded a “complete disarmament of all illegal arms in the possession of miscreants and unauthorised persons in the entire state at the earliest by the Central and state forces”.
“Armed attacks (using sophisticated weaponry such as Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers) on Indian soil, Indian citizens and state security forces by Myanmar based armed Militants must be stopped at all costs. It will be to the detriment of the prestige of the Republic of India if this cannot be achieved in short order,” it stated.
The MLAs also accused the Assam Rifles, a central armed police force, for not being “responsive”. They alleged that members of the force were “mute spectators when unarmed civilians (particularly farmers) are being indiscriminately fired upon frequently”.
They said that the “Assam rifles and their leadership (chain of command) need to give strict instructions and be held accountable”. It suggested the Assam Rifles be replaced with “forces that have the ability to act by returning suppressive fire when they observe that unarmed civilians are being fired upon”.
“Such a reaction, which is wholly appropriate to safeguard the lives of civilians under fire, has been non-existent, which is why the public’s faith and trust in the forces presently deployed at places such as Moreh, Bishnupur, Imphal West, Kakching among others has been shattered,” added the statement.
The MLAs urged the Centre to take up “appropriate action at the earliest”. “Failing this”, the statement said, the “legislators will take appropriate action in consultation with the public.”"
LRDO0B50LU_IA4V3BAVA3OSX67,"US signals cooperation with China on AI safety: what could happen, and what could it mean?",Anil Sasi,"Updated: January 27, 2024 04:36 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/us-cooperation-china-ai-safety-significance-9127739/,"Less than six months after President Joe Biden signed an executive order prohibiting American investments in sensitive technologies in China, including artificial intelligence (AI) systems, the United States has signalled a rapprochement — by agreeing to work with Beijing on safely deploying AI systems.
Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told the Financial Times that despite their trade tensions, especially in sensitive technology sectors, the two countries would work together to “lessen [the] risks and assess [the] capabilities” of AI.
“Steps have been taken to engage in that process,” Prabhakar said on the question of collaboration with China on AI. “We have to try to work [with Beijing].”
Two important events took place between the executive order, issued in August 2023, prohibiting tech transfers to China, and the statement by the White House’s top science adviser.
At the beginning of November, China joined 27 other countries (including India) and the European Union to sign the Bletchley Declaration on evolving standards for AI at the world’s first AI Safety Summit in the United Kingdom.
Later that same month, President Biden met with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit outside San Francisco for wide-ranging discussions including on US export controls for sensitive equipment.
Why is the statement by the White House important?
The change in approach from Washington comes at a time when rapid progress in AI has triggered global concern that this frontier technology could widen vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and spread misinformation, especially as a record 40-odd countries vote in elections this year.
It also coincides with a recent report in Forbes that quoted analysts including Kaifu Lee — a tracker of AI development in China — to claim that the two countries “have reached parity in the development of artificial intelligence but China’s implementation of the technology in products and services is likely to edge ahead of the US this year”.
Chinese AI major Baidu, working in partnership with Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent, has recently unveiled ERNIE, a 23-billion-parameter AI model trained on almost 150 million Chinese image-text pairs. Another Chinese AI model is Taiyi, a bilingual (Chinese-English) large language model trained on some 20 million filtered Chinese image-text pairs and one billion parameters.
China has declared its intent to become the global leader in AI by 2030, and TikTok is seen as a global leader in behavioural algorithms.
Facial recognition is yet another area where China is seen as getting far ahead of the US and Europe, given the heavy deployment of a billion surveillance cameras in Chinese urban centres that are being hooked up with backend AI tools.
While the contours of the new collaboration are unclear, Prabhakar told the FT that while the US may disagree with China on certain values and approaches to regulation, “there will also be places where we can agree”, including on global technical and safety standards for AI software.
Prabhakar underlined, however, that the US “did not intend to slow down AI development, but to maintain oversight of the technology”.
This comes in the backdrop of criticism that the Biden administration had potentially dented the competitive advantage of American tech companies in AI by moving too early to regulate it.
Prabhakar argued that even American AI companies “accepted the need for clear methods to understand and assess AI”. She said the best options available to evaluate the safety of new AI systems were “not up to scratch” because of “the complex and opaque nature of the technology”.
While the US has imposed export curbs on cutting-edge chips such as Nvidia’s latest GPUs to curb China’s ability to train foundational models needed for AI, there is also a realisation in Washington that political divergences notwithstanding, the US and Chinese AI research ecosystems are deeply intertwined. Some of the best AI scientists coming out of China come to the US, and Washington can benefit from some of these ties to China, including the talent flows from that country.
What could be the impact of this seeming reconciliation in other geographies?
A US-China alignment on AI technology, especially its regulation, could have an impact across other geographies, including India.
India has been trying to pitch itself as a country that has effectively used technology to develop and deliver governance solutions on a mass scale — the biometric identity programme Aadhaar and the payments solution Unified Payments Interface (UPI) being examples.
These solutions form the bedrock of what New Delhi calls Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) — in which the underlying technology is sanctioned by the government, and then offered to private entities to develop various use cases. India wants to take the same DPI approach with AI.
With sovereign AI and an AI compute infrastructure (the software and hardware needed to build AI-powered systems), New Delhi is not looking to merely compete with the generative AI type of model. It also wants to focus on real-life use cases in healthcare, agriculture, governance, language translation, etc., to maximise economic development.
As of now, the European approach to technology rules is seen as being based inherently on regulation for the rights of citizens, while the US approach is more innovator-focussed. According to policymakers, India’s approach so far has been a hybrid of the European and American approaches. The new US-China consensus on tech development and regulation could offer another useful template."
LRP1V666CV_8EYOV7DFJUG8LT0,UPSC Essentials | Case Study (Week 3) — IAS officer who conducted ‘Sabarimala Yatra’ through strategic planning,Manas Srivastava,"Updated: January 30, 2024 16:47 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/upsc-current-affairs/upsc-essentials/upsc-essentials-case-study-week-3-sabarimala-yatra-ias-divya-iyer-governance-award-9121129/,"Let us celebrate a good governance strategy that made big headlines. The following case study is framed from a success story recognised at The Indian Express Excellence in Governance Awards. UPSC Essentials of The Indian Express takes you through some inspiring case studies every week from the area of Governance and Civil Services which not only highlight the problem but also focus on award-winning solutions.
Relevance: For Essays, Governance and Ethics section of Mains examination as case studies and example-fodder for answers. Candidates will find it useful for framing replies in interviews and personality tests. This particular case study is relevant to questions related to Disaster Management. Moreover, to remain motivated, and inspired and create role models, such real-life stories should be read, noted, and applied.
Accidents during mass gatherings are not a novel phenomenon. Especially in a place that is prone to natural disasters. The hill shrine of Sabarimala, situated 72 km from Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, is the sacred abode of Lord Ayyappa. Every year, hundreds of devotees from various parts of the country visit the temple during the Mandala season. When the pilgrimage opened in 2021-22, the situations were different with many obstacles for district administration. After a series of disruptions, from protests to the pandemic, the district administration faced another challenge: the massive floods and landslides had made early preparations nearly impossible. Can we think of effective crowd management in a place like Pathanamthitta, where conducting ‘Sabarimala Yatra’ amid natural disasters is not easy?
What is Crowd management? It may be defined as a systematic process of planning, organizing and monitoring large gatherings. Such management must be anticipated and planned accordingly for the worst situation and therefore should strategise to reduce and mitigate the risks in advance.
Crowd management is an important tool for safety of citizens especially at religious places. Unfortunately crowd disasters still happen. According to nidm.gov.in such disasters still happen due to lack of (i) understanding of crowd behaviour, (ii) coordination, (iii) clear roles & responsibilities of various stakeholders and (iv) proper planning on the part of organizers.
Tackling many challenges, IAS Divya Iyer and the district administration of Pathanamthitta district of Kerala successfully managed to conduct the yatra through some strategic planning and execution. The following were the part of the strategy:
1. Coordination with 52 stakeholder departments,
2. The administration undertook a Safety Walk,
3. Carrying out landslide hazard mapping,
4. The administration also designed the Sabarimala Virtual Queue System to regulate and streamline the queue of devotees.
All these steps were taken while following strict covid protocols.
Crowd management has now emerged as a discipline. It requires a planned response to mass gatherings and enhancing the experience of those participating in them. Crowd planning is to be prioritised for public safety.

An effective crowd management is the first responsibility of administration especially in a place like Pathanamthitta where conducting ‘Sabarimala Yatra’ amid natural disasters is not an easy task. In a conversation with Manas Srivastava of The Indian Express during the Excellence in Governance Award ceremony in 2023, IAS Divya S Iyer told that Pathanamthitta district is prone to many natural disasters and thus it is the responsibility of the administration to protect the people from the hazards. So, hazard mapping was essential which was done with the help of agencies like the Indian Meteorological Department and under the aegis of State Disaster Management Authority.
Disaster Management is not just about responding to disaster but also about preventing, mitigating and providing warnings in advance. People have to be taught how to deal with disasters. The project of crowd management begins before the gathering, continues throughout and ends after the gathering or event. There is also a plan to start a disaster literacy program for children in the school.
Divya believes that the capacity and curiosity to learn is an important value for a civil servant. Civil Services isn’t a routine job. Everyday offers new challenges and so one needs to be a good learner to survive and flourish in Civil Services.
For an effective crowd management project that mitigates disaster risks, District Collector Divya S Iyer was awarded The Indian Express Excellence in Governance Award in the ‘Jury Special’ category.
Crowd management is an important tool for safety of citizens especially at religious places. Unfortunately crowd disasters still happen. What are the major reasons behind such disasters. Suggest strategies to avoid crowd disasters.

LWHY2C1FBZ_QV3FSZWD3WKXRC4,‘Unsigned show cause notice’: HC sets aside Delhi Police order asking bar to cease operations,Jignasa Sinha,"Updated: January 22, 2024 10:02 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/unsigned-show-cause-notice-hc-sets-aside-delhi-police-order-asking-bar-to-cease-operations-9120986/,"Noting that the show cause notice issued was “unsigned”, Delhi High Court has set aside an order by the Delhi Police to a café-bar in South Delhi to cease operations. Sources said the Licensing department of the Delhi Police had sent a notice to Uncultured Café and Bar in Kailash Colony with multiple “discrepancies”, and the notice was later set aside by the court.
The police notice is based on an FIR lodged in 2022 against the café-bar under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). Police had said the eatery was operating post 1 am. Notably, this came days after a senior IPS officer’s name had come up in connection with an alleged incident in which a woman was injured after she got hit on the head with a glass on the premises. No FIR was registered in the case but a general diary entry was made.
The Indian Express has accessed the notice sent by the Delhi Police; it names the Joint Commissioner of Police (Licensing) but none of the officers (in the department) have signed it.
“Whereas, inspection conducted by team of Licensing Unit found the entity operational and using 4th floor that is violation of FSC & Delhi Police License. CCTV recording was found of 10 days instead of 30 days. That is clear violation of terms & conditions laid down in the Registration Certificate. Therefore, your eating house i.e. M/s Uncultured (A Unit of Konnect Hospitality) are violating the terms and condition of Delhi Police Eating House License,” the notice said. “Therefore, I…Joint Commissioner of Police, Licensing, New Delhi, in exercise of power conferred upon the undersigned under the provisions of “Delhi Eating Houses Registration Regulations 2023”, do hereby suspend the Registration Certificate no. and directed to cease operations of Eating House with immediate effect…” it added.
The notice is not only unsigned but also not dated properly: while the notice was issued on January 1, 2024, it is dated December 27, 2023 at one place.
In the High Court, M Sufian Siddiqui, the lawyer for the petitioner, stated that the café-bar does not have any operations on the 4th floor, as opposed to what is written in the notice. Also, only a single DVR was malfunctioning while the premises has other CCTV recordings up to 30 days.
Officials said the Delhi Fire Services also inspected the place in May 2023 and, in their report, mentioned the café-bar was only operating till the 3rd floor, adding the premises is compliant with the fire safety standards/requirements. A senior DFS officer confirmed that the premises was not violating FSC (Fire Safety Clearance) norms.
On Friday, the High Court sought details of the case and found that the police show-cause notice was unsigned and hence it “can not exist”, and the café-bar can remain operational. The petition was disposed of and the police were directed to look into the matter.
“The order is unsigned, does not even bear any facsimile or digital signatures of the Jt. CP, thus cannot be acted upon, and is not a valid order in the eyes of law. Besides, the said order is brazen abuse of the process of law, patently suffers from arbitrariness, based on absolutely spurious grounds, disproportionately harsh and precipitously passed without affording any opportunity of hearing, violating the Guarantee of Article 14 of the Constitution,” said lawyer Siddiqui.
The Joint CP, licensing, was not available for comment."
LXFCU8IAV1_R0VOS99JPBQ9V6W,‘CUET final answer key will be uploaded before result is declared’: NTA assures Delhi High Court,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 09:46 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/cuet-final-answer-key-nta-delhi-high-court-9123584/,"The National Testing Agency (NTA) has assured the Delhi High Court that the final answer key of the Central University Entrance Test (CUET) would be uploaded on its website at least a day prior to the declaration of the result.
The submission was recorded in an order passed by the High Court pertaining to two pleas filed by a candidate who appeared in the CUET (UG) 2022 examination seeking directions to the NTA to publish the final answer key of the 2022 CUET, reconsider his objections regarding two questions and publish a corrected score card.
A single judge bench of Justice C Hari Shankar in its January 19 order observed, “The learned ASG (appearing for the NTA) has pointed out that the exercise of re-examination of the answer keys after the final results were declared may have been avoidable but was undertaken bona fide, especially as a large number of objections were received even after the final result was declared. It is submitted that, in the interest of the students, a decision was taken to reconsider the objections. The fact that the CUET was being conducted for the first time, and the magnitude of the exercise, had persuaded the NTA to adopt this approach.”
“However, the Court has been assured that in future, this would not happen and that any exercise of consideration of objections to the provisional answer key would be undertaken only prior to the final result of the examination of the CUET. The Court has also been assured that the final answer key would be uploaded on the website of the NTA at least a day prior to the final declaration of result, though it would be accessible only through the individual login ID and password of the candidate concerned,” the High Court noted.
Justice Shankar said that the court is satisfied with NTA’s explanation and further directed the NTA to ensure that the assurances given are “scrupulously adhered to, in future”.
Meanwhile, the counsel appearing for the candidate did not press the prayer for fresh consideration of the remaining objections to the provisional answer key in one of the petitions.
In another petition, the candidate filed an application seeking to amend the writ petition for a thorough investigation into the manner in which there was a re-examination of the answer keys and for summoning the records pertaining to normalisation of the scores of the CUET, etc.
“I am not inclined at this point of time to direct any such investigation as it would lead to needless controversy and it does not appear that the NTA has, in acting as it did, not been bona fide. The substantive prayer…which was for making known the final answer key, stands satisfied,” the High Court said disposing of both the pleas.
The petitioner applied for and had appeared for the CUET (UG) 2022 examination on August 18 and 30, 2022. The provisional answer keys for the 2022 CUET were released by the NTA on September 8, 2022.
On the same day, i.e. September 8, 2022, the NTA issued a Public Notice, allowing candidates who had appeared in the CUET to challenge the provisional answer key by paying a nominal fee.
The Public Notice said if the challenge raised by any candidate was found to be correct, the provisional answer key would be corrected and the final answer key would be issued accordingly. The final result of the CUET would be based on the final answer key.
The Public Notice also clarified that no individual candidate would be informed about the outcome of her/his challenge and that the final answer key would not be open to question. The petitioner submitted objections against the answer proposed in the provisional answer key in respect of 11 questions on September 10, 2022, within the time stipulated in that regard.
On September 15, 2022, a second Public Notice was issued by the NTA, stating that the challenges to the provisional answer key had been placed before the subject experts and that the answer keys had been finalised.
The Public Notice also stated that the final answer key would be available by 10 pm on September 15, 2022. On September 16, 2022, the final result of the 2022 CUET, along with the final scores of the individual candidates, was released by the NTA.
Aggrieved by the fact that the NTA shared the final results without making the final answer key known to the candidates, the petitioner filed the first writ.
Subsequently the final answer key was uploaded. A perusal of the final answer key disclosed that prior to the publication of the final result on September 16, 2022, the challenge by the petitioner to two other answers in the proposed answer key had been accepted. The position that emerged was that of the 11 answers in the provisional answer key, which were challenged by the petitioner, the challenge was accepted in respect of four answers, of which two were accepted prior to the release of the final result and two were accepted after the petitioner had filed one of the petitions.
The candidate thereafter filed a second petition seeking that his objections in respect of the remaining questions, and not accepted by the NTA, be also considered/re-considered and his corrected result/score card be published."

The couple had been on the run since last week after the police registered a case against them under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They were arrested from a hideout near Andhra Pradesh, as per multiple reports.
The Madras High Court on Thursday had declined the couple’s request to direct the Principal District and Sessions Court in Chennai to consider their bail applications on the same day of their surrender.
The couple was arrested after their former domestic help lodged a police complaint saying that Ann stripped and assaulted her and forced her to drink water mixed with chilli powder. She also accused Mathivanan of hitting her. A video of the victim claiming to have been subjected to repeated physical torture for over eight months and being denied medical care was also shared widely on social media. The victim said that she had been threatened to keep quiet about the abuse.
As per the medical register shared with The Indian Express by Evidence, a Madurai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) that highlighted the alleged abuse, the girl was found to have abrasions above the eyes, on the forehead and chin, and burn injuries on both the forearms.
The issue sparked a political row in Tamil Nadu with the Opposition, including the BJP, urging the police to expedite the inquiry into the allegations.
Meanwhile, officials conducted medical tests on the victim at the Government Royapettah Hospital in Chennai on Thursday."

A native of Belur village in Kerala’s Kasaragod, Sathyanarayana began his mission with 100 grams of a seed variety and kept gleaning seeds of various rice varieties, first from Kerala and then from across the country, to conserve the grains for posterity.
“The Padma award was unexpected. This recognition makes me more responsible. I would continue my mission and add more seeds to my collection,” said Sathyanarayana.
Sathyanarayana said he started the paddy *gene bank conservation out of curiosity and the first rice variety that he experimented with was Rajakayame. Gene banks store genetic resources like seeds.*
“I started gleaning seeds which were left at paddy fields after harvest. Then I developed an interest in growing various seeds in small quantities. Now, I have 650-odd rice varieties. Since I am engaged in this mission, agricultural scientists and farmers from across the country are willing to hand over seeds. For me, a handful of seeds is enough, because I am cultivating only for conservation purposes,” he said.
The 50-year-old farmer, who passed his Class 12 exam last year through a literacy mission programme, has created this paddy gene bank on a small plot of land. “I am not a paddy cultivator, only a conservationist. All varieties of seeds are cultivated on this small patch of land, one after another, throughout the year. I give the seeds to interested farmers free of cost. Let people cultivate,’’ he said.
For livelihood, Sathyanarayana cultivates rubber and areca on four acres of land, owned by his joint family, including his parents and a younger brother. “The terrain of our land is sloppy and not suitable for paddy cultivation. Hence, I started the conservation experiment in the courtyard of the house where various varieties were sown in grow bags. The saplings are later shifted to small pots.”
In 2021, he was honoured with the Plant Genome Saviour Farmer Reward for his efforts in conserving rice varieties. The rice varieties are of different colour, different taste, dwarf and long grass, with short and long durations and which are suitable for various climatic conditions."

A special gallery on Prime Minister Narendra Modi was recently opened to visitors at the museum. Dattatreya was so impressed with the collection that he suggested that universities should make their students visit the Sangrahalaya, as it is “useful and informative” for them.
At Veer Gatha 3.0, an event jointly organised by the ministries of defence and education on Wednesday, a parent interrupted the programme saying the announcer excluded his granddaughter’s name during the felicitation ceremony “because she hails from Tamil Nadu”. The matter was soon resolved when the organisers admitted to having missed the name by mistake. According to sources, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the chief guest at the event, later spoke to the man and his granddaughter, putting the matter to rest. The event was organised to award 100 students from across the country who excelled in poem, essays, painting and multimedia presentations on acts of bravery by Indian soldiers.
The Supreme Court recently elevated 11 women lawyers as senior advocates. Most of them got a call from Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, congratulating them. This is the first time that the SC has elevated so many women lawyers as senior advocates in one go. The CJI is learnt to have reminded the senior advocates of their responsibilities and told them that they have an important role to play in terms of mentoring juniors."

Parakram Diwas aims to instill fearlessness and patriotism, especially among the youth, inspiring them to stand strong in the face of challenges. Netaji’s unmatched courage and charm served as a guiding light, motivating Indians to fearlessly oppose colonial rule.
Schools and colleges nationwide organise cultural events on Subhash Chandra Bose Jayanti. The Indian national flag is raised ceremoniously, and monuments like Netaji Museum, Netaji Bhawan, and INA Museum are adorned with garlands. Students take the stage to deliver speeches, reflecting on Netaji’s inspiring legacy and that of other freedom fighters.

The incident occurred in Lalbagh area under the Ramchandra Mission police station jurisdiction. The three accused were identified as Ankit Katheria, Rohit Joshi and Rohit Saxena, all aged 20. Their associate Pankaj Saxena is absconding, the police said.
Ramchandra Mission police station incharge CP Shukla said, “The incident took place around 8 pm. These three men climbed on top of a mosque and removed the green flag there. They replaced it with a saffron flag with Jai Shri Ram written on it.”
“A case was lodged after a complaint was submitted by Faizullah, a local resident. The three accused have been sent to judicial custody and further action is underway. The situation in the neighbourhood is normal,” added Shukla. The FIR was registered under Section 295 (destroying, damaging, or defiling a place of worship or sacred object to insult the religion of any class of persons) of the Indian Penal Code.
In another incident in the same district, four men belonging to the minority community and some unidentified people were booked after a saffron flag with “Jai Shri Ram” written on it was found desecrated under the Katra police station jurisdiction.
Katra Station House Officer Gaurav Tyagi said, “We have filed a case. But during the probe, the role of those men has not come to light and we suspect that they were being framed."
MCEY9WBNMQ_D09SHXT8W2GMXY5,Taiwan’s new president has his task cut out,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 16:43 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/taiwans-new-president-has-his-task-cut-out-9125757/,"Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected President of Taiwan after an election where his competitors, Hou Yu-ih of the Kuomintang (KMT) and Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) conceded defeat to the former Vice President. This marks the DPP’s third consecutive tenure in office, with more than 40 per cent of votes going to William Lai. Hsiao Bi-khim will be the Vice President. She was the representative of Taiwan to the United States from 2020 to 2023. William Lai assumes his presidency on May 20. Briefly, let us parse through what makes Taiwan and its political culture unique.
The Legislative Yuan, Taiwan’s parliament, elects 113 members, of whom 73 are directly elected, with ballots counted by hand and each vote publicly displayed. Thirty-four seats of the Legislative Yuan are “at large”, allotted proportionately to parties that have secured more than 5 per cent of the votes. The remaining six seats are allotted to indigenous communities, who have been living on the island, much before Ilha Formosa, as it was called by the Portuguese, had their minor coastal holdings facing the South China Sea. The Central Election Commission conducts these polls every four years and is lauded for its efficiency. Taiwan’s elections for a new President demonstrate the country’s varying political expressions that it has witnessed over seven decades — this time, it is democracy with Taiwanese characteristics.
After losing the civil war on the mainland to the communists, the Kuomintang (KMT) led by Chiang Kai-shek “relocated” to Taiwan to establish a nation, where the “market” decides the economy, different from the overwhelming “state control” exemplified by the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Mao Zedong. The KMT began its rule on the island authoritatively, with settled populations in a few towns and hinterland uncomfortable with “mainlanders” who were “occupiers”. Within a few decades, the economy determined daily life, and Taiwan, then known as the Republic of China (ROC), adapted quickly to the former coloniser Japan’s methodologies in fomenting active participation in building an economic nation. During the Cold War, Taiwan had phases of tension with mainland China, but protective reassurances from the United States kept mainland China troops at a distance.
Chiang Kai-shek’s totalitarianism gave way to his son Chiang Ching Kuo’s farsighted demeanour as an authoritarian who steered political culture from absolute control to relative authoritarianism while encouraging the establishment of political parties — with the island gradually transforming into a democracy. A one-party democracy was visualised with the KMT at the helm supported by weaker political parties and Lee Teng-hui of the KMT as elected President exemplified this. This gave way to the Democratic People’s Party (DPP), coming to power for the first time in 2000 with Chen Shui-bian, who was at the helm until 2008 when his constitutional limit of two terms for elected President ended. He was replaced by Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT (2008-2016) who gave way to Tsai Ing-wen of the DPP in 2016. With William Lai, the DPP continues to be in power.
There are many important features of Taiwan’s politics. Public enthusiasm for polls is reflected in the media commentary and debates on digital platforms with television documentaries highlighting what contesting candidates must do to assuage people about the economy — and how to convey a politically open Taiwan template to centralised mainland China, just 180 kms across the Taiwan Straits.
With a GDP of $1.2 trillion and a population of 23 million, Taiwan’s per capita income exceeds $32,000 making it northeast Asia’s second richest economy after Japan. Innovative research in “computronics” has made it an island hub for micro technologies, especially microchips and semiconductors. Smartphone manufacturers like Apple source their microchips from companies like Qualcomm and Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). More than 70 per cent of Taiwan’s GDP comes from international trade.
China covets digital technologies created and fabricated in Taiwan, which it wants to replicate. Taiwan, despite the size of China’s economy and its bellicose statements, has stuck to the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) signed with Beijing during KMT Ma Ying-jeou’s term. Not surprisingly, China has a large trade deficit with Taiwan as bilateral trade in 2023 was around $ 224 billion. Taiwanese private investments in the mainland are estimated to be more than $100 billion and there are a few million working in factories owned by Taiwan companies.
Calls in Taiwan to shift its overreliance from China to countries like India and Vietnam are gathering steam. Taiwan’s multi-billion dollar investment in the software sector to manufacture digital chips in India is an example. Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Vietnam, with whom there was a war in 1979, has economic undercurrents too. These arise from his worries about Taiwan’s investments in Fujian province being shifted to Vietnam. After all, Xi Jinping was the CPC Secretary and Governor of this province (1999-2002), closest to Taiwan from the South China Sea.
The election victory for William Lai of the DPP has led to a rigmarole of statements from China and the United States (US). China criticises Taiwan for its flawed political system “choosing” a splittist and denier of history. The US has made statements about democracy being secure in the hands of the newly elected leader of Taiwan from the DPP, with whom they have had a deep relationship.
As an island with the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean on two sides, Taiwan is not a member of UNCLOS, while abiding by its tenets scrupulously. The US, while increasing its arms sales to Taiwan, conveniently ignores Taiwan’s desire to be a member of the World Health Organisation, despite its exceptional health care system and facilities. As a member of the WTO, and named Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei), the island of Taiwan has acquiesced to trading with China, the US, EU, Japan and other countries as recognition of its difference from the mainland. William Lai will, as President, have to move with caution and not make the island a theatre for big powers to squabble over. As a democracy, Taiwan will continue to ensure that future leaders are people with excellent educational backgrounds.

After refusing seven times, Soren had asked the ED officials to come to his residence for questioning on January 20, which eventually went on for 7.5 hours. A few days ago, Soren was sent the summons again. A government source said, “He said that he is not available till March-end, citing his busy schedule.”
The probe in question emanates from illegal possession and sale of an Army land in Ranchi, in which, IAS officer Chhavi Ranjan is also an accused and is currently in judicial custody. During the investigation, another piece of land, around eight acres, was found to be “illegally owned”. The ED is questioning Soren on the ownership of this piece of land."
MDYFAM1IX1_ZN0Y6WUT9LROIE2,"Behind Mamata, Adhir face-off, a history of bad blood, from Bengal Cong days through TMC rise",Atri Mitra,"Updated: January 25, 2024 14:40 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/mamata-adhir-bengal-congress-9126731/,"With West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee turning up the heat on the Congress and declaring that her party would contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls alone, the Opposition INDIA alliance seems to be unravelling in the state, where the CPI(M)-led Left has already been up in arms against the TMC.
The equations between the state Congress unit and the TMC have also been tense and acrimonious, with the relations between Mamata and West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury marked by hostility and bitterness for many years.
The 69-year-old three-time CM, Mamata had floated the TMC after quitting the Congress on January 1, 1998. Former Union minister Adhir, 67, who has been a five-term MP from Berhampore since 1999, is also the Congress’s Leader in the Lok Sabha.
On the relations between Mamata and Adhir, several TMC and Congress leaders echo a common refrain: “Their ties have always been antagonistic, and they have remained poles apart.”
According to a veteran Congress leader, who had been a colleague of both Mamata and Adhir in the grand old party, said, “The two leaders were never in the same boat. When Mamata rebelled against then PCC chief Somen Mitra-led group in the late 1990s and went on to establish TMC, Adhir was with the Somen faction along with other senior leaders like Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi. Ironically, several Congress leaders, including Somen himself, later joined TMC and became MP but Adhir never joined TMC nor got close to Mamata ever.”
In the 2011 Bengal Assembly elections, Mamata spearheaded the TMC to a resounding victory with the Congress’s support to end the Left’s 34-year rule. In December 2012, a Congress minister in the Mamata Cabinet, Manoj Chakraborty – who is close to Adhir and hails from his home turf, Murshidabad district – resigned that led to the collapse of their coalition. Adhir had then stood by Manoj.
Since then, Adhir has been a prominent face of anti-Mamata politics in Bengal. When the Congress and the Left forged an alliance for the 2016 Assembly elections, Adhir was the key leader behind it. A senior TMC leader said, “Our leadership has repeatedly told the Congress high command that if Adhir remains the state president, then TMC and Congress will never be able to become allies in Bengal. Mamata has always preferred Congress leaders like Pradip Bhattacharya or Abdul Mannan who are less strident towards TMC.”
Mamata recently told TMC workers from Murshidabad district that the party was gearing up to contest all the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state. At the same time, while referring to Adhir’s constituency Berhmapore in the district, she told them in the closed-door meeting,“If you all fight unitedly, you can defeat Adhir Chowdhury too,” TMC sources said.
Earlier, Adhir had dared Mamata that “If you have the power, come and fight in Berhampore”. He also claimed, “Mamata Banerjee can win seats with muscle power but cannot win people’s hearts. People are with us in Murshidabad.” Adhir has called Mamata an “opportunist”, maintaining that the Congress would contest the Lok Sabha polls without her assistance. “We won’t fight the elections with Mamata’s help. Congress knows how to fight on its own strength, and Mamata Banerjee should remember that it was with Congress’s support she came to power in Bengal,” he said.
To finalise seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha polls, Mamata earlier offered the Congress just two of its sitting seats – Berhampore and Malda Dakshin. Adhir rejected it, saying the Congress won these seats on its own in 2019 fighting against the TMC and the BJP, and that it would not need any “grace or generosity” from Mamata to win them again.
Meanwhile, senior TMC leader Derek O’Brien on Thursday held Adhir responsible for their alliance not fructifying in the state.
Hitting out at the state Congress chief, O’Brien said the INDIA bloc had many detractors but only two of them, the BJP and Chowdhury, have repeatedly targeted the Opposition alliance.
“After the general elections, if the Congress does its job and defeats the BJP on a substantial number of seats, the Trinamool Congress will very much be a part of the front that believes and fights for the Constitution,” O’Brien reportedly told media persons."
MFHFTUKI6F_ICISQNOQFK8P8SN,Maratha quota survey | Tech woes to community backlash: Data collectors face several obstacles to record info,Rupsa Chakraborty,"Updated: February 1, 2024 17:56 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maratha-quota-survey-tech-woes-to-community-backlash-data-collectors-face-several-obstacles-to-record-info-9128185/,"Days after the Maratha reservation survey commenced, enumerators appointed for the job were riddled with challenges. As data collection work began with an exhaustive list of 154 questions, the number of challenges faced by enumerators was just as lengthy. Obstacles ranged from technical glitches such as struggles with the mobile app being used to record data, internet connectivity and required expenses to language barriers and discomfort in asking some of the questions. They also faced backlash from communities in isolated areas.
The mandatory survey by the Maharashtra State Backward Commission, that commenced on Tuesday, aims to determine the Maratha community’s eligibility as a backward class. The survey covers the Maratha community and the open category and will be completed by January 31. More than 1.25 lakh government employees were deployed for work as enumerators which include teachers and community health workers.
The Indian Express spoke to several community health workers and teachers who highlighted challenges, which began with the unavailability of smartphones among many of them and no financial support from the government to buy internet services necessary to fill data through the app.
A community health volunteer from Borivali said, “After posing these 154 questions, interviewees need to sign at the end. However, due to network issues on our phones, the process often halts. Once it halts, we must restart the entire process again. We recharge our phones for daily usage, but not for such demanding work which weak networks can’t do.”
The problem exacerbated in slums where weak networks prevented volunteers from detecting longitudes and latitudes of the area, essential for individual registration. Without this, the process can’t be commenced. Once information is submitted, requests for modifications or resubmission are not accepted, which according to some of the enumerators raised questions on the accuracy of the data.
Maharashtra Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Samiti, a state-wide primary teachers’ organisation complained that teachers were threatened with consequences if the collected information was inaccurate. “It is inappropriate to put the entire blame on those who are collecting data. The individuals giving information from each household are required to sign the form before submission. They can verify the details,” said the organisation’s state head, Vijay Kombe.
Enumerators complained that in several instances, the OTP required to log in didn’t generate. “The training was so hasty that older women couldn’t learn. They don’t even know how to use the OTP to log in,” said advocate Prakash Devdas, president of the Mahapalika Aarogya-Seva Karmachari Sanghatan.
Enumerators without smartphones or with low RAM on their devices were advised to manage by borrowing from a relative or purchasing one for the survey. “I earn only Rs 12,000 per month, which covers my sons’ education and tuition fees. How can they expect me to invest Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 in a smartphone with high RAM?” said a Parel volunteer.
A teacher from Nagpur said, “We are given meagre compensation for the task, which does not cover the internet expense, forcing us to spend out of our pockets.”
Enumerators alleged ambiguity regarding the source of the promised compensation. The Sanghatan has also submitted a letter to the corporation, alleging that they were initially promised Rs10,000 for enumeration work and Rs 500 for training. However, during training, the promised Rs 500 was suddenly denied to them. The Sanghatan also submitted a letter to the corporation on this. “They have been ordered to buy mobiles, power banks with their own money, which is labour exploitation. Also, the corporation doesn’t have any idea who will pay them the money and how much,” said Devdas. He also noted discomfort in asking specific questions about women, like their choice of attire, leading to relying on observational answers.
Enumerators were also compelled to record information from other communities during their door-to-door survey which involved a basic one-page questionnaire, but residents often objected to giving information."

While the Maldivian foreign ministry said the Chinese Research Vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3 will “not be conducting any research while in Maldivian waters”, New Delhi is keeping a close watch on the movement of the ship.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Maldivian foreign ministry said a diplomatic request was made by the Chinese government for the necessary clearances to make a port call, for rotation of personnel and replenishment. It further said that Maldives has always been a welcoming destination for “vessels of friendly countries” and continues to host both civilian and military vessels making port calls for peaceful purposes.
“Such port calls not only enhance bilateral ties… but also demonstrate the centuries-old tradition of the Maldivian people welcoming vessels from friendly countries,” it said.
This comes days after Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu hit out at India for “bullying”, and set a March 15-deadline for India to withdraw its military personnel from the country."

While Roy is the MP from the Birbhum Lok Sabha constituency, Mal represents the Bolpur seat.
The decision was taken in a meeting held at the CM’s Kolkata residence, it is learnt. Party second-in-command and MP Abhishek Banerjee was not present in the meeting. The party, CM Banerjee said, will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from the district the way it did under now jailed party leader Anubrata Mondal in the previous polls.
She, however, retained Assembly Deputy Speaker Asish Banerjee, minister Chandranath Sinha, MLAs Bikash Roy Chowdhury and Abhijit Singha Roy, and party leader Sudipta Ghosh as core committee members. The CM has since January 2 started meetings with district leaders in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections. Earlier, she had convened meetings with leaders from Purba Medinipur and Murshidabad districts.
As to why Abhishek Banerjee was not present in the meeting, Satabdi Roy said, “He was busy with other assignments.” However, a section of TMC leaders said the MP skipped the meeting since Mamata had earlier announced that she herself will oversee the party’s organisation in Birbhum.
A close associate of Mamata, Anubrata is one of the accused in the multi-crore cattle smuggling scam, which allegedly involved smuggling cattle to Bangladesh through Birbhum. His involvement in the smuggling racket is being investigated by both the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The TMC leader, who is currently lodged in the Tihar jail in the national capital, was arrested by the CBI in August 2022 and by the ED in November that year. In January, the Calcutta High Court refused to grant him bail in the case lodged by the CBI. A senior party leader from Birbhum said, “The CM said the district organisation will be according to Anubrata’s wishes. She also said that she is hopeful of his release from jail soon and that he will take over as the party’s district president then.”"

— Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897 and his Indian National Army (INA), also called the Azad Hind Fauj (literally Free Indian Army), faced the British on the battlefield during World War II.
— The INA was formed on February 17, 1942, two days after the British surrendered to Japanese forces in Singapore. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— It mostly comprised Indian prisoners of war (PoWs) captured by the Japanese during their Southeast Asia campaign. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
— By December, however, the army was in disarray, with no vision or leadership. To turn things around, Subhas Chandra Bose would have to arrive. Bose arrived in Singapore in July 1943, having courted both the Nazis and the Japanese for assistance in India’s independence campaign. On July 4, he assumed command of the INA’s 12,000-strong force.
— Over the next six months, he would pull off a public relations coup, gaining support — both material and human — from the Indian diaspora in Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia. The INA strength eventually grew to more than 40,000 members, and many Indians contributed their life savings to the cause.
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The Ramayana has been popular in India for millennia, as text in Sanskrit and many other languages, as folk theatre, as puppet shows, and as countless kathas or oral retellings organised in villages and small towns.
— However, the epic’s appeal extends well beyond Indian borders, and its dissemination demonstrates how Indians roamed the world – as rich traders, preachers, and bonded labourers.
— In Cambodia, the Angkor Wat temple complex, built in the 12th century, features murals from the Ramayana, and was originally a temple dedicated to Vishnu.
— The 12th-century Angkor Wat Temple Complex, the largest Hindu temple in the World, is spread over 500 acres and is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.
FYI:
— The Lakadong turmeric is one of the best varieties found in Lakadong area of the Jantia Hills district o Meghalaya.
— The Lakadong turmeric is slightly dark in colour compared to any other turmeric found in India. Hence, statement 1 is correct.
— The curcumin content in Lakadong turmeric is between 6.8-7.5 per cent, which is one of the highest, as against a mere 2 to 3 per cent in most varieties of turmeric. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.
— Meghalaya has got the GI tag for Lakadong Turmeric. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.
Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

MV7A80S74Z_C4SGMQHW161NKCD,"1.8 minutes: Governor Arif Mohd Khan ‘budgets’ his Kerala House speech, skips all but first, last paras",Shaju Philip,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:32 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/kerala-governor-arif-mohd-khan-house-speech-9127155/,"Continuing his standoff with the CPI(M)-led state government, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan Thursday cut short his policy address to the Budget Session of the Assembly, wrapping up in less than two minutes.
After reading out the first paragraph addressing the Assembly, Khan jumped to the last paragraph of the 61-page-long policy address, before winding up the speech, one of the shortest policy addresses of a governor in the Kerala Assembly marking the beginning of the Budget Session.
In his 1.81-minute-long address, Khan read out: “Let us remember that our greatest legacy lies not in buildings or monuments, but in the respect and regard we show to the priceless legacy of the Constitution of India and the timeless values of democracy, secularism, federalism and social justice. The essence of cooperative federalism is what has kept our country united and strong all these years. It is our bounden duty to ensure that this essence is not diluted. Together as part of this varied and beautiful nation we will weave the tapestry of inclusive growth and responsible resilience, overcoming all the challenges that are thrown our way.’’
While the government, which has been involved in protracted confrontation with Khan including in the Supreme Court, played down the issue, the Opposition Congress-led UDF said the Governor had insulted the Assembly.
CPI((M) leader and Law Minister P Rajeeve argued that Khan had discharged his “Constitutional responsibility”. “He read out the policy address, which was ratified by the Cabinet. There is nothing wrong in reading out the first and the last paras of the policy address.”
At the same time, Rajeeve added: “We do not know why he opted to read only those two paras. We do know whether he has any issue. The state government perspective is very well stated in the last paragraph, which the Governor read out. The state approach towards federalism is very clear in the last paragraph.”
Accusing Khan of snubbing the House, Congress Leader of the Opposition V D Satheesan said: “He has the Constitutional obligation to read out the policy address. In the address, there is no criticism against the Union government policies. What we have seen in the House is a pathetic finale to a political drama staged by the Governor and the government. The policy address does not reflect the ground realities of the state, where people are struggling to make both ends meet,” he said.
The portion of the address that Khan skipped included the state expressing concern over the Union government’s stand on fiscal matters. “The (Kerala) government’s stupendous achievements have come about despite many formidable challenges confronting it. Paramount among these is the liquidity stress stemming from the vertical imbalance between the Union and states in fiscal matters. The fact that the Union possesses a significantly greater capacity to mobilise resources compared to states, while states are mandated to undertake developmental expenditures that far surpass their revenue-generating capabilities, points to a great asymmetry within India’s federal system. This has further intensified, constraining the fiscal position of states.’’
The address went on to talk about the discontinuation of GST compensation, a reduction in revenue deficit grant, and restrictions imposed on off-budget borrowings by states.
It is the first time Khan skipped portions of his Budget Session speech which included criticism of the Centre. Earlier, he has read out sections where the Union government and its decisions ranging from farm laws to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, as well as its fiscal policies, came under attack."
MV7W0GQYUZ_NCHC8QQ49QRKTIX,"Indian students need to work on soft skills, experts opine",_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 17:49 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/international-education-day-2024-indian-students-need-to-work-on-soft-skills-say-experts-9123377/,"Over 13,24,954 Indian students head to study abroad and secure admissions at some of the top universities in the world. While Indian students are welcomed everywhere and are usually hailed as the leaders in technical skills, what they lack, as per experts, is soft skills.
Time and again, in several interviews with experts, indianexpress.com has observed that experts request Indian students to work on their soft skills when they head abroad to pursue higher education. Some experts share their opinion on the same:
The education system in India is undergoing a rapid transition and shifting focus from an exam and vocation-oriented approach to a holistic learning and development approach. Educationists are now exploring learning beyond the curriculum to inculcate innovative and creative thinking among students. Modern methods of presentation and individual delivery, interactive discussions among peers, public speaking and communication skills improvement are now being integrated with more traditional methods of academia.
So yes, while observations point towards a gap in desirable levels of soft skills, the system is now sensitised, and Indian students are catching up successfully. Coupled with their repertoire of technical skills and impeccable subject knowledge they are giving tough competition in the global arena.
Being ready for college and career requires that students have both the technical skills to be successful, as well as the “soft skills” that are an essential part of postsecondary success. Soft skills ensure a student’s ability to present effectively, clearly communicate their ideas, and work as part of a team. Focusing on mastering these skills and other dimensions of readiness ensures students are prepared with the full range of knowledge that they need to be successful in college, career, and life.
Indian candidates are usually very hardworking, analytical, and good with numbers and technology. One of the areas where they don’t rank as high, especially when they are in their formative years and early mid-teens to late teens or early 20s is more around oral communication in a foreign language. Due to this, what happens is that when you are out in a situation for the first time where you need to converse in English completely, you can get shy or awkward. This is mainly with those students who do not grow up in an English-speaking household.
The University of Queensland advises students to enhance their soft skills by taking on leadership roles, engaging in global experiences, contributing to research projects, and participating in innovative endeavours, including startups. Their approach underscores the importance of a comprehensive education that blends deep knowledge in their chosen field with the development of a diverse skill set. This approach is designed to equip students with the adaptability and lifelong learning skills necessary to meet the changing demands of the future job market.
Although many elements of learning are common across countries, some different cultural contexts and norms may differ between a Canadian and an Indian classroom.
In Canada, instructors often expect students to engage in classroom discussions, ask questions, and think critically about issues and problems presented in class. At York, students may be asked to show their learning through case studies, real-world problems, group projects, and other ways of synthesising and applying the knowledge and theory learned in class to actual problems or situations.
Indian students are amazing when it comes to technical skills – that’s a big strength back home in India, where there’s a huge focus on science and tech in education. But when these students go abroad for studies, they often find out that there’s more to learn, especially in soft skills like communicating well, working as a team, and being adaptable. It’s mostly because the way they’re taught back home is a bit different from what’s expected on the international stage.
For Indian students looking to improve their soft skills, I would advise getting involved in activities outside their textbooks. Join a club, work on projects with classmates from different backgrounds, or do some volunteer work. It’s a fun and practical way to build those soft skills. Additionally, lots of universities overseas offer workshops or courses to help out with this too. Getting involved in these can round out their skills and make their time studying abroad even more rewarding and fruitful."
MW0KKEY288_VYPO7LBIHZKR4B2,Red Sea woes: Exporters seek increased credit as freight rates jump 300%,Ravi Dutta Mishra,"January 26, 2024 04:06 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/red-sea-woes-exporters-seek-increased-credit-as-freight-rates-jump-300-9128191/,"Indian exporters have asked the central government to help facilitate more credit as freight rates have jumped nearly 300 per cent due to the disruption in the Red Sea route forcing global shipping lines to take longer trade routes, which is ultimately affecting exports of low value items such as Basmati rice.
Increasing attacks on ships sailing in the Red Sea region since November 2023 have forced shippers to consider the alternative, longer route past the Cape of Good Hope, which has not only stretched delivery time by 15 to 20 days, but also increased the transit cost substantially because of incremental freight rates and insurance premium.
Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai told The Indian Express that freight costs have surged by 300 per cent as global shipping lines are taking the Cape of Good Hope route, which is why exporters have sought more credit to match the rising cost of shipments to Europe.
Meanwhile, ratings agency Crisil on Thursday said that players operating in sectors such as agricultural commodities and marine foods could see a significant impact due to the perishable nature of their goods or lean margin profiles, which limit their ability to absorb the risks from rising freight cost.
“Not all sectors are expected to be impacted to the same extent. In fact, for agricultural commodities like Basmati rice (30-35% of production is shipped to these regions), exporters are feeling the pressure as rising freight cost has curbed exports and a part of their inventory is now being sold in the domestic market, leading to a moderation in realisations,” the report said.
Indian companies use the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, North Africa, and parts of the west Asia. Crisil said that these regions accounted for 50 per cent of India’s exports worth Rs 18 lakh crore and 30 per cent of imports worth Rs 17 lakh crore last fiscal.
“Marine foods –predominantly shrimp and prawn – could also see a significant impact as 80-90 per cent of the production is exported, more than half of it through the Red Sea. Their perishable nature and lean margins make exporters vulnerable to rising freight cost and competitive pressure from Latin American suppliers,” the report added.
The Indian Express had earlier reported that the finance ministry is set to hold a high-level meeting on February 5 to ensure smooth trade payments amid challenges emanating from the disruption in the Red Sea region."

Police have arrested two persons in this case, who are identified as Bhujangnath Dilip Patil (28) and Sambhaji Balaji Upase (24), both residents of Chikhali area.
Police have booked the accused persons under sections 420, 285 of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Essential Commodities Act.
Cops raided the tin shed godown located near Sairaj Fabrication, Jadhav Wadi in Chikhali. Police said the accused were allegedly refilling LPG from domestic cylinders illegally into commercial cylinders, which were then sold in the black market. Cops seized 119 LPG cylinders (71 filled and 48 empty cylinders) of different sizes, along with three gas refilling circuits and an electronic weighing machine."

The accused, Akashdeep Singh, and his brother Gurpreet Singh, a constable in the Punjab Police, are absconding since the minor, Surjit Singh Gaggu, 15, was murdered on Friday night.
Karan Masih, a DJ and a relative of the victim, said the teenager used to work with him as his assistant.
Masih said he and Gaggu had gone to play music at Akashdeep Singh’s engagement party in Asal Uttar village on Friday.
Masih further said, “Akashdeep Singh and Gurpreet Singh were in an inebriated condition. The guests performing bhangra were throwing currency notes. Surjit Singh Gaggu was collecting the notes that were falling on the dance floor. Akashdeep Singh and Gurpreet Singh demanded the thrown notes from Surjit Singh Gaggu. Gaggu refused by saying that the money had to be given to me. Akashdeep Singh then asked Gurpreet Singh to shoot him. As soon as he said this, Gurpreet Singh first fired three shots in the air. Then a bullet hit Surjit Singh Gaggu’s chest. Gaggu died as soon as he was shot.” Both the accused then fled from the spot.
Valtoha police station in-charge Sunita Bawa reached the spot and took the body into custody. The police have registered a case of murder against Akashdeep Singh and Gurpreet Singh.
When asked if Akashdeep Singh could have fled back to the US, SHO Bawa said, “We have started proceedings to issue LOC. But it takes time.”
Meanwhile, the family of the victim accused the police of taking no action. Masih said, “The police reached the crime spot after three hours. The family of the accused is sitting at home. The police are not asking them to produce the accused. What if a poor person was involved in the crime? The police would have picked up the whole family to force the surrender of the accused. We are afraid that the police have given time to Akashdeep Singh to return to the US.”
The SHO said Gurpreet Singh was posted as a constable in Sadar police station and he has been absent from the job since the day of the incident.
A close relative of Akashdeep Singh said, “Akashdeep went to the US through the donkey route as a minor. It was the reason that he secured PR in just five years. He had returned for the first time for the engagement. All who were present at the party knew that neither of the brothers fired the shot. It was one of their friends.”
Masih said, “We were hired by the family. It is the responsibility of the family to produce before the police whoever fired the shot. We will hold the family responsible because they had hired us.”
Surjit Singh Gaggu, a student of Class 7, was the youngest of four siblings. He sold balloons with his father after his studies and at night used to assist DJ Karan Masih."

While the Mumbai Police registered eight FIRs, the Navi Mumbai police registered an FIR and arrested five persons on the charge of attempt to murder in connection with a clash that took place in Panvel between locals and some Shiv Sena workers on Monday.
The incidents in Mumbai occurred in areas that included Vakola, Govandi, Bhoiwada, Girgaon, Malvani, Oshiwara, Antop Hill and Juhu. The police have also arrested at least five persons.
The police claimed that while the incidents were not as serious as the one on Mira Road, several minor incidents were witnessed in Muslim-dominated areas in city. The incidents mainly involved heated argument between residents of the area and members of Shobha yatras who were on vehicles bearing saffron flags and shouting slogans.
In Santa Cruz (East), a complaint was filed with the Vakola police regarding alleged insult to a religious flag. People present in the Shobha Yatra caught the accused Saud Mehmud Qureshi (27) and handed over to the police.
In another incident in Govandi area, one Prithviraj Jogdand (23), was arrested for posting objectionable and provocative post on WhatsApp. He was booked for hurting the religious sentiments on the complaint of a young man.
In Bhoiwada and Malwani, police registered a case against one Mufeez Ahmed (55) and Irfan Qureshi respectively for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
At least 20 unidentified people were also booked for alleged stone-pelting at the rally.
Cases were also filed in Islampura area, Antop Hill and Juhu for hurting sentiments.
In Navi Mumbai, the police registered a case of attempt to murder along with rioting and arrested five persons for clashes with Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde Group) party workers when they were taking out a procession on bikes and cars from the area on Monday afternoon.
Navi Mumbai DCP (zone II) Pankaj Dahane said, “In the clashes that took place between the two sides, we have registered an FIR and arrested five persons. Some five to seven people are still on the run and will be nabbed soon.” The FIR was registered by the Navi Mumbai Police under sections related to attempt to murder, rioting and common intention.
The incident took place in the Kutchi Mohalla area of Panvel after local residents got into a fight with Shiv Sena (Shinde group) party workers from Kharghar who were taking out a rally through the Muslim-dominated neighbourhood. As per the FIR, there were 15-20 bikes and two four-wheelers that were part of the rally.
The FIR was based on a complaint given by Chinmay Sonawane, a Shiv Sena Vibhag Pramukh. Sonawane said that after the rally was over, Kshitij Shingare, Panvel Vidhan Sabha Yuva Sena head, had organised lunch at Samarth godown. He said that they were led by Shingare, who was riding ahead of all.
His statement added, “Instead of leading us to Samarth godown to have lunch, he said let’s go through Panvel and we followed him. Our bike then passed a Muslim Naka and reached Safa Mosque. While 10 bikers had gone ahead, we were left behind.”
He added, “nearly 10-15 Muslim youngsters who had gathered then attacked us and damaged our vehicles.” Based on the statement, the police registered the FIR and made the arrests."
NBFAHP8TLS_TQFVPRP69IZAYKU,"After Sony-Zee merger collapse, promoters now control ZEEL with just 3.99% stake",George Mathew,"Updated: January 24, 2024 11:14 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/sony-zee-merger-collapse-promoters-control-zeel-9125122/,"With Japan’s Sony Corporation calling off its merger plan, the promoters — Subhash Chandra family — in Zee Entertainment Ltd (ZEEL) are in a peculiar situation as they are controlling the company with just 3.99 per cent equity stake.
Institutional shareholders, including mutual funds, insurance companies and foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who hold 71.78 per cent stake in ZEEL, are in a position to wield the clout in the running of the company even as Sony and the company are bracing for arbitration and court proceedings over the termination of the merger plan.
Of the institutional stake, domestic mutual funds hold 32.49 per cent stake and insurance companies 10.66 per cent stake. FPIs own 28.19 per cent in the company.
However, it’s not an easy task to change the management control of a company. Currently, the appointment, re-appointment or removal of independent directors is made through a special resolution. For a special resolution to be passed, 75 per cent of ‘yes’ votes are needed. “What works in favour of the Zee promoters is that institutional stakes are widely dispersed with no fund owning a major stake. They will have to come together to work out a strategy for bringing stability in the company,” said a fund house source.
Another option before the promoters — who are facing Sebi investigation over governance issues — to increase their stake in the company through market purchases or opt for a preferential offer. The 3.99 per cent stake makes the position of the current promoters vulnerable for a takeover. Subhash Chandra’s son Punit Goenka is the MD and CEO of ZEEL. While promoter and promoter group firms held 41.62 per cent stake in ZEEL during the quarter ended September 2018, they were later forced to sell a major part of the stake to repay loans.
Among major shareholders, Nippon Life India Trustee owns 6.12 per cent, ICICI Prudential value Discovery Fund 7.25 per cent and HDFC MF Mid-cap Opportunities Fund 5.25 per cent. LIC holds only 5.12 per cent stake in ZEEL. Moreover, 3.95 lakh retail shareholders own 12.41 per cent stake in the company, according to BSE data.
Earlier, Invesco was the single-largest shareholder in ZEEL, holding around 17.88 per cent in the media major. It had a dispute with the promoters of ZEEL and in September 2021, it called for the removal of the company’s MD & CEO Punit Goenka. However, Invesco sold its stake for over Rs 3,000 crore after the Sony announced the merger plan two years ago.
Before the entry of Sony, Reliance group of Mukesh Ambani had shown interest in the company. RIL made a broad proposal for merger of its media properties with Zee at fair valuations of Zee and all RIL properties. The proposal included continuation of Goenka as Managing Director and issue of ESOPs to management, including Goenka. However, differences arose between Goenka and Invesco with respect to a requirement of the founding family for increasing their stake by subscribing to preferential warrants. “The investors seemed to be of the view that the founders could always increase their stake through market purchases. At Reliance, we respect all founders and have never resorted to any hostile transactions. So, we did not proceed further,” RIL had said in October 2021.
A takeover predator can acquire 15 per cent from the market and then come out with an open offer to acquire another 26 per cent stake in the company. However, it’s not an easy task. The Burmans of the Dabur group had announced an open offer after acquiring around 22 per cent stake in Religare Enterprises. This is being stoutly opposed by the current professional management of Religare.
ZEEL Shareholding Pattern (As of December 2023):
📌 Promoters: 3.99%
📌 Mutual funds: 32.49%
📌 Insurance companies: 10.66%
📌 Foreign investors: 28.19%
📌 Resident individuals: 12.41%"

A delegation from the UK arrived in India on January 22. “There have been several issues, but most chapters have been closed in the last three months. Over 90 per cent of the deal is one, only a handful of articles in a few chapters are remaining. It is a small basket,” a senior government  official told The Indian Express.
“For us, (India) the Model Code of Conduct will be the cut-off date. Our UK counterpart understands this and that is the reason their officials are here and meetings are ongoing with the highest level of the government across ministries — commerce, finance and external affairs,” the official said.
The MCC will come into effect the day the Lok Sabha poll schedule is announced. Elections need to be held before June 16 when the term of the 17th Lok Sabha ends. The MCC contains general precepts for model behaviour during elections, with an entire chapter on what the party in power can and cannot do.
The India-UK FTA was originally slated to be signed by the Diwali of 2022, a deadline that was announced earlier by the UK side and then affirmed by the Indian government in the September of that year. Following that, no formal timeline was announced by either side for the conclusion of the deal.
While the UK has asked India to reduce the duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. While the average tariff on goods imported from India into the UK is 4.2 per cent, the average tariff in India on goods imported from the UK is 14.6 per cent; so it is expected the cut in duty by India would be of a greater extent.
Negotiations on cars and whisky have been contentious as the Indian industry has been seeking greater access into the UK market. Indian whisky manufacturers have said the UK should ease its three year maturation rule, which acts as a barrier, and New Delhi is also seeking duty concessions in the auto sector, particularly in the EV segment.
The FTA with the UK would be the first full fledged deal with a western country that would see deeper economic integration with a major global service sector leader. It is also seen as crucial since it will serve as a template for trade deals with larger western trade partners such as the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
Economic integration with the western countries through FTA assumes significance as the global supply chain is undergoing a reset after Covid-19 and multinational companies globally are adopting a China plus one policy. Multilateral trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) are also being negotiated in a bid to shift away from dependence on China.
However, the window to sign the deal is fast closing with elections in both the countries this year. While the general election in the UK is expected in December this year, India’s general elections are likely to take place between April and May this year.
With elections approaching, India is looking to close two other FTAs including the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Free Trade Association with the four nation bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
However, the comprehensive trade deal with Australia is likely to be taken up after the general elections as Australian negotiators are seeking access into India’s agricultural market, which is a sensitive sector for India.
India’s labour-intensive sectors are expected to see gains from the India-UK FTA, especially the textile sector. Indian textile exports face tariffs as high as 10% in the UK and a trade deal could put India on par with competition such as Bangladesh (which get LDC benefits), and revive textile exports. Meanwhile a greater integration in the services sector with the UK could help greater job creation in the fast growing industry.
India and the UK are also looking to sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) alongside the FTA that could improve UK’s investments into India. To resolve investor-state disputes under the new BIT faster, India is expected to move away from its 2016 model BIT approach that stressed on exhaustion of local remedies.
In FY2023, India’s merchandise exports to the UK were valued at $11.41 billion while imports stood at $8.96 billion."

With folded hands and a tilak on his forehead, megastar Amitabh Bachchan posted a picture of himself from the new Ayodhya Ram Mandir.
Amitabh Bachchan, along with his actor son Abhishek Bachchan, on Monday attended the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony. After the Pran Pratishtha ceremony, Amitabh Bachchan shared a picture of his from the temple, where the idol of Ram Lalla was in the background. He captioned the picture, “Jai Siya Ram”.

With the completion of the ceremony, the new 51-inch idol of the child Ram will henceforth be referred to as “Balak Ram” of Ayodhya, said those associated with the consecration ceremony. The old idol of Ram Lalla has been placed in front of the new idol inside the sanctum sanctorum.
In his blog, Amitabh Bachchan described the moment as a day “filled with the relevance of divine spirit.” He wrote, “Back from the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ayodhya… the glory the celebration and the belief of faith .. Immersed in the reckoning of the TEMPLE at shri Ram’s birth not much can be said beyond this .. for faith does not possess description…”
The official Instagram handle of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also shared images with Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan and wrote, “सबको राम-राम! आप सभी पर प्रभु श्री राम की कृपा बनी रहे।”

Rajinikanth, who also attended the ceremony, said it was a “historic” event and told ANI that he was fortunate to witness the moment. “I will definitely come to Ayodhya every year,” he added.
At the ceremony, cameras caught a moment when Rajinikanth greeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The video clips showed PM Modi greeting those present at Ram Mandir with folded hands. When he came near Rajinikanth, PM Modi seemingly gestured to ask if the megastar was doing well, to which he responded with his hands that he was fine.

Shah offered prayers at Birla temple in Delhi and watched the Ram Temple consecration ceremony live. The Lakshmi Narayan temple near the Gole Market in central Delhi was adorned with marigolds, with a motif of the Ayodhya temple made of flowers greeting the visitors.
In a message on ‘X’, Shah said that today, this resolve has been fulfilled under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and for this, he expressed his gratitude to him. “On this auspicious day, I also pay my respects to all those great men who kept this struggle and determination alive for centuries, endured many insults and tortures, but did not leave the path of religion,” he said.
“The struggle of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, thousands of great saints and innumerable famous and unknown people has yielded a pleasant and successful result today,” he wrote.
He said the Ram Temple will remain a unique symbol of “imperishable eternal culture” for ages. “The wait and promise of five centuries was fulfilled today. Today is an unforgettable day for crores of Ram devotees. Today, when our Ram Lalla is seated in his grand temple, like countless Ram devotees, I too am overwhelmed with emotions. It is not possible to express this feeling in words,” he wrote.
There was tight security around the Birla Temple and only a select number of people could attend the live-screening of the Ayodhya consecration ceremony. Shah, along with others, took part in the ‘Sundarkand’ reciting ceremony at the temple.
Shah was accompanied by Minister of State Meenakshi Lekhi and Delhi Assembly Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri.
Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders including national president Jagat Prakash Nadda, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva apart from other Union ministers and both national and state unit leaders witnessed the Ayodhya event live at various venues across the capital. Nadda joined devotees at Jhandewalan Mandir. BJP MP Anil Baluni, among others, was also present.
The Union Defence Minister joined devotees at a similar programme at Darya Ganj; Railway Minister Ashwani Vaishnav at Jagannath Temple, Hauz Khas; and Dr Jitendra Singh at the Nehru Place Market."

The victim, Lakshay Chauhan (24), a lawyer at Tis Hazari Court, went with two of his friends to attend a wedding in Rohtak on January 22. He then went missing. His family began searching for him after his phone was not reachable.
DCP (Outer North) Ravi Kumar said, “Abhishek, an advocate and a resident of Jawahar Camp in Punjabi Colony, has been arrested. During questioning, he disclosed that on the afternoon of January 22, the other accused contacted him and asked him to attend a wedding with him in Sonepat.”
The co-accused claimed Lakshay had taken a loan from him; when he asked for his money back, Lakshay allegedly misbehaved with him. “The duo planned to eliminate Lakshay and decided to throw him into the Munak Canal in Haryana,” said the DCP.
On the day of the wedding, Lakshay met Abhishek at Mukarba Chowk in his Ford EcoSport; the other man joined them later. They reached the wedding venue and left after midnight.
Said the DCP, “On their way back, they stopped the car at Panipat, near the canal, to attend nature’s call. That’s when the accused pushed Lakshay and fled with the car.”
Lakshay’s father, currently posted as ACP (Operations), had filed a missing person’s complaint at Samaypur Badli police station on January 23 and a case under IPC sections of kidnapping and abduction was lodged the next day. With Abhishek’s arrest, charges of murder and causing disappearance of evidence have been added to the case. The co-accused remains on the run.
Meanwhile, efforts are still on to trace Lakshay’s body. Said an officer, “We are still searching for the body… divers have not made a breakthrough so far.”"
NKHTRRYNLB_P4JM4XG7LH9GPN7,‘How will you complete concretisation of Mumbai roads in time?’: Bombay HC asks BMC,Omkar Gokhale,"Updated: January 24, 2024 00:53 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/complete-concretisation-mumbai-roads-time-bombay-hc-bmc-9123657/,"The Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to give details on the total length of concretised roads in Mumbai and the progress made in work related to concretising all roads falling within the limits of the civic body.
Referring to a news report which claimed only 5 per cent of the roads have been concretised, the court raised concerns as to how the BMC was going to complete the rest of the 95 per cent pending work by August, this year.
A division bench of Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Arif S Doctor passed directions while hearing a contempt petition filed by lawyer Ruju Thakker alleging non-compliance of 2018 orders by the civic authorities to repair potholes along all arterial roads in the city.
Thakker cited a news report which claimed that as per civic officials, merely 5 per cent of the work of a total of 397 kilometre of cement concrete roads in the island city have been fully completed so far.
Thakker argued that the BMC was to complete construction of cement concrete roads within a year from the date the BMC Commissioner appeared before the court on August 11, 2023.
“How are you going to complete the concretisation of 95 per cent roads by May this year as the monsoon starts thereafter? So, what will you do then? The same story continues (every year). Clarify that, howsoever incorrect the information given in the news report may be,” Chief Justice Upadhyaya orally remarked.
The High Court also expressed displeasure over the municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and state Public Works Department (PWD) not filing their affidavits in response to the contempt plea, despite the passage of a month since the said direction.
After a BMC lawyer sought time to file an affidavit in response citing its staff, including those from the legal department, being occupied with election and door-to-door Maratha reservation survey duties, CJ Upadhyaya remarked, “So the roads will be shut down in Mumbai? What kind of excuses are you giving? Some of your Class C staff are being sent for survey and election duties and therefore the BMC cannot function and not file an affidavit? What is happening?”
However, the bench granted time to the authorities to file their responses and posted the matter for further hearing to February 15.
Meanwhile, on January 17, the BMC told a coordinate bench led by Justice Gautam S Patel that it had cancelled a fresh tender, worth over Rs 1,362.34 crore, issued on December 4 to concretise roads in Mumbai.
The High Court was hearing a writ plea by M/s Roadway Solutions Infra Ltd (RSIL), whose contract to improve and concretise various roads was terminated by the civic body in November last year. The Justice Patel-led bench on December 14, 2023, had stayed the effect of a fresh tender, which came to be cancelled as per the BMC’s submission in High Court on January 17."

Langpu was among the panches and sarpanches of villages in India’s border areas invited as special guests for the parade under the Centre’s Vibrant Villages Programme (VVP).
Langpu Tame (45), who was accompanying his wife from Kra Daadi district in Arunachal Pradesh, said, “This is my second time watching the parade live; I was thrilled to watch the bike formations this year.”
Also among the invitees were nearly 800 guests from different tribal communities across the country. Of these, 130 guests included two tribal representatives, one male and one female.
Among them was 27-year-old Seema Devi from Pithoragarh district, the easternmost Himalayan district in Uttarakhand. Devi, who makes shawls and pashminas from rabbit skin back in her hometown, said, “… Modi ji has invited us today to be a part of the Republic Day celebrations. This is my second time in Delhi and we arrived January 22… we were delighted to be a part of this unique experience of witnessing so much culture on one platform.”
27-year-old Manganta Jo, who came from Arunachal Pradesh’s Seppa town, the headquarters of the East Kameng district, said, “We have come to Delhi for the first time with the help of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police… as special guests invited to see the celebrations. It has been a great honour to be a part of this… We got here on January 24 and toured the city; we will be returning to our hometown the day after tomorrow.”
The sarpanches and panches were also invited to participate in the Bharat Parv exhibition currently underway on the lawns of the Red Fort. They have also been invited to attend the Prime Minister’s rally which is performed by NCC cadets at Cariappa Parade Ground in Delhi Cantt on January 28.

NOXYQN3PCC_H3OJG0MHHB4JTKH,"Gyanvapi row: Parties silent, RSS, BJP likely to leave matter to courts",Vikas Pathak,"Updated: January 27, 2024 07:55 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/gyanvapi-row-parties-silent-rss-bjp-likely-to-leave-matter-to-courts-9129431/,"WHILE THE Opposition maintained silence on the matter of an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report saying a “huge temple” existed where the Gyanvapi Masjid next to Kashi Vishwanath Temple now stands, the RSS and BJP indicated they were in no hurry to get into the issue, and would wait for courts to take the lead on the matter.
The ASI report, which was submitted to the Varanasi district court hearing the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi matter, was handed over to the petitioners in the case on Thursday. As per the report, “there existed a large Hindu temple prior to the construction of the existing structure”, and that parts of it had been reused.
Asked about the issue, an RSS functionary, not wishing to be named, said: “In the 1980s, the Sangh had to take up the Ayodhya Ram temple as a mobilisational issue so as to reach out to people and get our concerns into the mainstream debate. At that time, society was not alive to these concerns, like it is today. Now, it is society that has taken up all these cultural concerns as collective concerns. What is the need for the Sangh to do anything when society is itself active? Now people are themselves filing cases and also discussing these issues regularly.”
An RSS insider also argued the same, saying: “The court asked the ASI to report its findings, and it has done so. We don’t feel any need to do anything in particular about this. There will be discussions among people in society… These matters are not exclusively ours, it is society at large, and it showed a lot of enthusiasm days ago for the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Temple in Ayodhya… Let people discuss the issues and let courts do their work.”
A source in the BJP said roughly the same thing. “I don’t think we are going to do much on this. The court asked for an ASI report, the ASI report has said what it has said. The courts will look into the matter and eventually find a solution, just as they did in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi.”
An RSS leader from Uttar Pradesh contended that the aim of the Sangh Parivar was to make society “think like the Sangh”. “We have little other work. Social discussions are already happening around religious and cultural issues. From Varanasi, 5,000 buses a day are plying to Ayodhya and all seats are getting sold out. What is the need for us to do anything extra, when society itself is showing great interest in matters of cultural resurgence?”
This argument seems to align with RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat’s statement in 2022 that the Sangh was not looking to launch any “andolan (movement)” into other disputes such as Ram Janmabhoomi, adding “par har masjid mein Shivling kyun dekhna (what is the need to look for a Shivling in every mosque)”.
The RSS chief had gone on to say that there had been invasions and destruction of religious shrines in medieval times, but stressed “peace”.
While sources in the VHP also said that the organisation would wait for what the courts say, it was with a rider. “Society as a whole should see that what we were saying is coming out as the truth, with each ASI report. And Muslim society should also understand that it is important to recognise these historical facts and accordingly side with the national mainstream, instead of going into litigation each time,” a VHP leader said.
BJP leader and Union minister Giriraj Singh, who is known for his controversial remarks, however, said Friday that Muslims should hand over the Gyanvapi mosque site to Hindus, adding that the ball was in their court to ensure communal harmony.
“‘The Pran Pratishtha at the Ram Temple has been done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the Sanatanis have welcomed it… But our demand has always been Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura… I will appeal to my Muslim brothers, when all evidence is out, hand over Kashi to Hindus, so that communal harmony is maintained,” Singh was quoted by PTI as saying.
He added: “We have not broken any mosques after Independence, but there is no temple left in Pakistan.”
The minister said there should be no “provocative statements”. “This is a changed India, the Sanatani youth has awakened… If someone tries to be Babur or Aurangzeb, youths will have to become Maharana Pratap. You should ensure peace is maintained, the ball is in your court.”"

The survey began on August 4, 2023, concerning the dispute around the complex. Hindu litigants have claimed that the mosque was built on the site of the original Kashi Vishwanath temple after its destruction in the 17th century. The Gyanvapi mosque stands next to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
The ASI, tasked with ascertaining whether the mosque was “constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu temple”, had submitted its report to the court last month in a sealed cover.
Historical records suggest the mosque was built in the 17th century on the orders of Aurangzeb after destroying the original Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in 2023 that the Muslim side should acknowledge the “historic mistake” and propose a solution.
The Sangh Parivar, which is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP, has not involved itself in the current phase of the Kashi-Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi mosque dispute. However, the RSS had raised a demand on Kashi as early as 1959, even before it took up the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue. Here’s the history.
The beginning
When the issue of the “return” of Hindu temples was first taken up in 1959, only Kashi Vishwanath was mentioned — not Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya or Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura. At the annual meeting of the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) of the RSS, a resolution on the “Issues of Temples Turned into Mosques” was adopted.
It said: “Many intolerant and tyrannical foreign aggressors and rulers in Bharat have, during the last one thousand years, destroyed many Hindu temples and built mosques in their place… Out of all such temples, the Kashi Vishwanath temple occupies a special place of honour because of its unique position as the centre of devotion and faith of all Hindus… The Sabha (ABPS) urges the Government of Uttar Pradesh to take steps to return this temple to the Hindus…”
During the 1980s
In 1981, there was deep concern in the RSS after about 150 Dalit families in Tamil Nadu’s Meenakshipuram converted to Islam to escape caste oppression.
A meeting of the Akhil Bhartiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM) of the RSS in 1981 passed a resolution calling upon “the entire Hindu Society to bury deep the internal caste dissensions and the pernicious practice of untouchability and stand up as one single homogeneous family, so that the neglected and down-trodden sections will be assured of a place of equality, security and honour in the Hindu fold”.
The Meenakshipuram incident changed the dynamics of the RSS’s Hindu renaissance project. Ashok Singhal, who had been moved after the Emergency as Prant Pracharak of Delhi (and Haryana) from his position of Sambhag Pracharak in Kanpur, was deployed to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.
Singhal turned the Parivar’s focus to Ayodhya. At a VHP meeting in 1984, a resolution was passed to “free” Ram Janmabhoomi. That year, the VHP’s first Dharma Sansad demanded the removal of the three mosques at “Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi”.
Focus on Ayodhya
At its ABPS on March 15, 1985, the RSS said that “Ramjanmbhoomi Ayodhya, Krishna Janmabhoomi Mathura and Vishwanath Temple Kashi are most sacred places for Hindus”, but its demand was concentrated on Ayodhya as it “expected that UP government will realise the truth and will return it (disputed site at Ayodhya) to rightful owner Hindu samaj”.
At its national executive in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, on June 9-11, 1989, the BJP said “the sentiments of the people must be respected, and Ram Janmasthan handed over to the Hindus”. The Palampur resolution made no mention of Kashi and Mathura.
The RSS ABKM in 1989 and 1990, and the ABPS of 1991 stayed focussed on Ayodhya alone. In 1994, the ABPS asked the Centre to “promptly hand over the acquired piece of land to Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Nyas…” But the shrines in Kashi and Mathura were not mentioned.
The governments under Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998-2004 kept the Ayodhya issue on the back burner, and the BJP appeared to be putting its faith in the judicial process. In its Raipur national executive in July 2003, the BJP stated its inability to take the legislation route on Ayodhya without the backing of the other partners of the NDA, and of opposition parties like the Congress.
2003: Kashi-Mathura
In 2003, the RSS mentioned Kashi and Mathura along with Ayodhya for the first time since 1959. The ABKM that year extended “unqualified support to the just demand of the Hindu society for restoration of the holy shrines of Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi to them”.
It said: “Bhagwan Ram, Bhagwan Krishna and Bhagwan Shankar symbolise Bharat’s age-old civilisation, cultural and spiritual identity. Restoration of the pristine glory of these holy places is the bounden duty of independent Bharat… It is not out of place here to remind the countrymen about the restoration of the glory of Somnath immediately after independence. On the same lines, restoration of three other important holy places — Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi — should also be done.”
The ABKM called upon “the Muslim leadership to seize the historic opportunity and give up their claim over the sites at Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi so as to pave way for creation of mutual goodwill and respect between Hindus and Muslims forever”.
However, the RSS did not return its focus to Kashi and Mathura again. In June 2022, RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat questioned the need to “look for a Shivling in every mosque”, and said the RSS was not in favour of launching any other movement (“andolan”) on these issues.
“…Hum ko jhagda kyun badhana? Gyanvapi ke baare main hamari shraddha parampara se chalti aayi hai. Hum karte aa rahe hai woh theek hai. Par har masjid mein Shivling kyon dekhna? (Why escalate fights? On Gyanvapi, our faith has been there for generations. What we are doing is fine. But why look for a Shivling in every mosque?),” Bhagwat said.
This is an updated version of an earlier explainer."

CM Saha attended a Ram Pujan and Maha Yagya at Durgabari in Agartala to mark the consecration of the Ram Mandir.
Speaking to media persons after the puja, CM Saha said, “We have been long waiting for this day. Entire India is getting ‘Rammay’ (full of Ram spirit). We often speak of ‘Ram Rajatwa’. It seems a new era of ‘Ram Rajatwa’ is starting in India after the establishment of the Ram Mandir”.
He also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is running the country in the model of Ram Rajya and said the Tripura government also wants to provide good governance to people. “Our government will try to ensure the fundamental rights of people,” he said.

Outlining his view on the “main essence of Ram Rajya”, CM Saha said it is important for the ruler to resolve people’s problems and to have the people develop faith in the ruler. “The feeling of wellbeing has returned in the country after 500 years,” Saha said.
Saha said he would visit Ayodhya on February 5 with all his cabinet ministers.
Last week, CM Saha lauded PM Modi’s administration and said India is already experiencing Ram Rajya as different pro-people initiatives are being undertaken for public welfare.

The state government also appointed five new members to the controversy-ridden TSPSC following the approval from Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. They are retired bureaucrats Anita Rajendra and Amit Ullah Khan, Professor N Yadaiah, Y Ram Mohan Rao, and Palavai Rajani Kumar, and they can hold the office for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 62 years, said an order issued by Chief Secretary Santhi Kumari.
Reddy, 61, a 1986-batch IPS officer, served as the DGP and head of the police force in the BRS government for five years from November 2017 till his retirement from the service in December 2022. He was the city police commissioner of Hyderabad before his promotion.
The new Commission has a herculean task of conducting free and fair recruitment to fill vacancies in government departments. Reddy is known for his no-nonsense nature and sincerity in succeeding in tasks given to him. After his retirement, he had been staying away from public glare.

Alleged mismanagement of the Commission and incidents of question paper leaks had led to the Group-1 exam being cancelled twice, along with several other Group-2 exams. More than 50 arrests, including those of who worked for the TSPSC, had exposed the functioning of the earlier Commission.
A special investigation team probe is also underway. All this caused massive outrage among over 32 lakh unemployed youths who aspired to government jobs and prepared hard for the exams.
In the run-up to the November 2023 elections, the Congress party had promised to fill 2 lakh government vacancies within a year of assuming power. The party also released a job calendar, according to which the government would issue job notifications in phases starting February 1, 2024, and complete this process on December 15, 2024. The party had also promised to scrap the existing Commission and revamp it to conduct exams in a foolproof manner.
The previous Commission, headed by retired IAS officer B Janardhan Reddy, had tendered their resignation soon after the change of government. While the resignations were not approved by the governor until January 10, citing the need for review and legal opinion in the wake of an ongoing investigation, a search committee led by chief secretary A Santhi Kumari recommended the name of the former DGP from over 50 applications for the post. A total of 371 applications were received for all posts from retired bureaucrats and academicians."

“The master plan is being prepared to streamline future expansion up to the final phase. This is necessary so problems don’t arise in the future concerning the construction of facilities, its ownership, linking the airport with industries, and developing different modes of transportation such as Rapid Rail, Metro, pod taxi, roads, semi-high speed trains etc,” said Dr Arun Vir Singh, CEO, NIAL.
NIAL is the implementing agency of the airport on behalf of the Uttar Pradesh government. Officials said the company is in consultation with Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), which is a subsidiary of Zurich Airport International AG and the developer of the first phase.
Singh said along with the Master Plan, the state government will decide on the allotment of the next phases of the airport — whether it will be through bidding, a joint venture, or a special purpose vehicle.
“The Master Plan will integrate all six proposed runways, MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) hub, aviation hub, and other facilities. The plan will first be sent to the NIAL board; after it’s approved, it will be sent to the government for final approval. We will issue the scheme for the MRO and aviation hubs by March,” added the CEO.
Singh said the two hubs are proposed to be developed in the second phase: “Out of an area of 1,365 hectares acquired for this phase, a runway and MRO will be developed on 500 hectares; 800 hectares will be for the aviation hub. As there are numerous facilities proposed in every phase, the master plan is necessary to streamline work.”
Meanwhile, the Gautam Buddh Nagar district administration has begun the process of acquiring 2,085 hectares of land for the airport’s third phase. Despite farmers holding a mahapanchayat every Sunday to oppose it, the administration said it is hopeful of finding an amicable solution.
The first phase is spread across 1,334 hectares. Once the expansion is complete and the six proposed runways are operational, the Noida airport is expected to be among India’s biggest."

In an official notice dated January 22, the education department of the Rohini Zone has termed protests by different associations as an unlawful course of redressal. “It is for information of all that there are some associations which are not recognised by the MCD and are indulged in illegal activities of maligning the image of education department through social media and other means of communication instead of following the lawful course of redressal of grievances if any,” the official notice read. The notice also stated that strict disciplinary action would be taken against any teacher found participating in any form of strike, casual mass leave, boycott of work or demonstrations. The protests will be considered a violation of the CCS (Conduct Rules, 1964). The Heads of Schools have been directed to bring the contents of the notice to their respective staff members.
Vibha Singh from the Nagar Nigam Shikshak Sangh said, “Our teachers’ association was first recognised by the MCD in 1953.” She said problems started in 2018 when the erstwhile North Delhi Municipal Corporation issued an order taking back the recognition it had earlier provided to the association. “The association used to act as a bridge between officers and the employees in grievance redressal,” Singh said.
An MCD official told The Indian Express: “These unscrupulous elements have been spreading misinformation with vested interests… The circular may be taken as an advisory so that when action follows, they should not complain that they were not aware of the rules.”"
NWNFPVDHYW_NHW6UR8K89JXTG8,"How the Ram temple draws a new line, frames challenge for Opposition",Vikas Pathak,"Updated: January 28, 2024 09:47 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/ram-temple-ayodhya-narendra-modi-mohan-bhagwat-9122462/,"JANUARY 22 was presaged, way back on November 9, 2019, when the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of the temple; and then on August 5, 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed the bhoomi pujan at the site in Ayodhya.
Yet, on Monday, with the nation watching, the consecration of the Ram Lalla in the new temple led by the Prime Minister marked not only a milestone in the history of the BJP-RSS but also a new chapter in national politics.
Its message was an unprecedented Hindutva surge amid statements of reconciliation from Sangh Parivar leaders who were once seen to occupy the “fringe” of mainstream Indian politics.
The date marked a state holiday in UP, and also a half day for Central government employees – the state came across as having the kind of intimacy with religious rituals that it rarely had since independence, but for that moment when the first President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad, was present during the inauguration of the Somnath temple on May 11, 1951.
That the consecration was shown on all TV channels and livestreamed in cities and neighbourhoods across the country deepened its symbolism. Modi’s earlier call for a Diwali on the evening of January 22 also found many an echo across the country.
At the same time, there was dialing down of the rhetoric with Modi calling it a day not of vijay (victory) but of vinay (humility). RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat flagged the “hosh” (reason) amid the “josh” (passion) and the need to show restraint and work towards resolution of social disputes.
Even the Sangh’s political discourse in the run-up to the consecration was reconciliatory. BJP leader Uma Bharti, once seen as a rabble-rouser by critics, told The Indian Express that the peaceful atmosphere since the Supreme Court’s title suit verdict proved to the world, which had seen India in terms of religious and caste conflict, that Hindus and Muslims could live in peace.
UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath wrote on Sunday, “The joint victory of justice and truth is erasing bitter memories and creating new stories, fostering harmony in society.”
In a piece written days ago, veteran BJP leader LK Advani, the architect of the mandir movement, said that when Modi consecrates the temple, he would represent 140 crore people of India – all of India across faiths.
In other words, there is a clear attempt within the Sangh to be seen as steering clear of triumphalism now that the temple is here. How this translates into the election campaign that may be just weeks away remains to be seen.
For the Opposition, January 22, 2024, frames a fresh political challenge given how since 1992, in the wake of the Babri Masjid demolition, it has defined itself in opposition to the temple movement. In 1989, the BJP had said, in its Palampur resolution, that not the courts but a negotiated settlement or legislation could solve the issue, the Opposition parties had left the matter to the judiciary.
With the Supreme Court awarding the whole hitherto disputed land for a Ram temple in 2019, the opposition has been at a loss to decide what its position on the matter should be. From the Congress declining the invitation to attend the consecration to Samajwadi Party saying it would attend at a later date, from TMC’s inter-faith rally to AAP’s shobha yatras and community kitchens in the capital, each member of the Opposition is trying to figure its own way out.
Having invested over three decades in hardening the line over the temple issue – allies forced the Atal BJP to put it on the backburner — and at the same time not wanting to be seen as insensitive to “Hindu sentiments,” the Opposition parties are having to tease out strategies to strike a balance. That’s easier said than done especially in the run-up to the general elections.
The consecration of the temple has been accompanied by a sense of resignation within the Muslim community with most of its leaders saying they want to move on. As of now, the disputes around Mathura and the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi are making their way through the courts. How these are handled by the courts, the respective communities, the BJP and the Opposition, will have a bearing on what follows after January 22, 2024."
NY15WVYLU8_6NJRMY9G77NRXXE,Questions such as ‘Do you go to a doctor or Tantrik if bitten by a dog or monkey’ part of 40-page Maratha quota survey,Pallavi Smart,"Updated: January 30, 2024 17:04 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maratha-quota-teachers-40-page-survey-week-9124239/,"“Do you go to a doctor or a ‘tantrik’ if any family member is bitten by a dog/monkey?” These are the types of questions that form the 38-page long questionnaire prepared by the Maharashtra State Backward Commission for the Maratha reservation survey which commenced on Tuesday and which the state government hopes to complete within a week’s time.
Government schoolteachers who have been roped in to complete the survey have complained that the process of completing the 40-page survey is time consuming and raised doubts on whether an effective enumeration of the 154 questions can be done in the timeframe laid down by the state government.
The questionnaire includes five modules having a total 154 questions ranging from basic family information with income and other details to socio-cultural information and health related behaviours of individuals.
The mandatory survey began across Maharashtra on Tuesday to determine the eligibility of the Maratha community as a backward class. The survey covers the Maratha community and the open category and will be completed by January 31. More than 1.25 lakh enumerators, including superintendents and officials, have been appointed to conduct the survey.
Questions aimed at gauging socio-cultural information of families, include queries such as whether or not there is a dowry system in the community, are widows allowed to remarry and if they can wear kumkum and mangalsutra which generally work as markers for married women. The survey also includes questions–Do married women have to cover their head? And has there been any inter-caste or inter-religion marriage in the family? This section also demands to know if there has been any suicide in the family in the past ten years and if yes what were the reasons.
Vijay Kombe, a senior teacher from Wardha, who is also state head of the Maharashtra Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Samiti, said, “If one teacher gets 100 households, it means he/she will require 200 hours in total. Looking at the nature of the questionnaire, the given task at hand is impossible to be completed within a week. Additionally, there are technical issues such as errors in the mobile application to fill data among all. As opposed to it, census surveys have less columns and longer tenure to complete the task.”
Kombe also shared how this is going to lead to tremendous academic loss at government schools and there was no consultation with teachers before deciding to impose the task on them. A teacher from Chalisgaon said, “The government schools already have paucity of teachers. And in this condition now, 3 out of total 4, 7 out of total 8 teachers are asked to work for the survey in order to complete the task on time.”
Pointing out how running schools is going to be very difficult with teachers out on Maratha survey duty, another teacher from Jalgaon said, “Each form takes about two hours to complete. Does the government think that teachers have such time to spend on non-academic tasks?” A teacher from Pune ZP, said, “Even teachers who are on leave for different purposes are sent show-cause notices for not participating in the survey work.”
Commenting on the rationale behind the questions asked in the survey, chief of Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, Justice Sunil Shukre (Retd) said, “The list of questions was prepared by the commission after putting a lot of thought into it by experts from fields such as sociology, politics and law. The survey is aimed at knowing if there is backwardness and if yes at what level it is. The report, post survey, will provide answers to why certain questions were included in the list. There is no point questioning the rationale behind questions on the day when the survey has already begun.”
Responding to teachers’ concerns, Shukre said, “We had requested the government to provide manpower to conduct the survey. The decision on who should work was then taken by the government.”"

As part of the programme, the government wants to develop its own ‘sovereign AI’, build computational capacity in the country, and offer compute-as-a-service to India’s startups.
“We will take the proposal for the AI Mission to the Cabinet soon. We are still working out some contours, but the overall outlay for the initiative could be more than Rs 10,000 crore,” he said.
The Indian Express had earlier reported the capacity building will be done both within the government and through a public-private partnership model, highlighting New Delhi’s intention to reap dividends of the impending AI boom which it envisions will be a crucial economic driver.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the AI Mission and said its aim was to establish the computing powers of AI within the country. This, he said, will provide better services to startups and entrepreneurs and also promote AI applications in the sectors of agriculture, healthcare and education.
In total, the country is looking to build a compute capacity of anywhere between 10,000 GPUs (graphic processing units) and 30,000 GPUs under the PPP model, and an additional 1,000-2,000 GPUs through the PSU Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Chandrasekhar had earlier told this paper.
For context, according to a 2020 blog by Microsoft, the company had developed a supercomputer for OpenAI – the firm behind ChatGPT – which consisted of 10,000 GPUs among other things.
The government is exploring various incentive structures for private companies to set up computing centres in the country – ranging from a capital expenditure subsidy model which has been employed under the semiconductor scheme, a model where companies can be incentivised depending on their operational expenses, to offering them a “usage” fee, Chandrasekhar had said.
Computing capacity, or compute, is among the most important elements of building a large AI system apart from algorithmic innovation and datasets. It is also one of the most difficult elements to procure for smaller businesses looking to train and build such AI systems.
The government’s idea is to create a digital public infrastructure (DPI) out of the GPU assembly it sets up so that startups can utilise its computational capacity for a fraction of the cost, without needing to invest in GPUs which are often the biggest cost centre of such operations.
Apart from building computing capacities, the government is also working on building datasets and making them available to Indian startups.In May 2022, the Information Technology (IT) Ministry released a draft of the National Data Governance Framework Policy under which it proposed the creation of an India Datasets platform, which will consist of non-personal and anonymised datasets from Central government entities that have collected data from Indian citizens or those in India.
The idea is that the non-personal data housed within this programme would be accessible to startups and Indian researchers, the draft proposal said.
The Indian Express had earlier reported that the Centre is also considering issuing a directive to big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon to share anonymised personal data in their possession with the India Datasets platform."

The larger than anticipated crowd prompted the administration to hold urgent meetings and the Chief Minister to personally pay a visit.
By evening, around 5 lakh people had paid obeisance to the Ram idol, a day after the consecration ceremony.
Around 8,000 security personnel have been deployed to manage the rush. On Day 1, Principal Secretary (Home) Sanjay Prasad and Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar were also at the temple to oversee the crowd management. Both could be seen trying to ensure a smooth flow of pilgrims.
At 4.40 pm, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reached the temple town. He first took an aerial review of the crowd from a helicopter and then reached the temple to take stock. Those present at the temple gates said the CM had made a personal appeal to the crowd: “Darshan ke liye na harbarayen. Bheed normal hone ke baad Ayodhya aayein (do not be in a rush to pay obeisance. Let the crowd become normal and then come to Ayodhya).”

The CM also called senior police and administrative officers and held a review of crowd management efforts on the premises.
Later, Director General of Police Vijay Kumar said, “A system is being put in place to have a holding area for the crowd. So, if 50,000 people come at a time, they can be stopped at different entry points and at different holding areas and can move ahead for darshan slowly.”
People had started gathering at the Ram Janmabhoomi Path, which leads to the temple, as early as 3 am. These included both locals, who called themselves “Ayodhya vasi”, and pilgrims from far and wide.
With little knowledge of what is and isn’t allowed inside, pilgrims from other states and districts carried with them huge bags, walking on foot towards the temple gates since vehicles were stopped six kilometres away. With heavy luggage on their heads, many said they wanted to be the first ones to offer prayers.

By 6 am, the 566-metre-long Ram Janmabhoomi Path was packed, as pilgrims tried to push their way inside. Security forces tried telling them they cannot enter with luggage or mobile phones, but not everyone paid heed.
Sources said the official timing to open the gates had been kept as 7 am but considering the crowd, an exception was made and the first line of barricades was removed around 6.30 am. Eager to have the “first darshan”, some even left their bags on the road as they did not want to leave the queue to deposit their belongings elsewhere.
The darshan closed around 11 am and a huge crowd again began to gather at the gates. Once the gates reopened around 2 pm, security forces urged the crowd to form a queue and to leave their phones outside. But as the pressure increased, pilgrims said they were eventually allowed to carry their phones with them.

Officials said the temple gates are scheduled to close at 7 pm.
“Darshan ho gaya,” said Bansi Dhar Mahanti, who had come from Odisha with his family of 10 and had been staying in Ayodhya for the last eight days. “Bohot bheed thi (it was very crowded). I kept my phone with my wife and entered. Many people just abandoned their bags outside,” he said. The family reached the temple gates around 2.45 am and could have a glimpse of the new idol around 7 am.
Poonam (42), part of a group of 25 from Bihar, arrived in Ayodhya six days ago and stayed in an ashram. They queued up around 6 am and managed to enter around 9 am.
Also in the crowd outside was 21-year-old Kirti, who stood out because she was not lugging any belongings. “Ayodhya vasi hain. Pehla darshan humara hona chahiye (we are from Ayodhya; the first darshan should be ours),” she said."

Fewer visas will mean fewer Indian students will be able to travel to Canada for a college degree.
Marc Miller, the Canadian Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, announced on Monday that for the academic session beginning September 1, 2024, the number of new international student permits would be cut by 35% from the 2023 number.
“This is expected to result in approximately 360,000 approved study permits this year, and will be allocated to provinces and territories to distribute among their DLIs” (Designated Learning Institutions), Miller said in a thread posted on his official X (Twitter) handle.
“Provinces must issue letters of attestation for the students they accept, and as such, the current intake of study permit applications will be paused until March 31st as provinces implement their systems,” he posted.
The situation will be assessed at the end of this year to decide on the number of study permits for 2025. The cap on permits is not permanent, Miller said.
Miller, who spoke at a three-day retreat in Montreal for Ministers of the ruling Liberal Party ahead of an upcoming sitting of Parliament, also announced changes to the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWP), which allows international students to work in Canada after they have completed their studies.
“Starting in September (2024), we will no longer issue PGWPs to students studying under curriculum licensing arrangements” (that is, public-private institution models), Miller said.
Also, “in the coming weeks, we will no longer issue work permits to spouses of international students, apart from those in masters and doctoral programs. We will work towards exempting those pursuing professional programs, such as medicine and law.”
Canadian media quoted Miller as saying the intake of international students needed to be capped so that “a sustainable level of temporary residence” in Canada could be maintained. Canada has an obligation to ensure international students “have access to the resources they need to succeed” in the country, the Minister said on X.
Last month, the Canadian government said that from 2024, international students would have to show that they have more than $20,000 — double the existing funds requirement — in addition to tuition fees to be eligible for a study permit.
Sean Fraser, who had been Immigration Minister earlier, told Canadian media that student intake had grown “beyond what certain communities could handle” — which was the reason for the decisions announced by Miller.
Also, “unscrupulous actors” had been “taking advantage of international students, rendering them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation”, Miller said on X. The new measures would “ensure system integrity and sustainable growth”, he said.
On the decision to exclude public-private institutions from the PGWP program, the Minister said “these programs are notorious for lacking oversight and do not provide the quality academic experience that Canada is renowned for.”
Mandeep, convener of the Montreal Youth Students Organisation told The Indian Express: “There is a housing crisis in Canada currently. Rentals and the cost of living have increased a lot, while jobs are not that abundant. Also, some students have complained that private institutions were charging high tuition fees and offering poor quality education.”
The two-year cap on student permits is only for undergraduate courses. Masters and PhD programs, as well as elementary and secondary school-level courses are exempt.
The curbs will apply to only new applicants — international students who are already studying in Canada, whether in undergraduate or any other courses, are not impacted.
The visa cap will hit Indian students. According to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the largest numbers of student visas are given to applicants from Asia, and India is on top of the list (followed by China).
Canada is a favourite destination for students from Punjab. Often, students are joined by their spouses on spouse visas within months of their beginning studies or getting a temporary job. Under the new rules, open work permits will be given to spouses only if they are enrolled in a postgraduate or doctoral program.
According to IRCC data, the population of international students rose from around 3.26 lakh in 2014 to more than 8 lakh in 2022. Last week, The Globe and Mail reported that at the end of December 2023, the number of study permit holders had crossed a million — 1,028,850, according to IRCC data quoted in the report — with more than half of them living in Ontario. The number of work permit holders was estimated at 1.4 million."

Since 1950, January 26 has marked the day India’s Constitution came into effect. However, the Constitution was prepared way before the chosen date, adopted officially by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949. Why do we celebrate our Republic Day on January 26, then? The answer lies in the history of the Indian freedom struggle during which the date held significance since 1930.
On January 26,1930, the historic “Poorna Swaraj” declaration was officially promulgated, beginning the final phase of India’s freedom struggle where the goal would be complete independence from British rule.
Follow the Republic Day 2024 Live blog for the latest updates!
The Non Cooperation Movement ended unceremoniously in February 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident. Mahatma Gandhi, at the time, felt that the country was “not yet ready” for his non-violent methods of protest. Thus, the 1920s did not see further mobilisation at the scale that was seen during the Non Cooperation Movement and the anti-Rowlatt Satyagraha.
The 1920s however were far from insignificant. From the rise of revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad to the coming of age of a new generation of Indian National Congress (INC) leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Vallabhai Patel and C Rajagopalachari, the 1920s laid the ground for the future course of India’s freedom struggle.
Notably, in 1927, British Authorities appointed the Simon Commission – a seven-man, all European team under Sir John Simon – to deliberate on political reforms in India. This sent a wave of outrage and discontentment across the country. For the first time since 1922, protests against the Simon Commission spread nationwide, with chants of “Simon Go Back” echoing across the country.
In response, the INC appointed its own commission under Motilal Nehru. The Nehru Report demanded that India be granted dominion status within the Empire. In the Balfour Declaration of 1926, dominions were defined as “autonomous communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.” In 1926, countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand were granted dominion status.

Crucially, even within the Congress, the Nehru Report did not enjoy universal support. Young leaders such as Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru, Motilal’s own son, wanted India to break all ties with the British Empire. They argued that under dominion status, while India would enjoy a certain level of autonomy, the British Parliament and Crown would still have the ability to meddle in Indian affairs.
Importantly, for both Bose and Nehru, attaining dominion status would make India party to colonial exploitation elsewhere in the British Empire, mainly Africa. With a far more radical worldview than their predecessors, Bose and Nehru looked at anti-colonialism not only as a local political issue for India but in a more global lens.
However, Gandhi was still very much for dominion status, arguing that it would be a welcome step in India’s anti-colonial struggle. His views would soon change.
In 1929, Viceroy Irwin had vaguely announced that India would be granted dominion status in the future. Known as the Irwin Declaration, it was warmly welcomed by Indians but faced massive backlash back in Britain.
The British population was still pro-Empire and India was seen as the Empire’s Crown Jewel. Importantly, as the world economy went into a recession, India was arguably Britain’s most valuable colony with its vast land, resources, and population crucial for its economy.
Thus, under pressure from back home, Irwin went back on his word. In a meeting with Gandhi, Muslim League’s Muhhammad Ali Jinnah and a few other leaders, he said that he could not promise India dominion status any time soon.
This would be a turning point as the Congress grew increasingly united on the issue. With the British unable to follow through on even reasonable reforms, Indians supported increasingly “radical” goals – a fully independent republic being one of the first.
The Lahore Session of the INC convened in December 1929. On December 19, the historic “Poorna Swaraj” resolution was passed in the session. Literally meaning “total self-rule/sovereignty,” the resolution read, “The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually…. Therefore…India must sever the British connection and attain Poorna Swaraj or complete independence.”
This declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on January 26, 1930. The Congress urged Indians to come out and celebrate “independence” on that day. The Indian tricolour was hoisted across the country by Congress party workers and patriotic songs were sung as the country reconfigured its strategy for Independence. The resolution also contained in it an affirmation to the Gandhian methods of nonviolent protest, which would start almost immediately after Poorna Swaraj Day was celebrated.
Historian Mithi Mukherjee in India under the Shadows of Empire writes that the Poorna Swaraj declaration was a critical pivot point for India’s freedom struggle. It is with this declaration that India’s national movement “shifted from the language of charity to the language of justice.”

From 1930 till India finally won its independence in 1947, January 26 was celebrated as “Independence Day” or “Poorna Swaraj Day” with Indians reaffirming their commitment towards sovereignty on that day.
However, India won independence from the British on August 15, exactly two years after the Japanese surrendered to the Allies to end World War II. As historian Ramchandra Guha wrote, “freedom finally came on a day that resonated with imperial pride rather than nationalist sentiment.”
Thus, when leaders had to decide on a day to promulgate India’s new constitution, January 26 was thought to be ideal. Not only did this date already hold nationalist significance, the Constitution in many ways reflected the “Poorna Swaraj” declaration of two decades back.
While today’s Republic Day celebrations are very different from what Poorna Swaraj Day looked like under British Raj, January 26 remains a solemn reminder of the journey India took to attain self-rule.

One of the guidelines in the 18-point ‘advisory to colleges/departments for holding programmes/events/fests’ stated: “Entry for events should be through pre-registration like on Google Forms with details of the event i.e date, venue, the expected number of participants (to) be maintained and submitted to the police with a copy to other… departments… The registration forms should include scanned copies of college IDs of participants.”
It also stated that a police NOC is a must for holding any event: “No event where outside students are invited will be organised without an NOC from the police. Before any such event, security liasoning meetings in advance (are) to be conducted with Fire, Police, Electricity, College/University Security etc.”
Speaking to The Indian Express, Jyotsna Singh, a second-year English Honours student and the central counsellor of the student union at Miranda House, said, “The implementation of these guidelines will depend on whether we as a college decide to open up our fest to outsiders this year or not. How is it possible to ensure that students who have pre-registered are the only ones entering the campus?”
In October 2022, several men had allegedly jumped over the walls of Miranda House during a Diwali fair to enter the campus by bypassing security.
Singh further said these guidelines are “vague and unmanageable”. “What is the point of introducing guidelines when they can’t be easily implemented in the interest of students? There is still no justice for the events that took place at IPCW…”
She was referring to the incident at Indraprastha College for Women last year where a few men allegedly scaled the walls of the college and harassed women students.
Miranda House Principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said, “These guidelines are for ensuring the safety and security of students. It is up to the colleges how many of these points they can implement or not.”
College officials also said they put up wires above the main gate during student elections to ensure protection.
At Shyama Prasad Mukherjee College, central counsellor Harshitha Sharma said while the guidelines are necessary for the safety of women students, “deciding the number of students who will be attending the fest etc. would be challenging”. “How can we ensure that even registered students don’t create any problems?” she questioned.
Sharma, however, pointed out that the crowd at SPMC’s fests has always been low as they are not in North Campus. “So it is comparatively easier for us to manage… it might be a challenge for the North Campus colleges,” she added.
Meanwhile, at Jesus Mary College, students believe the implementation of the guidelines can help regulate the crowd and make fests more manageable.
“Our college is located in the Embassy area and surrounded mostly by other women’s colleges… We, fortunately, have never had any incidents like the ones at the North Campus colleges. Our fests have always been open to outsiders, both male and female students, depending upon which department is hosting it. I believe pre-registration and maintaining a record will reduce crowds as there will be a timeline to register, making it safer and manageable” said Alina Mariyam Benny, president of BA Programme department.
Other guidelines state that the responsibility for events will lie with college/department authorities and that they should act with due diligence. They also state that before any event, there should be an assessment of the college’s boundary wall. “If found low, concertina wires should be installed to prevent outsiders from scaling the walls,” it said. It further said CCTVs and a PA system are a must at all gates of colleges.
An additional guideline issued earlier this month stated that “there should be proper security arrangements/CCTVs outside the ladies’ washroom/changing rooms in every institution”."

Mamata made the comments at a public rally after leading an all-faith “Sanhati Yatra” in Kolkata.
“I am not against Ram. I respect Ram and Sita but they don’t take the name of Sita. So, are you anti-women? Do not forget, she is Sita who accompanied Ram during his 14 years of exile. Had there been no Kaushalya, Ram wouldn’t have been born … I don’t mind if someone worships Ram and someone worships Rahim. But I have an objection if someone politicises it.”

The CM said, “I do not agree with their (BJP) priority when crores of people are unemployed in the country and so many people die every day; in a country where some people are trying to dictate what I will wear or eat, I cannot agree with them.”
Mamata said it was easier to stoke fire than to douse it and remembered the riots that were triggered by the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, and the lives lost in subsequent riots. “I was on the streets then. I went to Jyoti Basu (CPM leader and the CM at the time). Park Circus was burning, Metiabruz was burning, and Watgunj was burning. So many people died. People died in other states too. Today’s generation does not know this. They should. We pay respect to those who died and we call them ‘shaheed’ and martyrs … Tum khun baarish le aayenge, toh hum himmat ka baarish le aayenge (If you bring forth a rain of blood, we will bring the rain of courage).”
She said, “The BJP tries to divide the Hindu vote and they have created some middlemen who are also trying to divide the Muslim vote here. I never did that. When the NRC (proposed National Register of Citizens) came, I fought against that. No one fought like I did. We stopped NRC here.”
The TMC chief, accompanied by the leaders of various faiths and her party leaders, started the yatra from Hazra More in Kolkata and it concluded at Park Circus crossing. During the yatra, she visited a temple, masjid, gurdwara, and church along the way. In her speech, Mamata referred to her nephew and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee’s post on X the day before in which he wrote, “My RELIGION has not taught me to accept and embrace a place of worship, whether it be a MANDIR, MASJID, CHURCH or GURUDWARA, which has been built over HATRED, VIOLENCE and the dead bodies of innocents. Period!”
The CM on Monday said, “Do you remember when the Babri Masjid incident happened, so many people lost their lives? Yesterday, Abhishek wrote that I can’t stand where so many people died and celebrate. No matter what religion the people belong to, we pay tribute to them.”
Among those who walked with the CM were Nakhoda Masjid Imam Mohammed Shafique Qasmi, Revered Paritosh Canning, and Buddhist religious leader Arunjyoti Bhikkhu. Referring to these leaders, Mamata said, “To all the dharma gurus who walked with me today, I share my gratitude with all. All the religious places that I came across on my way, paid my tribute to all of them. I want to show my respect to all the people of Bengal because all of you are cultured and educated people. Today, the people of Bengal have to take up a big responsibility. Will the people of this country survive or will someone, before the elections, come and sell the entire country and go?”
In his speech, Abhishek Banerjee said, “Koi kehta hain Hindu khatre me hain. Koi kehta hain Musalmaan khatre me hain. Main kehta hoon ki dharam ka chashma hata ke dekho, poora Hindustan khatre me hain (Some say Hindus are in danger. Some say Muslims are in danger. I say, remove the spectacles of religion and you will see that the entire country is in danger).”"
OLX9TES8FC_XEJIDQPRIHUGIKH,Nirmala Sitharaman to equal Morarji Desai’s record with her sixth straight budget,_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 13:55 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-equal-morarji-desai-record-interim-budget-2024-9128868/,"Sitharaman, the first full-time woman finance minister of the country, has presented five full budgets since July 2019 and will present an interim or vote-on-account budget next week.
With the presentation of the interim budget on February 1, Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha, who had presented five budgets in a row.
Desai, as finance minister, had presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959-1964. The interim budget 2024-25 to be presented by Sitharaman on February 1, will be a vote-on-account that will give the government authority to spend certain sums of money till a new government comes to office after the April-May general elections.
As the Parliamentary elections are due, Sitharaman’s interim budget may not contain any major policy changes. Speaking at an industry event last month, Sitharaman had ruled out any “spectacular announcement” in the interim budget, saying it would just be a vote-on-account before the general elections.
A vote-on-account, once approved by Parliament, will authorise the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India on a pro-rata basis to meet expenditure for the April-July period.
The new government, which is likely to be formed around June, will come up with a final budget for 2024-25 sometime in July. Usually, interim budgets do not contain major policy announcements, but nothing stops the government from taking steps which are necessary to deal with the urgent issues facing the economy.
After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19. It was in 2017, that Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting budget on the last working day of February to 1st of the month.
Piyush Goyal, who was holding the additional charge of the ministry due to ill health of Jaitley, presented the interim budget for 2019-20 on February 1, 2019. Goyal had hiked standard deduction for salaried taxpayers by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. Also, the tax rebate for taxpayers whose annual taxable income did not exceed Rs 5 lakh was increased from Rs 2,500 to Rs 12,500.
After the 2019 general elections, in the Modi 2.0 Government, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio. She became the second woman to have presented a budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71.
That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a ‘bahi-khata’ with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.
Under Sitharaman, India has weathered the Covid pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag of the fastest growing major economy and a ‘bright spot’ in the world economy.
India is racing to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2027-28 and USD 30 trillion by 2047. Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who holds the tag of presenting 10 budgets — the maximum by any finance minister — had presented six of them, including one interim, in a row.
The first budget of Independent India was presented by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.
Sitharaman, who will be presenting her sixth budget in a row, is expected to come up with some measures, especially to boost the rural sector as the agriculture sector growth in 2023-24 is estimated to decelerate to 1.8 per cent, from 4 per cent, in the preceding year.
Rakesh Nangia, Chairman, Nangia Andersen India said given the proximity to the elections, the budget is expected to focus on immediate fiscal needs rather than introducing broad long-term economic reforms.
In the last interim budget for FY 2019-20, while the overall tax structure remained unchanged, there were certain specific tax rebates and standard deduction concessions. “While major announcements may be deferred until after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the budget is expected to address ongoing concerns and lay the foundation for future economic growth. This strategic approach aims to balance immediate fiscal responsibilities with long-term economic objectives in a pre-election context,” Nangia said."

According to the police, the victim’s husband, who works in Saudi Arabia, had hired killers to eliminate the woman on suspicion that she was having an extramarital affair. They added that the assailants gangraped the victim before killing her.
The arrested men, who are in their twenties, were on Tuesday produced before a local court which sent them to judicial custody, said a police officer. The police are now looking for the victim’s 25-year-old brother-in-law who allegedly played the role of mediator between the husband and killers.
“We will seek the help of central agencies to bring the husband from Saudi Arabia where he had gone around a year ago for work. The victim’s husband is a conspirator in the murder. We are trying to contact the husband’s friends and relatives to know where in Saudi Arabia he had gone,” said Hori Lal Singh, Circle Officer, Fatehpur.
The victim’s husband is also accused in the murder of his parents which took place four years ago, said Singh. He is presently out on bail in that case.
The victim, who got married two years ago, had been living at her parent’s home for the last 15 days. The police suspect the victim came to her parent’s house after arguments with her husband over the phone. Her parent’s house is around 30 kilometre from her in-law’s house in Fatehpur.
On Saturday morning, labourers working at the under-construction house spotted the naked body of a woman and informed the police. The police rushed to the spot and seized the body. With the help of local intelligence, the police identified the body and recorded statements of her family members. The under-construction building is around 10 km from the victim’s parents’ house.
The woman’s father told the police that his son-in-law’s cousin came to his house five days ago and took his daughter with him to a fair in a neighbouring village. When she did not return home in the evening, the father contacted his son-in-law’s cousin and he told him he had dropped the victim near his house after returning from the fair.
“The father said he was searching for the victim and did not file any complaint with the police. The father suspected the role of his son-in-law’s cousin in the murder case. We conducted raids at his (son-in-law’s cousin) hideouts but failed to contact him. Based on his call records, we traced a few persons, who had been in contact with him for the last week. We picked those persons for questioning,” said a police officer.
During interrogation, they confessed to the crime and revealed the details of the murder. “The assailants told us that the victim’s husband suspected that she was having an extramarital relationship with a local man. Over two weeks ago, the husband contacted his cousin and asked to arrange a contract killer for the murder of his wife. The husband also promised to pay Rs 3 lakh for the murder,” said the officer.
He added, “The assailants also told us that the victim’s brother-in-law contacted them and offered the contract. After they accepted the contract, he paid Rs 1 lakh as advance money. As per the plan, the cousin went to the victim’s house and brought her to the under-construction house on the pretext of seeing it. Other accused were following the victim on motorcycles. When the victim reached the construction site, they raped and killed her by strangulation. They also hit her face with stones.”"
OU1MFLQ3VI_X810SR2ANAENHYB,Gujarat Vidaypith amends constitution; curtails number of trustees and Chancellor’s term,Ritu Sharma,"Updated: January 24, 2024 20:22 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/gujarat-vidaypith-amends-constitution-curtails-number-of-trustees-and-chancellors-term-9124678/,"In a big move, the Gujarat Vidaypith has amended its constitution to curtail the number of trustees and the term of the chancellor.
As per the amendments effective from last month, the Gujarat Vidyapith Governing Council or Mandal has fixed the bar on the number of members (trustees) on its board from 25 to 17, increased their terms from three to five years, and fixed the term of Chancellor, which was earlier lifetime, to five years.
Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat currently holds the post of Chancellor of the varsity.
“The current Chancellor himself requested to fix his term from lifetime to five years,” Gujarat Vidyapith Mandal secretary Harshad Patel told The Indian Express.
The eight members, who are no longer in the Trust, are employees of the Vidyapith. All these members were also in the board meeting that cleared the amendments and agreed to them. “From now on, there would be only trustees and no employee in the Mandal. Out of eight, the term of the current six employees — Jagdishchandra Savaliya, Jagdishchandra Gothi, Arunbhai G1andhi, Nareshbhai Chauhan, Pravinkumar Sharma and Mehulbhai Patel — will conclude on March 31, 2024,” states the amended constitution.
Directly related to this is the quorum and request for special and general meetings. A special meeting can be called by the secretary with a request by three-fourths members. This was earlier one-fourth.
Similarly, the quorum in the general meeting has been amended from one-fourth to one-third. Also, the intimation for a general meeting has to be sent five days in advance, which was earlier a period of three days, the amendment states.
“These changes can be interpreted as a measure to stop any resolutions being passed by the Mandal that might be against the leadership. For instance, the existing six employees who are members of the Mandal have been removed from the Mandal which constitutes one fourth of the previous number of members. So, their term might be till March 31, 2024, but by changing this clause along with the quorum, it has been ensured that no resolution or decision is passed by these six employees,” revealed one of the trustees.
Also, while the president of the Mandal was the Vice Chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith earlier, now the president is the Chancellor. On the reasons for these amendments, Harshad Patel said, “The provisions have been streamlined and retained to what these were originally.”
However, the provision that any change in the constitution will be eligible only with the majority consent of two-thirds of members has been retained."

According to police, last November, the woman filed a complaint alleging that a person, on the pretext of marriage, sexually assaulted her over 8-9 months and forced her to undergo an abortion for Rs 8,000 in a hospital. The accused then absconded with her mobile phone and gold chain.
Police said the main accused, Veer alias Navin, was already arrested in connection with the case.
Police said they went to check the hospital, but found it closed. “When we enquired further, we came to know that the doctor who ran it was named Mohammad Sohrab (37),” police said.
“During questioning, it was revealed that Sohrab obtained an MBBS degree from China. Upon failing the MCI exam in India, he forged the certificate. He practised with the fake certificate at a private hospital in Islampur from 2014 to 2017,” said Inspector Sandeep, SHO of Sector 9A police station.
Police checked with the hospital and after seeking information from MCI, they confirmed it was forged."
P1QX2UQ3NQ_VUXER27MUAT14S1,Delhi High Court refuses to quash FIR against A V Prem Nath in ‘cash for compassionate jobs scam’,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 09:48 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-high-court-refuses-to-quash-fir-against-a-v-prem-nath-in-cash-for-compassionate-jobs-scam-9122941/,"The Delhi High Court has refused to quash an FIR against 1998-batch Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Island Civil Services (DANICS) officer A V Prem Nath for allegedly inducing the filing of a “false complaint” against Y V V J Rajshekhar, Delhi government’s Special Secretary (Services and Vigilance), in connection with the “cash for compassionate jobs scam”.
A single-judge bench of Justice Amit Sharma, in its January 22 order, said that it was “prima facie clear” that the email ID in question was created by the Nath and falls within the definition of ‘creating a false document’ under Section 464 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
“Be that as it may, the matter is still under investigation. The exercise of collecting evidence in support of the offences alleged in the present FIR is still underway. The present case is not one where it can be safely concluded at this stage that no offence is made out… In view of the above discussion and in the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the considered opinion that no case for exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC for quashing of the impugned FIR is made out. The present petition is dismissed and disposed of accordingly,” the high court observed.
It further said that the order should not be considered an opinion of the court on the case’s merits.
Nath had moved the high court seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him last year by one Nakul Kashyap (complainant) for the offences under Sections 417 (cheating), 419 (cheating by personation), 468 (forgery for harming reputation) 471 (using as genuine a forged document) 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and all other consequential proceedings emanating from it.
The prosecution stated that Kashyap, whose father was an employee at LNJP Hospital, Delhi and had passed away in 2016 on duty, alleged that Nath had assured him that he is “acquainted with Saurabh Bhardwaj, a minister in the ruling Government of the Aam Aadmi Party and that he will help the complainant in securing the appointment on compassionate grounds”.
As per the prosecution, Kashyap had alleged that Nath called him after a few months and asked him to meet. When they met Nath showed Kashyap “some documents and told him that he has had a conversation with Mr. Saurabh Bharwdaj and once a complaint is submitted against Sh. YVVJ Rajshekhar, Special Secretary, Services, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi , they will get him employed”.
The prosecution claimed that during the “enquiries conducted into the complaint” against Rajshekhar, it came to the “complainant‘s knowledge that in the said complaint, it has been stated that Sh. YVVJ Rakshekhar made caste based remarks against the complainant, which is false”.
“The complainant never even met Sh. YVVJ Rajshekhar. It further came to the complainant‘s knowledge that a fake email-ID has been created in his name, using which complaints against Sh. YVVJ Rajshekhar have been sent to various persons,” the order records.
Nath argued before the HC that a perusal of the FIR reflects that the ingredients of the offences for which it has been registered are not made out. He further submitted that the complainant has an “ulterior motive” for registration of the FIR and is a “result of vendetta” against him, “perpetrated” by Rakshekhar, who is a senior IAS officer.
Justice Sharma noted that it was not Nath’s case that he did not assist Kashyap in making the said complaints.
“On a pointed query from this Court, during the course of arguments, with regard to the email-ID…learned Senior Counsel contended that the case of the petitioner is that the said email-ID was created with the complainant‘s (Kashyap) consent. It is the stand of the petitioner that he had used the said email-ID to forward complaints against the aforesaid officer filed at the instance of the complainant,” the high court observed.
“It is a matter of record that the statement of the complainant has been recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC wherein he has corroborated the allegations in the FIR. In view of the above, the present case involves two versions – one of the petitioner and one of the complainant, which requires due investigation,” it added."

Deepika V Lokesh had been missing since January 20 and her body was found in the foothills of Melukote on Monday. Both Deepika and the accused, Nitish, were residents of Manikyanahalli of Pandavapura taluk.
A police officer said, “Deepika, who was married to Lokesh, is the mother of an eight-year-old son. She was in a relationship with Nitish for a couple of years. However, recently there was a rift between the duo and Deepika had avoided Nitish’s calls.”
Lokesh had warned Nitish, who worked in a private firm in Mysuru, not to talk to his wife after he came to know about their relationship 15 days ago, according to the police. He was advised to do so also by the village elders.
It was Nitish’s birthday on January 20 and he had allegedly called Deepika to Melukote to celebrate his birthday. Though she reached there, Deepika told Nitish that she would not meet him again. Upset over it, Nitish killed Deepika and buried her body there, said the police officer.
Nitish, who fled after Deepika’s body was discovered, was arrested near Hospet in Vijayanagar district, Mandya Superintendent of Police N Yatish told The Indian Express."
P2XL0GTQO8_JHDFSOTNZ09ZJ91,Bhullar denied relief: SAD blames Kejriwal and Mann govts; AAP says 6 of 7 board members BJP nominees,Kamaldeep Singh Brar,"Updated: January 24, 2024 23:38 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/1993-delhi-bomb-blast-davinder-pal-singh-bhullars-plea-rejected-9123901/,"A blame-game erupted in Punjab Tuesday after the Sentence Review Board (SRB) of New Delhi’s Tihar Jail rejected an application for the premature release from jail of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, a convict in the 1993 Delhi bomb blast case, for the seventh consecutive time. It is also the first time that the board, which has Delhi jails Minister as member, has rejected Bhullar’s plea after the Aam Aadmi Party formed government in Punjab.
The Shiromani Akali Dal accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government of rejecting the plea of Bhullar, a charge rubbished by the Punjab AAP.
Bhullar was convicted in connection with the killing of nine people and injuring 31 others in a blast outside the Youth Congress headquarters in Delhi. He was arrested after deportation from Germany.
In Tihar jail since 1995, Bhullar was awarded death penalty by a designated TADA court in August 2001 but his capital punishment was commuted to life sentence in 2014. Meanwhile, after being diagnosed with depression, he was shifted to a hospital in Delhi in 2012. He was shifted to an Amritsar hospital in 2015 based on the family’s plea and transferred to the Amritsar Central Jail. Since 2016, the Punjab government has allowed him to come out on parole. Bhullar has undergone an actual sentence of more than 25 years and availed parole for more than three years.
As per the the recommendations of the SRB, which met on December 21, 2023 — and which were uploaded on Delhi’s prison department Monday — 46 cases were considered for permanent release. It allowed the release of 16 prisoners while rejecting the applications of 33 others, including that of Bhullar.
Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal accused the AAP governments in Delhi and Punjab of conspiring to reject Bhullar’s plea.
“Shocking heinous crime against humanity by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his puppet (Punjab Chief Minister) Bhagwant Mann. By teaming up to reject the premature release plea of Prof Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, they have both sprinkled salt on the wounds of the Sikh Sangat,” Badal said on X.
Badal condemned the manner in which “the human rights of Prof Bhullar are being violated by keeping him in incarceration for around 29 years despite his precarious health condition”. He also appealed to the Panth “to unite and formulate a joint strategy to secure justice in the case”.
Party leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia too blamed the Delhi government and demanded that the reasons for rejecting it be made public. “The Punjabis have a right to know why the plea had been kept pending for the last five years and why it had been rejected now This amounts to violating the human rights of Bhullar,” Majithia said.
Punjab AAP’s chief spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang, meanwhile, lashed out at the SAD leaders for telling “lies” and “an attempt to create unrest in Punjab” as “Badals want to grab power at any cost.”
He said the SRB comprised 7 members, including Delhi jails minister Kailash Gehlot, while six belong to the BJP, a former ally of the SAD. Referring to the minutes of the board meeting, Kang claimed that it was only the Delhi minister who supported Bhullar’s release. All other six members voted against Bhullar’s premature release, he said and pointed out that it was rejected with the majority of 6:1 “influenced by members reporting to Lieutenant General of Delhi”.
“Setting the record straight, the lone voice of Gehlot ardently advocated for Bhullar’s early release, citing grave physical and mental deterioration,” said Kang.
The AAP leader said that Gehlot  cited the no objection certificate issued by police in Amritsar, which is Bhullar’s home district “but dissenting board members raised concerns that his release may jeopardise the nation’s sovereignty.”
Bhullar’s counsel Jaspal Singh Manjhpur said that despite being the chairman of the SRB, Gehlot could not get the decision in favour of the Sikh prisoner’s release. “He should have resigned as the chairman. Also, all others in the board were not BJP nominees. There was a nominee of the Sessions Judge, another of Social Welfare Department of Delhi government. There was DIG (Jails). They can say the Joint Commissioner of Police was from Centre. But they cannot exonerate themselves from this completely,” Manjhpur said.
Kang, meanwhile, said the people of Punjab will never buy “lies” of Majithia. “They know the SAD’s reality too well now. Everyone knows that Akali Dal has never done anything for the ‘panth’, Sikhs and Punjab, they always do things for their personal interests. So, the SAD’s attempt to gain sympathy here will fail miserably,” Kang said.
The Centre had in September 2019 recommended special remission to eight Sikh prisoners, including Bhullar, to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
Bhullar’s application for release was rejected twice in 2018, once in 2019, thrice in 2020, and deferred once in 2022."

A message on Snapchat, sent by Aditya Verma before he departed UK’s Gatwick airport in July 2022, read: “On my way to blow up the plane (I’m a member of the Taliban).”
The message was picked up by the UK security services, who in turn alerted the Spanish authorities, prompting the latter to scramble two Spanish fighter jets to follow the plane.
Soon after the plane landed at Menorca, Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested and kept in a police cell for two days and was later released on bail, a Madrid court was told Monday as the case came up for hearing.
He was questioned by the British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 after he returned to the UK.
Varma, who appeared before the court, said the message was “a joke in a private group setting.” “It was just sent to my friends I was travelling with on the day,” he said, as reported by BBC.
Police experts, who combed Varma’s phone for any suspicious activity, told the court that they found he had researched clashes between Pakistan and India and the possibilities of an Islamic State attack in that area. However, they said they did not find anything of interest that linked Verma to jihadist radicalism.
Although Verma is not facing terrorism charges or a possible jail term, the Spanish defence ministry is demanding €95,000 in expenses besides the fine of €22,500 if he is found guilty."

P8TD36BCY6_1QP2U90BYPBIZAE,DMK govt says no curbs on Ram Temple celebration; but Governor joins BJP offensive,Arun Janardhanan,"Updated: January 23, 2024 02:47 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/dmk-ayodhya-ram-temple-celebration-governor-bjp-9122177/,"AS THE RAM Temple consecration was being held in Ayodhya Monday, the Tamil Nadu government found itself facing allegations at home and in courts over alleged attempts to stop devotees from celebrating the event.
Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman led the allegations, and Governor R N Ravi took up the matter, talking of a “pervasive sense of fear”, even as the state government denied having issued any such order.
The M K Stalin-led DMK government also threatened legal action against a prominent Tamil daily that reported Sunday that it had banned special pujas and live telecasts of the Ayodhya event.
Reacting to this report, Sitharaman first attacked the DMK government, slamming its “anti-Hindu, hateful action”. “In TN there are over 200 temples for Shri Ram. In HR&CE managed temples, no puja, bhajan, prasadam, annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are stopping privately held temples from organizing events. They are threatening organizers,” she tweeted.
HR& CE is the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department that manages temples in Tamil Nadu.
Soon after the Union minister’s tweet, HR&CE Minister P K Sekarbabu said no limitations had been imposed on devotees’ freedom to offer food, conduct pujas, or distribute prasad in state temples.
However, Sitharaman repeated her allegations on Monday. “The repression saga in Tamil Nadu continues,” she tweeted, alleging that a small village in Chengalpattu district had been prevented from celebrating the event and that LED operators planning to telecast it had been threatened.
She seemed to be referring to the removal of LED panels from Kamakshi Amman temple in Kanchipuram, which officials and police attributed to permission issues.
Visiting Sri Kodandaramaswami Temple in Chennai Monday, Governor Ravi spoke about a “pervasive sense of invisible fear and apprehensions writ large on the faces of priests and temple staff”, and “a sense of acute repression”. He said this was in “stark contrast to the festive environment in the rest of the country”.
A top official told The Indian Express that “there was absolutely no such ban” anywhere over the Ayodhya events, but that a “standard rule” had been enforced. “We insisted on permission if huge screens were put up for telecasting the Ayodhya event in public places. Similarly, processions without permissions were restricted… Otherwise, we have nothing to do with a temple or mutt organising events on their own premises,” the official said.
The BJP-DMK war of words was also taken up by minister Udhayanidhi Stalin who, in response to a tweet attacking the DMK government, posted an old photo of his wearing a T-shirt saying: “Don’t understand Hindi. Leave.”
Udhayanidhi had earlier stirred a row with his remarks on the Sanatan Dharma, which the BJP had taken up as evidence of the DMK being against Hindu religion. The DMK government has also had a long-running feud with the Governor, while Sitharaman (who has Tamil origins) has lately been leading the BJP offensive against it. Separately, the BJP has been demanding that temples be taken out of state government control.
Courts dragged in The Supreme Court was approached by a BJP functionary, alleging that the DMK government had “issued oral orders / directions to the police” not to permit prayers, alms distribution or live telecast of the consecration ceremony, in all temples, including private.
After it clarified that it had not issued any such order, the Bench asked the DMK government to record reasons for accepting or rejecting applications seeking permission, and to keep data on the same. “We believe and trust that authorities will act in accordance with law and not on the basis of any oral instructions,” the Court said.
The Court also took objection to the reply of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Dindigul Rural Sub Division, regarding an application by the administrators of Sri Bhagavatiyamman Temple to hold special almsgiving to mark the consecration.
The police note said, “The area of A Vellodu village, where you have requested permission to conduct the event, is predominantly inhabited by Christians. Additionally, there are areas with Christian temples. Due to the lower number of Hindu residents in this village, there is a possibility of encountering cultural sensitivities or legal complications related to public peace and morality when organizing events that are perceived as deviating from the prevailing religious practices. Also, public peace is likely to be affected.”
The Court termed the reasons cited by the police as “atrocious”, noting: “If the order at page 21 (of the petition) is to be made applicable across Tamil Nadu, wherever there are minorities, they will never be able to hold a prayer meeting… You regulate it, you have the power. You have the power to pass orders regulating all these processions. But this reason is atrocious… what is stated in the order alone can’t be the reason. We want to know the reason. If this is the reason going to be given, you will be in trouble.”
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Court that he was told that some police stations had passed written orders and added that a message must go from the highest constitutional court that what was happening is not acceptable.
The Madras High Court separately saw a special sitting around 9.30 am, to hear an “urgent” petition. After the government’s clarification, the court ordered that events be conducted responsibly and without causing any disturbance."

Issuing notice on the appeal against the HC order, a three-judge bench presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud stayed the January 9 order, but allowed the HC to proceed with the pending petitions.
Appearing for the state government, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the airport in Kangra is the only one of the three airports in the state that is capable of being expanded.
In June 2023, the Himachal Pradesh Cabinet in its meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu decided to go ahead with the land acquisition process for the expansion of Kangra airport.
The HC, while passing its order, had taken note of submissions that the matter is being re-examined in light of a letter addressed by the Airport Authority of India, particularly with regard to financial and technical viability.
It then went on to say: “Having regard to the fact that the matter is under re-consideration by the state government, at this stage, it would not be proper to permit the respondents to proceed with the taking of possession of the land, which is notified for acquisition, or demolish the structure thereon or to proceed with the R&R (relief and rehabilitation) process till the next date of hearing.”
It said “since there is a possibility that the state government may re-visit its own decision to proceed with the expansion of the Gaggal airport after examining all aspects of the matter and in such an event, there is every possibility of the time and expenses incurred in the R&R process commenced, would go waste, till the next date of hearing, status quo in all respects with regard to the R&R process as well as taking of possession of the land notified for acquisition or demolition of structure located in the land notified for acquisition, shall be maintained”."

Both in hotel rooms — one in Room No. 111, the other in Room No. 107.
On February 7, 2016, Sandeep Gadoli, a Gurgaon-based gangster, was shot dead in an alleged encounter with a team of the Haryana Police at a hotel near the international airport in Mumbai. In the hotel room with Gadoli that day was Divya Pahuja, an 18-year-old aspiring model and the gangster’s alleged girlfriend. As the nature of the case changed, with the Mumbai Police arresting five Haryana policemen for allegedly carrying out a fake encounter and killing Gadoli, Divya went on from being the prime witness in the case to Accused No 4.
On January 2 this year, Divya was shot dead in a hotel room in Gurgaon, with her family alleging that her murder was linked to Gadoli’s death.
The two murders, nearly eight years apart, shone a spotlight on the seamy world of gangsters and law enforcement, glamour and sordid relationships. For Divya, 27, the eldest of two children growing up in Gurgaon’s Baldev Nagar, it was a world no less alluring than the Instagram reels she immersed herself in.
A teenager and a gangster with a degree
Divya was barely 18 when she was first arrested in the Gadoli case. But by then, the teenager had already been living dangerously. Police claimed that Divya and the gangster were living together at the time of his encounter.
Her father a fruit vendor and mother a homemaker, police sources said “circumstances at home” may have played a major part as a young Divya was soon introduced to the world of gangsters and their rivalries. Her mother Sonia was arrested with Divya in the Gadoli case. Sonia was first released from jail in October 2020, during the pandemic, on health grounds after which she surrendered again in 2022 before she was granted bail in March 2023. She is now out on bail in the case.
It was around 2015 that Divya met Gadoli through her friends. The son of a constable with the Haryana Police, Gadoli, who had a bachelor’s degree from Rohtak University, had a bounty of Rs 1.25 lakh on his head at the time of his death. “Though he was wanted in 41 cases, including 10 cases of murder, across Haryana and Delhi when he died, Gadoli started out with petty assaults. Later, he formed a gang that was involved in the businesses of extortion and illegal liquor,” the police said.
As Gadoli gained a foothold in the world of crime, around this time, police said, he became enemies with politician-gangster Binder Gujjar over dominance in the illegal liquor and extortion business in the city.
According to the Mumbai Police, the Gurgaon police team conspired with Binder’s brother Manoj to track down Gadoli, who was then on the run in a case of murder of Binder’s driver, to Mumbai. And Divya would prove to be a handy double-cross agent.
The Mumbai Police’s chargesheet says that throughout her trip from Jaipur to Mumbai with Gadoli, as Divya kept updating her location on Facebook, she was sharing information on Gadoli’s whereabouts. Divya, the Mumbai Police said, would also pass on vital, coded clues to her mother, who in turn passed on the information to Manoj.
While the Mumbai Police said Manoj had promised Sonia a flat and money in exchange for information on Gadoli, in their bail applications, the mother-daughter denied conspiring with the Gurgaon police to kill Gadoli.
Wearing a grey cap that Divya got for her from a mela two days before her death, Divya’s mother Sonia denies these charges and says her first-born worked at a Noida-based event management firm for Rs 36,000 per month before her death. “Look at our house… It urgently needs to be repaired. If we were extorting people or getting money through other means, our house would not be in this state.”
Sonia’s younger daughter Naina, 25, was still in school in 2016 when Divya was arrested. Following the arrests of her mother and sister, Naina started working with a private company. “I have been working for seven years and Divya also worked to support the family as our father has a heart disease and does not work anymore. We know what hard work is. My sister would never try to extort money from anyone,” says Naina.
Phone, social media and an odd request
Pahuja remained lodged in Mumbai’s Byculla women’s jail from July 2016 to June 2023, when she was granted bail by the Bombay High Court. She had been denied bail five times in the past.
In the interactions that The Indian Express had with Divya, while she was produced in court during the trial and later, after she got out on bail, she came across as a teenager like any other. Denied her phone, Divya would often complain to her sister, who visited her in court and in jail, that she missed being on social media.
In 2017, Pahuja was admitted to the state-run JJ Hospital as her health deteriorated and she rapidly lost weight. Later, speaking to The Indian Express, she had said about her hospital stay, “I couldn’t bear to be in hospital where everyone else was using their phones and I didn’t have mine. I felt as if everyone else was getting on with their lives while I remained stuck inside jail. I requested the hospital authorities to send me back to jail. At least in jail, everyone was the same, nobody had a phone.” It was an odd request since prisoners liked the time they got away from jail.
Speaking to The Indian Express about her time in jail, Divya had said that for the initial few months of her confinement, she did not eat jail food in the hope that she would be out soon.
“I was told that once the chargesheet is filed, I might get bail. I did not eat because I did not want to get used to life in jail… I thought it is anyway temporary. All those months, I only ate some snacks available in the canteen,” she said.
It was when her first bail was rejected, five months after her arrest, that Divya began settling into her life in jail. She took to writing letters to her father who couldn’t visit her in jail due to his physical disability. It was mostly her younger sister Naina who would visit her in jail and through whom she took social media updates on what her friends and others her age were doing, eating, etc.
In January 2023, Divya moved a two-page handwritten application before the Mumbai sessions court seeking a plea bargain. She reportedly claimed that she passed on information about Gadoli to the Gurgaon police “to save her family, as he had threatened to kidnap her father and sister”. On her next court visit a few days later, she withdrew the application claiming “duress” and that incarceration had “affected” her mental health.
Throughout her time as an undertrial, Divya had maintained her innocence, including breaking down in court saying that “she was stuck between the police and a gangster”.
After being granted bail in June 2023, Divya, who was a first-year BCom student at the time of her arrest, told The Indian Express that she intended to study law.
Asha, 32, a homemaker and Divya’s neighbour in Gurgaon’s Baldev Nagar, says, “When Divya returned in July (on bail from Mumbai), she was quite reserved. She opened up as time passed.”
Divya also created a new Instagram account, which she kept private, after her release on bail, the family said. They added that she mostly kept to herself and did not even meet old friends since her return from Mumbai.
Blackmail and a murder
On January 2, five months after she came out on bail, Divya was shot dead at a hotel in Gurgaon by the owner of the hotel, Abhijeet Singh, 56.
Divya’s family said she was introduced to Abhijeet, who hailed from Haryana’s Hisar and is a 1989 NIT Kurukshetra graduate, by Gadoli’s old rival Binder. Her family claimed Binder had told her that Abhijeet, a former engineer who owns a house in Delhi’s South Extension, would leave his wife for her.
Abhijeet told police Divya was allegedly blackmailing him by threatening to post his “objectionable” photos and videos on the Internet. Police have arrested six people so far: Besides Abhijeet Singh, hotel staff Omprakash and Hemraj, who allegedly helped Abhijeet move the body; Megha, who allegedly helped Abhijeet dispose of the weapon and Divya’s belongings; Punjab and Haryana High Court lawyer Balraj Gill, who helped dispose of the body; and Parvesh, who supplied arms to Abhijeet.
Though the police have recovered the alleged gun, a senior officer said Divya’s phone is yet to be located. Gill’s co-accused Ravi Banga, who allegedly abandoned the car at a Patiala bus stand on January 3 after dumping her body in a canal at Pasiana in Punjab’s Moonak at dawn, is yet to be arrested. Her body was found on January 13 from Bhakra canal in Haryana’s Tohana, about 150 km from the original site.
Divya’s lawyer Sana Raees Khan claimed that she expressed frequent apprehensions about her safety. Even after she got out on bail, the shadow of the case never left Divya completely – she still had a trial to go through and faced serious charges, including murder. “Maybe Divya would have been alive if she was still in jail,” said Khan."

The police team fired almost 11-12 rounds even as the gangsters fired back. Eventually, both gangsters, Abdul Kadir and Kuldeep, were caught after the latter sustained gunshot injuries.
According to police, Kadir and Kuldeep had allegedly gunned down 30-year-old Suraj Mann, brother of gangster Parvesh Mann, in his car outside his gym in the upscale Sector 104 market area in Noida.
Police said the duo, along with other gangsters belonging to the Bishnoi-Jitender Gogi gang, allegedly attacked Suraj to avenge an old murder and a 15-year-old property dispute.
During questioning, the accused revealed they were in contact with gangster Kapil Mann alias Kallu Kheda, who is presently lodged in jail, through one of his friends. Police said Parvesh and Kallu have a long-standing rivalry over a 100-yard of plot in their village in North Delhi’s Kehda Khurd, which spiralled into violence.
CP Amit Goel (Crime) said his team, led by ACP Umesh Barthwal, Inspectors Rampal and Yogesh Kumar, were closely tracking the movements of the assailants who were on the “lookout for their next target”.
On Sunday night, the team found that the accused were in Delhi and would come to Sarai Kale Khan bus stand to flee the city. “In the early hours of Monday, our team laid a trap near the bus stand. None of the locals were allowed in the area and our informers were activated. In the morning, the duo came on foot and we waylaid them. We tried to warn them but they fired at us. More than 12 bullets were fired. Inspector Yogesh was shot at but escaped injuries as the bullet grazed his jacket. We retaliated and fired at them. Both were injured and caught,” said an officer.
DCP Goel said the accused were involved in multiple thefts and robberies and were “used” by gangs to commit bigger crimes and indulge in gang rivalry. Police seized semi-automatic pistols from their possession. (reporter: Jignasa Sinha edited by Nikitha Phyllis)"
PCYB7XC6WW_BMRPX6BO552JM66,Solving Crime: How the promise of a ‘miracle money shower’ led to 10 murders in a Maharashtra village,Omkar Gokhale,"Updated: February 1, 2024 17:56 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/solving-crime-how-the-promise-of-a-miracle-money-shower-led-to-10-murders-in-a-maharashtra-village-9127017/,"Twenty years ago, a ghastly discovery of decomposed remains of bodies by the villagers of Nandos in Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district unearthed a sordid tale of greed, deceit and murder.
On December 20, 2003, the then superintendent of police (SP) received anonymous letters and phone calls informing him about villagers spotting decomposed bodies on the hillocks and adjoining agricultural lands of Nandos village.
The police conducted a search operation with the help of villagers and recovered several dead bodies, along with the belongings of the victims. To identify the victims, information regarding missing complaints received at all police stations in Maharashtra was assimilated and the relatives of some of the deceased were contacted. Their blood samples were taken to conduct DNA tests to prove their identities.
The subsequent probe led the police to four men in their twenties who allegedly lured the deceased into the jungle near Nandos village, promising to turn them into millionaires overnight through a magical ‘money shower’. Santosh Manohar Chavan, Amit Ashok Shinde, Yogesh Madhukar Chavan and Mahesh Dhanaji Shinde were later arrested for killing 10 people, including two children, over two months. It was Santosh who performed the ‘magic spell’, the police said.
On May 6, 2011, the Bombay High Court confirmed the death penalty for the four men and commended the villagers, “If the police were not alerted on locating the dead bodies at the plateau, the accused would have continued their activities with equal determinations so as to make money by murdering innocent people by luring them in the name of multiplying the wealth by the magic of shower of money.” The Supreme Court, however, commuted their sentence to life imprisonment on February 27, 2014.
As per the prosecution, the victims belonging to varied professions were asked to bring cash, ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, and gunny bags to carry the money that would multiply after the ‘magic programme’ so that villagers in Nandos would not suspect them.
The probe revealed that the victims were brought from their towns in public transport buses with tickets bought under false names. Their stay was arranged at hotels or lodges in Kankavli or Malwan under fake identities. They were then transported by an auto rickshaw to the Nandos panchayat office, from where they were made to walk to the hillock of the plateau, a secluded place to perform rituals/pooja, the police stated.
The accused ensured that victims did not leave any of their belongings in the hotel, the police said. The victims were robbed, and during the ‘rituals’, they were shot or beaten mercilessly to death, the police added.
As per police, one Shankar Sarage from Goregaon and Hemant Thakare from Ratnagiri were killed on September 25 that year. On October 30, four people from Pune, including Vijaysinh Dudhe, Dadasaheb Chavan, Sanjay Gavare and Vinayak (Bala) Pisal from Badlapur were murdered. On November 14, a family of four from Vashi, including couple Kerubhai and Anita Mali and their two minor sons, were murdered.
The high court had observed that the crimes were committed in a “beastly, barbaric and grotesque manner”, the accused exhibited “their hunger for money and human blood and life” and the incident “shocked the collective conscience of the society”.
While commuting the death sentence to life term, the Supreme Court in 2014 noted that at the time of the commission of the offence, the four accused were between 23 to 29 years of age and belonged to the deprived section of the population, therefore it was “possible that being young, they had a yearning for quick money, which led to the crimes in question”."

The administration, however, refused to scrap the project and is apparently working on a solution to keep it going.
”We have issued the stop-work notice to the builder. The project has been stayed,” Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Singh told reporters at PCMC headquarters in Pimpri today.

I have already said we are looking into the objections made against the project. As of now, the project has been stayed, not scrapped,” he said.
Ajit Pawar, while speaking to The Indian Express last week, had said he had asked PCMC administration to not go ahead with the project. However, despite his directives, PCMC administration refused to put a stay order on the project and, if civic sources are to be believed, the administration was making a consistent effort to keep the project going.
In the past, the PCMC chief had repeatedly rejected allegations of illegality or wrongdoing in the project. However, Opposition leader Vijay Wadettiwar was the first to allege a multi-crore scam in the project. Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders in Pimpri-Chinchwad had then alleged that the builder would get transfer of development rights or TDR worth Rs 2,500 crore for a project in which he would be investing only Rs 568 crore. Rates quoted for the construction were way above the government’s Ready Reckoner rate, they had alleged. The PCMC commission had on the other hand defended the project, saying that the civic body would get Rs 5 crore in rent every month from the project without spending a single rupee on its construction.
Despite the uproar over the project, PCMC administration had received no directives from CM Eknath Shinde or Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis to scrap or stay the project, officials said. ”And that is why the administration has kept the project going. Even now, it is in no mood to scrap the project,” sources said.
When contacted, builder Aditya Javadekar confirmed that he has received a stop-work notice from PCMC. ”The PCMC has asked us to stop the work, as it told us it was analysing the objections raised and will then decide on whether to go ahead with the project or not. Till that time, we will wait. The ball is in PCMC’s court, we will act as per its directives,” he said.
Asked about the amount so far spent on the construction of the project, Javdekar said,”In about three to four four months, we have completed work till the plinth. We have spent crores on it,” he said. Civic sources said the builder has spent more than Rs 50 crore on the project so far."
PLJJZ1MB68_3217K4LNPAZOCRJ,Supreme Court grants bail to accused in 2013 Sabarmati jailbreak attempt case,Sohini Ghosh,"January 25, 2024 13:10 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/supreme-court-grants-bail-to-accused-in-2013-sabarmati-jailbreak-attempt-case-9127057/,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted bail to an accused in the 2013 Sabarmati jailbreak attempt case after the Gujarat High Court rejected his plea for bail in May last year. The accused was earlier charged in the 2008 serial bomb blasts in Ahmedabad but was acquitted of all charges in February 2022.
A division bench of Justices C T Ravikumar and Rajesh Bindal, while granting bail to the accused — Raziyuddinnasar alias Riyazuddinnasar alias Abdulrehman alias Mohammedgaus alias Abuhajar alias Abdulrazzak alias Rasidkhan from Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh — represented by senior advocate S Murlidhar, observed that the state had not appealed against his acquittal in the 2008 serial bomb blast case.
The court said that as for the jailbreak attempt case, he had been in jail custody for the past 11 years, including five years prior to his acquittal in the serial bomb blast case, in which 38 convicts were sentenced to death and another 11 were sentenced to life imprisonment.
“Taking into account all such circumstances and such other aspects,” the bench ordered for his release on bail ”subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the trial court”. The apex court ordered that Raziyuddin Nasar be produced before the concerned trial court to comply with its directions.
In May 2023, at the Gujarat High Court, the court of Justice Nirzar Desai while rejecting Raziyuddin’s bail plea, along with that of two others who were similarly accused of a jailbreak attempt at Sabarmati Central Jail in 2013 had noted that the three had “actively participated” in the conspiracy to dig the tunnel inside the jail barracks, attempting to run away from jail.
The other two were also initially accused in the 2008 serial bomb blasts in Ahmedabad but were acquitted in this case in February 2022. The court had added that releasing them on bail would send “wrong signal to society”.
The Gujarat High Court, while refusing them bail, had, however, directed the sessions court “to expedite the trial and to complete it as early as possible, if the court requires and deems it appropriate to conduct the trial on day to day basis, in that case, the sessions court may conduct the trial on day to day basis and to complete it at the earliest.”
As many as 24 stand accused in the 2013 jailbreak attempt case, with the trial at the stage of evidence of prosecution at present. The accused have been charged under IPC sections 130 (offence of aiding escape of, rescuing or harbouring a state prisoner or prisoner of war from lawful custody), 224 (resistance by a person to his lawful apprehension) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) as well as under sections 42 (introduction, removal of a prohibited articles into or from prison and communication with prisoners) and 45 (conspiring to escape or to assist in escaping) of the Prisons Act.
In February 2013, an FIR was lodged by the Ranip police station in Ahmedabad after a 213-foot-long tunnel was found inside the jail premises, purportedly dug by prisoners in a bid to escape. As many as 14 were named as accused, and ultimately, 24 were chargesheeted by the Crime Branch in the case."

Ambedkar’s statement came even as OBC outfits announced that they would hold a rally at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan on January 26 to protest the inclusion of Maratha reservation within the OBC category.
“It is not just a fight between OBCs and Marathas. It is a larger battle to reassert the rights of OBCs and Dalits. We have to unite and fight to save the Constitution, reservation and representation in the political system,” Ambedkar told The Indian Express. “The OBCs, tribals, Dalits and oppressed segments within Marathas together make up for 80 per cent of the population. Why should they be subjected to exploitation?” he added.
Exhorting people to learn to make a clear distinction between those in favour of reservation and those against, Ambedkar said, “Do not get swayed by the government’s false promises. Do not get carried away by their narratives.”
The battle lines have to be drawn, Ambedkar said. “All mainstream parties are getting elected using OBC/Dalit vote banks. But why is it that OBCs and Dalits do not get adequate representation in politics? Why is there only a symbolic representation of these communities in Parliament and Assembly?” Ambedkar asked.
“It is high time OBCs/Dalits assert themselves. In the Lok Sabha polls, they should ensure their vote goes to OBCs/Dalits. Unless such hard decisions are taken, OBCs and Dalits will be subjected to playing a secondary role in mainstream politics,” he said.
“Even within Marathas, there are two categories; one which is rich and politically dominant and the other is poor and neglected,” Ambedkar said, adding that he fears the rich and established Maratha class is using reservation politics to serve its vested interests.
“There are 169 well-established Maratha families that control the entire economy and politics in the state. They are all interlinked through relations,” he alleged, adding, “When we raise a voice against the exploitation of OBCs/Dalits, we also are concerned about these poor Marathas. We consider them as ‘Vanchit’ (deprived).”
Ambedkar’s remarks come at a time when OBC organisations in Maharashtra have decided to undertake a consolidation drive to put up a united front and showcase their political might to counter the growing clamour for Maratha reservation.
OBC Jan Manch president Prakash Shendge said, “We are holding a rally at Azad Maidan on January 26. We have appealed to OBCs to come in large numbers to raise their concerns and fight for their rights.”
“Our battle is not against any individual or community. Our objection is to Maratha reservation under the OBC category. Everybody knows Marathas are a dominant community. Till now they flaunted their forward caste. Suddenly, they are now seeking reservation. They are insisting on reservation within the OBC category. This cannot be tolerated,” Shendge told The Indian Express.
The OBC outfits’ rally will be held on a day when Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange-Patil is also holding a rally in the city. OBC leaders are angry that the state government has agreed to all the demands made by Jarange-Patil. Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s promise to Jarange-Patil that the survey to identify Kunbis will be concluded in seven days has also upset the OBC leaders who say this is a hasty decision to please Marathas and leaves ample scope for manipulation."
PQOJ4OWKKO_NXNBACG6N617D0O,"On road to Ayodhya and to LS polls, Ram Temple is a factor, just strong enough to cut across other concerns",Deeptiman Tiwary,"Updated: January 25, 2024 18:02 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/ayodhya-ram-temple-lok-sabha-polls-bjp-9126853/,"Given the scale of the celebrations around the Ram Temple inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ayodhya is set to be the ruling BJP’s major plank in the coming Lok Sabha polls. However, on the road from Delhi to Ayodhya in the run-up to the consecration shows that while the Temple will be a deciding factor for a large section of the electorate, for many, it will be one of several issues, with caste still a big determinant.
While there was near-unanimous approval for the Temple among the voters, the public response to the grand inauguration and its importance was clearly tempered by voters’ party preferences. Plus, concerns that were shared by them regardless of their party loyalties, such as unemployment, rising prices, stray cattle and, increasingly, recent changes that could end up punishing drivers with 10 years’ imprisonment for fatal accidents.
Those belonging to the upper castes and non-Yadav OBCs – the vote banks which have rallied behind the BJP staunchly in UP since 2014 – appear more excited about the Temple. But the Yadavs, which form the core vote base of the Samajwadi Party (SP), while approving of the Temple, express reservations over its “politicisation”, calling it a “ploy to deflect from real issues”, and talking of “waste of huge resources” on its construction.
The Jatav Dalits, a key vote bank of the Mayawati-led BSP, appear to be the least enthusiastic about the Temple. But even among the Scheduled Castes, Dalit groups such as Valmikis and Pasis, which have now gravitated towards the BJP, express happiness over the Temple being built.
“Ram Mandir is not an issue for the polls. They (the BJP) are already winning, with or without the Temple. People are happy about everything that Modi is doing for the country,” says Shiv Ashray, an OBC, who works as a driver and is a resident of Sarojini Nagar constituency of Lucknow. He then refers to the new central laws proposing a hefty fine and 10 years’ imprisonment for drivers involved in fatal accidents. “It is unfair. Accidents can happen even due to the victim’s fault,” he says.
Jagannath Kushwaha, also an OBC, who makes a living selling vegetables in Basheerganj in Unnao district, does not agree with Ashray. “Vote toh Ram Mandir pe hi padega. Modi-Yogi ne banwa diya, nahin to ye kabhi nahin ho paata (Only the Ram Temple issue will determine the vote. Modi-Yogi ensured its construction, otherwise it would have never happened),” he says, beaming with joy.
But even Kushwaha is unhappy over the laws regarding drivers. “Every house has a driver these days,” he says.
Another major voter grievance is the menace of “chhutta pashu” (stray cattle) – an issue that is being raised for several years now, though admittedly not seeming to have affected the poll results.
Udai Raj, a Valmiki farmer from Basheerganj, says: “This government is fine. But we are very troubled due to chhuta pashu, which have destroyed my entire wheat crop. And there is no compensation. It is so cold I can’t even sit near the field to protect my crops. If they (the BJP government) are able to control this, support for them will keep going up.”
It is a concern that Jagannath Kushwaha also shares. “They have got all the slaughterhouses shut. It is one bad decision they have made,” he says.
Ilu Rawat, a 25-year-old Pasi farmer from Kati Bagia village in Lucknow district, agrees, as does Rajendra Lodhi, an OBC from Murtazanagar. However, while echoes of this are heard across the rural belts of various regions, barely anyone thought of it as an issue strong enough to change their voting preference.
For the BJP’s supporters, the “maintenance of law and order” under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath – a topic on which there is agreement across the spectrum of castes and political affiliations – and India’s “rising prestige” under PM Modi are good enough reasons to stick to the party.
Most BJP voters list along with this the improved road infrastructure as the reason for why they will vote for the party, adding: “Aur ab toh Mandir bhi bana diya (And now they have also built the Temple).”
Many youths, especially students and graduates, speak about the lack of jobs, with those entrusted with looking after their families also highlighting price rise.
This is a concern even among core BJP supporters. However, Manoj Gupta, a shopkeeper in Lucknow district, speaks for many when he expresses jubilation for the Temple and while expressing concern about unemployment and price rise, says: “Lekin ab kya karein? Koi doosra saamne khada bhi to nahin hai (But what to do, is there any alternative challenging them).”
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had swept UP, bagging 62 out of the 80 seats as against the SP’s 5 and the BSP’s 10."
PR0ON9I3IL_AS60OFXHEJIGXQZ,Why Mayawati walks alone,Sudha Pai,"Updated: January 24, 2024 23:17 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-mayawati-walks-alone-9124521/,"At a press conference on January 15 — her birthday — Mayawati made it clear that the BSP would not align with any party or alliance, including INDIA, and would fight the 2024 Lok Sabha election alone in UP. This has led observers to argue that a three-cornered contest in UP would benefit the BJP, and, aware of this, Mayawati has decided to help the BJP.
However, Mayawati is a master strategist and it is necessary to understand the reasons underlying her decision. Two factors seem to be driving it: Like many observers, she feels that the BJP will return to power under Narendra Modi in 2024 as the INDIA alliance is facing problems within its own ranks. Second, given this calculation and the weakened position of her party, she feels that if she joins the INDIA alliance, the BJP and SP will be able to take away much of her remaining social base, including her core Dalit constituency.
The long-term reason lies in the animosity-ridden rivalry that has driven the relationship between the SP and BSP in UP. Both are “lower-caste” parties with a narrow sectarian base that overlap each other. With the Scheduled Castes (SCs) forming about 20 per cent of the UP population, the BSP has, under Mayawati, attempted to gain the support of sections of the non-Yadav OBCs, together with the Dalits. Similarly, the SP has attempted to unite all sections of backward classes and obtain some Dalit support. The two parties also compete for the support of the Muslim community as well as that of the upper castes. This contestation between the SP and the BSP to widen their social base is visible throughout the 1990s, particularly following the breakdown of the “Bahujan coalition” formed after the 1993 assembly elections. The Guest House incident in 1995 created personal enmity between Mayawati and Mulayam Singh.
The revival of the BJP in the 2000s has sharpened the rivalry between the two parties. Since 2014, the BJP has, over successive national and assembly elections, taken away a large chunk from the BSP and the SP base of the smaller non-Jatav Scheduled Castes and non-Yadav backward castes, respectively. As a result, both are facing decline, but it is the BSP that is facing an existential crisis with its seat/vote share falling in national and assembly elections.
Following the 2017 assembly elections in which the BJP gained a huge majority, fearing a further loss of their base, the two parties decided to bury their differences and join hands to fight three by-polls in 2018. The victory of the SP–BSP alliance by a high margin in March 2018 in the seats vacated by CM Adityanath and Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, and in Kairana in May 2018 in western UP, provided them with a template for a political alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But the experiment failed. The core constituencies of the alliance partners supported the alliance, but it could not defeat the new voting bloc built by the BJP of non-Jatav, non-Yadav and non-Muslim voters, a sizeable number across the state. The SP-BSP-RLD alliance won barely 15 seats, despite getting 38.92 per cent vote share; while that of the BJP increased from 42.63 per cent to 49.55 per cent.
The defeat by the BJP sharpened the hostility between them, making them conscious of the need to guard their core constituencies from further depletion by the BJP, but also by each other, in the run-up to the 2022 UP assembly. With the organisational breakdown in the BSP and exodus of its prominent leaders to other parties including the SP, the major battle in 2022 was fought between the BJP and a resurgent SP. Akhilesh Yadav attempted to harness the expansion of Mandal forces to include the smaller OBCs — the Kushwahas, Kurmis, Patels, Nishads and others — who had become politically conscious and demanding. He made efforts to shed the SP’s image of a Muslim-Yadav party by creating an anti-BJP front of smaller OBC and Dalit parties with the RLD in western UP. By positioning himself as the leader of the “pichhde”, he shifted the election discourse into a battle between Hindutva and social justice. This did not help the SP defeat the BJP, but it did make considerable gains in seat and vote share and managed to dent the BJP’s western UP citadel. The BJP’s seats decreased from 312 in 2017 to 255 seats (-52) but it increased its vote-share by 3 per cent. For the first time since 2014, the SP was able to challenge the BJP’s hegemonic position in UP, rendering the election so sharply bipolar that the alliances led by the BJP and SP polled over 80 per cent of the votes and shared 398 of the 403 seats among them.
In contrast, the BSP was the biggest loser among all caste/ sub-caste groupings and Muslims. The BJP made significant gains among the non-Jatavs and an impressive inroad among Jatavs, securing nearly a fifth of their votes, more than double of that obtained in 2017. The SP (including the RLD) increased its vote share among all sections of the Dalit community, though the increase was only slightly more than that of the BJP in the case of the other SC communities, and less than the BJP in the case of Jatavs.
Following the 2022 assembly election, the SP has made considerable efforts to increase its share of Dalit votes, leading to increased bitterness between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati. By retaining his assembly seat and giving up his Lok Sabha seat, Akhilesh Yadav signalled that the SP, as the strongest opposition party in UP, was preparing to confront the BJP in 2024. Putting forward the idea of constructing a PDA or “Pichhde (backward classes), Dalit and ‘Alpsankhyak’ (minorities)” alliance, he has consistently held that the SP should be the fulcrum around which the INDIA alliance in UP should be constructed for the 2024 election.
It is against this backdrop that Mayawati’s choice of going alone for the 2024 elections must be understood. For her, it is a matter of survival of the BSP and of the Dalit movement in UP. By not joining the INDIA alliance, she would like to protect her core constituency from further encroachments by the SP and the BJP. Viewed in a larger perspective, the Dalit movement in UP has passed through phases of resurgence and decline with periods of hiatus in which Dalit assertion has continued, giving it a complex nature. The presence of a dominant, upper-caste party, which affords little space for narrower, sectarian formations, is a key reason for the periods of decline. In the early years of Independence, it was the Congress party with its leadership from the upper castes that did not allow room for a Dalit party to grow. Now, it is the BJP, once again an upper-caste party but with a broad spectrum of Hindu social support, that constitutes a strong political force. While recognising all the failures of the BSP’s leadership, it is important to understand that the Dalit movement in UP and in the Hindi heartland, today operates under the shadow of a hegemonic, right-wing Hindu majoritarian party, espousing Hindutva. These factors underlie the decision of Mayawati to bide her time and keep her flock safe for another round of Dalit assertion.

PYGLAW3AEM_FY9JJ97HK30UQ8Y,"Tax sops for low income slabs, higher capex likely in Budget",Aanchal Magazine,"Updated: January 22, 2024 11:29 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/tax-sops-for-low-income-slabs-higher-capex-likely-in-budget-9120961/,"UNION Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the upcoming Interim Budget is unlikely to have any “spectacular announcement”, but small tax relief measures and a fillip to welfare spending is likely, according to officials.
Tweaks in certain income tax rates, especially for those at the bottom of the taxpayer pyramid, are expected in the Interim Budget for 2024-25 to be announced on February 1. A hike in standard deduction along with a higher exemption limit to incentivise taxpayers to shift to the  new income tax regime are likely.
Officials said the tax department is also looking at increasing the efficiency of revenue collection through additional transactions under the ambit of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and 360-degree profiling of taxpayers — measures that have yielded good results in the initial phase over the last few years.
In the past too, interim budgets, also called a vote-on-account, did not entail any major changes. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, then Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had proposed a hike in standard deduction and the threshold for tax deducted at source (TDS), along with sops to farmers and pension cover for unorganised sector workers. Five years earlier in 2014, the Interim Budget by then Finance Minister P Chidambaram had announced a cut in excise duties for small cars, motorcycles, scooters and SUVs besides large and mid-segment cars, and tax relief for mobile handsets.
And in the Interim Budget for 2009-10, towards the end of the first term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee announced easing of fiscal targets. This was preceded by a fiscal stimulus marked by Rs 40,000-crore of tax cuts in December 2008, which was later criticised for posing a challenge to fiscal consolidation.
Before that, in the final year of the AB Vajpayee-led NDA government, marked by the Interim Budget of 2004-05, saw late Jaswant Singh announcing changes in the stamp duty structure, revival packages for the tea and sugar industries, and merging of dearness allowance with basic pay. These weren’t the only measures taken as Singh had already announced major changes in both direct and indirect taxes in January 2004 including a cut in the peak rate of customs duty on non-farm goods to 20 per cent from 25 per cent, lower customs duty on project imports, coal and the power sector, and abolishment of the special additional duty on customs duty of 4 per cent.
While the revenue side of the Budget may see some tax cuts and efforts to increase efficient mobilisation, the focus of public expenditure is likely to be on infrastructure and welfare spending, but which may and can be achieved without huge fiscal implications, a person in the know said.
Continuing the trend from previous years, the Centre is expected to continue its thrust on capital expenditure in the upcoming year too, albeit at a slower pace than previous years. The Centre had raised the budget estimate for capex to Rs 10 lakh crore for 2023-24 from Rs 7.28 lakh crore in 2022-23 and Rs 5.92 lakh crore in 2021-22.
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is likely to see an enhanced budgetary allocation after seeing a 49 per cent reduction (from revised estimate of FY23) in the initial budget estimate of Rs 60,000 crore for FY24. The government had said it was a demand-driven scheme, and more funds would be allocated as and when needed. This has been subsequently reflected with an extra allocation of funds of Rs 16,143 crore for the MGNREGS in the first supplementary demands for grants presented in Parliament in December 2023.
The Budget session of Parliament, the last of the 17th Lok Sabha, will be held between January 31 and February 9. The Interim Budget will be presented by Sitharaman on February 1. The Lok Sabha elections are expected to be held around April-May, following which the elected government is likely to present the full Budget in July.
The government presents a vote-on-account in Parliament to seek approval for meeting expenditure for the first four-five months of the financial year beginning April to pay salaries and meet expenses for ongoing programmes in various sectors with no changes in the taxation structure, until a new government takes over and presents a full Budget that is revised for the full financial year. Over the years, some governments have made policy measures or tweaked tax rates and turned it into an Interim Budget before elections."
Q06PJCE2OP_TM2C4WUE39IBW6V,Karpoori Thakur gets Bharat Ratna: Why the Jannayak’s politics and policies still resonate,Yashee,"Updated: January 24, 2024 22:29 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/bharat-ratna-to-karpoori-thakur-his-politics-policies-9124428/,"The Centre on Tuesday (January 23) announced it would award the Bharat Ratna posthumously to Karpoori Thakur, former chief minister of Bihar. This is the birth centenary year of Thakur, also known as ‘Jannayak’, or the leader of the people.
Prominent political parties of Bihar, such as the RJD and the JD(U), have regularly demanded the Bharat Ratna for Thakur, known for his struggle to secure dignity, self respect, and development for the most disadvantaged sections of society.
Thakur’s (January 24, 1924-February 17, 1988) political life was one of contrasts — he managed to emerge as the tallest backward caste leader in Bihar despite belonging to the minority nai (barber) caste himself, but the rise of the leaders he mentored, from numerically stronger castes (Lalu Prasad from the Yadavs, Ram Vilas Paswan among Dalits), took away his pole position. He was chief minister twice for short tenures, but his radical policy decisions had an outsized impact, and resonate even today.
Life and career
Thakur was born in village Pitaunjhia (now known as Karpoori Gram), in the Samastipur district of Bihar. He participated in the freedom struggle and was also jailed for it. In independent India, he was voted in as an MLA in 1952. He remained an MLA till his death in 1988, except when he became an MP in 1977 and when he lost an Assembly election in 1984, amid the sympathy wave for Congress after Indira Gandhi’s assassination.
Thakur was education minister of Bihar from March 5 1967 to January 28, 1968. He became the state’s chief minister in December 1970 with the Samyukta Socialist Party, but his government fell after six months. He came to the post again in June 1977, but could not finish a full term, losing power in about two years. This happened due to a reservation policy he implemented, on which we’ll elaborate later.
As a new crop of social justice leaders became more powerful in Bihar, Thakur slowly lost the pre-eminence he had enjoyed.
While his policy decisions were polarising, he was respected personally for his clean image and his refusal to enrich himself on government funds.
A popular anecdote about him is that when he first became an MLA in 1952, he was selected for an official delegation to Austria. He did not own a coat, and had to borrow a torn one from a friend. When Josip Tito, the president of Yugoslavia, noticed the torn coat, he gifted Thakur a new one. When Thakur died in 1988, after three decades in public life, his home was little more than a hut.
Major policy decisions
Thakur is known for many of his decisions — removing English as compulsory subject for the matriculation examinations; prohibition of alcohol; preferential treatment for unemployed engineers in government contracts, through which around 8,000 of them got jobs (this was when unemployed engineers were staging regular protests for jobs; one such protester was Nitish Kumar); and a layered reservation system.
It was this last move that went on to have the loudest impact for Bihar as well as the country.
In June 1970, the Bihar government appointed the Mungeri Lal Commission, which in its report of February 1976 named 128 “backward” communities, 94 of which were identified as “most backward”. The Janata Party government of Thakur implemented the recommendations of the Commission. The ‘Karpoori Thakur Formula’ provided 26% reservation, of which OBCs got a 12% share, the economically backward classes among the OBCs got 8%, women got 3%, and the poor from the “upper castes” got 3%.
This was much before the central government came up with the EWS quota, and demands of layered reservation gained momentum amid caste census demands.
In the short term, however, The ‘Karpoori Thakur Formula’ cost him dearly. His government fell, and he witnessed major opposition from upper castes. Jayant Jigyasu, national spokesperson of the RJD, told The Indian Express, “After the landmark reservation policy was passed, Thakur had to face derogatory and even abusive slogans from the upper castes, directly targeting his caste. One such went ‘Karpoori kar poora, chhod gaddi, dhar ustura (Finish your work, Karpuri. Step off the chair, go hold a razor)’, a reference to his caste’s traditional occupation of a barber. A point to be noted is that this venom came his way even though he faced no charges of personal corruption or ‘lawlessness’ during his tenure.”
Politically too, his decision of bringing in the reservation policy has been seen as hasty. Jagpal Singh, former professor at IGNOU, in a 2013 paper contrasted Thakur’s way of working with Devaraj Urs of Karnataka: “Unlike Karpoori Thakur, Urs introduced the reservation policy during the last two years of his seven years of rule, after having consolidated his position for most of his rule. About the lack of proper preparation on the part of Karpoori Thakur, Urs remarked, “Karpoori Thakur climbed into the ring before he learned how to box”,” Singh wrote.
However, Thakur did keep his promise to his core voters, irrespective of the consequences.
Karpoori Thakur today
As the Mandal-Kamandal politics intensifies, Thakur’s legacy is being claimed by all political players in Bihar. CM Nitish Kumar, himself from a numerically small EBC community, has specialy sought to identify closely with Thakur.
Some have pointed out the irony of this, as it was Nitish’s generation of leaders that sidelined Thakur. To this, Jigyasu said, “The BJP government is honouring Thakur today, but it’s important to remember that his government fell because the Sangh-affiliated sections of the Janata Party withdrew support for him. The RJD and JD(U), meanwhile, are carrying his legacy forward through the government’s policies.”"
Q1PFN8V8M0_14VNTY8S272MC42,‘Agree to AAP’s arguments’: Delhi blast convict’s lawyer demands Kejriwal govt to pass resolution for Davinder Bhullar’s release,Kamaldeep Singh Brar,"Updated: January 25, 2024 15:07 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/agree-to-aaps-arguments-delhi-blast-convicts-lawyer-demands-punjab-govt-to-pass-resolution-for-davinder-bhullars-release-9127152/,"Amid spat between Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over the rejection of premature release of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, a convict in 1993 Delhi bomb blast, for the seventh time in a row by the Tihar Jail’s Sentence Review Board (SRB), the Sikh prisoner’s lawyer Jaspal Singh Manjhpur has agreed to AAP’s arguments.
While the AAP had claimed that all six out of seven persons on SRB were BJP men, Manjhpur demanded the AAP-led Kejriwal’s government in Delhi to convene a Cabinet meeting immediately and pass a resolution in favour of the release of Bhullar and send it for the Lieutenant Governor’s approval.
“Though officers, including a judge, can’t be called BJP men, but I have a suggestion for the party. If AAP doesn’t have a majority in the SRB and it really wants to help in the release of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, then you should do what then Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa had done for the release of convicts in Rajiv Gandhi murder case. She had passed a resolution in the state cabinet for the release of convicts and sent it to the governor of the state,” Manjhpur told The Indian Express.
“The cabinet is of the government, and it will make way for the release of Bhullar. It should be done immediately,” he said.
He said that what AAP spokesperson Malwinder Singh Kang has said is right about the rejection of Davinder Pal Bhullar’s permanent release in the SRB meeting held in December 21 last year.
It is also the first time that the board, which has Delhi Jails Minister as its member, has rejected Bhullar’s plea after the AAP formed a government in Punjab.
Bhullar has undergone an actual sentence of more than 25 years and availed parole for a period of more than 3 years during his incarceration. He was convicted in connection with the killing of nine people and injuring 31 others in a blast outside the Youth Congress headquarters in Delhi. He was arrested after deportation from Germany and has been in Tihar jail since 1995.
The SAD (Badal) had termed the rejection as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s ‘heinous crime against humanity.’
Responding to allegations of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Kang had blamed Delhi Lieutenant Governor for the rejection of the permanent release of Bhullar. “The lone voice of AAP’s Minister of Jails in Delhi government Kailash Gahlot ardently advocated for Bhullar’s early release, citing grave physical and mental deterioration. Regrettably, in the recently held meeting, SRB overturned this plea with a 6:1 majority, influenced by members reporting to the L-G post the recent Modi Govt’s bill,” Kang had said.
Apart from SRB chairman Kailash Gahlot, other officials on the board from the Delhi government included Delhi Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Ashwani Kumar, Delhi Director-General of Prisons Sanjay Baniwal, Principal Secretary (Law, Justice & LA), Bharat Parashar, and Chief Probation Officer, Social Welfare Department Rahul Aggarwal.
Two more members on the board were Special Commissioner of Police (Crime), Delhi Police, Ravindra Singh Yadav and Principal District & Sessions Judge, Karkardooma Courts Delhi, Renu Bhatnagar.
Bhullar was awarded death penalty by a designated TADA court in August 2001 but his capital punishment was commuted to life sentence in 2014. Meanwhile, after being diagnosed with depression, he was shifted to a hospital in Delhi in 2012 and later to an Amritsar hospital in 2015 based on the family’s plea and transferred to the Amritsar Central Jail."
Q2PBSCM40A_UHK2VUWRMWA2NHN,"Amid INDIA rumblings in Bengal, CPI(M) ups the ante: Will skip Rahul Yatra if TMC joins it",Atri Mitra,"Updated: January 24, 2024 01:46 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/india-rumblings-bengal-cpim-rahul-yatra-tmc-9123847/,"In a sign of rifts within the Opposition INDIA alliance, the West Bengal CPI(M) has made it clear to the Congress that while supporting Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra the party would give the Yatra a miss in the state if the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) participates in it.
The CPI(M) has sought “assurance” from the Congress that the TMC would not be part of the Yatra when the former joins it.
Rahul’s Yatra 2.0, which kicked off from Manipur on January 14, is scheduled to enter Bengal on January 25, where it is slated to traverse a stretch of 523 km across seven districts over several days.
According to Congress sources, a senior All India Congress Committee (AICC) leader called up the Bengal CPI(M)’s state secretary Mohammad Salim from Delhi Sunday to invite him to join the Yatra when it enters the state.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Salim said, “We give full support to Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra. But, we made it clear we will not participate in the Yatra with any political force who helped BJP to grow their organisation in West Bengal. It is Trinamool Congress which paved the way for BJP in Bengal to expand its organisation.”
Apart from the Congress, the TMC and the CPI(M) are among the major constituents of the Opposition INDIA bloc formed to take on the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
Congress sources said the party will also invite the TMC to participate in the Yatra, but the latter might refrain from joining it over their differences in sharing of the Bengal seats for the Lok Sabha polls. A senior state Congress leader said, “TMC wants seat-sharing confirmation from our leadership. This is impossible right now because our high command will not allow this type of bargaining. We expect that without finalising the seat-adjustment, TMC will not participate in the Yatra.”
The Congress leader also said, “We are eager to make seat adjustment with CPI(M)-led Left, which we had in the 2016 and 2021 Assembly elections. A majority of our leaders are not eager to make any adjustment with TMC. Our leaders have already made it clear to the party high command as well.”
In the 2021 Assembly elections, the TMC pulled off a hat-trick, winning 213 seats out of 294 as against the BJP’s 77. The Left Front, Congress and ISF fought the elections together in an alliance, with the Left and Congress failing to open their account and the ISF winning just one seat.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the TMC bagged 22 seats out of 42 as against the BJP’s 18. The Left and the Congress had then contested the elections separately, with the former drawing a blank and the latter winning two seats.
On Monday, which marked the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, TMC supremo and Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee led an all-faith “Sanhati (harmony) rally” in Kolkata, from where she not only slammed the BJP for “politicising religion” but also hit out at her INDIA partners.
Mamata accused the CPI(M) of “controlling” the INDIA bloc’s meetings, even as she targeted the Congress for not listening to her over seat-sharing for the polls.
“I suggested the name INDIA. But I am sad to say that when I attend the INDIA meetings I see CPI(M) controlling it. I cannot agree with those with whom I fought for 34 years,” Mamata said. “I have been told what they (INDIA allies) think they will do. I tell them not to help the BJP. If you do so, the people of India will not pardon you. If I can have the guts to take on BJP, why can’t you?”
The INDIA allies have run into a seat-sharing hurdle in Bengal, with the TMC having declined to engage in talks with the Congress’s national alliance committee over the issue while offering the party just two of its sitting seats – Berhampore and Malda Dakshin.
State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also the party MP from Berhampore, has rejected the TMC’s offer, saying the grand old party had won those seats on its own in 2019 fighting against the TMC and the BJP, and that the Congress does not need any “grace or generosity” from Mamata to win them again.
Rahul’s Yatra will enter Bengal through Falakata in Alipurduar district on January 25, where it will stay on January 26 and 27. Subsequently, it will head to Chopra in North Dinajpur on its way to Malda over the next few days.
Adhir is said to be keen that Rahul’s Yatra also passes throughMurshidabad district, which is his home turf."

Allowing the request, a bench of Justices B R Gavai, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta adjourned the hearing till January 30.
Amit Chakraborty and Prabir Purkayastha, the founder and editor-in-chief of the news portal, were arrested in October last year in a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA over alleged Chinese funding to promote anti-national propaganda.
“Let him withdraw if he wants to withdraw,” Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, appearing for the Delhi Police said, adding the case of NewsClick founder and editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha will have to be heard by the court.
Earlier this month, Chakraborty moved an application before the trial court, seeking permission to turn approver in the case and expressed willingness to disclose information to Delhi Police. The court allowed the request and also granted him a pardon in the matter.
Chakraborty and Purkayastha had approached the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court decision upholding their arrest. The Delhi HC had on October 13, 2023, dismissed their plea challenging their arrest and the subsequent police remand order in a case lodged against them under the anti-terror law for allegedly receiving Chinese funding.
The High Court rejected their contention that they should have been provided the grounds of arrest when apprehended by police and said the UAPA does not mandate furnishing written grounds and only speaks of the accused being “informed” about the reasons for arrest. The court said it would be “advisable” that the police henceforth provide the grounds of arrest in writing to an accused after redacting “sensitive material”."

Police said the incident took place at 3.45 am. The driver could not get out of the Toyota Corolla Altis and was burnt to death, they said.
The victim, Sahit Modem, was a resident of Sector 75 and worked with his father in HR consulting. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Noida) Hridesh Katheriya said the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.
“A passerby called the emergency helpline number and informed that a Toyota Carolla car had hit the divider near the Sector 59 Metro station U-turn. As soon as we received the information, personnel from the Phase 3 police station and fire service department were immediately rushed to the spot and they doused the blaze. Prima facie, it seems that the car collided with the divider and went over it,” said Katheriya.
The officer further said the man was taken out of the car and rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. Police contacted his family through the vehicle number as there was no other way to identify him and his kin.
The ADCP added that the deceased was returning from Ghaziabad after meeting a friend when the incident took place.
Police said that after completing legal formalities, the body was handed over to the family."
Q6BXN3ZWPC_MBVBH3NI6CC0XEF,"SAU an international organisation, has privileges and immunity: Delhi HC",Malavika Prasad,"Updated: January 25, 2024 10:04 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/sau-an-international-organisation-has-privileges-and-immunity-delhi-hc-9126612/,"The Delhi High Court has observed that the South Asian University (SAU) has the status of an “international organisation” and enjoys the “privilege and the immunity” from being subjected to the writ jurisdiction conferred to the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
The observations came while the court was hearing pleas moved by SAU’s associate professors, who were issued show cause notices on December 30, 2022, over their alleged involvement in a student protest for redressal of their grievances. The HC has said the pleas are not maintainable.
After the notices were issued, SAU formed a fact-finding committee and the petitioners were provided an opportunity to participate in its proceedings. The order notes that the petitioners “allegedly” did not cooperate with the committee when they were provided an opportunity to appear before it. Submitting its report on May 29, 2023, the committee concluded that the petitioners had “prima facie acted in a manner which can be construed as a violation” of the rules, regulations, and bylaws, including, but not limited to, the Code of Conduct of the university. On June 16, 2023, SAU’s Acting President suspended the petitioners; the latter moved the HC against this.
A single-judge bench of Justice Chandra Dhari Singh, its its order on Wednesday, opined that the privileges granted by the Ministry of External Affairs, through its January 15, 2009, notification, extend to SAU where the university is “exempted from getting sued by the employees in a court of law established in India”.
“The petitioners have an effective remedy for redressal of their dispute against the respondent University and hence, the question of whether the respondent University acted in bona fide can only be answered by the Arbitral Tribunal when the issue is heard on merits,” it said.
Justice Singh further observed that the pleas were not maintainable as SAU enjoys the “status of an international organisation having privileges and immunities” which is evident from the “headquarters agreement signed by the member countries of SAARC, the SAU Act enacted by the Parliament of India, and the notification issued by the MEA” in 2009. “Therefore, the present petition, being non-maintainable, is liable to be dismissed… petitioners are advised to approach the appropriate forum i.e. the Arbitral Tribunal for adjudication of the dispute on merits,” the HC said.
The HC observed that as per material on record, the contract signed between the parties provides for referral of a dispute to an “Arbitral Tribunal” which deals with disputes arising out of an employment agreement. It further perused the “appointment letters” issued to the petitioners and noted that it clarified the position wherein “the employment agreement specifically mentions the adjudication of the issue by an Arbitral Tribunal”.
Justice Singh said the petitioners had “agreed to the terms while joining the respondent University and… signed the employment agreement”. The court said that the factual matrix “clearly establishes that the petitioners chose not to avail a remedy provided to them and approached” the HC, “bypassing rules and procedures prescribed by the laws governing” SAU, which were “duly agreed” by them when they joined.
The HC further referred to “the SC’s 2023 decision in ‘St. Mary’s Education Society v. Rajendra Prasad Bhargava’ and observed that the decision clarifies that “even if an educational institution is assumed to be performing a public duty, any action complained of must have a direct connection with the discharge of that a public duty”.
“Furthermore, the Hon’ble Court also clarified that the availability of the extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Article 226 for a prerogative writ is contingent upon the existence of a public law action, where individual wrongs or breaches of mutual contracts without a public element cannot be rectified through a writ petition. Therefore, this Court is bound to hold that the employment matters remain within the realm of an ordinary contract of service and are not amenable to challenge under Article 226 of the Constitution,” Justice Singh underscored.
It also said that while it was true that the land on which SAU was established was provided by the Union Government and it also committed to providing funds for the development of infrastructure, “it does not enjoy a dominant position where it can be said that the functioning is controlled by the Government in any manner”. It said even though SAU has been created “out of an Act of Parliament”, it is “not in control” of the Government of India in any manner; rather the role of the Government is “limited to facilitation of establishment” of SAU. It said SAU’s character is of an “international institution and it is not functionally, administratively or financially controlled by the Government of India”, and hence SAU is not ‘State’ under  Article 12 of the Constitution of India."
Q7C1DHGLR9_49D9KXTM7NX2ADX,"With Imran Khan clone rally and Modi deepfakes, AI has entered the election race",_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 20:48 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/deepfake-online-disinformation-campaigns-misinformation-cool-dude-frank-9124464/,"Somewhere in the depths of X (formerly Twitter), an American engineer turned children’s novelist in Austin, Texas called “cool dude frank” has an “important political message”. Unexpectedly, it is delivered in fluent Hindi.
Scroll down the thread and you will find that this is a translated video made using HeyGen — an AI-powered video generator that not only translates the spoken language but perfectly matches the voice and lip movements, making it impossible to imagine that “cool dude frank” doesn’t speak Hindi at all.
Examples like this are no longer experiments but viral content reshaping the future of politics — from Prime Minister Modi’s digitally rendered voice being used to serenade us in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada to The Indian Deepfaker company using voice cloning to deliver “personalised messages” from politicians to on-the-ground party workers for elections in Rajasthan.
Seventy-six countries will head to the polls in 2024, with an estimated four billion people voting in a record-breaking number of presidential, legislative, and local elections around the world. India is on the frontline with the world’s largest single day of voting. However, this grand march to the ballot box doesn’t necessarily imply a triumph of democracy.
While generative AI supercharges online disinformation campaigns to manipulate and micro-target voters, civil society worldwide is increasingly cornered and crowded out. In the face of political and technological forces trying to dehumanise and monetise our identities, we need a return to people-powered grassroots movement building so we can create a more resilient civic infrastructure.
Democracy feels like a lofty ambition when the truth is easier to distort than ever before. The generative AI boom has made the production and distribution of misleading fake content cheaper, faster, and most importantly, hyper-realistic. From Pakistan’s Imran Khan deploying an AI clone from prison for a “virtual rally” to artists experimenting with an AI-generated Danish political party called The Synthetic Party vying for a seat in parliament, democracy is witnessing its AI-era in full force. Today, it is easier to make fake reality. But it is also easier to dismiss reality altogether.
Meanwhile, civil society has been forced or incentivised to refrain from pursuing political questions about power imbalances. The silencing of civic space is intentional and targeted. This silencing will cost us if we, as citizens, forget that we have more power than just our vote. We are citizens and not clients of our democracies. We build power by coming and acting together. The year of elections gives us an opportunity to remember that democracy is a verb — something that needs collective doing and redoing.
With the growth of funded organisations replacing people’s movements or community-based collectives, civil society organisations are implementing programmes instead of mobilising people’s power to challenge systems.
The antidote to AI-powered elections indeed includes better platform safety and government regulation. But the true and long-lasting inoculation will come from our capacity for civic association to represent our voices, needs and experiences.
Social media has created a platform for us to aggregate our communities to protest or distribute our opinion to the masses, but it has yet to create the conditions for relational community building and leadership. In 2008, Obama for America organised 2.2 million volunteers into a grassroots army. Scholars have studied how Barack Obama’s field campaigns were not made of the usual collection of staffers, consultants, and paid canvassers.
Instead, the campaign’s strength came from unpaid local citizens who organised their own neighbourhoods for years ahead of Election Day. This is different from simply mobilising in big numbers because relationship building inherent in this community organizing model offers the crucial context of articulating and acting on our shared values especially when our identities, cultures, and religions are pitted against each other.
India has its own rich tradition of building power for the most vulnerable. Contemporary models like CORO India, SEWA, and Commutiny Youth Collective are just a few of many community-based organisations driving justice. We need to create, join, and fund more people-powered models of civic action.
Since the 2019 general election, India has added approximately 250 million new internet users. Electoral threats may seem concentrated online, but the ammunition to fight them lies in the vibrancy of our own collective power.

On Thursday, Ambedkar responded to an invite by Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole to join seat-sharing talks with the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance by questioning Patole’s authority on the matter.
The MVA had requested Ambedkar to send a representative to the talks, in n a letter signed jointly by Jayant Patil of the NCP (Sharad Pawar), Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena (UBT) and Patole.
Speaking to The Indian Express on his refusal to attend, Ambedkar said: “We have already conveyed our reasons (for not attending the meeting) to the Congress. Firstly, we received the invitation at 1 pm for the 3 pm meeting.” Accusing the Congress of creating “confusion”, the VBA chief added: “AICC leaders said they will talk to us when the elections are announced. When the central leadership has taken a stand, there is no reason for state Congress president Nana Patole to decide on the VBA. Does he really have the power to decide (whether or not to include VBA in the alliance)?”
Ambedkar also said that his political stand has been consistent and his party would join any party or coalition which is “sincere” in its fight against the RSS and BJP. “Elections or not, the VBA has been fighting the RSS and BJP. Our ideology remains uncompromised. The problem is with the Congress, whose central and state leaders make different statements leading to confusion,” he said, adding that the VBA would join the INDIA bloc or MVA provided it was treated as an equal.
Ambedkar’s stand appears to stem from the fact that the Congress, Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar NCP did not consider his outfit during the earlier INDIA bloc meetings in Delhi and Mumbai.
A couple of months ago, the VBA chief had exhorted the MVA to take quick decisions on alliance partners and seat-sharing formula. He also suggested that he, along with the MVA parties, divide the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, leaving 12 for each.
Ambedkar indicated as much while speaking to The Indian Express, saying that while “everybody wants to fight the BJP, no one did anything about the alliance or seat-sharing”. “Hence, I suggested that the Congress, Sena (UBT), NCP (Sharad Pawar) and VBA contest 12 seats each. It is not a rigid formula and there is scope for some give and take.”
However, the MVA parties are unlikely to agree to this formula given that the VBA currently has no representation in either the Assembly or the Lok Sabha, though its sizable vote share among the Dalits and OBCs in parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and Western Maharashtra makes it a valuable partner.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha and subsequent Assembly polls, VBA candidates are believed to have dented the chances of a significant number of Congress-NCP nominees. In 9 Lok Sabha seats, VBA candidates had secured between 50,000 and 1.7 lakh votes, seen at the expense of the Congress-NCP, while in the Assembly elections, the outfit had got 4.58% of the votes, which is estimated to have cost 32 seats for the then alliance.
The MVA is keen on getting the VBA on board keeping this in mind and its aim of preventing the split of “secular votes”, the idea behind the INDIA bloc as well, especially at a time when there is intense polarisation between the Marathas and the OBCs over the quota issue.
“The 2024 elections are a much bigger battle and are not about a single party or front. Our fight is against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. We have to save democracy and want the VBA to join the MVA,” Patole said.
Patil echoed Patole’s view and said the MVA would be happy to have the VBA on board as it is fighting to save the Constitution and democracy.
Incidentally, the VBA is already a partner of the Shiv Sena (UBT) since 2022. The alliance, often referred to as the Shivshakti-Bhimshkati, was sealed during an event in Mumbai where both Uddhav Thackeray and Ambedkar pledged to follow in the footsteps of their grandfathers. Uddhav’s grandfather Prabodhankar Thackeray and B R Ambedkar had worked together in the early 1950s against social evils such as casteism, dowry, etc and were associated with the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, which fought for statehood for Maharashtra.
Ambedkar said the VBA’s alliance with Uddhav was still intact. “We will wait and see how the situation evolves with the MVA,” he added.
In his career spanning over four decades, Prakash Ambedkar (69) has pursued politics on his terms and conditions, earning the tag of being an “unpredictable politician”. He forayed into politics in the 1980s with the Republican Party of India (RPI). Following the RPI’s disintegration into several splinter units, he floated the Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh in 1994 with an eye on the Dalit and OBC voters.
To expand his party’s base beyond caste and community lines while keeping his Dalit, OBC and Muslim base intact, Ambedkar then renamed his party as the VBA ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, which he fought in alliance with the AIMIM.
Since then, the alliance has fallen apart.
Now, as the push for Maratha quota gets more aggressive under activist Manoj Jarange-Patil, Ambedkar is looking to champion the rights of the OBCs, which constitute around 52% of the state’s population. Under the banner of the OBC Mahasangh, a conglomeration of OBC groups, the VBA chief is exhorting OBCs to fight for their rights against mainstream political parties.
“There are 169 Maratha families which control the economics and politics of the state. They feel threatened by the political empowerment of the OBCs and use poor Marathas to serve their own interests. We have to fight them,” Ambedkar said at a public rally in Dharashiv (formerly Osmanabad) on Wednesday.
He also warned voters about the “divisive politics” of the BJP, which he said was detrimental for democracy. “It will have huge ramifications on Dalits, OBCs and tribals,” he added."

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge is likely to write to Union Home Minister Amit Shah drawing his attention to the incident and flagging the “sad state” of law and order situation in the state.
An MLA who was part of the January 24 meeting called by Arambai Tenggol confirmed that three MLAs – two of the BJP and Congress state president K Meghachandra – were assaulted by members of the group during the course of the meeting.
On Thursday, Congress communications in-charge Jairam Ramesh tweeted about the assault, saying: “The Indian National Congress strongly condemns the brutal physical assault on Manipur PCC President K. Meghachandra , in a meeting of all-party MLAs/MPs/Ministers, under full security protection of state and central forces, at Kangla in Imphal yesterday. The PM, however, continues with his eloquent silence on the enormous tragedy that has overtaken Manipur,” he had written on X.
As per the MLA present at the meeting, the BJP legislators who were assaulted were Paonam Brojen Singh and Khwairakpam Raghumani Singh.
Meghachandra reportedly was beaten up for holding the BJP-run state government responsible for the situation in the state.
The “meeting” in which the assault had taken place was the result of a “summons” issued to all Meitei MLAs and MPs by the Arambai Tenggol. All the MLAs and MPs of the community – including Union Minister of State for External Affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh and former Congress chief minister Okrom Ibobi Singh – attended it, amidst heavy fortification of Imphal’s historic Kangla Fort, with massive security development both inside and at all the gates of the complex.
Incidentally, a special team of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs was present in Manipur for talks at the time.
While CM N Biren Singh was not present at the meeting, his signature was on the document of demands released at the meeting.
During his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra through Manipur recently, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi repeatedly attacked the Narendra Modi government’s handling of the crisis in the state, particularly the Prime Minister’s failure to visit Manipur since May, when violence began in the state.
A radical outfit that has come into prominence in the nine months of the Meitei-Kuki conflict in Manipur, the Arambai Tenggol is accused of several incidents of violence."

“Why do you have to be so touchy?” Justice Gavai asked the UP counsel.
Justice Mehta further said that “it is a matter of interpretation. Plain and simple” and asked “how is it an offence?”
Though the state pointed out that copies of the holy book were burnt following Maurya’s comments, Justice Mehta said “he cannot be held responsible for that. It’s a line of thought”.
The high court had rejected his contention that the case was politically motivated and held that it prima facie appeared he incited people to start a rebellion."
QH8JIHH766_IAHY0A3C02IOAW3,PM Modi set to address tribal national convention in Vadodara next month,_,"January 25, 2024 03:42 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/pm-modi-set-to-address-tribal-national-convention-in-vadodara-next-month-9126404/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address the BJP’s national convention for tribal leaders to be held between February 15 and February 20.
BJP National General Secretary Radhamohandas Agarwal Wednesday arrived in Vadodara to oversee the preparations for the mega event. PM Modi-led central government had set a three-year deadline to “screen a seven crore tribal population” for sickle cell anemia, said Agarwal.
Accompanied by Gujarat BJP vice-president Gordhan Zadafiya and Lok Sabha MPs Ranjan Bhatt of Vadodara and Geeta Rathwa of Chhota Udepur, Agarwal visited the ground near the Panjrapole to oversee the preparations for the tribal convention. “PM Modi will address a tribal convention of the BJP in Vadodara, which is one of the two conventions to be held in the country. This one is for Western India, which will see participation from the party tribal leaders from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Goa as well as the states of South India. The number of attendees is high. So we have zeroed in on the Vadodara Panjrapole ground,” Zadafiya said.
Speaking at the media interaction, Agarwal said that PM Modi had “chosen” to address the Vadodara convention due to “his roots” in Gujarat.  “This is a convention for party leaders from the tribal community. We are holding two conventions — one in Ranchi in Jharkhand and one in Vadodara for the Western and Southern zones. Only the organisational-level tribal leaders of the BJP will be invited to participate in the convention… Today, the BJP’s reach among the tribal communities is so deep that we cannot call all tribal workers or it will become unmanageable…PM Modi has gone to UP (as an MP) from Gujarat but he has Gujarat in his heart; we feel jealous… When we asked him which convocation will you address, he chose Vadodara,” he said.
Agarwal said that it was due to PM Modi’s “relentless efforts” that tribals in the country had “seen development in the ten years of the NDA government”. “What PM Modi has done for tribals in ten years, no one did in the last 65 years… Right from education to health to empowerment of tribal women, Modiji has personally developed the beneficiary schemes… Under the NDA-ruled government, the number of Eklavya schools has gone up from 166 ten years ago towards the goal of making 700 Eklavya schools,” Agarwal said.
Agarwal also said that the central government had begun a campaign to tackle sickle cell anemia among tribals– a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in the beta-globin genes that result in faulty red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body.
Until Modi took over as PM, he said, no one paid attention to sickle cell anemia. “I am a pediatrician, and I know several tribal children died due to deficiency of blood and it was not due to nutrition deficiencies but due to inherited disorders… In July 2023, PM Modi started a campaign to screen tribal populations under 40 years of age, who have chromosomes of sickle cell anemia in order to tackle this disease… The goal is that we will treat the deficiency medically. The announcement was made in July 2023 and today, at the end of January, I am proud to share that out of the 7 crore tribal population, we have screened 58 lakh. We will achieve the target within three years to deal with sickle cell anemia,” he said."
QN6ZGOE4K6_9WRNB9ANCHUR515,"India-UK FTA: Final push for deal as window closing fast, with poll MCC a line-in-the-sand",Ravi Dutta Mishra,"Updated: January 25, 2024 16:22 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-uk-fta-final-push-for-deal-as-window-closing-fast-9127471/,"Top government officials from both India and the UK are making a final push to close pending issues in a bid to seal a free trade agreement (FTA) that has been in the works for the last two years, and where the widow is seen as closing really fast. The model code of conduct (MCC), likely to be implemented next month, is being viewed as a final cutoff date, with hectic last-minute parleys being escalated to the highest level in the Indian government across ministries including commerce, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs to thrash out a final consensus, a government official said.
The FTA with the UK would be the first full fledged deal with a western country that would see deeper economic integration with a major global service sector leader. However, the window to sign the deal is fast closing with elections in both the countries this year. While the general election in the UK is expected in December this year, India’s general elections are likely to take place between April and May this year.
The UK FTA is crucial as it will serve as a template for trade deals with larger western trade partners such as the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Economic integration with the western countries through FTA assumes significance as the global supply chain is undergoing a reset after covid-19 and multinational companies globally are adopting a China plus one policy. Multilateral trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) are also being negotiated in a bid to shift away from dependence on China.
“For us (India) MCC is the cutoff. Our UK counterpart understands this and that is the reason their officials are here and meetings are ongoing with the highest level of the government across ministries including commerce ministry, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs,” the official said.
A delegation from the UK arrived in India on January 22.
“All chapters are closed but a handful of articles in a few chapters are remaining. It is a small basket now. Over 90 per cent of the deal has been closed. There have been several issues and chapters closed in the last three months,” the official added.
The MCC is a code containing general precepts for model behaviour during elections conducted by Election Commission (EC). It has an entire chapter on what the party in power can and cannot do once elections are announced which forbids use of official machinery and personnel for the political gains of the party in power.
Hence, the spirit of MCC also requires the bureaucracy or any public servant to not engage or appear to engage in an activity that could work to the advantage of the party in power. Notably, the MCC is only a moral code and lacks any statutory backing, the EC, at best, can censure, advise or pull up the person found violating it.
With the date for MCC fast approaching, India is looking to close two other FTAs including the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Free Trade Association with the four nation bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
However, the comprehensive trade deal with Australia is likely to be taken up after the general elections as Australian negotiators are seeking access into India’s agricultural market, which is a sensitive sector for India.
While the UK has asked India to reduce duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. The final deal could see India lower duty to a greater extent as India is a high tariff country. The average tariff on goods imported from India into the UK is 4.2% but the average tariff in India on goods imported from the UK is 14.6%
Negotiations on cars and whisky have been contentious as Indian industry has been seeking greater access into the UK market too. Indian whisky manufacturers have said that the UK should ease its three year maturation rule, which acts as a barrier for Indian whisky brands seeking entry into the UK, and is seeking duty concessions in the auto sector, particularly in the EV segment.
India’s labour-intensive sectors are expected to see gains from the India-UK FTA, especially the textile sector. Indian textile exports face tariffs as high as 10% in the UK and a trade deal could put India on par with competition such as Bangladesh (which get LDC benefits), and revive textile exports. Meanwhile a greater integration in the services sector with the UK could help greater job creation in the fast growing industry.
India and the UK are also looking to sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) alongside the FTA that could improve UK’s investments into India. To resolve investor-state disputes under the new BIT faster, India is expected to move away from its 2016 model BIT approach that stressed on exhaustion of local remedies.
In FY2023, India’s merchandise exports to the UK were valued at $11.41 billion while imports stood at $8.96 billion."

Chavan will remain under ED custody till Thursday.
The ED arrested Chavan on Wednesday, alleging he was linked to the firms that were given work orders to provide khichdi to migrant workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. The agency claimed Chavan received Rs 1.25 crore in his personal accounts from the firms for contracts that were to be given to them and another Rs 10 lakh to his partnership firm, in lieu of his alleged proximity with a “senior political leader”. When questioned earlier, Chavan had said he received salary and personal loan from the firms.
The ED claimed that during Chavan’s questioning in the last five days, it was revealed his appointment letters with the firms were “forged/backdated” to justify the “irrational hike” in his salary. The letters were dated April 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020, the ED remand plea said.
“Investigation under ED custody further revealed that the funds amounting to Rs 1.35 crore so admittedly received by accused Mr Suraj Chavan from Force One Multi Services were utilised in purchase of immovable residential flat, agricultural land, investment in dairy business, payment of personal tax liabilities and other personal expenses,” the ED said. It alleged that Chavan “admitted” to having presented these documents to project himself as an employee of Force One Multi Services.
It said additional documents were sought from the police and examination of key personnel of the firms was underway to confront Chavan as he is one of the key persons. The probe agency sought another seven days for Chavan to remain in its custody for interrogation. A special court allowed ED to keep Chavan in the agency’s custody till January 25.
Meanwhile, Chavan approached the Bombay High Court, challenging the January 18 order passed by the special PMLA court, remanding him to four days ED custody and termed it as “illegal” and was passed without following due process of law. The plea was listed before a single-judge bench of Prakash D Naik on Monday, who granted time to Chavan to amend the plea, with Monday’s remand order extending his ED custody till January 25. The HC will hear Chavan’s plea on January 29. Representing Chavan, advocate Dileep Sartape argued that the grounds of arrest supplied to the accused were not in compliance with the provisions of the PMLA.
Chavan argued that while he was not named an accused in the scheduled offence registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) Mumbai in September 2023, the ED added him as an accused, therefore his subsequent remand with the agency was illegal."

The AIIO claims to represent half-a-million imams across 3 lakh mosques in India. It also claims to be the “largest Muslim organisation in India”. Ilyasi, meanwhile, is no stranger to meetings with members of the ruling dispensation. He has interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on several occasions, after their first meeting in 2018, and also met Home Minister Amit Shah. Ilyasi has also had meetings with spiritual leaders such as Jagadish Vasudev (Sadhguru) and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, among others.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, meanwhile, said the consecration of the idol of Ram Lalla at the magnificent Ram temple marks the advent of a new era and called upon people to build the foundation of a strong, grand and divine India of the next 1,000 years.
Addressing a gathering after the consecration ceremony, Modi said this occasion is not of mere triumph but of humility. The Ram Temple will be witness to the dawn of a prosperous and developed India, he said. “Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,” Modi said in his 36-minute-long speech.
The prime minister took part in the consecration ceremony inside the sanctum sanctorum of the grand Ram temple, made possible by a historic Supreme Court judgment in 2019 on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. Modi also offered prayers at Kuber Tila and showered flower petals on the construction workers of the Ram Temple.
The temple, built in the traditional Nagara style of architecture, spans 380 feet in length (east-west), 250 feet in width and 161 feet in height. It is supported by 392 pillars and has 44 doors."

On Tuesday, even as jail authorities and the district police prepared for the release of Chaitar Vasava from the Rajpipla sub-jail, where he has been lodged in judicial custody since December 18, Chaitar surprised everyone by refusing to execute the bail order. The MLA was arrested and sent to remand on December 14.
“Once a person is in judicial custody, it means that he is in the custody of the court. Even though the court has granted the bail, the warrant for the release is sent to the jail authorities only after the conditions of the bail are met with and the surety is executed. So, it is a legal process that has to be followed… Chaitar has decided to execute the bail conditions only when his wife, Shakuntala, and others are granted bail. It is his emotional decision,” Chaitar’s advocate SK Joshi told The Indian Express.
Earlier on Tuesday, the district police barricaded the roads leading to the Rajpipla sub-jail as a stream of supporters and mediapersons arrived at the jail in anticipation of Chaitar’s release. The 12-page bail order of the Narmada Sessions Judge NR Joshi Monday had set 13 bail conditions, including the MLA’s consent to the “trial proceeding in his absence” in the Narmada court. Apart from asking Chaitar Vasava to furnish a bond of Rs 1 lakh as well as two guarantors to present a surety of Rs 1 lakh each, Chaitar has been directed to “not enter the Narmada district jurisdiction till the end of the trial” or reside at an alternate residence in Narmada district or Bharuch, among other conditions.
“He has to agree to all the conditions to be able to be granted bail, so there is no choice per se, but we will explore other legal aspects available in this matter, later,” Joshi added.
Sources close to Chaitar added that the tribal leader had made up his mind to contest from the Bharuch Lok Sabha constituency in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls."

QZNW9FVG19_4P58ULWYE6J668P,To detect gastrointestinal cancer: First ever CAD EYE AI system in Pune installed at Ruby Clinic,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 21:26 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/gastrointestinal-cancer-cad-eye-ai-system-pune-ruby-clinic-9124377/,"Ruby Hall Clinic, in collaboration with FUJIFILM India, announced the installation of its first-ever, state-of-the-art CAD EYE Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, a ground-breaking technology designed to enhance the early detection of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. This collaboration pioneered by Dr. Nitin Pai, Director of Gastroenterology and GI Endoscopy at Ruby Hall Clinic and Pune GI Private Limited, marks a significant milestone in Pune’s healthcare landscape.
The introduction of the CAD EYE AI system in Pune addresses a pressing concern in the region. Pune, akin to several parts of India, confronts a rising threat, with gastric cancer, ranking as the fifth most prevalent cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally in 2020, as per a Lancet study. The burden is exacerbated by inadequate cancer treatment infrastructure and limited systematic studies in India.
Stomach cancer incidence has steadily risen in the past decade, with India exhibiting a comparatively higher rate than many Western countries. Consequently, early detection becomes a crucial tool in combating these life-threatening diseases, and with the help of CAD EYE AI, the burden of GI cancer in India can be reduced to a greater extent, Dr Pai told media persons on Tuesday. Dr Pai also pointed out that this was a huge milestone to install the first-ever Artificial Intelligence system CAD EYE in Pune.
The CAD EYE system introduced in Pune employs advanced AI algorithms and real-world data to assist in the identification and characterization of suspected lesions during colonoscopies. Additionally, it excels in detecting early gastric flat lesions in gastrointestinal endoscopy, addressing a critical need in a region burdened by increased occurrence rates of esophageal, stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers. By boosting diagnostic accuracy and improving adenoma detection rates, CAD EYE enables timely intervention and increases the chances of successful treatment.
Dr. Purvez Grant, Chairman and Managing Trustee of Ruby Hall Clinic said this cutting-edge technology provides renewed hope in the fight against GI cancers. Behram Khodaiji, Group CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic, added “The potential of AI-enabled endoscopy in preventing serious and life-threatening conditions like stomach and colon cancer by screening for them at the precancerous stage is a crucial juncture in Pune.”"

In one incident, officials from the Vice and Virtue Ministry advised a woman to get married if she wanted to keep her job at a healthcare facility, saying it was inappropriate for an unwed woman to work.
The Taliban have barred women from most areas of public life and stopped girls from going to school beyond the sixth grade as part of harsh measures they imposed after taking power in 2021, despite initially promising more moderate rule.
They have also shut down beauty parlours and started enforcing a dress code, arresting women who don’t comply with their interpretation of hijab, or Islamic headscarf. In May 2022, the Taliban issued a decree calling for women to only show their eyes and recommending they wear the head-to-toe burqa, similar to restrictions during the Taliban’s previous rule between 1996 and 2001.
In its latest quarterly report, covering October to December last year, the UN mission in Afghanistan said the Taliban are cracking down on Afghan women who are single or don’t have a male guardian, or mahram, accompanying them. There are no official laws about male guardianship in Afghanistan, but the Taliban have said women cannot move around or travel a certain distance without a man who is related to her by blood or marriage.
Three female health care workers were detained last October because they were going to work without a mahram. They were released after their families signed a written guarantee that they would not repeat the act, the report said. In Paktia province, the Vice and Virtue Ministry has stopped women without mahrams from accessing health facilities since December. It visits health facilities in the province to ensure compliance.
The ministry, which serves as the Taliban’s morality police, is also enforcing hijab and mahram requirements when women visit public places, offices and education institutes through checkpoints and inspections.
In December, in Kandahar province, ministry officials visited a bus terminal to ensure women were not travelling long distances without mahrams and instructed bus drivers not to permit women to board without one, said the UN.

R4SF08CNMO_XZSBQK4V2ZR1IA5,Ram Mandir inauguration: AAP MLA funds temple-cum-community,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 09:04 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ram-mandir-inauguration-aap-mla-funds-temple-cum-community-9122640/,"On the day of the Ram Temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, AAP MLA Hemant Khava on Monday attended a ground-breaking ceremony of a Ram temple and a community hall that will come up in his constituency of Jamjodhpur in Jamnagar district.
Khava took to social media to announce that he has allocated money for the “Ram Mandir” at Ambardi Jam village square in Jamjodhpur from his MLA local area development (LAD) fund.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Khava said that a Ram temple has existed at the village square for the last 50 years. “I have allocated Rs 4 lakh from my MLA AD fund for the work. We can allocate up to Rs 5 lakh per work. There already exists a Ram temple at the village square but there was a demand from villagers to have a community hall in the temple.”
“A new temple-cum-community hall will be built. As the government grant cannot be used to build temples, it can be used to build village community halls, so this will come under the expense head of a ‘community hall’. Usually in villages, the village square has an idol of Lord Ram and the enclosure around it is used as a community hall. This is not a first, I have earlier, too, allocated money from my funds for community halls,” he added.
The construction will be carried out over an area of 60 feet by 20 feet, Khava said. Asked why the announcement of the allocation was made on Monday, Khava said, “I did not think much about the date but it is a significant day today, with such a big temple coming up (at Ayodhya). Many are also having planned births and today has in a way become a landmark date.”
“Villagers, too, had expectations and thus, this was fixed for today,” he added. In Botad, AAP MLA Umesh Makwana performed a yagna of Lord Hanuman and termed Monday’s Ayodhya temple celebrations as “one like Diwali celebrations”. In Rajkot, meanwhile, AAP leaders and workers set up a pandal, installed an idol of Lord Ram, performed puja and distributed prasad among commuters.
The prasad distribution marked the culmination of AAP’s three-day long celebrations in connection to the Ayodhya temple, which began on Saturday with recitation of Sundarkand
– one the chapters in Ramayana – followed by recitation of Ram Dhun on Sunday. “While the BJP has turned the temple inauguration in Ayodhya into a political event, it is not that only those who go to Ayodhya are devotees of Lord Ram. At the same time, we are happy that Ramlalla who was so far sitting in a tent has now got a temple, hence an occasion to celebrate,” Lokhil told The Indian Express.
Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia went to a temple in his hometown of Porbandar on the occasion of Ram temple inauguration. Modhwadia, a sitting MLA from Porbandar, participated in a yagna at the Rokadiya Hanuman temple. He also went to Balaji Hanuman temple for darshan."
R5PXKLCVE9_ZVKCDE6ZY64EAPF,Federal court says Alabama can carry out first nitrogen gas execution; Supreme Court appeal expected,_,"January 25, 2024 08:35 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/federal-court-alabama-first-nitrogen-gas-execution-supreme-court-9126632/,"Alabama will be allowed to put an inmate to death with nitrogen gas, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday, refusing to block what would be the nation’s first execution by a new method since 1982. A divided panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Kenneth Eugene Smith’s request for an injunction to stop his execution by nitrogen hypoxia Thursday night.
Smith’s lawyers, who have argued the state is trying to make him the test subject for an experimental execution method, are expected to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in a final bid to halt the scheduled execution. The judges said in a 3-2 decision there is “no doubt that death by nitrogen hypoxia is both new and novel” but that Smith had failed to establish how it would violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
Circuit Judge Jill A. Pryor dissented from the decision, saying there are, “real doubts” about the protocol and what Smith will experience. “He will die. The cost, I fear, will be Mr. Smith’s human dignity, and ours,” Pryor wrote in a dissent. Robert Grass, an attorney for Smith, declined to comment Wednesday night.
Smith, 58, is one of two men convicted in the murder-for-hire slaying of a preacher’s wife in 1988 that rocked a small north Alabama community. Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall praised the decision to let the execution proceed.
“Two courts have now rejected Smith’s claims,” Marshall said. “I remain confident that the Supreme Court will come down on the side of justice, and that Smith’s execution will be carried out tomorrow.” The new execution method involves putting a respirator-type face mask over the nose and mouth to replace breathable air with nitrogen, causing death from lack of oxygen.
The state predicted in court filings that the gas will cause an inmate to lose consciousness within seconds and cause death within minutes. Critics of the untested method say the state can’t predict what will happen and what Smith will feel after the warden switches on the gas. His attorneys said he is at risk for a prolonged suffering and choking to death on his own vomit.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute death row inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, have become difficult to find. Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, but no state has attempted to use it so far.
If carried out, it will be the first time a new execution method has been used since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. The appeals court ruling comes after oral arguments in which the Alabama attorney general’s office and Smith’s lawyer presented diverging accounts of the humaneness and risks execution by nitrogen hypoxia. Smith’s attorneys said it is riddled with unknowns and potential problems in violation of a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
“This is the first time this will ever be attempted. There is no data on exactly what’s going to happen and how this will go forward,” attorney Robert Grass told the court. The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable euthanasia method for most mammals because the experience of oxygen deprivation “is distressing.”
And experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council cautioned that they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture. Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour had urged the judges to let the execution proceed, saying, “Alabama has adopted the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.”
Alabama previously tried to execute Smith by lethal injection in 2022 but called it off before the drugs were administered because authorities were unable to connect the two intravenous lines to his veins. Smith’s attorneys said he was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Smith’s request for a stay, rejecting his argument that it would be unconstitutional for the state to attempt a second execution after he survived the first. Sennett, 45, was found dead March 18, 1988, in her home in Colbert County with eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner.
Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr., killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect, according to court documents.
Smith’s initial 1989 conviction was overturned on appeal, but he was retried and convicted again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by a vote of 11-1, but a judge overrode that and sentenced him to death. Alabama no longer lets judges override jury decisions in death penalty cases. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the slaying, was executed in 2010."

“Last but not least, we will facilitate the visa process for any former Indian students who studied in France,” he added.
Macron’s visit to India caps a milestone year for India-France ties — the 25th anniversary of their strategic partnership.
The India-France Strategic Partnership, the first that India signed with any western country, has seen considerable progress in bilateral, regional and international contexts. “The partnership draws strength, trust and consistency from a shared sense of strategic autonomy and sovereignty, a quest for a multi-polar world, and a natural affinity for democratic values and rule of law,” a senior official said.
Defence and security, civil nuclear matters, and space constitute principal pillars of this partnership, which now also includes a strong Indo-Pacific component.
The comprehensive Roadmap between India and France, which was adopted last year in July during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit as Guest of Honour for Bastille Day, was classified under three pillars — Partnership for Security and Sovereignty; Partnership for the Planet; and Partnership for People."

The party demanded “strict legal action” against the CRPF, alleging that the Central force had come with an ulterior motive to fuel tension.
A press release signed by General Secretaries Supriyo Bhattacharya and Vinod Pandey stated: “A protest was also being held by the public and party workers against the biased action of the investigating agencies of the Central Government, in view of which prohibitory orders were imposed under Section 144 by the district administration. Meanwhile, suddenly CRPF personnel (on bus) tried to enter the CM’s residence without any permission or information. They also started quarreling with JMM workers.”
The letter said the entry of CRPF personnel into the prohibited area is a provocative and illegal act.
“If JMM workers had not shown restraint, a violent situation could have arisen… This act was a premeditated conspiracy… (and) should (there) be a fight between them and the protesters, the state government can be accused of failure of the constitutional system and the role of imposing President’s rule can be prepared… This is at the behest of the Central Government, which is an attempt to destabilise the state government and is a cowardly attack on the federal structure,” the release alleged.
A CRPF official, on the condition of anonymity, told The Indian Express: “We were there at the behest of the ED and they had given it to us in writing. There is nothing more to it.”
State BJP spokesman Pratul Shahdeo attacked the government for “not following law and order”. “Despite the fact that there were prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144, JMM protesters had gathered with bows and arrows. Does the CM want to scare the judicial system and central agencies? The current government is trying to create an environment of fear. The CM himself does not believe in law and order as he called ED to his home when he was asked to come to the ED office,” Shahdeo said."

Nesa Prabhu, who works for a Tamil news channel, is currently admitted at a private hospital in a critical condition.
Sources said the assailants, who came in several cars, surrounded Prabhu even as he was on a call with a police officer pleading for help. They added that the assailants attacked him with sharp objects like machetes and knives around 9 pm on Wednesday.
According to the news channel, Prabhu, who sustained multiple injuries to his chest, head, hands and legs, was rushed to a local hospital and later admitted to a private hospital in Coimbatore.
Prabhu had reportedly made several calls to the police station on Wednesday, stressing that a gang of six unidentified men, all in their mid-20s, have been following him over the past few days. He also told the police that there is a threat to his life.
The purported audio conversations between Prabhu and the police officers have now been shared widely on social media.
In the audio clip, a police officer from the Kamanaickenpalayam police station can be heard asking Prabhu for the details of the accused. Prabhu can be heard saying that people in SUVs and motorcycles without number plates are looking for him and asking details about his whereabouts at a nearby shop.
He is also heard saying that the vehicles are parked near his residence for a long time. In the audio clip, Prabhu is also heard informing that he has left his home in his car and is currently near a petrol pump.
When the police officer asks Prabhu the motive behind the incident, he is heard saying that he made a reportage on a Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (TASMAC) liquor shop in the Kamanaickenpalayam area. He is also heard telling the police officer that he was threatened by the relatives of the TASMAC owner that he will face serious consequences for his reportage.
At a point, Prabhu is heard being asked by the police officer to reach the police station to hand over a complaint and while speaking, the journalist is heard saying that the men have reached near him and are about to attack him. The audio clip then abruptly ends.
Meanwhile, attempts to reach the Tiruppur police for a comment in connection to the incident did not succeed.
Several journalists in Chennai and Coimbatore staged a protest condemning the attack and the lack of efforts by the police who did not provide enough security despite being informed about the threat multiple times. The journalists’ union has demanded the police to arrest those behind the incident at the earliest.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin in a statement said he is deeply saddened by the attack on the journalist and added that stringent action would be initiated against the assailants.
He added that the police station inspector, who did not take immediate action on request made by Prabhu to provide him security, has been transferred and put on wait list. The Chief Minister also announced a cash aid of Rs 3 lakh to Prabhu.
Opposition parties, including the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Pattali Makkal Katchi and the Bharatiya Janata Party have also condemned the incident and questioned the state of the law and order in the state.
AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami in a statement said, “Despite knowing about the life threat to the journalist four hours before the attack, the police did not take any prompt action.” He also urged the government to take care of Prabhu’s medical expenses and demanded measures to immediately arrest the assailants."

With an illustrious career spanning six decades in theatre and films, the legendary Nirmal Rishi, 80,  declares that acting is not just a profession but her life’s essence. This year, she is a proud recipient of the prestigious Padma Shri award for her outstanding contribution to the world of Art, solidifying her inseparable connection to Punjab’s vibrant art and culture scene.
“I’ve lost count of the plays I’ve been a part of. Stepping onto the stage has always felt like a cathartic moment,” says Rishi, who earned the 2012 Sangeet Natak Akademi award for her exceptional acting skills. Renowned for her compelling performances in social, religious, and adapted plays, Rishi’s artistic journey began under the mentorship of Punjab’s acclaimed theatre figures, Harpal and Neena Tiwana.
“They discovered my talent in mono acting in Rajasthani during my college days and imparted invaluable lessons about the art through hands-on experience. Workshops led by luminaries like Ebrahim Alkazi and Balwant Gargi provided us with fresh insights into the world of theatre. Those were truly the golden years,” reminisces Rishi. Collaborating on nearly 50 plays with Tiwana, some notable productions include “Kabuli Wala,” “Aate Ki Katori,” “Dug Dugi Payi Wajdi,” “Foolish King,” “Lesson,” “Adhure Sapne,” and “Chamkaur di Garri,” among others.
In films, she shot to fame with her role as Gulabo Maasi in her debut movie “Long Da Lishkara” (1983). She was also a big hit in recent  films such as “Nikka Zaildar” and its sequel, “Nikka Zaildar 2.”
The actor says she enjoys playing characters which are emotional,but also loves to experiment and surprise herself.
Rishi also enjoys  training young talent and says the challenge is to keep the finances flowing. Many talented actors have to switch to other mediums to earn their livelihood, she rues. “More sponsors and no tax on theatre will really help theatre grow.”
The veteran actor has always maintained that films are her bread and butter but theatre is her life. Rishi says as long as she lives, she will carry on acting.
Born in 1943 into a Brahmin family in the village of Khiva Kalan in Mansa district, Rishi’s father, Sarpanch Baldev Krishan Rishi, and her mother, Bachni Devi, played significant roles in her upbringing. Her enthusiasm for theatre emerged during her school days. Opting for a career as a physical education instructor, she enrolled in Government College Patiala for Physical Education. She has acted in over 60 films.
One of the two personalities selected for Padma Shri honor from Punjab, Pran Sabharwal (93), is a Patiala-based veteran theatre actor credited for over 5,000 performances in seven decades.
Born in Jalandhar of Punjab on December 9, 1930, Sabharwal, who otherwise served as an employee in the erstwhile Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB), was attracted towards acting after getting inspired from the doyen of Hindi cinema, his idol, Prithivraj Kapoor. Without having any formal qualification or training in acting, Sabharwal went on to make theatre and radio his life. And there was no looking back. Sabharwal was also one of the founder faculty members of the Department of Speech, Drama & Music, at Punjabi University, Patiala.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Sabharwal said: “I am ecstatic that my work, dedication and love for acting has been finally recognized. I never had any formal qualification or training in acting. I was just a big fan of Prithviraj Kapoor and had even requested him to take me to Bombay but he told me that I should continue to live in Punjab and pursue acting in my own mother tongue-Punjabi.”
“I am settled in Patiala since 1962 after I was posted here in the electricity board. I also retired from the board. But my love for theatre started when in 1952, Prithviraj Kapoor had visited Jalandhar for some performance and I kept running after him like a fan boy. He asked me what do you want? I said please take me to Bombay, I want to work with you. He said I should continue to pursue my love for acting but in my own mother tongue- Punjabi. I obeyed what he said after I got his blessings and best wishes,” said Sabharwal.
Sabharwal said that he was extremely proud and happy to know that veteran actor Nirmal Rishi, too has been selected for Padma Shri honor from Punjab. “We worked together in the play “Paisa Bolta Hai,” said Sabharwal, who has been running the National Theatre Arts Society (NTAS) since 1952.
Sabharwal will also be honored at Republic Day programme in Patiala Friday where Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit will be the chief guest.
A radio drama artist of All India Radio (AIR) since 1951, Sabharwal is also credited for over 500 radio plays in his career. He also performed in Punjabi films including national award winning ones. Some of his films include “Chann Pardesi”, Marhi da Deeva”, “Shaheed Udham Singh”, “Vairy Jatt”, “Angrejan” and “Ruttan Piar Dian”.
He also acted in several Doordarshan television shows including iconic Punjabi serial “Eho Hamara Jeevna” based on Dalip Kaur Tiwana’s novel.
He also produced “Punjabi Bal Ramayana”, a first of its kind play, written by his artist wife Sunita Sabharwal, which covered the entire epic in two hours. He also remained a fellow, theatre and television department, Punjabi University, Patiala."
RMEXJSEM2T_ETTIEKLBSTXYJIW,Cyber expert roped in to help in probe against hacker Sriki colluded with Karnataka police officers to pocket Bitcoins from accused: SIT,_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 10:55 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/cyber-expert-roped-in-to-help-in-probe-against-hacker-sriki-colluded-with-karnataka-police-officers-to-pocket-bitcoins-from-accused-sit-9128105/,"A cyber expert roped into assist an investigation by the Bengaluru Central Crime Branch (CCB) police into the illegal activities of international hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 29, in 2020, illegally accessed the crypto wallet of an accountant of the hacker and transferred Bitcoins valued at Rs 1.83 lakh to his own crypto wallet, CID SIT revealed.
This alleged illegal access to the crypto wallet of a co-accused in the controversial probe by the CCB is among other information unearthed by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Karnataka CID which is probing what is known as the Bitcoin scam dating to the 2020-21 period when the BJP was in power in Karnataka.
In a new FIR, the SIT has named five persons — cyber expert K S Santhosh Kumar who runs a private firm called Group Cyber ID Technology Pvt Ltd in Bengaluru and four former CCB officers — Sridhar Poojar (now a DySP), inspectors Prashanth Babu, Chandradhar S R and Lakshmikanthaiah — for alleged illegal confinement, breach of trust by a public servant and destruction of evidence filed at the Cyber Crime police station of the CID on January 24.
The SIT arrested the cyber expert K S Santhosh Kumar and the former head of the city technical cell Prashanth Babu on Thursday in the case.
The investigations into the case suggest dozens of procedural lapses in the CCB probe against the hacker and his associates — including illegal detention, no documentation as evidence of the logins, passwords and data for the computer usage by the accused and even the provision of a laptop worth Rs 60,000 by the police to Sriki to display his hacking skills.
The large-scale procedural lapses in the investigations suggest a deeper corruption but no evidence has been found yet to suggest that the CCB police officers themselves profited from the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seized from Sriki by Kumar.
Sriki in statements to the police, that are documented in the chargesheets, claimed to have had 400 to 500 Bitcoins in his possession when he was arrested in 2020. The CCB police, however, never recovered any of the Bitcoins allegedly acquired through illegal hacking by Sriki.
The SIT probe has found that the CCB police had kept Sriki and his accountant or associate Robin Khandelwal in illegal confinement for three days between November 14 and 17 and again between November 18 and 30 to extract information.
Sriki and Khandelwal were allegedly taken illegally to the office of the firm run by Kumar on several occasions in December 2020 and January 2021 and Kumar was co-opted into the probe as an expert on the direction of CCB technical cell inspector Prashanth Babu, the SIT has alleged.
The SIT has further alleged, “On December 30, 2020, December 31, 2020 and January 6, 2021, the CEO of GCID and technical expert Santhosh Kumar illegally accessed the crypto wallet of Robin Khandelwal and transferred Bitcoin of the value of Rs 1,83,624/- to his own crypto wallet. This transaction was facilitated by the police officers Chandradhar and Lakshmikathaiah.”
Lakshmikanthaiah is alleged to have seized a One Plus phone belonging to Khandelwal on December 27 and is said to have illegally used the phone on December 30 before destroying the device as a part of efforts to hide evidence.
The SIT also said that on January 5, 2021, on the instructions of Babu, Kumar allegedly gained access to crypto wallets, email accounts and bank accounts of Sriki and Khandelwal and changed the logins and passwords in the absence of witnesses or court orders.
The SIT alleged that Babu provided a laptop worth Rs 60,000 to Sriki to test his computer skills and directed him to hack a few websites and carry out other activities in the presence of Kumar.
Sriki was allegedly allowed to access his Amazon Web Server account on the cloud using the laptop but no data or the files accessed in the cloud was collected for evidence by the officers, the SIT has stated.
Sriki was using the laptop provided to him by the police freely in police custody and even sent mails to friends while in custody on January 22, 2021, it has been alleged.
He was also allowed to use mixers that allow the transfer of Bitcoins to be camouflaged and the data on the laptop given to Sriki by the police has been deleted as a part of the efforts to hide evidence of illegal activities, the SIT has alleged.
Sriki and Khandelwal were initially arrested by the CCB in November 2020 on charges of ordering drugs on the internet using Bitcoin. Sriki’s friends Sunish Hegde and others were initially accused in the drugs case and later Sriki and Khandelwal were named in the case.
The purchase of drugs on the darknet led to the cracking of several other cybercrimes involving Sriki in Karnataka, including one involving a heist of Rs 11.5 crore from the e-governance cell in July-August 2019.
The handling of the cases was criticised by the Congress, which was then in the Opposition, between 2020 and 2023. The party alleged widespread corruption by the then BJP-led government.
In fact, Sriki himself said in his police statements on record in the charge sheets filed by the CCB that he was forced to handover all cryptocurrencies in his possession to the police.
Later, shortly after the Congress came to power in Karnataka in May, it formed the CID SIT in July 2023 to probe “cases connected to laundering of Bitcoins and other cases”."

The Local Crime Branch (LCB) of the rural police as well as the Special Operations Group (SOG) nabbed the 13 accused who have been booked in the FIR lodged at the Vadu police station. The FIR states that eight people were injured in the incident which was “a criminal conspiracy intended to kill persons belonging to the Hindu community participating in the Shobha Yatra”.
According to the police, tension flared up in the village around 4 pm when the Shobha Yatra passed through the Nagina Masjid lane, where youth from different communities indulged in a heated exchange of words and stones were pelted. Vadodara Superintendent of Police Rohan Anand told The Indian Express that members of the Hindu community, who organised the yatra, had also filed a complaint at Vadu police station against unidentified persons for “removing religious flags” put up at the temple ahead of the Shobha Yatra on January 18, prompting the police to beef up security for Monday’s Shobha Yatra.
A police constable was also injured in the incident, it stated. It has identified the 16 accused — all residents of Bhoj village — and has mentioned 10 other yet-to-be-identified people who were part of the mob that attacked the Shobha Yatra participants.
The 13 arrested between 18 and 40 years of age, police said.
They have been booked under IPC sections for attempt to murder (307), criminal conspiracy [120(b)], unlawful assembly (143), member of unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon likely to cause death (144), rioting (147), offence committed by every member of unlawful assembly in prosecution of common object (149), deliberate and malicious acts, that are intended to outrage religious feelings (295A), rioting (147), rioting armed with deadly weapons (148), assaulting or obstructing public servant when suppressing riot (152), promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony (153A), voluntarily causing hurt (323), voluntarily causing hurt by the use of a dangerous weapon or means (324), mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees (427), utters any obscene words [294(B)], and statements conducing public mischief [505(A)]."

Mumbai police officials said that they have cancelled leaves of all its staff for next three days. This will exclude leaves pertaining to health issues. The decision was made in order to ensure a full police force when lakhs of Maratha activists are expected to enter the city on Friday, a police officer said.
On January 20, Jarange-Patil started the rally from Antarwali Sarati in the Jalna district of Maharashtra to Mumbai. The Maratha quota activist and supporters are marching towards Mumbai to protest for quota in jobs and education.
The police will deploy heavy security cover along the route Maratha reservation activists will take. Policemen will also be part of the morcha in plain clothes to look for anyone planning to do any sabotage, sources said. Police will also use their CCTV network to monitor the morcha’s movement and will likely use drones for aerial monitoring, a source said.
City Traffic police may soon impose restrictions in Mumbai during the march. Heavy vehicles may be restricted during peak hours, and buses and trucks, during the daytime.
Since, Friday is also Republic day, vital installations, public areas, religious places will also see heavy security bandobast. A strong police force of nearly 44,000 personnel will be on the streets as part of the bandobast, another police officer said. The deployment of police force will be in effect from Thursday midnight."

Addressing the birth centenary event of Thakur, Shah said that PM Modi fulfilled the dream of 500 years of devotees who wanted Ram Lalla to reside in a grand temple rather than a tent.
“On January 23, he fulfilled the long-awaited wish of crores of poor, deprived, exploited, Dalits, tribals, that the people’s leader (Jan Nayak), who made social justice a reality, get the Bharat Ratna award,” Shah said.
“22 tarikh ko Modiji ne Ram kaaj kiya, aur 23 tarikh ko garib kaaj kar, Ram aur garib ko jodne ka prayas kiya (Modiji completed Lord Ram’s task on January 22 and by undertaking the cause of the poor on January 23, he tried to link Ram and the poor),” Shah said, adding that the poor are being honoured after so many years because “the son of a poor tea seller is the Prime Minister of the country”.
“In the 10 years of Prime Minister Modi, 23 crore Indians have come out of poverty, 4 crore people have got their pucca houses, 3 crore electricity connections have been provided, 10 crore people have received gas cylinders, 14 crore households have received tap water connections, 13 crore toilets have been constructed, and every month 80 crore poor are getting 5 kg food grain free of cost,” Shah said, listing the achievements of the Modi government.
Recalling Thakur’s popularity as Jan Nayak, Shah said, “He became Jan Nayak because of his conduct and sensitivity towards the poor and the deprived. However, it took ages to bestow on him the Bharat Ratna award. Many people came (to power) but no one found it appropriate to confer Bharat Ratna on Karpoori Thakur.”
The Union Home Minister said that for ages political parties have demanded Bharat Ratna for Karpoori Thakur but when they came to power, “they completely forgot about the demand”.
“Today, on the 100th birth anniversary of Karpoori Thakur, Narendra Modi, born in a poor family like his (Thakur), has bestowed on him the Bharat Ratna,” Shah said.
Shah also slammed the Congress “for its tradition of honouring leaders of only one family”.
“Congress ne ek parampara kari thi ki ek pariwar ke aaspas hi jan nayakon ka, lok nayakon ka aur sarvajanik jiwan ke netaon ka samman ho. Modiji ne wo parampara todi hai. (The Congress had started a tradition of honouring leaders of only one family. Modiji has broken that tradition),” Shah said.
He said that the PM constructed an unforgettable memorial of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and has honoured many freedom fighters and heroes during the celebrations of the 75th year of India’s Independence and in that series of honouring India’s greats, Bharat Ratna was announced for Thakur.
Shah went on to list the initiatives taken by the Modi government for the uplift of the backward communities in the country. “There are 27 OBC ministers in the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. This is because Prime Minister Modi himself comes from an extreme backward society,” Shah said.
On the occasion, Union Ministers Dr Virendra Kumar, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Nityanand Rai, and Meenakshi Lekhi were also present.
In a separate event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Thakur’s entire life was dedicated to social justice and upliftment of the underprivileged.
“You all must have seen that yesterday the country has taken a big decision. This is the decision to give Bharat Ratna to Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji. It is very important for today’s young generation to know about Karpoori Thakur ji and learn from his life. It is the good fortune of our BJP government that it got the opportunity to honor Jannayak Karpoori Thakur with Bharat Ratna,” Modi said, addressing NCC/ NSS cadets.
“Fighting challenges like extreme poverty and social inequality, he reached a very high position in national life. He was also the Chief Minister of Bihar twice. Despite this, he never gave up his humble nature and worked for all sections of the society. Jannayak Karpoori Thakur was always known for his simplicity. His entire life was dedicated to social justice and upliftment of the underprivileged. Even today his honesty is an example,” he said."

Several people were injured in the incident, including Congress’s Assam chief Bhupen Borah.
“With reference to wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Congress members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in a post on X. The FIR was filed under several IPC sections, including those dealing with criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and rioting.
Sarma had earlier said that he instructed police to register a case against Rahul Gandhi for “provoking the crowd”. Before the yatra arrived in Guwahati, Sarma had said they would not be allowed inside the city as it would cause congestion.
Assam Director General of Police G P Singh said “lawful action is being taken against such leaders and participants who instigated, led and participated in unlawful activities”.
Addressing a press conference after the incident, Rahul Gandhi said Sarma was helping the Congress by “disrupting” the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam.

“Actually, what the Chief Minister of Assam is doing against the yatra… The yatra is benefitting (from it)… the publicity that we may not have otherwise got…the Assam Chief Minister, and perhaps with (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah behind him, is giving us…(they are) helping us…So we are benefitting. The main issue in Assam has become the yatra,” he said.
Later, he also said that cases were being filed against him because the BJP government had “fear in their hearts” as the people of Assam are “standing up against them”.
On Tuesday morning, participants of the yatra set out from Meghalaya towards Guwahati, travelling along the highway. At Khanapara, they found that the road leading into the city from the highway was barricaded by police.
The yatris who were on foot, ahead of the bus carrying Rahul Gandhi, pushed against the barricades in a confrontation with police personnel deployed there. Assam Police said its personnel had to push back at the yatris, who attempted to break through the barricades.
“The police used lathis, and I got injuries on my arms and legs. Many others were also injured,” said Naveen Kumar Paswan, a Congress worker who was part of the yatra.
State Congress chief Borah and party leader Jakir Hussain Sikdar were injured in the scuffle. Borah had also been injured two days ago in Assam’s Sonitput district when a group carrying BJP flags sought to attack vehicles that were part of the yatra.
After reaching the site of Tuesday’s incident, Rahul Gandhi addressed the Congress workers from atop the bus. “On this very road, the Bajrang Dal took out a rally earlier, (BJP president J P) Nadda ji took out a rally. But the Congress padyatra is being stopped here. There was a barricade here. We broke and threw it away, but we will not break the law. Assam’s Chief Minister may break it, the Home Minister may break it, the PM may break it, but Congress party workers will not break it.”
“But don’t think that we are weak… You are all ‘babbar sher (lions)’. Recognise your strength,” he told party workers.
At around 12.30 pm on Tuesday, the yatra continued along the highway.

The Assam DGP said the yatra had been given permission to use the highway to pass through Guwahati and reach their next destination – Hajo in Kamrup district. However, on Tuesday, participants of the yatra “insisted” on changing the route, he said.
“On being advised to stick to the ASL (advance security liaison) plan, the participants of the road event, at the instigation of senior leaders, tried to force their way by changing the route, which was resisted by Assam Police. Participants used force to break down some of the barricades, causing injury to some policemen and the general public. Sensing and seeing threat to life and property, Guwahati police used persuasion to turn the event back to the allotted route,” the DGP said.
CM Sarma lashed out at the Congress. “This is not part of Assamese culture, We are a peaceful state. Such ‘Naxalite tactics’ are completely alien to our culture… Your unruly behaviour and violation of agreed guidelines have resulted in a massive traffic jam in Guwahati now,” he said on X.

Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi said he was “prevented” from interacting with students of a private university in Meghalaya at the “instructions” of the Union Home Minister.
“I wanted to come to your university and address you, listen to you. But what happened is that the Home minister of India called up the Chief Minister of Assam and the CMO called up the leadership of the university and said that Rahul Gandhi must not be allowed to speak to the students of this university,” he told students and others from atop his yatra bus on the Assam-Meghalaya border.
In the press conference later on Tuesday, Rahul also talked about being stopped from going to Batadrava Than in Assam’s Nagaon on Monday.
“Why is Rahul ji being stopped from going to the mandir, why is Rahul ji being stopped from talking to the students…Nadda ji’s padayatra is allowed, Bajrang Dal’s padayatra is allowed… but Congress is not being allowed…,” he said.
Targeting the Assam CM, Rahul said, “There is a clear problem in this state. Number one…is that the Chief Minister of this state is one of the most corrupt chief ministers in the country. Secondly, whenever I am moving around the state…pretty much everybody is saying to me that there is massive unemployment, massive corruption, massive price rise…farmers are struggling, no youngster can get a job in the state. So that is the situation. And that is what we are raising.”
Asked whether he was concerned about his security amid “attacks” against the yatra, he said, “I don’t get intimidated. Kuch bi karo, gaali do, disrupt karo, maro, peeto (Do anything, abuse us, disrupt us, assault us), but I don’t get intimidated. I will fight for my truth…,” he said.

The complainant, Suhas Ohwal, manager from Shriram City Union Finance Ltd, in his statement to the police mentioned that the accused Prakash Raj and his wife Sandhya in April 2018 approached the organisation for a loan to purchase four office spaces 3, 5, 15 and 17 in commercial building Business Point in Sahar Village area. They offered to mortgage these office properties for the loan.
Prakash and Sandhya hail from Andaman and Nicobar Islands and are directors of Mountain Edge Tours & Holidays Private Limited.
They submitted all the required documents and requested the NBFC that the loan money be sanctioned directly to the developer Roy Ambrose Creado. After following due procedure the complainant NBFC sanctioned four loans totalling Rs 4.80 crore and transferred money into developer’s bank accounts, the police said. Initially the accused paid two EMIs, but later defaulted. When the complainant NBFC visited the said office galas they discovered that no such four galas 3, 5, 15 and 17 exist. Instead the building has offices 103, 105, 115 and 117 which were owned by some other individuals, states FIR.
The NBFC discovered that forged and bogus documents were submitted to fraudulently avail the loan. It was also revealed that almost half of the loan money was diverted from the developer’s bank accounts to the bank accounts of the accused couple, the FIR added. The said developer is believed to be no more. Hence, the NBFC approached the police and filed a complaint saying they were defrauded between April 2018-January 2024 of Rs 4.80 crore by Prakash, his wife Sandhya, and two others.
The police have booked the four accused under sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120 of the Indian Penal Code and are further investigating the matter, a police officer said."

The Rahul Gandhi-led yatra faced several hurdles in Assam, with Borah himself getting injured on two different occasions – once when a scuffle broke out after police stopped the yatra from entering Guwahati city on Tuesday, and two days earlier, when a group wielding BJP flags attempted to attack yatra vehicles in Sonitpur. On Thursday, the yatra exited Assam and entered West Bengal.
The notice received by Borah asks him to appear at Jorhat police station on January 31, failing which he will be liable for arrest. This is in relation to a suo moto case registered by Jorhat police on January 18.
The complaint alleged that “one K B Byju, along with unknown others, instigated and led the crowd to take the Gar Ali road and damaged the barricades which were put for management of traffic, and also assaulted on-duty police personnel”.
“There are reasonable grounds to question you to ascertain facts and circumstances from you, in relation to the present investigation,” the notice issued to Borah read.
Another case that was filed against participants of the yatra, including Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders, in connection with the scuffle that ensued as participants tried to push through barricades to enter Guwahati city, has been transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department.
State Congress leaders said the yatra was a success in Assam despite all the hurdles.
“The government was not successful in the way it kept trying to thwart the yatra right from Sivasagar district. Their ill-intentions could be seen by everyone… Assam’s police administration and district administration was used as a political weapon,” said Assam Congress leader Debabrata Saikia.
Speaking about the case in Jorhat, he said there had been a misunderstanding over what the approved route was in the district, because of which participants strayed to another route. “There, the police did not even stop us then, but later, filed a case with bailable and non-bailable offences,” he said.
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma continued to fire barbs at Rahul Gandhi even after the yatra exited the state.
“Look at the timing of the yatra. They hatched a conspiracy to cause a very big issue in Assam. In Guwahati, we got just a glimpse of that. But they had a very big conspiracy that they would pass through Assam during the Ram Mandir pran pratishtha and create a very big clash in Assam. But our party’s people and Ram bhakts – all the people exercised quite a lot of restraint and did not allow any disturbance to happen in Assam,” he said, speaking to the media on Thursday."

The success of Pathaan not only marked a professional collaboration but also fostered a friendship between Siddharth and SRK. In a recent interview, Siddharth revealed SRK’s positive reaction after watching the trailer of his upcoming film, Fighter.
According to Siddharth, Shah Rukh Khan was thoroughly ‘impressed’ with the Fighter trailer. He told News18, “Shah Rukh loved the trailer. In fact, I met him the day it was released. He loved the look of the villain and the stunts. According to him, the CGI appeared very seamless. He was very impressed.”
During the conversation, the filmmaker admitted that Pathaan’s success has set the bar too high for him and he feels the ‘pressure of the expectations’ from his audience. The filmmaker, however, doesn’t want Fighter to be compared to Pathaan. He said, “I don’t expect that this time around. With Pathaan, it just happened. I got blessed with it. Pathaan was blessed and special. But I don’t want Fighter to be compared to anything. I didn’t want Pathaan to be compared to War either. I want Fighter to chart its own world because it’s its own film.”
Starring two of the biggest stars in Hindi cinema, Deepika Padukone and Hrithik Roshan, Fighter revolves around Indian Air Force officers. The film has already generated significant buzz, with over one lakh tickets sold in advance for day one, amounting to Rs 3.66 crore. Fighter is scheduled for release on January 25, coinciding with the opening of Pathaan.

In his letter, Kharge mentioned incidents of Gandhi’s convoy being blocked by BJP workers in Nagaon and the state party president Bhupen Borah being physically assaulted in Sonitpur district. He said that there have been several instances where the Assam Police has been found wanting to provide adequate security to Gandhi, who is entitled to Z+ security.
This letter comes after the Assam police registered a case against Gandhi and other Congress leaders yesterday, following a scuffle between participants of the Yatra and the Assam Police when they attempted to enter Guwahati city.
Kharge wrote that on Day 1 of the Yatra the Assam Police was found protecting the posters of the BJP in Amguri, Sibsagar district instead of ensuring safe passage for the Yatra.
On Day 2, “miscreants associated with the BJP were caught defacing the posters and hoardings of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Lakhimpur district”, he alleged further.
“On the 21st of January, 2024 as the Yatra returned to Assam via Arunachal Pradesh, another outrageous attack occurred on the Yatra in Sonitpur district. The local Superintendent of Police in Sonitpur District happens to be the brother of Chief Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma. He watched to see that BJP workers attacked and manhandled the Indian National Congress’ social media team, along with our General Secretary, Jairam Ramesh. Jairam Ramesh’s car was attacked while miscreants were shouting anti-BJNY slogans, tearing off the BJNY sticker on the vehicle, and attempting to throw water on the passengers inside,” Kharge wrote further.
On the same day in Sonitpur district, the BJP’s district party workers blocked Rahul Gandhi’s convoy and then physically assaulted Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President BHipen Borah, he wrote.
“The Assam Police has systematically stood by and / or allowed BJP workers to come closer and closer to the convoy of Shri. Rahul Gandhi, breaching his security cordon, and endangering his physical security and that of his team.”

On January 22, in Nagaon district, BJP workers blocked Gandhi’s convoy, coming extremely close to him, and creating an extremely unsafe situation, Kharge alleged.
Kharge accused the Assam Police of being a silent spectator allowing the BJP wokers to breach Gandhi’s security cordon thereby endangering his physical security and that of his team.
The Congress chief said none of the miscreants have been arrested even when there was ample evidence for all listed incidents, and added that in many instances investigation has not been initiated.
“As the risk increases, and as the Yatra proceeds as planned, we request your intervention to ensure that the Chief Minister of Assam and the Director General of Police, Assam ensure that no such untoward incident takes place which may lead to grave personal injury to Shri. Rahul Gandhi or any members of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,” he wrote further."

Asked by reporters about the state’s stand on the issue, Rio said the government has to consult the people.
“If the need be then we have to work out a formula on how to solve the issue for the people and prevent infiltration as well, because Nagaland is bordered by Myanmar, and on both sides there are Nagas,” he said.
Rio, an ally of the BJP, said that while many people live on the Indian side, their farms are on the other side. “Therefore there has to be a workable formula,” he added.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah last week said the government will end the free movement of people at the India-Myanmar border, and fence it completely so that it can be protected like the country’s boundary with Bangladesh.
Deputy CM Y Patton had on Monday said that the Nagaland government will hold meetings with other northeastern states that share a border with Myanmar, and then approach the Centre on the issue.
Various Naga civil society organisations and also the NSCN-IM have opposed the Centre’s decision, saying that it would “divide” the Nagas living on two sides of the border."

R Ravindra, Deputy Permanent Representative of India to the UN, has made the remarks during a UNSC Open Debate on the Middle East, as Houthi rebels step up attacks on ships in the Red Sea. “The ongoing conflict is also impacting the safety of maritime commercial traffic in the Indian Ocean, including some attacks in the vicinity of India… This is a matter of great concern to the international community and has a direct bearing on India’s own energy and economic interests. This fraught situation is not to the benefit of any party, and this must be clearly recognised,” said Ravindra, without naming Houthi rebels.
The Houthis have said the attacks have been in response to Israel’s war in Gaza, and to show their support for the Palestinians.
According to Ravindra, the message that India has conveyed since the start of this conflict was clear and consistent — it is important to prevent escalation, to ensure continued delivery of humanitarian aid. “The humanitarian situation needs to be addressed in earnest,” said Ravindra, adding that India welcomes the UN’s efforts and international community.
“India has delivered shipments of relief material to the Palestinian people in Gaza. We have also provided USD 5 million, including USD 2.5 million, we provided in December-end to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine refugees in the Near East, which will go to support the agency’s core programmes and services, including education, healthcare, relief, and social services provided to Palestinian refugees,” said Ravindra.
Reiterating India’s long-standing support for a “two-state solution” where the Palestinian people are able to live freely in an independent country within secure borders — with due regard to the security needs of Israel — Ravindar said that “India firmly believes that only a two-state solution, achieved through direct and meaningful negotiations between both sides on final status issues, will deliver an enduring peace that the people of Israel and Palestine desire and deserve”. “For this, we urge all parties to de-escalate, eschew violence, avoid provocative and escalatory actions, and work towards creating conditions for an early resumption of direct peace negotiations,” said Ravindar.
In her speech, Uzra Zeya, Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights of the United States, called on Israeli leaders to take feasible precautions to minimise civilian harm in line with international law. She also emphasised Hamas’ role in unleashing the conflict, and condemned attacks in the wider region by Iran and its proxies.
Emphasising that the “only guarantor of peace is a two-state solution” — with Israel’s security guaranteed — Zeya called for a strong Palestinian authority in the West Bank and Gaza, even if this was “difficult to imagine”.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council that “any refusal to accept the two-state solution by any party must be firmly rejected”, and stressed that Israeli leaders’ recent clear, and repeated “rejection of a two-state solution is unacceptable”.
The denial of the right to statehood would indefinitely prolong the conflict, and a “one-state solution” — huge Palestinian populations inside that state without any real sense of freedom, rights, and dignity — would be “inconceivable”. “The only way to address the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians is through the two-state formula”, said Guterres.
Riyad Al-Maliki, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (State of Palestine), said, “Israeli leaders do not see our people as an empirical and political reality to coexist with, but as a demographic threat to get rid of through death, displacement or subjugation.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said that the council has not mounted an appropriate response to the situation due to the position of the US. He called for a world order based not on Anglo-Saxon rules, but on international law with the UN playing a central role.
“Western countries want to focus on the day after the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as if the escalation in Gaza had already ceased,” Lavrov said, adding that the “cunning logic of Western delegations is obvious, as they have blocked all council efforts to call for an acutely necessary ceasefire”.
Israel’s representative urged the council to shift its focus towards addressing the “real and significant” security threats in the Middle East, which is “suffering from cancer” — the “continuous threat posed by Hamas”, which exploits international aid to turn Gaza into “a war machine” as well as the “genocidal goals of annihilating Israel” pursued by Hamas during the October 7 events, where over 1,200 Israelis were killed.
Describing the council members’ calls for a ceasefire “shocking”, the Israel representative warned that “any such measure would leave Hamas in power, allowing them to regroup and rearm, while Israelis will face another attempted Holocaust”.
Stephane Sejourne, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France), Council President for January, speaking in his national capacity, said that the council has two possible options. “The first is division, argument, and fanning the flames — The choice of those who invade their neighbour,” said Sejourne. His choice, however, would be the second option — “to stand alongside both Israelis and Palestinians, for peace and the good of both, which entails difficult things for both sides”."
S15S5OOVWN_IGUS4AJBW5LYSN7,"3 FIR’s filed, 9 persons held over inciteful social media posts",_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 10:59 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/3-firs-filed-9-persons-held-over-inciteful-social-media-posts-9128182/,"DAYS AFTER clashes took place in certain parts of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) following the Ram Mandir inauguration at Ayodhya, social media posts kept fanning the flames of incitement in the city, with at least three FIRs registered in the eastern suburbs of the city, in which nine persons were arrested.
In the first case, Mumbai Police made two arrests from Trombay after a person put up a video stating that “arms had been delivered” in the Cheetah Camp area and there would be violence asking people to stay indoors. The information was incorrect, however it started going viral on Whatsapp groups in the area, which led to some people shutting shops.
When people started to reach out to the police, they realised the panic and assured people that no such incident had happened. Once the police determined it was the video that created the panic, they tracked down the two persons who had made the video and shared it.
The duo, identified as Irfan Shaikh and Vijay Sandge, both residents of Trombay, were arrested by the police after an FIR was registered against them. The police questioned them to find out why they spread the video.
In a second case that took place in Nehru Nagar area of Kurla (east), a social media status uploaded by a local led to a group of men reaching his brother’s shop and assaulting him.
An officer said they have registered an FIR against a local who put up a social media post that was communal. It was based on this post that people reached his brother’s shop in Nehru Nagar on Wednesday night and threatened him over the status his brother uploaded.
“The accused roughed him up and damaged some of the articles in his shop. He then called up the police control room following which we reached the shop within minutes,” an officer said. The police registered an FIR against the accused in this case as well.
“While in the first case, the person who uploaded the post was arrested, in the second case, the six persons who went to the shop were also placed under arrest. All were produced before the court and remanded to police custody till January 28,” the officer said.
Zonal DCP Hemraj Rajput said, “We appeal to citizens to not upload communal posts on social media platforms and alert us in case they come across any such posts. If anyone is found uploading such content, the police will take strict action against them.”"
S7LDCHTPYU_03MKD0ZA6A99YC6,7 buffaloes run over by train in Amreli,_,"January 26, 2024 03:26 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/7-buffaloes-run-over-by-train-in-amreli-9128273/,"Seven buffaloes were run over by a goods train near Pipavav port in Amreli’s Rajula taluka on Thursday.
The incident took place between Bherai and Bhachar villages between 9 am and 10 am, Bhachar village sarpanch Takhubha Dhakhda said. “The herd of buffaloes were grazing on the railway track embankment when a speeding goods train going towards Rajula town from Pipavav port hit them, killing them on the spot,” Dhakhda told The Indian Express. He, however, said that no one from Bhachadar or Bherai villages have claimed ownership of the buffaloes.
Officials of Bhavnagar division of Western Railway could not be reached for a comment even as sources said that farmers and cattle-herders don’t claim ownership of their livestock after such incidents. “If the owner of a buffalo or cow is identified after an incident of collision, the Railway books such owner for letting livestock lose on the tracks. Therefore, owners don’t claim such livestock heads,” said a source.
Forest officers said that they removed carcasses from the track. “The carcasses could attract Asiatic lions near the railway track. Therefore, our staff removed the carcasses from the railway line and dumped them at a safer place,” said Jayan Patel, Deputy Conservator of Forest of Shetrunji wildlife division. The area where the incident took place falls in Rajula range of the wildlife division.
Incidentally, two sub-adult male lions were killed after being hit by a goods train at Uchaiya village near Bherai last July. The deaths of buffaloes comes after a lioness was killed on the railway track between Rajula and Mahuva on Sunday evening. Six lions have been killed on railway tracks in Amreli over the last six months."

However, the state government moved the division bench of the high court, which then ordered an interim stay on the single-bench order.
While passing the order, a single-judge bench of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay said that the court has no faith in the state police as it has so far failed to arrest absconding Trinamool Congress leader Sheikh Shahjahan, who allegedly masterminded the attack on Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials on January 5.
Subsequently, the state government made a verbal appeal before a division bench headed by Justice Soumen Sen which admitted the petition and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.
In October last year, Itisha Soren, an MBBS candidate, filed a petition before the Calcutta High Court alleging irregularities in the admissions of candidates in medical colleges and hospitals under the reservation category. According to the petitioner, several candidates were admitted to medical colleges in Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe seats by showing fake caste certificates. It was alleged that the said irregularities took place in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, NRS Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.
Hearing the petition on Wednesday, Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay ordered a CBI inquiry into the alleged irregularities, saying that if any financial irregularities had taken place, they must be brought to light.
State Advocate General Kishore Datta objected to this order but Justice Gangopadhyay interrupted him and asked whether the state police had managed to arrest Shahjahan. The judge further said that there has been no positive step from the state police even after so much has taken place in the state. The court said that it had no faith in the state police, therefore it was of the view that the CBI would conduct an inquiry into the matter. The court also asked the advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner to make CBI a party to the case."
S8RVIGNKCT_CRO3OFONU6V34FQ,What is Circle to Search and how to use it on your smartphone?,Vivek Umashankar,"Updated: January 24, 2024 08:56 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/how-to-use-google-circle-to-search-9121401/,"Google recently unveiled an enhanced version of mobile web search called “Circle to Search,” allowing users to swiftly search for products or learn about a specific topic with a simple gesture. Currently available on Pixel 8 and Galaxy S24 smartphones, Google has confirmed that the feature will be rolling out to more premium phones in the coming days.

Despite its name, Circle to Search isn’t limited to circles. Users can also highlight or scribble on a specific area of an image to find similar products, making it ideal for identifying items spotted in short videos or social media posts.
The best part about Circle to Search is the ability to search for anything without switching to another app; there is no need to take a screenshot of an image, helping users cut down the number of steps required to search on Google to just one step, powered by the new Google app.
Right now, Circle to Search is limited to select Android smartphones. This feature is not just limited to product discovery; it can also answer complex questions using multisearch, a feature on Google Search that can identify and analyze both text and images at the same time. You can also highlight text on an article, photo, or video, and Circle to Search will offer relevant explanations, including AI-generated results.

There are two ways to use Circle to Search features. If you use navigation buttons, just long-press on the home screen, where a Google Search menu pops up, and then circle or scribble on the product that you would like to search.
Similarly, if you use gesture-based navigation, long-press on the gesture bar and circle, scribble, or highlight the text or the product that you would like to know more about.
If you have a smartphone with a stylus (S-Pen) like the Galaxy S24 Ultra, you can also use the S-Pen to circle around a product or scribble. On other models, one can circle or scribble using fingers, and in both cases, this feature works just fine.
If you don’t have access to these latest smartphones, there is a way to get a similar search experience minus the ability to circle or scribble. Long-press on the home button or swipe from the bottom right or left corner and select screen search, then highlight the image or the text you would like to search. The search results will be similar to that of the Circle to Search experience."
S9BFBKE53V_CX9AYU4A09SI2G8,SC asks Tamil Nadu govt not to proceed with probe into FIR against ED official,Ananthakrishnan G,"Updated: January 26, 2024 01:38 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dont-start-probe-into-ed-official-fir-sc-tells-tamil-nadu-govt-9127405/,"The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Tamil Nadu government not to proceed with further investigation into the FIR against Enforcement Directorate (ED) official Ankit Tiwari, who was arrested by the state Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on bribery charges.
“…don’t start any investigation in this FIR. Don’t file any chargesheet,” a bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice K V Viswanathan said, asking the Tamil Nadu government to file its response to the ED’s plea seeking a transfer of the probe in the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in two weeks’ time.
The court also asked the state government to share with it material collected by it in connection with the case by the next date of hearing.
The bench also expressed concern over even genuine cases escaping scrutiny if such inter-agency bickering continued and suggested that some best practices be evolved to avoid such a scenario.
“The larger issue of best practices, considering the federal nature of the country… we will evolve a mechanism. You should sit together and give suggestions,” said Justice Viswanathan.
He said, “There may be genuine cases where ED may have to go in, there may be cases where they are brought into mala fide. Some kind of best practices we want.”
He said there maybe situations where the ruling party at the Centre and state are different and “something has to be evolved so that while genuine cases don’t go scot-free merely because it is being handled by the central agency, at the same time there is no mala fide witch-hunting”.
Justice Surya Kant said, “To eliminate the apprehension of political vendetta or actual political vendetta, we need to have a mechanism…some transparent mechanism, where the investigation can commence while these types of situations can be avoided.”
Justice Viswanathan pointed out that the ED and CBI have officers across the country and asked what will happen if vindictive actions continue.
“We are not saying you are vindictive or they are vindictive. But suppose in a given scenario, there is a tit-for-tat reaction. Your officers are sitting in the states. If there is a vindictive action from their side as a tit-for-tat to what they perceive as a vindictive action, what will happen to the country?,” he asked.
Besides seeking a transfer of the probe in Tiwari’s case to the CBI, the ED also alleged that FIRs in scheduled offences were not being shared with it to enable it to carry out investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), and sought a direction to the Tamil Nadu government to appoint a nodal officer for sharing all such FIRs with it.
Appearing for the ED, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said on Thursday that it was not supporting the arrested official but wanted a fair probe.
Reiterating that the Tamil Nadu government was not sharing FIRs in predicate offences with it, the Solicitor General submitted that the state website relating to FIRs was blocked under the orders of the competent authority.
Responding to this, senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for the Tamil Nadu government said, “They are asking all FIRs from us. Have they asked any other state?”
The court, meanwhile, asked what’s the need for keeping FIRs secret.
“Aren’t the FIRs supposed to be uploaded online? Why the secrecy?…If you have registered an FIR against a public servant for corruption or illegal mining or disproportionate assets, what is the state propriety to say that we will not permit further investigation by the ED?” asked Justice Surya Kant.
Sibal said ED probe can happen only if there is money laundering and asked, “So, how is ED entitled to investigate without prima facie money laundering?”
The agency said in its plea that the state government was not sharing FIRs related to the sand mining scam. Sibal said the cases arising out of the alleged illegal mining is not a scheduled offence under the PMLA. He alleged that the ED was only pursuing cases in “certain states”."
SAZWIE1E82_A4LOOPI6OTYHNKV,"Will Jwala take care of newborn cubs? In Kuno, wildlife officials have fingers crossed",Anand Mohan J,"Updated: January 23, 2024 18:35 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kuno-mp-national-park-wildlife-cubs-9124086/,"With a Namibian cheetah named Jwala giving birth to three cubs in Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno National Park, all eyes are on whether the mother will take care of the newborns. Jwala had given birth to four cubs in March last year too – while three died due to the extreme heat, the surviving one was abandoned by its mother after being taken for medical treatment.
Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Aseem Shrivastava told The Indian Express, “Jwala is the best caretaker for the new set of cubs. The mother has still not interacted with the first cub and it can be due to a host of reasons. It is very difficult to say if the mother will take care of the cubs.”
However, wildlife officials are hopeful that the remaining cubs will survive since they were conceived in the winter months and will have a head start of a few months before the brutal summer conditions punish the Kuno landscape.
“We hope it will be better. Last summer, the cubs were born. This time, they are born in the winter and their chances of survival are better. This is ideal weather for them. Basically heat stroke killed the previous cubs; this time we are hoping that won’t be the case. We have learnt a lot from our previous experiences,” Shrivastava said.
Kuno field director Uttam Kumar Sharma said, “The mother is healthy, and we are monitoring it from a distance. The cubs are a healthy litter.”
Said a park official, “The gender of the cubs has not yet been determined. If the cubs are males then they form coalitions and can survive for a long period of time.”
The park officials are also monitoring the sole cub which had been abandoned last year. Shrivastava said that in the coming year, the cub will “undergo training courses to develop hunting skills, and a module is being prepared for the same”.
The birth of the cubs comes as much-needed good news – just a week ago, Namibian cheetah Shaurya died after it was spotted with weakness.
Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav shared the news on X, saying, “Kuno’s new cubs! Namibian cheetah named Jwala has given birth to three cubs. This comes just weeks after Namibian Cheetah Aasha gave birth to her cubs.”
“Congratulations to all wildlife frontline warriors and wildlife lovers across the country. May Bharat’s wildlife thrive.”
Under Project Cheetah, a total of 20 animals were relocated from Namibia and South Africa to Kuno National Park in two batches – in September last year and in February, 2022. Earlier this month, Aasha, another cheetah from Namibia, also gave birth to three cubs at the park."

The tricolour was unfurled at the two police camps set up deep inside the forest earlier this month.
The police camps at Chintagufa are among the nine such camps that were set up in Sukma and Bijapur districts – both considered war zones – since November last year where the tricolour was unfurled on Friday. Of the nine, seven are Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camps and two are Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) camps.
With anti-Maoist operations in Chhattisgarh intensifying, these camps have played a big role in improving the operational reach of the security forces and removing a considerable geographical area from the influence of Naxals.
“These security camps…are also functioning as integrated development centres and are facilitating basic amenities like health, education, PDS, electricity, mobile connectivity etc..,” Inspector General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P said.
Chintagufa is located on the Sukma-Bijapur border, over 100 km inside the forest and away from the headquarters of Sukma district. It was part of the safe haven for the dangerous People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) battalion led by Maoist leader Hidma which has now been pushed back by 7-10 km.
“The two camps in Duled and Mukrajkonda are situated 5 km away from each other. Due to the camps, about four to five villages will now get electricity connection and road connectivity for the first time and will also be able to avail other government services,” Superintendent of Police (Sukma district) Kiran Chawan said.
However, the threat of Naxal attacks still looms large on security personnel who operate amid risks of being ambushed or falling prey to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) hidden in the forests.
In 2023, 24 security personnel were killed in Chhattisgarh, an increase when compared to the 10 security personnel killed in 2022. Thirty-one civilians and 23 Naxals were also killed last year. The new year has seen five Naxals, including two women, being killed in encounters. A six-month-old girl also died in the crossfire during anti-Naxal operations in Bijapur and Dantewada.
Meanwhile, earlier this week, Union Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a review meeting on Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in Chhattisgarh’s Raipur where he said the Maoist menace should end in the next three years."

The land dispute involved one of the advocates accused in Wednesday’s case and another group of individuals, police said.
“Following a clash over the dispute earlier this week, the police had issued notices to three persons from both sides – including one of the accused advocates Raju Kumar – under sections 107 and 116 of the CrPC. Kumar then approached Sub-inspector Durgesh Singh to discuss the matter. However, the sub-inspector reportedly refused to withdraw any of the notices,” said a police officer. “Kumar along with a group of lawyers went to the Superintendent of Police Wednesday to lodge a complaint against Durgesh. The SP promised to look into the matter, and the lawyers were returning from his office when the alleged assault took place,” the officer said. Durgesh, who was stationed at the Collectorate police outpost, sustained minor injuries.

Several people were injured in the incident, including Congress’s Assam chief Bhupen Borah.
“With reference to wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Congress members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, K C Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in a post on X. The FIR was filed under several IPC sections, including those dealing with criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, and rioting.
Sarma had earlier said that he instructed police to register a case against Rahul Gandhi for “provoking the crowd”. Before the yatra arrived in Guwahati, Sarma had said they would not be allowed inside the city as it would cause congestion.
Assam Director General of Police G P Singh said “lawful action is being taken against such leaders and participants who instigated, led and participated in unlawful activities”.
Addressing a press conference after the incident, Rahul Gandhi said Sarma was helping the Congress by “disrupting” the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam.

“Actually, what the Chief Minister of Assam is doing against the yatra… The yatra is benefitting (from it)… the publicity that we may not have otherwise got…the Assam Chief Minister, and perhaps with (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah behind him, is giving us…(they are) helping us…So we are benefitting. The main issue in Assam has become the yatra,” he said.
Later, he also said that cases were being filed against him because the BJP government had “fear in their hearts” as the people of Assam are “standing up against them”.
On Tuesday morning, participants of the yatra set out from Meghalaya towards Guwahati, travelling along the highway. At Khanapara, they found that the road leading into the city from the highway was barricaded by police.
The yatris who were on foot, ahead of the bus carrying Rahul Gandhi, pushed against the barricades in a confrontation with police personnel deployed there. Assam Police said its personnel had to push back at the yatris, who attempted to break through the barricades.
“The police used lathis, and I got injuries on my arms and legs. Many others were also injured,” said Naveen Kumar Paswan, a Congress worker who was part of the yatra.
State Congress chief Borah and party leader Jakir Hussain Sikdar were injured in the scuffle. Borah had also been injured two days ago in Assam’s Sonitput district when a group carrying BJP flags sought to attack vehicles that were part of the yatra.
After reaching the site of Tuesday’s incident, Rahul Gandhi addressed the Congress workers from atop the bus. “On this very road, the Bajrang Dal took out a rally earlier, (BJP president J P) Nadda ji took out a rally. But the Congress padyatra is being stopped here. There was a barricade here. We broke and threw it away, but we will not break the law. Assam’s Chief Minister may break it, the Home Minister may break it, the PM may break it, but Congress party workers will not break it.”
“But don’t think that we are weak… You are all ‘babbar sher (lions)’. Recognise your strength,” he told party workers.
At around 12.30 pm on Tuesday, the yatra continued along the highway.

The Assam DGP said the yatra had been given permission to use the highway to pass through Guwahati and reach their next destination – Hajo in Kamrup district. However, on Tuesday, participants of the yatra “insisted” on changing the route, he said.
“On being advised to stick to the ASL (advance security liaison) plan, the participants of the road event, at the instigation of senior leaders, tried to force their way by changing the route, which was resisted by Assam Police. Participants used force to break down some of the barricades, causing injury to some policemen and the general public. Sensing and seeing threat to life and property, Guwahati police used persuasion to turn the event back to the allotted route,” the DGP said.
CM Sarma lashed out at the Congress. “This is not part of Assamese culture, We are a peaceful state. Such ‘Naxalite tactics’ are completely alien to our culture… Your unruly behaviour and violation of agreed guidelines have resulted in a massive traffic jam in Guwahati now,” he said on X.

Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi said he was “prevented” from interacting with students of a private university in Meghalaya at the “instructions” of the Union Home Minister.
“I wanted to come to your university and address you, listen to you. But what happened is that the Home minister of India called up the Chief Minister of Assam and the CMO called up the leadership of the university and said that Rahul Gandhi must not be allowed to speak to the students of this university,” he told students and others from atop his yatra bus on the Assam-Meghalaya border.
In the press conference later on Tuesday, Rahul also talked about being stopped from going to Batadrava Than in Assam’s Nagaon on Monday.
“Why is Rahul ji being stopped from going to the mandir, why is Rahul ji being stopped from talking to the students…Nadda ji’s padayatra is allowed, Bajrang Dal’s padayatra is allowed… but Congress is not being allowed…,” he said.
Targeting the Assam CM, Rahul said, “There is a clear problem in this state. Number one…is that the Chief Minister of this state is one of the most corrupt chief ministers in the country. Secondly, whenever I am moving around the state…pretty much everybody is saying to me that there is massive unemployment, massive corruption, massive price rise…farmers are struggling, no youngster can get a job in the state. So that is the situation. And that is what we are raising.”
Asked whether he was concerned about his security amid “attacks” against the yatra, he said, “I don’t get intimidated. Kuch bi karo, gaali do, disrupt karo, maro, peeto (Do anything, abuse us, disrupt us, assault us), but I don’t get intimidated. I will fight for my truth…,” he said.

SQGRS1RTUF_KNAB8VIGZQ6WYBS,"As Nitish blows cold, Congress hopes to thaw Mamata to secure INDIA alliance",Manoj C G,"Updated: January 26, 2024 10:37 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/nitish-kumar-jdu-mamata-banerjee-tmc-india-opposition-alliance-9128349/,"With more bad news coming in from the Bihar front, where JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar seemed on the verge of returning to the NDA fold, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Thursday reached out to Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee to find a solution to the seat-sharing impasse in the state.
The Congress was left alarmed by Mamata’s announcement Wednesday that no INDIA seat-sharing talks were on in Bengal and that the TMC would contest the Lok Sabha polls alone in the state, while adding that the regional parties were holding together.
Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told The Indian Express that Kharge got in touch with Mamata on Thursday to find a way forward. Refusing to share the details, Ramesh only said the objective of Mamata as well as the INDIA alliance was similar – “to defeat the BJP in Bengal and outside”.
Sources said Kharge also sent a letter to Mamata inviting her to join Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra at some point during its course through Bengal – a reaction to her claim that the Congress did not even inform her about it. Kharge, Rahul and everyone in the party would be “just delighted and privileged to have her as part of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, even if it is for a few minutes”, Ramesh told PTI, indicating the Congress’s desperation to get the TMC back on board.
However, indicating that the TMC will continue to play hard ball, the party on Thursday attacked Congress West Bengal unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as singularly responsible for the failure of the seat-sharing talks. “Three reasons for the alliance not working in Bengal – Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury,” senior TMC leader Derek O’Brien told reporters.
Not helping matters, Chowdhury reacted by telling reporters: “He (O’Brien) is a foreigner, he knows a lot. You should ask him.”
In the midst of this, the INDIA bloc was reeling Thursday over the strong speculation that Nitish was ready to jump ship again.
The loss of the Bihar Chief Minister will be a major blow to the struggling coalition as it was in the state, under Nitish’s sponsorship, that the foundation for the INDIA alliance was laid on June 23 last year. Leaders of 15 Opposition parties had met at Nitish’s official residence in Patna and decided to form a coalition to take on the BJP.
Seven months hence, Nitish, who expected to play a key role in the Opposition front, has been giving signals of increasing disillusionment with the coalition, the most recent being his rejection of the offer to become the INDIA convener.
Barely a month ago, the JD(U), while returning Nitish as party president, projected him as the “sutradhar (main link)” of the Opposition alliance, underlining that few leaders in Indian politics were as “experienced” as him.
Congress sources admitted that his departure might be a fatal blow at a time when the Lok Sabha elections are just around the corner and when the euphoria around the INDIA bloc has already dissipated. Clearly, the logic that the INDIA parties could ensure one-on-one contests against the BJP in maximum seats through tie-ups was more about chemistry than arithmetic.
The biggest implication of Nitish’s exit would be in terms of optics, with the eight-time CM the most prominent face of the Hindi heartland in the INDIA kitty.
With Nitish gone, the BJP will find it easier to project the alliance as a ragtag anti-BJP, “unnatural” coalition, susceptible to crises and one that was withering away even before the electoral challenge.
That most INDIA parties are compelled by local interests despite ideological posturing against the BJP is a fact, which was also evident in its failure to even come up with a common programme.
The goals of the constituents too are divergent. The Congress’s primary interest is revival — “instead of survival”, as the leader of one party put it – while the TMC and AAP are looking to “expand”. This is why the TMC was left bristling over the Congress reluctance to share seats with it in Assam and Meghalaya, and the AAP felt snubbed by the party in Haryana and Gujarat. But for the Congress, it is important too to not contest so few seats that it risks losing the status of being the primary Opposition party.
The Congress recent Assembly losses, virtually wiping it out of the Hindi heartland, left INDIA bloc’s hopes riding largely on Bihar – and to some extent Uttar Pradesh. Nitish’s exit could also send those electoral calculations for a toss, although a section of the Congress leaders are hopeful RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav can compensate and stir up a sympathy vote.
Nitish’s exit would also send another crucial message: given the veteran’s long innings, an indication of which way the electoral wind is blowing.
Plus, at a time when the Opposition is seeking to make demand for a caste census its main poll plank, the loss of a leader who has shown it could be done – given Bihar’s recently released caste survey – would punch a big hole in that platform, even as the BJP is left standing taller."
SRQOQHT602_5VJ707ROXDER5MR,‘Your dreams are my resolution’: PM Modi asks first-time voters to send ideas for BJP manifesto,Vikas Pathak,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:16 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-bjp-first-time-voters-address-9126929/,"In a virtual interaction with about 30 lakh first-time voters from across 5,800 locations in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday exhorted the youth to send him suggestions for the BJP’s 2024 Lok Sabha election manifesto over the Namo app, saying that he would personally meet young people whose suggestions he liked. He also called upon the youth, who are connected over social media, to not just vote but also help people whose names were not on the voters’ list get their names included in it.
“Send me suggestions on how the BJP manifesto should be – in particular for youth. I want you to associate with it. Involve yourself in the BJP’s manifesto. Indian youth will guide the manifesto. I will even personally meet young people who send suggestions that I like and are implementable. A team will prepare the list,” Modi said. “Work on not just ‘let us vote’ but also ‘let us make them vote’ this year. You can connect with a large audience via social media. Try to get names of voters whose names are not on the voters’ list included in it,” he added.
Telling young people that they would be crucial in the direction India takes in the next 25 years, Modi asked them to defeat “family-run parties” that do not allow youth from outside their ruling families to rise. He said that India’s youth are the only generation that has the Ramayana and the Gita for inspiration and also knowledge about artificial intelligence: “You are the youth of the 21st century. You have a heritage of thousands of years and are also futuristic. You are the only generation that has inspiration of Ramayana and Gita, and also knowledge of artificial intelligence. You have both inspiration and innovation.”
The PM reminded young people that youth exactly a century ago fought for India’s freedom and achieved it. “Twenty-five years before 1947, the youth had the responsibility of making India free; in these 25 years leading up to 2047, you have the responsibility of making India a developed country. You have to decide how to write your names in golden letters in the next 25 years. You will decide our speed, direction and approach, and one major medium for this will be voting. To choose the correct people is your responsibility. It is incumbent on you to vote to make the future of the country bright,” Modi said.
He added, “Your vote and the country’s direction for the future are merged. It will make India the third largest economy and bring stable governments. It will give speed to reforms. It will give greater energy to the digital revolution. It will send the first Indian to space. It will make India establish India’s first space station. It will make India more influential in the world. Your one vote has great strength.”
Modi further said, “You have become voters when Bharat’s Amrit Kaal has started. Tomorrow the country will celebrate the 75th Republic Day. You have to decide in the next 25 years, your own and the country’s future. You will have to shoulder the responsibility of voting in all the elections in the next 25 years.”
He said that stable governments with a majority can take decisions that propel the country forward. “Our majority government removed Article 370, brought OROP for Army veterans, brought GST after long, paved the way for women’s reservation, made a law against instant triple talaq, brought the new education policy, protected the interests of SCs, STs and OBCs and also gave poor 10 percent EWS, and got the opportunity to witness the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla. Firm decisions are taken by stable, majority, governments,” Modi said.
“When I shake hands with world leaders, it is not Modi but 140 crore people who do it. This influences the world. India has global clout and India’s passport has a high value now. We have got record FDI, high forex reserves. There was a time when we had to mortgage our gold,” the PM added.
Modi said that his government had solved many of the chronic problems of the past. “Open newspapers before 2014. Almost every day news on corruption and scams was published in the headlines. Scams of thousands of crores were routine. The youth used to protest against the government. We have brought the nation out of that,” he said. “We talk not about corruption but credibility, and not about scams but success stories, today. India was then in the fragile five; now it is the fifth largest economy. In some years from now, India will be among the top three economies. In some years, our economy will cross 7 trillion dollars. New employment opportunities will come. India is a country of youth,” he added.
“Our railways will soon be 100 per cent electrified. We have a goal of solar rooftops in 1 crore homes. Power bills will go down and the government will buy the electricity people produce. They will get money for that,” he said.
Referring to the youth of the country, Modi said, “Your dreams are my resolution. You are my priority. We have taken decisions that earlier seemed impossible. We have opened the drone and space sectors for you. We have made it possible for you to take loans without guarantee under Mudra Yojana. We have a common test for university admission now and even attestation of the form is not required. We are opening higher education institutions of high quality. We are funding research. The government trusts you. It wants to open new opportunities for you.”
Modi added, “New highways and railway routes are being built. We are investing more than ever in infrastructure. The youth will benefit most from it. New employment opportunities will come for you. Who are these expressways for? For you. Who are Vande Bharat trains for? For you. For whom will bullet trains start? For you. Companies have ordered 1,000 new planes. These will provide opportunities for you. Modernised airports and railway stations are being built for you. We will take decisions for the youth – this is Modi’s guarantee.”"

After spending the night at a camp in Rupahi in Assam’s Nagaon district, the Yatra convoy began moving towards the Batadrava Than located around 26 km away at 8.25 am. The Congress had announced earlier that its Yatra schedule for January 22 would include a morning visit to the than in Nagaon district – the birthplace of revered Vaishnavite reformer-saint Srimanta Sankardeva, and one of the most sacred sites for Assamese Vaishnavites. However, en route, the convoy was met with police personnel behind barricades blocking the road at Haibargaon.
Rahul, along with several other leaders including Jairam Ramesh, Supriya Shrinate, Gaurav Gogoi, Srinivas B V, Kanhaiya Kumar, Yogendra Yadav and Jitendra Singh Alwar, got off their vehicles when the convoy was stopped.
It eventually remained stuck at the barricades for over two hours. While some local party supporters joined the yatris, Rahul sat down on road surrounded by supporters singing the bhajan ‘Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram’ in chorus.
“What have I done that I can’t visit the temple?” Rahul asked the police personnel at the barricades.
Incidentally, on Sunday, the president of the Than management committee had alerted the Congress MLA from Batadrava constituency, Sibamoni Bora, that Rahul would not be permitted to enter the premises before 3 pm on Monday, stating that thousands of people were expected to gather at the temple in the morning to mark the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, while addressing the media in Guwahati, had also suggested that Rahul should visit the shrine after the Ayodhya programme, and not in the morning. “… we request that he goes to the Batadrava Sattra only after the Ram Mandir programme is over… There is no competition. He should not come and create an image of a competition,” he had said.
After long exchanges with Congress leaders, the police allowed Gaurav Gogoi and Sibamoni – the local MP and MLA respectively – to go past the barricades and visit the than.
According to AICC leader Jairam Ramesh, while the original plan was for Rahul to visit the than, in the end, only the two Assamese leaders were allowed to go, and it was decided that the Yatra would proceed only after they returned.
Later that afternoon, while the Yatra prepared to move from Jagiroad in Morigaon district to Jorabat at the Assam-Meghalaya border, it was brought to a halt for some time when Nagaon MP Pradyut Bordoloi raised an alarm that a large crowd wielding saffron flags had gathered along their route in Jagiroad.
“I spoke to the District Collector and the Superintendent of Police, and they gave me assurances. But in terms of action, I have not seen anything. They (the flag-wielding crowd) have totally blocked the road and are shouting communally provocative slogans. They are actually trying to create problems,” he told The Indian Express.
He said he had assured the local administration that Rahul, who is leading the Yatra, would not get down from the bus and that the Yatra would pass through peacefully. “We have no intention of challenging them (the crowd),” he said.
After a further delay of around an hour, the convoy passed through the area without incident under police cover.
On Saturday, the Morigaon DC had written to the District Congress committee, requesting that Rahul’s cavalcade should not stop during the course of the roadshow through the district, stating that the administration “apprehends the involvement of miscreants who may try to disrupt the peace and tranquillity” given the two events happening the same day.
Later in the evening, the convoy entered Nongpoh to commence the Meghalaya leg of the yatra."

Among those awarded the Kirti Chakra, Major Digvijay Singh Rawat from the Parachute regiment (Special Forces) received the award for an operation which led to the killing of an insurgent in Manipur. “…Undaunted by hostile fire, Major Rawat tactfully manoeuvred his party to engage the terrorists and himself crawled to a flank and eliminated one self-styled captain and injured another in a display of superlative skills. As per intelligence, they were masterminds of ambush on Assam Rifles,” his citation said.
Major Deependra Vikram Basnet from the Sikh regiment also received the Kirti Chakra for an ambush deployed in the Kupwara sector. “Realising the grave danger to his men, unmindful of his own safety, the officer crawled towards the terrorist amid heavy fire and killed him,” it stated. “In the ensuing firefight, he came face to face with a second terrorist. Without second thought, he engaged this terrorist in fierce hand-to-hand combat and killed him,” it read.
He continued to resolutely control the operation and assisted in elimination of a third terrorist who was pinning down his team. The officer risked his life to safeguard his troops and ensured success of the operation. The operation eliminated five heavily armed foreign terrorists.
Captain Ashuman Singh, a medical officer, was awarded Kirti Chakra posthumously for saving four to five individuals during a major fire at the Siachen glacier on July 19, 2023. Other Army personnel who received the Kirti Chakra include Havildar Pawan Kumar Yadav, and Havildar Abdul Majid, and Sepoy Pawan Kumar both of whom got the award posthumously. All awards were for operations in J&K. Of the Shaurya Chakras awarded, seven were awarded to Army personnel and one to a civilian, one was received by a naval officer and two by Indian Air Force officers, four by J&K personnel and CRPF personnel."

This will be Shah’s third visit to Bengal in the last three months.
Sources in the BJP said Shah would come to Kolkata on January 28, Sunday, and hold a meeting with leaders including state president Sukanta Majumdar, Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari and MP Dilip Ghosh.
On January 29, the Union home minister is scheduled to hold a party workers’ meeting at Mecheda in Purba Medinipur district. Later in the day, he is scheduled to attend an “intellectuals’ meet” at the Science City Auditorium in Kolkata.
“Amit Shah-ji is likely to monitor the BJP’s poll preparation in West Bengal. He is likely to formulate poll strategies for the party,” said a senior BJP leader.
This will be his first visit to the state after the Ram temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya.
In November last year, Shah addressed a public meeting in Kolkata where he accused the Mamata Banerjee government of rampant corruption, violence and a deteriorating law and order situation.
Last month, Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda together visited Bengal and held a series of meetings with party functionaries.
With the elections round the corner, Shah’s visit assumes significance as the party has set a high target of winning 35 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won 18 out of the 42 seats in the state. Since then, former Union minister Babul Supriyo and MP Arjun Singh have defected to the ruling Trinamool Congress."

Nawazuddin gave a rough idea of the amount and said that he does not negotiate with the makers of the film to increase the remuneration.
On Unfiltered by Samdish, the host asked Nawazuddin, “How much money do the actors make, approximately?” The actor said, “They earn a lot.” When the host asked, “10 crore or more than that?” Nawauddin said, “Uske aas paas. (Somewhere around that.)”
When asked if he negotiates with them, the actor replied, “I don’t negotiate a lot. The industry gives you how much you deserve. If you negotiate, they will ask you ‘do you deserve so much?’”


A post shared by Nawazuddin Siddiqui (@nawazuddin._siddiqui)
Nawazuddin said that he does few films just with the intention of making money so he can do some films without charging any money. He said, “I even tell (the makers) that I am doing this for money so that I can do films like Manto for free.”
The Sacred Games had previously revealed that he has stopped doing smaller roles in films. Nawazuddin had said that even if he is offered Rs 25 crore, he would not do a small role. He told Bombay Times, “In my career in this industry, I have worked in many films where I did small roles. And I am done with that. Ab toh aap mujhe 25 crore bhi denge toh bhi main chhota role nahi karunga (Now even if you offer me Rs 25 crore, I won’t do a small role).”
On the work front, Nawazuddin will next be seen in the film Section 108. The upcoming film also stars Arbaaz Khan and Regina Cassandra.

While the crown has 3 kg of gold, the rest of the weight is that of the 300 precious stones, pearls, diamonds and gemstones studded on it.
Although this crown was not a part of the idol’s attire during the installation on Monday, Mukesh Patel, the owner of Greenlab Diamonds, has donated it to the temple.
The owner’s son, Sanket Patel, 30, told The Indian Express, “This was a very quick decision. We started making the mukut (crown) on January 4. We had a talk with the Vishva Hindu Parishad and told them we want to do this. We went to Ayodhya to get the measurements and had around 12 days to get a sense of how we wanted to create it. So, we set around 40-45 people to work on it.”
“We had discussions with the sculptor, Arun Yogiraj, because ultimately it was his vision which created the Ram Lalla idol as there are no images of it. So, we thought, he would be the best to guide us through the process. We created some sketches and shared them with him and he loved them. Then we went ahead with the process,” Sanket added.
“The mukut reached Ayodhya on the night of January 21 and by that time the idol was already ready so it didn’t get the grand reveal but I’m sure when they change the attire in the coming days, we’ll be able to see the mukut on Ram Lalla,” Patel said.
Greenlab Diamonds was started over 50 years ago and was initially named M Kantalal Exports. However, in 2017, the company made an eco-friendly transition to green diamonds and refrained from mined diamonds.
The company has previously made the lab-grown 7.5-carat diamond that Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted US first lady Jill Biden upon his visit to the United States of America last year."
SZRPNF4BJZ_TDDT4HKA70DIQ10,"Boundary dispute with India ‘legacy issue’, doesn’t represent whole picture of bilateral ties: China’s military",_,"Updated: January 25, 2024 20:31 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/boundary-dispute-china-india-galwan-valley-standoff-9127780/,"China’s military on Thursday said the boundary dispute with India is a “legacy issue” and it is “unwise” to link the border issue with the overall relations as it does not represent the whole picture of the bilateral relations.
Chinese Ministry of National Defence spokesperson Senior Colonel Wu Qian made the remarks at a media briefing here in response to a question on External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s reported statement that China violated the bilateral consensus in 2020 and assembled a large number of military forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), resulting in the conflict in the Galwan Valley.
The India-China relations remained frozen since May 2020 when the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) amassed troops in eastern Ladakh that led to a deadly clash between the two militaries at the Galwan Valley in June 2020, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese military personnel.
Wu repeated Beijing’s claim that the Galwan Valley lies on the Chinese side of the western sector along the LAC and the relevant incident happened when the Indian side violated the consensus and made unilateral provocations. “Therefore, the responsibility entirely lies with the Indian side,” he said.
India is pressing the PLA to disengage from the Depsand and Demchok areas. While India has maintained that there cannot be restoration of normalcy in its relations with China as long as the state of the borders remains abnormal, China continues to press India to delink the border issue and bilateral relations and work for normalcy.
Wu said in the past three years, China and India have maintained communication and coordination through military and diplomatic channels. The two militaries held 20 rounds of Corps Commanders level meetings and agreed to disengage from four points mainly the Galwan Valley, the Pangong lake, Hot Springs and Jianan Daban (Gogra) contributing to the de-escalating tension along the border, he said.
“The border dispute,” Wu said, “is a legacy with India but that does not represent the whole picture of the bilateral relations.” “Therefore, it is unwise and inappropriate for the Indian side to link the border issue with the overall relations.

While at the Google office canteen, Singh noticed what he thought to be a common Indian snack Kurkure.
In a post on X, Singh said he helped himself with a “generous portion”. It was only after a coworker said he seemed to like the snack, that Singh realised it had an unexpected twist.
“Yes, of course. I grew up eating something similar as a snack in India’, I replied. She was surprised. “Really? Are duck tongues common in India?” I had been relishing crispy coated duck tongues! Now, whenever I see a plate of ‘kurkures’, I double-check to make sure it’s not Chinese tongue-di kabab,” he posted.
Even though he was initially shocked, Singh handled the experience well, posting afterwards about his adventurous palate and that he had tried everything from insects to snakes and yes, duck tongues. “But when I expect kurkure, I want kurkure!” he added.
Take a look at the post:
I was in the cafeteria at Google’s Beijing office when I spotted a large plate of what looked like fried ‘kurkures’. I helped myself with a generous portion. A colleague commented, “Wow, I didn’t know you were a fan of these.” “Yes, of course. I grew up eating something similar…

His candid admission of the error soon went viral and gained widespread attention, inspiring others to contribute their humorous tales of miscommunications involving food.
A user commented, “I filled my plate with something looking like sev-bhajia in Kuala Lumpur. I found the smell a bit strange. When looked closely, every strand of sev had a pair of tiniest eyes. It was some kind of deep-fried minuscule fish!”
While another said, “A famished me found an instant noodles cup in the snacks tray at a hotel in Guangzhou. Seeing the tiny green circle sticker relieved me. “Vegetarian food at last!”I muttered as I grabbed the cup. It had a large colourful photo of a prawn covered in noodles. Evidently, fish is considered vegetarian there”.
“Similarly, in Disneyland in HK, I went to buy a packet of popcorn and asked if it was veg. “Yes sir. This vegetarian. Cooked in fish oil!” added the user."
T1OYEHJCVV_2XWRNA8XB85HKXS,"Judges have fundamental rights, including right to stand by family, says Delhi HC",_,"January 25, 2024 22:31 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/hc-judges-right-to-stand-by-family-9128060/,"The Delhi High Court recently observed judges by virtue of being in the position do not waive their fundamental rights, which are available to other citizens including their “social and private rights to look after and stand by their family”.
The HC, made the observation while dismissing the bail plea of a man (applicant) who has been accused of conspiring with the main accused, who has been booked for allegedly raping and cheating a judicial officer’s sister, and marrying her despite being already married.
A single judge bench of Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, in its January 24 order, observed that the applicant, “despite being a teacher of the main accused, had conspired with him to cheat the woman and her family.”
“To state that only because the brother of the victim is a judicial officer, the accused is not getting bail due to some influence without any iota of evidence in this regard is preposterous. Accepting this argument will be equivalent to accepting that a judicial officer in case of being victimized or being hurt or cheated as a family member, as in this case being the biological brother of the complainant, does not have the fundamental right to get justice for himself, his family or his immediate kith and kin,” the HC said.
It, further, said that to suggest that not granting bail to the applicant, would amount to taking sides in the judicial system since the person who has been cheated is a judicial officer’s kin, amounts to “judging the judicial system with a myopic eye”.
According to the prosecution, the main accused had befriended the woman on a matrimonial website and married her. Later, it was revealed that he was already married. The prosecution had alleged that the main accused’s profile on the matrimony website showed him as unmarried and he had shown interest in 1,411 profiles of women under different age groups.
The applicant had, the court prima facie observed, “convinced” the woman and her parents for the marriage by misleading them that the main accused was unmarried and his parents had passed away. On this “assurance”, Justice Sharma noted, the woman and her family acted and the main accused and complainant had got married. “The co-accused has targeted innocent women and the present accused in this case has been his close associate to help him succeed in his nefarious design of misguiding the family of the complainant and leading her to get married to him and extracting huge amount of money to his own and the bank account of the present accused for which evidence is on record. Such accused persons need to be dealt with a stern hand so that if granted bail, they will not indulge in similar activities of spoiling the lives of other women,” Justice Sharma underscored."

Studies in Asia and North America reveal high vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among masseurs and clients, emphasising the necessity for interventions to broaden the scope of HIV prevention, treatment and care within these establishments.
Dr Vijay Karanjkar, Additional Project Director of MDACS, said, “We lack information about specific spas or massage centres engaged in sex rackets. Therefore, our approach is to sensitise all workers in these establishments, addressing the risk of the likelihood of contracting HIV and STIs. Our training will focus on promoting condom usage and highlighting the risks associated with unprotected sex.”
MDACS has already conducted workshops in 26 spas and massage parlours in the city, with over 200 such centres earmarked for sensitisation.
The project also involves collaborations with non-governmental organisations (NGOs). These NGOs have organised health camps in two spas, reporting positive responses. HIV and STI counselling and testing for all employees were carried out, emphasising the convenience of workplace health check-ups.
Ganesh Acharya, an activist working for HIV patients, emphasised the importance of sensitising sex workers.
“Spa environments are potential hubs for exploitative practices, heightening vulnerability to health risks such as HIV. By fostering awareness, sex workers can make informed choices, promote safer practices, and seek necessary health interventions. This approach is pivotal in safeguarding their well-being and mitigating the spread of infections within this specific context,” he said."

This drama-in-the-sky, part ‘Top Gun’, part ‘Uri’, and part other Siddharth Anand films, has enough well-executed action set pieces, filled with several effective flourishes from its lead actors, to have coasted through. Why didn’t the film have enough confidence in its USP: the brave boys, and girls, looping those loops?
India’s most wanted ‘dushman’, as far as Hindi cinema goes, has forever and always been Pakistan. But didn’t we show them what’s what in the 2019 surgical strike, ‘Uri ’? Didn’t an ISI agent curl up and roll over in the director’s own 2021 ‘Pathaan’? I could go on, but you get the point.
So the first feeling when you hear pointed references to Pulwama, and a convoy being blown up, and ‘ghar mein ghusna’, is that of ennui. Why can’t Bollywood think of a new enemy? Or is that too much work? Don’t know about you, but I’m tired of terrorists with kohled eyes, plotting in make-shift shacks somewhere in Pakistan, snarling and shooting and scooting. Even the new face as the antagonist, Rishabh Sawhney as the Lashkar mastermind Azhar Akhtar, blow-dried long hair reaching the chin, one eye carefully bloodshot, does old things: stomp on brave Indian soldiers, and spout melodramatic dialogues dripping with hate.

Hrithik Roshan reunites with Anand after their ‘War’, this time as Shamsher Pathania, call sign Patty, as an ace fighter pilot — needless to say, he is ‘our best’ — who lays the table and washes up with as much dexterity as he flies his plane. Matching him on eye-candy stakes, is Deepika Padukone as helicopter pilot Minnal Rathore, aka Minni, who is as much an expert on rescue missions as any man. There is the bonding with the other aviators, chiefly Karan Singh Grover as Sartaj ‘Taj’ Gill, and Akshay Oberoi as Basheer ‘Bash’ Khan. The latter is your token patriotic Indian Muslim; there’s also a Sikh officer who gets the ‘comic relief’ lines before his ‘action scenes’. A Sardar being the butt of jokes? What else?
Last year, around the same time, we got from the same director, ‘Pathaan’, a spry spy saga. It was all about reclaiming ground that a long-time hero had to cede; it was also about the declaration that he wasn’t going anywhere. It was a lot of fun because it had the smarts to not take itself seriously. In ‘Fighter’, there’s an uneasy mix of wanting to be real in a plot awash with mainstream cliches: when the camera lingers for a moment too long on a pilot, you know he’s in for the chop. You know which one will be sacrificed; you know who will come home. You know a pair of reluctant parents will become aware of their ‘mistake’, and more tears will be shed. After a point, everything feels like a stretch: Minni’s line about ‘men and women being equal in the sky’ makes you want to cheer, but not when it comes around again.
This is one of those films that you wish that the desire to get the easy claps, with dialogues like ‘baap kaun hai’, and ‘har galli will become Indian Occupied Pakistan’, could have been kept at bay. A lot of effort has gone into keeping the proceedings at Air Force stations authentic, and there’s a great aerial sequence in the second half — I loved the snow whooshing off a row of fir trees — which can compare with the best of the ‘Top Gun’ flicks. Hrithik and Deepika make a great pair; Anil Kapoor, as fit as the hero, provides able support.
Succumbing to the current atmosphere of hyper-nationalism leads to bombast, which in turn weakens a film. Baaps don’t go around declaring who they are. They just know.

Ramesh Chennithala, the in-charge, will on Tuesday review the party’s preparations for the Lok Sabha elections in western Maharashtra, including Pune. The Pune seat is traditionally contested by the Congress, but the Opposition alliance is yet to make an official announcement.
As per directions of the Congress’s state unit, the Pune unit invited applications from aspirants for the Lok Sabha seat and 20 people have applied for the party ticket. They include legislator Ravindra Dhangekar; former legislators Mohan Joshi, Anant Gadgil, Balasaheb Shivarkar and Dipti Chowdhary; city Congress chief Arvind Shinde; senior leaders Ulhas Bagul, Abhay Chhajed, Sanjay Balgude, Datta Bahirat, Gopal Tiwari, Virendra Kirad and Sangeeta Tiwari and radio jockey Sangram Khopade.
The biggest task for Chennithala is to end factionalism in the party’s Pune unit before the Lok Sabha elections. “This will be the major issue that will crop up in the review meeting,” said a senior Congress leader.
After the Congress defeated the BJP in Kasba, part of the Pune Lok Sabha constituency, in an Assembly bypoll, the ticket aspirants have high hopes of regaining the seat for the party, which had lost it in the previous two general elections.
“If the party can defeat the BJP in its bastion of Kasba, it can also win the Pune Lok Sabha seat provided it contests the election unitedly as it did in the bypoll,” said a ticket aspirant.
The Congress, however, has been disintegrating in the city since the ouster of former MP Suresh Kalmadi, who had managed to keep everyone together.
“There has been not much effort from the state leadership to end factionalism in the city unit and everything rests on the newly appointed state in-charge, who is known to be an organisational person working at different levels in the party,” said another Congress leader.
According to him, local Congress leaders are busy pointing out the mistakes of one another to the state leadership rather than standing together."

“We have removed this ad,” an H&M spokesperson said on Monday. “We are deeply sorry for the offence this has caused and we are looking into how we present campaigns going forward.”

Italy will chair the G7, which also groups the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Canada, throughout 2024 and will host a summit in June.
Laying out Italy’s priorities for the first time, the source said core issues on the leaders’ agenda would include conflict in the Middle East, food security, climate change, development in Africa, engagement with China and Artificial Intelligence.
As in the last two G7 presidencies, the war in Ukraine will also be a major consideration, said the source, who was not authorised to go on the record talking about Italy’s plans.
The West’s once-staunch wartime support for Kyiv has appeared to waver in recent months amid political wrangling in Washington and Brussels that has held up the delivery of badly needed arms and funding.
However, the source said G7 leaders were determined to show they remained fully committed to Kyiv and could not risk showing signs of weakness two years after Russia invaded its neighbour. “We must change the narrative on Ukraine,” the source said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin had lost significant financial, military and diplomatic clout since the invasion.
Italy is planning to stage 20 ministerial meetings during its G7 presidency, kicking off with a three-day gathering from March 13-15 on industry, technology and digitalisation, which will put a spotlight on the fast-paced AI revolution.
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has already said that the dangers posed by AI will be a key issue for Italy’s G7 presidency and she will dedicate one session to the subject at the June 13-15 summit in Puglia, the source said.
Italy wants to focus on the impact of AI on jobs and inequality, while also laying down “ethical guardrails” for the development of the technology. Rome will also propose creating a steering committee to ensure greater G7 coordination on AI.
The source said G7 leaders were “pretty much on the same page” over AI, adding that there was broad consensus on most of the major issues facing the wealthy-nation club, including on how to deal with China.
There was a determination on all sides to avoid tensions with Beijing, the source said, adding: “Nobody wants to impede or put obstacles towards Chinese growth.”
There was also agreement, the source said, on the need to develop economies in Africa and try to stem illegal immigration – a domestic priority for Meloni, who is struggling to honour an 2022 election pledge to stem migrant flows."
TBXJSQBX4X_N1DX0S9UR075TV1,Sushil Kumar Modi on Karpoori Thakur: The common man’s man,Sushil Kumar Modi,"Updated: January 25, 2024 09:59 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sushil-kumar-modi-on-karpoori-thakur-the-common-mans-man-9126345/,"Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur was finally conferred the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour. The demand to confer this award on Karpooriji, the often unacknowledged pioneer of India’s social justice movement, was long overdue and much awaited. That the honour was conferred by the government led by Narendra Modi, another champion of social justice and backward classes, is a true tribute to the legend.
Karpooriji belonged to the “Nai” community, among the most backward communities in Bihar. Back then, no one would have thought that a member of this community would take on the Congress, fight for the rights of the backward classes and end up becoming one of the first non-Congress chief ministers of Bihar in 1970, and then come back again as CM.
Karpooriji studied only till the intermediate level. He had to cut short his education to join the country’s freedom movement. But this was no hindrance for this son of the soil — Karpooriji had learnt much through his experiences in poverty and backwardness.
Very early on, he realised that the benefit of reservation was being arrogated by the privileged backward classes. To undo this wrong, Karpooriji provided a separate 12 per cent reservation to the EBCs. Powerful BC communities like the Yadav, Kurmi and Koeri were given only 8 per cent reservation. While the Congress vacillated on implementing the report of the Mungeri Lal Commission, in 1978, Karpooriji showed courage and created quotas in government jobs for EBCs and BCs. The Karpoori Formula also gave women a share of 3 per cent and reserved another 3 per cent seats for the poor from the upper castes. It, therefore, tried to accommodate all sections of society.
The then Jan Sangh was a party to this decision — Kailashpati Mishra was the finance minister in Karpooriji’s government.
There were violent protests by those unsettled by the reservation formula. But Karpooriji stood firm. This decision not only changed the socio-political scenario of Bihar decisively but also changed the way backward classes were looked at in India.
Karpooriji’s brainchild was later emulated at the Centre when the Morarji Desai government constituted the Mandal Commission in 1979. While Congress again backtracked after the report was submitted in 1980, it was only 10 years later, in 1990, that the National Front government led by VP Singh implemented the Mandal Commission report.
Not just the Mandal Commission. In fact, PM Modi’s decision to grant 10 per cent reservation to EWS and 33 per cent reservation to women is inspired by the ideology which Karpooriji preached and practised.
As chief minister, he ensured that he was always in janta’s darbar — his house and office were always open to the public. He was always swarmed by people wanting to meet him — truly a janta’s CM.
Karpooriji was a staunch supporter of regional languages. As education minister in Bihar, when he realised that English was becoming an impediment in students passing the matriculation examination, he directed that English as a subject not be counted for passing matriculation. Liberals and the English-speaking gentry mocked this decision — they called it the “Karpoori Division”. But Karpooriji remained undeterred.
As an Opposition leader, it was  Karpooriji who set the trend of being the first responder. He was the first to reach accident sites in remote places in Bihar, irrespective of where he was. Such was his commitment and dedication to his people.
That Karpooriji was the epitome of simplicity and honesty is well-known. This quality was evident in all aspects of his life. He wore his trademark half-sleeve thick kurta and dhoti, rode a motorcycle, roamed without bodyguards and never promoted family in politics. When Karpooriji passed away, he left behind only an ancestral jhopdi and no vehicle or property and very little bank balance.
He took many other notable decisions, including abolishing malguzari, the government tax on unused land, prohibition of alcohol and free education till the matriculation level.
The Opposition tried to pull him down and many of his policies were met with stiff resistance, but Karpooriji’s popularity only increased. After all, he was the common man’s man.
Karpooriji was a true socialist and someone who fought against the Congress’s misrule. He lived up to the ideals and created ideals for others to follow. Unfortunately, his socialist disciples have now lost their way in the lust for power and have joined hands with the same Congress which Karpooriji  fought all his life.
Today in the hustle to garner support from backward classes, political parties remember Karpooriji , every year on his birthday. But they also ensure that he is forgotten as soon as the anniversary celebration is over. So short is our memory. It is due to this that despite repeated demands from backward classes for Bharat Ratna for Karpooriji , all political parties in power, to date, paid lip service to his ideals — and to such demands.
However, such great sons of the soil who have uplifted the most backward should never be forgotten. To recognise this contribution, a government which understands the pulse of the backward classes was needed. It is apt, therefore, that PM Modi, who has learnt from his struggles against poverty and backwardness, decided to finally honour Karpoori Thakur with the nation’s highest award.
Karpooriji’s birthday is over and political parties may have already forgotten him. But the Bharat Ratna has finally placed Karpooriji in the category that he always belonged.
PM Modi has ensured that principles on which Karpooriji lived will now be etched in this nation’s memory forever and will be followed. One hopes that his disciples, who have ventured away from his ideals and joined hands with the Congress, finally walk the talk, instead of merely remembering him next in the coming year.

TH8E7UMMOW_95I8R6VBRKJCWA3,"Ayodhya marks an inauguration, not closure",Ashutosh Varshney,"Updated: January 27, 2024 09:36 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ayodhya-inauguration-not-closure-9128944/,"Symbolically and discursively, the consecration of a Ram temple in Ayodhya has dealt a monumental blow to India’s constitutional republic. Legally and politically, however, the construction of a Hindu state remains unfinished, and it may not come about. This paradox needs to be understood and explained.
Consider, first, how the consecration represented not only a fusion of the state and religion, but also a union of the state with the majority religion, something that India’s Constitution-makers explicitly fought against and forbade. Even the ghastly violence of Partition, which accompanied the birth of a Muslim homeland in 1947, did not convince the Constitution-makers that post-Independence India should be a Hindu homeland. The Constitution-makers were firmly committed to the idea of religious neutrality of the state and religious equality of citizens.
Such high principles are not easy to practise in politics, in India or elsewhere, which inevitably raises the question of how one should evaluate political practice. In some circles, it is said that Indian secularism, presented as religious neutrality of the state, was an empty shell even under pre-Narendra Modi governments. All that PM Modi has done is taken the pretence away.
This argument is wrong. Political practice is normally not analysed in binary terms (“yes or no”). It is appraised on a scale (“more or less”). We judge whether the practice has been close to the ideal (1) or to its opposite (0). Thus, it is plausible to argue that in the pre-2014 era of Indian politics, the principle of religious neutrality was never fully executed, just as we can legitimately say that the idea of equality was not fully practised in the US or France, despite a constitutional commitment to it. The important thing is that, in India, the principle of religious neutrality was not abandoned for over seven decades, and was in fact repeatedly made the yardstick for judging state practice, just as ethnic, racial or religious equality was often the touchstone of evaluating state conduct in the US or France. The Ayodhya consecration has changed all that. It is not just a practical deviation from a normative practice. It has fully invalidated the principle of the state’s religious neutrality.
For illustration, ask a simple question. Can a Prime Minister lead a ceremony of religious consecration? To consecrate, according to the dictionary, means “to make or declare sacred”. That is typically done by a “holy” or religious figure. The very idea of a politician leading a consecration ceremony in modern times would be abhorrent to most religious leaders and theologians. But that was precisely the point. Regardless of what the Shankaracharyas or the scholars said, the Prime Minister led the consecration. For him and his organisation, it was unquestionably a political project.
Though Hinduism, unlike Catholicism, does not have a clearly established ecclesiastical hierarchy and, a bit like Protestantism, it is highly decentralised, the four Shankaracharyas, in the Sanatani tradition, are nonetheless viewed as epitomising the summit of Hinduism’s religious establishment. If they had led the consecration, it would have been a purely religious event. They were entirely absent.
Moreover, the consecration was not simply a union of the state and religion. The most political aspect of the pious event was the fusing of the state with the religion of the majority, the Hindus. Given the RSS’s century-long commitment to restoring Hindu dominance in India, which the 1950 Constitution denied, a Constitution which the RSS explicitly disowned, January 22 was aimed at taking a massive step towards a Hindu rashtra, or what many comparative scholars would call Hindu supremacy. Modi used new vectors of language — such as  Dev se desh (divinity to nationhood ) and Ram se rashtra ki chetna ka vistaar (Ram as a mode of the spread of national consciousness) -– to articulate Hindu supremacy.
But to see Ayodhya as a decisive victory of Hindu theocracy, or as the establishment of a Hindu nation, would be an overstatement. The term “Hindu theocracy” does not make sense without a clear dominance of the Hindu religious establishment. It is the political establishment of Hindu nationalism that dominated January 22, not the Shankaracharyas. And it is the RSS which will most probably dominate a possible Hindu rashtra in the future, not the religious heads.
Equally important, a Hindu nation will require legal changes, which codify Hindu supremacy and reduce Muslims, the key contestants in Ayodhya and the prime object of Hindu nationalist ire, to second class citizenship. Politically speaking, given the key ideological arguments of Hindu nationalism, Hindu primacy and Muslim marginalisation are two sides of the same coin. While January 22 is a monumental step towards Hindu primacy, the project still lacks legal foundations.
Legally, the biggest step thus far has been the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). India’s original Citizenship Act (1955) contained no religious distinction. But the CAA said that all, except Muslim, immigrants from the neighbouring Muslim-majority countries were eligible for citizenship. A National Registry of Citizens (NRC) was to follow the CAA, and its aim was to deny citizenship to those who did not have the right ancestry papers. Hindus without such papers would not lose citizenship, for the CAA could provide a cover. But a Muslim documentary deficit would be legally fatal, for the CAA could not help them. Losing citizenship can lead to disenfranchisement and possibly loss of welfare benefits. In India, only citizens can vote, and generally speaking, if not always, only citizens can receive state-mandated benefits.
The CAA has not been operationalised yet, nor has the NRC been announced as a central government policy. The biggest obstacle is federalism. The BJP not only has to win national elections, bring about legal changes through the national parliament and have them constitutionally approved by the judiciary, but it also needs to win many more states. States have the biggest machinery for policy implementation in India. If they don’t cooperate, many central legislations will simply fail. In economic policy, this problem is well-known. Delhi-legislated land reforms in the 1950s and nationalisation of grain trade in 1973 faltered on the bedrock of state resistance.
India will be a Hindu state if the BJP wins central and most state elections.  Elections and politics thus remain critical to India’s future. Ayodhya is not a Hindu nationalist closure. It is simply a very big start.

But that line demarcating religion and the State seems to be getting thinner,” Vjayan said after the consecration ceremony in a video message on social media.
Reacting to the event, Vijayan, whose party was the first to reject the invitation to take part in the ceremony, said, “Now, it has come to a point in time when the inauguration of a religious place of worship is being celebrated as a State event. Most of us have been invited to participate in the rituals. As those who pledged to preserve and protect our Constitution, let us reaffirm our commitment to its secular character by declining to participate in the event and upholding our constitutional responsibilities,” he said.
“Religion is a private affair and the Indian Constitution has minced no words in stating that all persons are equally entitled to the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion. As those who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of India, we ought to ensure that every person within our territories enjoys this right in equal measure. At the same time, we cannot be promoting one religion above all others, or demean one religion beneath every other. As our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had often opined, Indian secularism means separation of religion and state… This is a major departure from the times when our constitutional office-bearers have been cautious from taking part in religious events as it would cast aspersions on our credentials as a secular state,” he said.
Vijayan said secularism is the “soul of the democratic republic of India”. “It has been part of our identity as a nation right from the days of our national movement. Those who belonged to different faiths and those who were not part of religion had taken active part in the freedom struggle. This nation belongs to all people and all sections of Indian society in equal measure,” he said.
The CPI(M), in December, was the first Opposition party to turn down the invitation to attend the consecration ceremony on Monday. Party general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the event was “straightforward politicisation of the religious beliefs of the people, which is not in consonance with the Constitution.”
“As far as the Indian Constitution and the Supreme Court are concerned, they have very clearly said that the state shall not profess any particular religion or have any religious affiliation. What is happening in this inauguration ceremony is that it has been converted into a State-sponsored event with the Prime Minister, UP CM and others holding constitutional positions… Therefore, in these circumstances, I regret not being able to attend the event,” Yechury said last month.
CPI(M) leader and Politburo member Brinda Karat had also criticised the ceremony for politicising a religious event. “We respect the religious beliefs but they are connecting a religious programme with politics… This is the politicisation of a religious programme. This is not right,” Karat said last month.
The party, in a statement, had underlined its belief that religion is a personal choice while saying it was “most unfortunate” that “the BJP and RSS have converted a religious ceremony into a state-sponsored event”. “Our policy is to respect religious beliefs and the right of each individual to pursue their belief. Religion is a personal choice not to be converted into an instrument for political gain,” the statement said.
Though the Congress also announced that its top leaders would not attend the consecration event, for becoming an RSS-BJP event, it has left to its governments and leaders to mark the occasion. While the Siddaramaiah government refused to announce a holiday for the day, unlike most states, the Chief Minister was present at a temple event on Monday."

According to Anil Gandass, a wildlife expert who was part of the rescue operation, the tiger was inside a mustard field and moved away when they came to the spot. “We need to shoot the tranquiliser from within a range of 10-15 feet, but as it was moving and the mustard stalks were 6 feet tall, the rescue attempts failed,” said Gandass.
ST-2303, the male tiger, stays close to the Masani Barrage in the Rewari district of Haryana for water. “Nilgai and dogs are very common in the region, so the tiger wouldn’t have a hard time finding food,” said Gandass.
He said officials from the forest departments of Haryana and Rajasthan along with experts will try again to rescue the big cat. “He is in Kharkhada now and we will attempt in the day again as dusk falls quickly and fog decreases the visibility,” he added.
The tiger is suspected to have left its family to set up its territory as big cats do when they are around three years old. On Friday, some farmers in Rewari spotted the tiger in a vegetable produce field and alerted authorities.
The Alwar forest department said the male tiger in the Alwar Range, under the jurisdiction of the Kishangarh-Bas Wildlife Division, Ismailpur, has been roaming in the nearby areas over the past three months.
“The forest department’s team is regularly tracking its movements. On the morning of January 17, the tiger moved northward from the forest area towards the fields. On January 18, around 2pm, the tiger attacked a person near Khushkhera village, close to Bhiwadi. The victim received minor injuries, and after treatment at the nearby hospital, was discharged,” the Alwar forest department said in a release.
“Alwar Forest Range and Sariska’s special rescue team are attempting to locate the tiger. The district administration and police have been informed of regular patrolling,” it added."

He along with other Congress leaders distributed prasad to people on the occasion.
Joshi is vice president of the state Congress unit and is a former legislator. He had also contested the Lok Sabha elections in the past. “The maha aarti at the Rahalkar Ram Mandir was organised to mark the inauguration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. It received good response,” he said, adding bhajans were recited and prasad was distributed on the occasion.
It was attended by Dhangekar, former corporators Datta Bahirat, Sanjay Balgude, Rajani Tribhuvan, Lata Rajguru, party leader Rohit Tilak and many office-bearers. “Shri Ram is in the heart of every Indian citizen. Lord Ram is the deity of every person in the country and does not belong to any particular person or group or political party. If anyone tries to relate it to only one political party it will not be accepted by citizens,” Joshi said, adding the shilanyas of the temple in Ayodhya was done by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi but it was never used for political gains.
Dhanegkar, who was elected to the state Assembly last year, took up various initiatives in his constituency in the last few days to celebrate the inauguration of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
Dhangekar, who started his political career with the Shiv Sena, organised felicitation of kar sevaks followed by a firecrackers show near Bhide bridge on Sunday to mark the auspicious occasion.
The Congress legislator also felicitated the ‘Shree Ram Vadya Pathak’ drummers’ group, which performed at the Ram Mandir ceremony in Ayodhya. Besides, he distributed lamps in his constituency. “The Ram Temple inauguration is a proud moment for all citizens of the country. There has to be a big celebration and gifting lamps to citizens is my small contribution to the celebrations,” he had said."

As part of the programme, students of Class 11 and 12 are given “seed money” to start their business.
“It is being considered to start this programme for final-year and pre-final-year students in colleges, aiming to enable them to start their businesses after leaving college, thereby increasing employment opportunities. With this goal in mind, the (Chief Minister Arvind) Kejriwal government may allocate funds for entrepreneurship programmes in this year’s Budget,” said the Delhi government in a press note.
This year, the Kejriwal government will present its 10th Budget. The proposed Budget has received the cabinet’s approval and the file has now been sent to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) for his nod. Notably, this will be the first time Finance Minister Atishi will present the Budget.
During the preparation for the Budget, the government has sought suggestions from all stakeholders in Delhi; some of the recommendations have been included in the Budget. The proposed Budget reflects the government’s priorities and vision for the capital city, said the finance minister’s office in a statement.
During the session, the government will also present the ‘Outcome Budget’ for the financial year 2023-24, showcasing the achievements and progress made in the previous fiscal year.
This time, the Delhi government is presenting the Budget in February instead of March in view of the impending Lok Sabha elections.
Education, health, electricity, water, roads, and infrastructure will continue to be the government’s priority in the Budget, said officials.
“Water, roads, urban development, and various developmental projects: These aspects have been identified as top priorities for the forthcoming fiscal year, reflecting the government’s proactive approach towards addressing the diverse needs of the city and its residents,” said the official.
The total Budget of 2023-24 was Rs 78,800 crore with key focus on ‘Clean, Beautiful, and Modern’ Delhi. This year’s Budget is also anticipated to yield profits, said officials.
Further, officials said that preparations for the Budget have been underway for the last 20 days.
“On January 6, the CM chaired the first high-level meeting regarding the Budget. He held detailed discussions with all ministers on the upcoming Budget’s priorities. He explicitly stated that the Budget should be aligned with the concerns of the common people to bring more happiness into their lives…the government has always focused on education, health, electricity, water, and infrastructure…This year too, there will be a special emphasis on these areas,” according to the finance minister’s office."

Siddharth, who has previously directed Pathaan and War, said that his film is nothing like the Tom Cruise film and insisted that since there aren’t many films made within the world of fighter pilots, these comparisons are “inevitable”.
In a chat with Zoom, Siddharth said, “As a filmmaker, you have to be prepared that if you make a film on planes they will call it Top Gun because they have no reference point so they believe that we are not so creative, that we will do things that are a rip-off. We need to start looking at our films with a little bit more respect and not constantly believe that things are being ripped off. People do get inspired, even in the West, by content that is created in the east.”

Siddharth Anand was presumably speaking about a sequence in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning that fans found similar to a sequence in Pathaan. He said, “I have many instances where… lately also where I did some sequences and those sequences were similar to a film that came out later, a very very big franchise film in the West.” He insisted that he was “not saying they copied us and there is no way they would copy us so let’s be real. There are only that many things that you can do in action. and there will be overlaps. You just have to do it with an X-factor that makes it different.”

He reiterated that fans and social media users should be “proud” of the work that is being done in India and not assume that everything is copied from Hollywood. “We need to start being, as an audience and as people on social media, start being a little more proud of your own country and your country’s work and stop thinking that everything is inspired or copied from the West,” he said.
The director said that after watching the movie, one will realise that Fighter is a “desi film”. “That Top Gun conversation is going to bitten to dust in the first five minutes of the film,” he said.
Starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, Fighter is set to release on January 25.

BJP national president JP Nadda shared a video of the campaign song over X, stating, “A beautiful music video marking a decade of efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji, which presents his leadership, working style, and continuous efforts in a very inspirational manner. Such efforts are making the dreams of crores of Indians a reality. Come, let us all pledge to carry forward the chain of these efforts through this new campaign of BJP through this song.”  The song’s refrain says, ‘Sapne nahi hakikat boonte, tab hi toh sab Modi ko chunte’ (We weave reality, not dreams.

BJP in a statement, said that the party’s official campaign for the 2024 general elections was launched by Nadda in the virtual presence of PM Modi.
The Prime Minister is also scheduled to kick-start the party’s election campaign in Uttar Pradesh with a public rally in Bulandshahr on Thursday.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi addressed 50 lakh first-time voters. In his speech, he encouraged the youth to defeat ‘parivarwadi’ (dynastic) parties with the “power” of their vote. “Family-run parties never allow other youngsters to move ahead, you have to defeat them with your votes,” the PM said.
BJP is also expected to release its first list of candidates for the general elections soon, sources told The Indian Express. Stepping up its outreach programmes, the party expects to increase its vote share from 37.36 per cent to over 50 per cent in this Lok Sabha election."

The police said the banner was set on fire by the members of the right-wing Hindutva outfits. After the incident, heavy police deployment was made inside and outside the campus. The police also deployed riot control vans and quick response teams. The Deccan Gymkhana police said the incident took place around 1.30 pm on the FTII campus, which is located on Law College Road in Pune city.
“Preliminary probe has revealed that a banner was displayed on the campus by the FTII Students’ Association. Our information also suggests that screening of a film and an exhibition of photos related to the history of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi issue was also organised on the campus,” said an officer from Deccan Gymkhana police station.
Based on the complaint filed by Sanjay Jadhav (54), a security officer posted at the FTII, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered later in the evening against 12 to 15 persons who had entered the campus. “Investigation has revealed that the members of the group do not belong to one outfit but multiple Hindutva right-wing groups based in Pune. We are in the process of identifying all the persons who were part of the group,” the officer said.
The FIR states, “Around 1.30 pm, a group of 12 to 15 persons gathered outside the FTII campus in an unauthorised manner. They were asking how FTII students can be involved in ‘anti-national’ acts. They manhandled the security personnel and entered the campus illegally and were chanting slogans. They were asking the students why they were doing ‘anti-national’ acts. They thrashed the students and pulled down and tore the banner and set it on fire and also threatened the students.”
When contacted, senior inspector Vipin Hasabnis, in-charge of Deccan Gymkhana police station, said, “As soon as we received information, teams were dispatched. Our personnel intervened and brought the situation under control.” The police said while no arrests were made in the case till late on Tuesday, notices will be issued to those who are identified and they will be asked to present themselves before the police.
Another officer from the police station said, “Some people have approached us and given a complaint application against the FTII students for putting up the banner. They also claimed that the FTII students assaulted the group that had entered the premises. These allegations are being verified.” When asked if anyone was injured in the incident, the police said some people had been sent for medical examination and the reports revealed no serious injuries.
The police have invoked IPC sections pertaining to unlawful assembly, rioting, causing hurt, trespassing, damage to property and criminal intimidation. Pravin Padwal, member of a Hindutva outfit named Samastha Hindu Bandhav, who was part of the group, said, “What FTII students had written on the banner was against India. We were asking them to take down the banner but they did not. So we had to pull it down and burn it.”
Documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan, whose Ram Ke Naam was screened at the institute on Monday, said he was aware of the screening and had a chat with FTII students on Zoom. “A similar incident occurred yesterday in Kerala regarding the screening of the same movie. Just a day before yesterday, three organisers in Hyderabad were arrested by the police for the screening of a movie in a restaurant,” he said.
While calling the incident an attack on freedom of expression, he said that the movie is legal and has been watched by the whole nation."

Speaking at India Global Forum’s 6th annual UK-India Parliamentary Lunch at the House of Lords on Wednesday, Cleverly said that the intellectual horsepower of India is enormous and getting bigger.
“The intellectual horsepower of India is enormous and getting bigger. Whether it is dealing with potential future pandemics or dealing with non-communicable diseases or dealing with the opportunities and risks of Artificial Intelligence or financial services or sustainable agriculture, I struggle to think of any sector where coordination and cooperation between the UK and India will not be a force for good in the world,” he said.
Against the backdrop of major global conflicts, and following the first visit by an Indian Defence Minister (Rajnath Singh) to Britain in 22 years, Cleverly emphasised the vitality of the partnership in preventing conflict from “spilling over”. “It was incredibly important that India’s Defence Minister visited the UK because in a turbulent world, and a potentially turbulent region, having strong and long-standing partners, as we do with India, closely coordinating on security on the preservation of peace is incredibly important.
“Of course, the military relationship between India and the UK is very long-standing. I hope that together, demonstrating strength of purpose, demonstrating a commitment to democracy, and demonstrating a willingness to defend our values, the UK and India can work to prevent conflict spilling over and engulfing other parts of the world,” Cleverly was quoted as saying by a media release issued by the India Global Forum.
Highlighting the strides the Indian economy has made in recent years, Sujit Ghosh, India’s Deputy High Commissioner said that India is not just creating opportunities for its people but also for the rest of the globe. “India is not just creating opportunities for its people but also for the rest of the globe. The UK is uniquely positioned to benefit from India’s rise. The time has come for our friends in the UK to shed their old lenses and see India for what it is,” he said.

Co-hosted by the Indian High Commission in the UK and Lord Jitesh Gadhia, the UK-India Parliamentary Lunch convened key players from the worlds of politics, business and finance over a sit-down lunch at the House of Lords to celebrate the growing ties between the two democracies.
Referring to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron’s comments on the global conflict dashboard flashing red lights, India Global Forum Chairman and CEO Manoj Ladwa said: “As we have seen, approaches and responses can vary, even between the closest of partners. These divergences are more about nuance and emphasis, rather than the fundamental values of the rule of law, freedom of belief, diversity and inclusion, freer trade, and democracy, that we all so cherish. “In such times, democracies must work harder to work together. Because we all know, democracies work best, when democracies work together,” Ladwa said.

UJS68VWHTQ_1R98GXO35PHSQ95,"In a first, US executes prisoner with new nitrogen asphyxiation method",_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 19:06 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-executes-prisoner-nitrogen-asphyxiation-9128569/,"Alabama on Thursday executed convicted murderer Kenneth Smith, who held his breath in vain as officials asphyxiated him with nitrogen gas, the first use of a new method of capital punishment since lethal injections began in the US four decades ago.
Smith, convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, was a rare prisoner who had already survived one execution attempt. In November 2022, Alabama officials aborted his execution by lethal injection after struggling for hours to insert an intravenous line’s needle in his body.
The state has called its new closely watched protocol “the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.” It predicted Smith would lose consciousness in under a minute and die soon after, although witnesses on Thursday said it appeared to take several minutes longer.
Alabama has touted asphyxiation as a simpler alternative for prison systems that struggle to find either veins or the required drugs for lethal injections.
Human rights groups, United Nations torture experts and lawyers for Smith had sought to prevent it, saying the method was risky, experimental and could lead to an agonising death or non-fatal injury.
In Smith’s second and final trip to the execution chamber on Thursday, executioners restrained him in a gurney and strapped a commercial industrial-safety respirator mask to his face. A canister of pure nitrogen was attached to the mask that, once flowing, deprived him of oxygen. The execution began at 7:53 pm (0153 GMT Friday) and Smith was declared dead at 8:25 pm (0225 GMT), prison officials said.
Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes after the nitrogen was activated, according to five journalists who were allowed to watch the execution through glass as media witnesses. Although the mask was also secured to the gurney, he then began shaking his head and writhing for about two minutes, and then could be seen breathing deeply for several minutes before his breathing slowed and became imperceptible, the witnesses said.
“It appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could,” Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm told a press conference. “He struggled against the restraints a little bit but it’s an involuntary movement and some agonal breathing. So that was all expected.”
Rev. Jeff Hood, Smith’s spiritual adviser, was at Smith’s side for the execution, and said prison officials in the room “were visibly surprised at how bad this thing went.”
“What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,” Hood, attending his fifth execution in the last 15 months, told reporters. “We saw minutes of someone heaving back and forth. We saw spit. We saw all sorts of stuff from his mouth develop on the mask. We saw this mask tied to the gurney, and him ripping his head forward over and over and over again.” Before the nitrogen was switched on, Smith made a lengthy final statement that began: “Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward.”
His wife and other relatives attended and he gestured towards them. “I’m leaving with love, peace and light,” he said, according to media witnesses. “Love all of you.”
Failed challenges
Smith mounted legal challenges in federal courts arguing that Alabama’s new method amounted to unconstitutional “cruel and unusual punishment,” but he failed to cross the high bar needed to have a judge order a delay of his execution.
His lawyers raised fears the mask would not properly seal against Smith’s face, allowing oxygen to seep in, delaying or even averting the moment of unconsciousness but risking serious brain injury.
Though poisonous gases such as hydrogen cyanide have been used in executions in the US and beyond in the past, this was the first time a death sentence was carried out anywhere using an inert gas to suffocate someone, capital punishment experts say.
Oklahoma and Mississippi have also approved nitrogen asphyxiation methods for executions, but have yet to deploy it.
Smith, who has suffered from nausea since he survived his first execution attempt, also raised concerns he would vomit into the mask and choke. In response, prison officials said they would serve him his final meal on Thursday morning and forbid any solid foods after 10 am. His final meal was steak, hash browns and eggs.
The US Supreme Court’s conservative majority rejected Smith’s final appeal to delay his death on Thursday evening, and the execution began soon after.
“On March 18, 1988, 45-year-old Elizabeth Sennett’s life was brutally taken from her by Kenneth Eugene Smith,” Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, a Republican, said in a statement. “After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr. Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes.”
Smith was convicted of murdering Sennett, a preacher’s wife, after he and accomplices each accepted a $1,000 fee from her husband to kill her, according to trial testimony. Eleven of 12 jurors voted to sentence Smith to life in prison, but an Alabama judge overruled their recommendation under a law that has since been abolished as unconstitutional.
Several of Sennett’s relatives attended the execution and told reporters they had forgiven Sennett’s killers. “Nothing that happened here today is going to bring mom back,” Mike Sennett said. “It’s a bittersweet day, we’re not going to be jumping around, hooping and hollering, hooraying and all that, that’s not us. We’re glad this day is over.”"

Before he went missing, Akolkar, who is now in his 40s, worked as a full-time activist of the Sanatan Sanstha and was appointed the Pune district convener of its sister outfit, the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS).
He co-ordinated several campaigns launched by the HJS in Pune, including one in June 2009 against the Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire, claiming that the film showed Hindus in a bad light. A resident of Shaniwar Peth, he was visible during various public meetings and press conferences of the Sanatan Sanstha and HJS.
Link to 2009 Goa blast
As per police records, the Sanatan Sanstha was opposed to a Narkasur effigy competition in Goa’s Madgaon. On October 16, 2009, the eve of Diwali, its members Malgonda Patil and Yogesh Naik, then residing in Goa, were allegedly carrying a bomb on a scooter to plant it near the competition venue when it exploded prematurely, leading to their death.
The police arrested six Sanatan Sanstha members in connection with the blast, while Akolkar, Rudra Patil of Sangli, and Jay Prakash alias Anna of Mangalore were named wanted accused and continue to remain on the run. The probe was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).
As per the submission made by the police before the court, Akolkar was among the suspects, including Malgonda and Yogesh, who had allegedly “prepared IEDs” and conducted “test blasts” on the hill behind the house of one Laxmikant Naik in Talaulim village of Goa between “August 26 and 28, 2009.”
The NIA however received a major setback as a special court in Mapusa, Goa, acquitted all the six arrested accused in December 2013.
The police, however, point out that it is a fact that a bomb blast took place and those linked to the Sanatan Sanstha died in the blast. The investigators also claimed to have records of phone calls between Akolkar and the co-accused on the day of the blast and even before.
Lawyers representing the accused, however, said that the investigation was false and that all the allegations against the Sanatan Sanstha members were baseless. Meanwhile, the search for Akolkar and the other wanted accused continued. An Interpol notice was also issued against him.
Narendra Dabholkar’s murder Even though Akolkar remained untraceable, his name cropped up in the murder investigation of rationalist and activist Dr Narendra Dabholkar. The founder of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (ANIS), Dabholkar was shot dead on the VR Shinde Bridge in Pune on August 20, 2013, when he was out for a morning walk.
In January 2014, the Pune city police launched a probe and arrested alleged illegal firearms dealer Manish Nagori and his aide Vilas Khandelwal. Meanwhile, investigators claimed that a ballistic examination of one of the firearms seized from them following their arrest by the ATS in October 2013 suggested that it matched the “markings” on a cartridge seized from the Dabholkar murder spot in Pune.
The CBI took over the probe in this case in June 2014, but never hinted at the involvement of Nagori and Khandelwal. Meanwhile, Communist leader Govind Pansare was shot dead in Kolhapur while he was on a morning walk with his wife Uma on February 16, 2015. The murder bore similarities with Dabholkar’s killing.
During the investigation, the CBI recorded the statement of Sanjay Arun Sadvilkar, a Kolhapur-based artisan who was a witness in the Govind Pansare murder case. Based on Sadvilkar’s statement, the CBI arrested a Sanatan Sanstha seeker (sadhak) and ENT surgeon Dr Virendrasinh Tawade in the Dabholkar murder case on June 10, 2016.
In September 2016, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Tawade, naming Sarang Akolkar and another Sanatan Sanstha seeker Vinay Pawar as the two assailants who shot Dabholkar.
This chargesheet claimed that Tawade and Akolkar had a meeting with Sadvilkar in 2013. It is stated that Tawade allegedly wanted to manufacture weapons with Sadvilkar’s help and “Akolkar had for this purpose brought samples of one country-made pistol and one country-made revolver of high quality.”
In his statement to the CBI, Sadvilkar described how Tawade allegedly demanded “chocolates”, referring to bullets, to be used for the pistol and revolver shown by Akolkar. The CBI also stated in the chargesheet that Tawade allegedly conspired with Pawar and Akolkar to kill Dabholkar “owing to the ideological differences between ANIS and Sanatan Sanstha”. The CBI had also issued sketches of Akolkar and Pawar and announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh to anybody giving information about the suspects.
But the CBI later contradicted its own claim and named Hindutva activists Sachin Prakashrao Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, arrested in August 2018, as the two men who had opened fire at Dabholkar.
The CBI chargesheeted Andure, Kalaskar and three others and the trial in this case is on before a special court in Pune even as no information is available on Akolkar’s whereabouts."

The sample container landed on Earth in September but two fasteners of the container were stuck, preventing the opening of the container.
But on January 10, NASA engineers were able to remove the two stuck fasteners that prevented the opening of the sample container. The container carries precious cargo — about 250 grams of material from the asteroid Bennu collected by the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft about two years ago.
After seven years in space, the OSIRIX-REx mission “parcel dropped” the sample container to Earth without entering the planet’s atmosphere. The canister was dropped with a precise trajectory, causing it to land at a location in a Utah desert chosen by the American space agency.
An initial analysis of some material that was stuck on the arm used to collect the sample revealed evidence of high carbon content and water. Essentially, it indicated the presence of important building blocks of life on the 4.5-billion-year-old asteroid.
After opening the full sample container, NASA officials used high-resolution precision photography and a semio-automated focus stacking procedure to capture the above photograph of the open TAGSAM (Touch-and-Go-Sample-Acquisition-Mechanism) head with the asteroid material inside.
The next step is for the team to remove the round metal collar that you can see in the image and transfer the sample from the TAGSAM head into sample trays. The samples will once again be photographed after they are transferred to the trays, and they will be stored at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas."

According to police sources, Banerjee was returning to Kolkata after presiding over an administrative meeting in Burdwan. Near the Burdwan city, her convoy encountered what she claimed was a car speeding at 200 kmph. Banerjee’s driver applied the brakes but her head hit the dashboard, leading to swelling and concussion, she said.
After returning from Burdwan she met Governor C V Ananda Bose at Raj Bhawan around evening. After the meeting, the Chief Minister said, “I did not see the car. We were coming out from a small road and it suddenly came in front of us at a speed of 200 km per hour. I could have died on the spot.”
She added, “I got an injury on my forehead. I have a concussion as well and there is swelling. I have pain in my head too but I finished my work. I survived with the blessings of the people. I have taken medicine but I am feeling very cold. So, I am going back to my house now.”
During her meeting in Burdwan, Banerjee said, “Several thousand teachers would have been appointed but Ram (the BJP) and Bam (Left Front) filed court cases and blocked the appointments. Around 60-70 thousand youth could have got jobs in schools. It is stuck in court complications now. Vacancies must be filled by solving such problems. They have tied the hands of the government. I will appeal to the court to arrange for the vacancies to be filled.”
Earlier, while visiting Jalpaiguri in North Bengal in June last year, amid inclement weather, a chopper Banerjee had boarded malfunctioned. It had to make an emergency landing at the Sevoke Airbase and while deboarding, she injured her leg and waist."

He was accompanied by his wife, Latha Rajinikanth, brother Sathyanarayana Rao and his grandson, Linga. At the airport, the actor spoke to the media and shared his experience of visiting the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. He also reacted to the Pran Pratishtha ceremony being touted as a political event.
Rajinikanth was seated with the other dignitaries in the first row at the Pran Pratishtha ceremony. He was among the first few people to get the ‘darshan’ of the Ram Lalla idol. India Today reported the actor as saying, “I had a great darshan. After the Ram temple was opened, I was among the first 150 people to witness [the Ram Lalla idol], and it gave me immense happiness.”
While some people called the inauguration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya a political event, Rajinikanth said, “For me, this is spirituality and not politics. Everyone can have different opinions, and it doesn’t have to match every time.”

Earlier, filmmaker Pa Ranjith had commented on Rajinikanth attending Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha ceremony. He said, “It’s his choice to go to the Ram Temple. But he stated that this is a conclusion to a 500-year-old problem. We have to question the politics behind it. I have a critique of his opinion beyond whether he is right or wrong.”
Rajinikanth was joined by many other film celebrities at the Ram Mandir inauguration including Ram Charan, Chiranjeevi, Dhanush, Amitabh Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif.
After the inauguration of the temple, the Tamil superstar promised to visit the temple annually and called it a “historic” event. A video clip from the ceremony also surfaced on social media which had PM Modi seemingly asking if the megastar was doing well, to which he responded with his hands that he was fine."

Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar and leaders from other communist parties have also been invited for the meeting, an indication VBA is included in the MVA. The party will discuss seat sharing with the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena and the talks will decide the future course of action for the VBA.
Shiv Sena UBT MP Sanjay Raut said seat sharing talks were in the last stage and a final decision will be taken on Thursday. “The final discussion on seat sharing will be taken tomorrow (Thursday). A meeting of all MVA leaders has been convened to discuss and decide the matter. We have also invited VBA’s Prakash Ambedkar as well as some other communist and left party leaders,” Raut said.
Even though the Sena UBT and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi formed an alliance a year ago, the VBA is not a part of the MVA, since the Congress and NCP never gave its nod for the party’s inclusion in the opposition alliance. This irked Ambedkar and VBA leaders, and the party had announced going solo in all 48 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
The Sharad Pawar-led NCP faction then showed it’s willingness to include VBA in the MVA, however the Congress is yet to take a decision on it and seat sharing discussions remained pending. Now, the MVA inviting Ambedkar for seat sharing talks indicates that the VBA’s inclusion in the MVA has been finalised but the final outcome will be cleared once the seat-sharing formula is finalised.
“Maha Vikas Aghadi seat allocation is almost done. Shiv Sena (UBT) has always been contesting on 23 seats. The Shiv Sena has a huge strength in these 23 constituencies. Hence, I have been saying Shiv Sena candidates will contest and win 23 seats. Congress-NCP is with us. And Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi is in alliance with Shiv Sena. VBA surely has a place in MVA and we are going to have a discussion on the seat sharing allotment on Thursday. All three parties are united and we are united to win,” Raut added.
Earlier, Raut had said that the Sena UBT staked claim on 23 seats and will get 23 seats to contest in the LS polls. The demand created friction between Congress and Sena UBT.
When asked if the MVA’s seat allocation formula will be sealed on Thursday, Raut said, “We do not agree with this ‘formula’ word. We are fighting together. One seat going here and there during allocation will not affect much. Ultimately, this is not a numbers game but we are together to win the 48 Lok Sabha seats together. So I don’t believe this formula. If we want to defeat the dictatorship in the country, we have to fight the battle without any formula.”"

Until he ran his little fingers first over the actor’s chiselled face and then, Khan’s bracelet.
During their 30-minute meeting, Salman made Jaganbeer a promise: they would meet again if he fought cancer like a champion. Five years later, both Salman and Jaganbeer kept their word.
In a heartwarming reunion at the actor’s Bandra house in December last year, Jaganbeer, 9, laid his eyes on Salman for the first time after he was declared cancer-free following nine rounds of chemotherapy and four of radiation.
His mother Sukhbir Kaur, 42, said Jaganbeer was a little over three years old when he lost his sight suddenly. Doctors discovered a coin-sized cancerous tumour in his forehead that exerted pressure on a nerve, leading to his abrupt visual impairment. They suggested taking him to Delhi or Mumbai for treatment.
Sukhbir said her husband Pushpinder Singh, 42, and she were at a loss over how to explain their little son his diagnosis. They just told him that they were headed to Mumbai and Jaganbeer assumed they were going to meet Salman.
“Looking at his excitement over meeting Salman, we decided not to tell him the truth. We felt he would get scared, which could affect his condition adversely. Even after he was admitted to the hospital, we would keep promising him a visit from Salman,” she said.
Soon, the paediatric ward officials heard about his wish. Since the doctors were concerned that Jaganbeer might never regain his sight, the hospital’s Improving Paediatric Cancer Care and Treatment (ImPaCCT) Foundation and NGO Anjeze Charitable Trust partnered to reach out to Salman.
“They made a video about Jaganbeer’s wish and sent it to Salman, but we were sceptical. After all, why would he come to meet common people like us,” said Sukhbir.
When Salman turned up at the hospital to meet Jaganbeer, the boy thought his parents were still bluffing.
“He touched the actor’s face and shoulders, but was still unsure. Salman tried to convince him too, but he was still not convinced. Then, Jaganbeer touched the actor’s bracelet, something Salman always wears. He was so excited that he burst into laughter,” recalled the mother.
What happened next, she said, left everyone astonished. “Jaganbeer had undergone chemotherapy the previous day. He was feeling weak and itchy all over. When Salman asked him about his wish, Jaganbeer, who was in pain and feeling restless, said he wished for the actor to scratch his back and shoulders. Looking at his condition, Salman told him to keep fighting and promised to meet him again if he obeyed him,” she said.
Talking about the reunion, Salman said, “Being Human Foundation (his charitable trust) and I are always happy to support cancer patients being treated at Tata Memorial Centre.”
Shalini Jatia, the officer incharge of the hospital’s ImPaCCT Foundation, said, “Such encounters have a profoundly positive impact on children.”
Sukhbir said her son is now cancer-free after undergoing a rigorous regimen of chemotherapy and follow-up treatments. “He regained his sight partially — which is a miracle. Though his visual impairment registers at 99 per cent in all eye tests, he can see everything. He attends regular school,” she added.
Jaganbeer told The Indian Express, “At first, I could only make out when the lights were turned on and off. I can read now if words are large in size. I could not recognise the colour green initially, but that has also improved.”
Throughout these milestones, Sukhbir said, Salman’s team was in touch with them and even made arrangements for the reunion. “The reunion was not just a happy occasion for me, but a testimony to my son’s struggles with cancer and visual impairment.”"
UWMI4OL1HG_UKST5E1NSVRMJLR,IPS officer who was suspended for ‘extracting teeth during torture sessions’ reinstated by Tamil Nadu govt,Arun Janardhanan,"Updated: January 29, 2024 09:03 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/ips-officer-suspended-extracting-teeth-torture-sessions-tamil-nadu-govt-9125898/,"The Tamil Nadu government has revoked the suspension of Balveer Singh, a former Assistant Superintendent of Police in Ambasamudram who was accused of custodial torture in four cases – specifically, extracting the teeth of 15 suspects. The move has prompted his alleged victims to approach the Madras High Court to contest the government’s decision.
A senior official in the state home ministry told The Indian Express that the suspension of Singh, a 2020 batch IPS officer who was implicated in cases of custodial torture at Vikramasingapuram, Ambasamudram, and Kallidaikurichi police stations, has been revoked. The official attributed the decision to the state DGP’s office, citing Singh’s extended suspension period exceeding six months.
“Senior IPS officers consider these (circumstances) sufficient punishment, given his youth and potential career impact. They argued that an indefinite suspension, especially with the trial’s lengthy duration, would be detrimental to his career,” the official explained.
Regarding the legal validity of this decision, the official emphasised that the chargesheet has been filed and the trial has commenced. “Now that the investigation is over and the case is before the judiciary for trial, revoking his suspension will not affect the case,” they said.
The office of the state DGP confirmed the decision was made last Friday. Asked about the potential conflict between the DMK government and influential IPS officers in the decision, the official clarified there were no objections from the state government.
“However, Singh will not be assigned Law and Order duties or any role involving public interaction. We are also considering surrendering him back to the National Police Academy,” the official said.
Singh’s alleged torture methods, which included tooth extraction using jelly rock and, in two cases, crushing the testicle of suspects, had caused widespread outrage.
Singh was suspended on March 29 last year and an initial investigation by a senior IAS officer concluded in April. The case was subsequently transferred to the CB-CID, which filed a chargesheet in September against Singh and a dozen junior officers, including inspectors and constables.
They were charged under IPC sections 294(b) (obscene acts), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons), and 506(1) (criminal intimidation), along with Sections 109, 201, 167, and 220 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. By December, all the accused had been granted bail.
There have been two hearings in the case so far.
Singh and his lawyer were unavailable for comment.
In March 2023, a Tirunelveli-based lawyer released purported evidence of the custodial torture implicating Singh, who is originally from Tonk in Rajasthan. Following backlash, Chief Minister M K Stalin announced Singh’s suspension in the assembly.
In the last week of March 2023, victims described to The Indian Express a consistent pattern in Singh’s alleged torture sessions – changing into casual attire, donning gloves and sandals, extracting teeth, and forcing victims to clean their blood. The methods allegedly included using sharp jelly rocks and specialised equipment. Junior officers assisting Singh were either unwilling or unable to object due to language barriers, his victims claimed.
Despite victim testimonies, the government initially did not file an FIR but conducted an investigation led by an IAS officer. The government and the then DGP, as a result, faced accusations of shielding Singh. Ultimately, legal action was initiated, and several officers were shunted out from their post for their alleged assistance or inaction in the case, including the then Tirunelveli Superintendent of Police.
The CB-CID police completed investigations in all four cases and chargesheeted Singh.
The victims’ lawyer, Maharajan, expressed dismay at the government’s decision, and said they will challenge it in the Madras HC. “Revoking his suspension is a betrayal of the victims, who believed that the state government would deliver justice.”"
UX3PUBWILL_RHLUPR55V0KJTXA,Bharat Ratna for Karpoori Thakur: How the BJP is creating a narrative of empowerment and inclusion,Badri Narayan,"Updated: January 24, 2024 15:14 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bharat-ratna-for-karpoori-thakur-bjp-9125554/,"In his speech at the consecration (pran pratishtha samaroh) of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about a squirrel (gilahari) that finds mention in the Ramayana. He spoke of it as a symbol of the weakest and most marginal members of society and said that, like Lord Ram, we need to acknowledge the value and contributions of the weakest among us.
Soon after the event in Ayodhya, the President of India announced that the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of India, would be posthumously conferred on Karpoori Thakur, a leader who had struggled all his life for the empowerment of the weakest. The announcement came a day before Thakur’s birth centenary. Is the timing of both these developments coincidental? I believe they are connected, showing how the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its politics are moving towards the inclusion and empowerment of the most marginal social groups. These decisions are part of a well-designed plan of the BJP to create a political narrative of the empowerment of the poor and marginalised communities which, like the squirrels in the Ramayana, are not yet politically visible and assertive. The current emphasis of PM Modi and the BJP on “garib kalyan” (welfare of the poor) and social justice circulates as the central metaphor of this well-conceived political narrative.
Thakur, a former chief minister of Bihar, who died in 1988, embodies various socio-political meanings: One, as the first non-Congress chief minister of the politically important state of Bihar; two, as a non-Congress socialist politician; three, as a political icon born in a most backward caste (MBC); four, as the “Jan Nayak” who worked hard to deliver social justice to the poor and marginalised throughout his life. The announcement of the Bharat Ratna to Thakur is a message to respect all these political values and honour the dedication which he represented as a leader and public servant. The politics of selection often reflects the nature and values of a party. The conferment of the Bharat Ratna on Thakur shows that the new BJP which has emerged under the leadership of PM Modi is trying to bring together the so-far-unheard voices from the margins and transform them into a message of democratic politics.
Thakur represented the departure of Bihar politics from the dominance of upper castes. He is also a symbol of “non-Congressism” which suits the BJP. PM Modi usually articulates non-Congressism as a critique of and alternative to Congress politics. Thakur is remembered for two political decisions that he made during his reign as a two-term chief minister of Bihar. The first was the removal of English as a compulsory subject from the matriculation syllabus in the state. The second was his implementation of the Mungeri Lal Commission’s report, which recommended 26 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes and various kinds of poor in state government jobs. This is known as the Karpoori Thakur Formula, which identified multilayered deprivation and multiple marginalities in society. It proposed a multilayered reservation formula with the clear provision of quota within quota for EBCs (Extremely Backward Castes), women and even the poor among the upper castes. This formula identified the need for the creation of the EBC-MBC category under OBC. This formula later played a foundational role in the making of Nitish Kumar’s “ati pichhada” (Extremely Backward) and Mahadalit-based policies and politics. The BJP also believes in the policy of quota to address multiple levels and layers of marginalities in Indian society.
PM Modi will soon be visiting Bihar where the decision to confer the Bharat Ratna on Thakur may have a deep political impact. The recent caste survey in the state reported that OBCs form 63 per cent of the population, among which EBCs constitute 36 per cent. While Thakur was the OBC face of Bihar politics, he was also a political icon among the EBCs. An MBC youth studying in a Patna college told me that “[Thakur] was Ambedkar for us”. He is seen as a leader who was sensitive toward protecting the interests of the EBCs from the dominance of a few OBC castes. For the BJP, which is trying to expand its politics among non-dominant OBC castes, such as EBCs, in Bihar, this decision may play an important role in creating trust capital for the party. The BJP has to compete with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which has a strong base among the Yadav community in Bihar and the Nitish Kumar-led JDU, whose caste base lies among the major non-Yadav OBC communities such as Koeri, Kurmi and Kushwaha mainly, but which also attracts EBCs and a section of upper castes. If the BJP creates an impact on the EBCs, adding them to its traditional caste base, such as upper castes, Vaishya and Nishad communities, it may succeed in forging a winnable alliance in Bihar politics.

UXAOEJ7AKE_O1TCYIY3Z0211MW,Sanjay Srivastava writes: The temple in Ayodhya is more about the present than the past,Sanjay Srivastava,"Updated: January 26, 2024 09:41 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-temple-and-the-consumerism-of-new-hinduism-9122870/,"If we consider the completely this-world contexts of the temple inauguration in Ayodhya – cameras, social media, helicopters, etc. – we might say that it fulfils an old Nehruvian dream. Religiosity has been effectively banished from the public life of the nation. However, as delicious as the irony is, it doesn’t really tell us very much about the nature of religious beliefs and its completely plastic nature. Older – well-meaning – certainties about what it is don’t help us in understanding the present.
Over the past few months, there have been at least two kinds of distinct ideas about the temple. The first suggests that it is the result of a “Hindu” rage based on what happened 500 years ago. And that there is a depth of feeling that has continued to exist in the same form for five centuries. This is a simplistic understanding of identities and how they are experienced through time. To subscribe to this view would be like saying that we feel the same way towards, say, cruelty to animals or the role of women in society now as we did 500 years ago.
The temple owes little to 500 years of constant rage and everything to the circumstances of the present. The most significant of these is the rise of the spectacles and a fundamental shift in thinking where Hinduism is about the outer world and spectacular displays of belief. There is no “rage”, as suggested by some, over what happened 500 years ago and as a consequence of which Hindus insist that their temple be re-built at the place where it was supposedly demolished.
We tend to think of the past as if there is a direct and transparent connection between it and the present and assume that we have always felt the same way about, say, religious identity. We know, for example, that in the battle for succession between Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh, each was supported by a nearly equal number of Hindu kings and nobles. The latter were not particularly deeply invested in their Hindu identity. As kings and rulers, they were interested in deploying whatever strategy they thought might gain them the maximum benefit in staying on the right side of power and maintaining their positions as rulers. To imagine that the current Hindu identity is the same as feelings of religiosity in the past is ill-informed and pernicious. The latter because it suggests that while it is unfortunate that religious divides have been created for political gain, there are, nevertheless, “genuine” reasons for “Hindu” anger. This thinking and bigotry are first cousins.
The past does not create the present in an unmediated way: The past itself is produced in the present through processes of the present. This is why, “better” – or more “accurate” – depictions of the past may have little or no effect on how people react and behave in the present. Our own present is being shaped through three interrelated aspects: The rise of new consumer cultures, the spectacularisation of everyday life and the fundamental shift towards viewing religion as an outer, rather than inner, aspect of one’s relationship with divinity. The three are linked in as much as consumer cultures are fundamentally about the relationship between us and commodities and hence about presenting ourselves publicly – through cars, clothes, mobile phones, whatever – to the world. This informs the great transition in the relationship between religious identity and its public nature. The temple at Ayodhya is not the result of a long-felt and consistent rage or grief that has lasted several centuries. It is the result of the processes of our time.
The second line of thinking has argued that the temple is “inauthentic” as it does not represent the “actual” – hybrid – Hinduism that exists as everyday reality. And that, the temple is about “politics” and not “faith”. However, this too assumes that religion has an actual and unvarying reality, unaffected by the processes of the times in which the believers live. In speaking of Hindutva as fake religion, it doesn’t address Hindutva’s popularity across such a vast swathe of the population — the urban and rural poor, the middle classes, Dalits, Buddhists and a whole range besides. It also doesn’t account for the fact that in both modern and earlier times, religion and politics have been intertwined. The idea of an inner “true” faith that exists outside the churn of the times has a very recent history. Do members of the Church of England feel less religious because their church was carved out by Henry the VIII for personal-political reasons? It is unclear if shouts of “inauthentic believers!” and “the politicisation of religion!” by 16th-century Catholics might have diminished the faith of English protestants.
The focus on “real” and “fake” belief systems – apart from providing a moral high ground – is both a poor strategy against majoritarianism and inadequate social analysis.
The irony is that religious beliefs that have been nurtured in the crucible of consumerism and spectacularisation are not any less “religious” or “fake”. Historically, there is no proof of any “authentic” ways of being religious. Marwari businessmen who pioneered Indian capitalism were just as religious as ascetics who severed all relations with the material world. Certainly, within Hinduism, otherworldliness is not the “genuine” mark of a religious person. This is hardly possible in a religion where gods procreate and relish a variety of delicacies. In the continuity between gods and humans, Hinduism is fundamentally different from the Judeo-Christian traditions of beliefs.
Religion itself has no authentic ways of believing – it entirely depends on how the cultures of believing are nurtured. It is quite possible that once the dust has settled – and the temple settles into the commerce of life – the monument might primarily become a tourist spot. However, there is little comfort to be gained from suggesting that “real” spirituality will be found in other, more organic, temples. This form of belief is no less real for all the inauthenticity we might attribute to it. Neither feelings of rage (for those who justify the new temple) nor ways of believing (for those who oppose it) have a deep and long history. Just as the present shapes how we think of the past, it also shapes the present. The fundamental change – the move towards spirituality as a matter of spectacular display – has recent roots, located in cultures of contemporary Indian modernity. The response, equally, must be to utilise the processes of the present to re-fashion another narrative. There are very few resources to be found within religion – by referring to Hinduism’s “inherent” tolerant nature, for example – that will help in this task. Religion in the time of plastic divinities should encourage us to ask questions about the other contemporary ways in which plastic gods can be made.

The ED team was escorted by a large contingent of central armed force personnel.
ED officers reached Sheikh’s house in Akunjipara area of Sandeshkhali around 6 am. Unlike their earlier visit to the house, the team was accompanied by 125 central force personnel who wore riot control gear and were carrying tear gas shells, batons and guns. Several units of state police and Rapid Action Force were also present on the spot.
According to reports, ED officers broke open the lock of the house with the help of a locksmith and started the search operations. They were  accompanied by a videographer and two witnesses. After entering the house, the officers locked the gates from inside and started searching rooms
After day-long search operations, ED officials sealed the house in Akunjipara and put up a notice summoning Sheikh to appear in person before it for questioning by January 29 in connection with its probe into the ration distribution scam, an officer said.
“It seems that the documents have been removed from this house during the last fortnight. We have sealed the house,” an officer said.  The ED officers found a few old visa-related papers, some contractual documents and articles besides a few clothing materials, he said.
Meanwhile, CAPF teams cordoned off the house and a section of the personnel went for area domination exercise.
Earlier on Wednesday morning, the ED team was stopped from entering the TMC leader’s residence by the local police before they were shown an “order to conduct a search operation” there. “We need to see the order to conduct a search operation at any place within our jurisdiction. This is the norm. They (ED officers) showed the order and after that we allowed them to break open the gate and start searching inside,” a senior officer of Basirhat Police District said.
A Zilla Parishad member, Sheikh has multiple houses in the area and also owns over 400 bighas of fisheries, five brick kilns, and a market which is named after him.
On January 5, a team of ED officials was attacked by a mob of over 100 men and women in Sandeshkhali, leaving three officials injured. The team had gone to conduct raids at Sheikh’s residence. Sheikh is considered close to state minister Jyotipriya Mullick, who was arrested in the alleged ration scam last year.
Following the incident, police had registered three FIRs, including the one against ED officials.

Based on a tip-off, the ATS arrested Anjum Qureshi alias Anjum Kanpuri from a house in Vatva on January 23, a statement issued by the agency said.
Anjum, who was booked under the Arms Act in 2005, has been remanded in police custody for three days, it added. Her husband Feroze Kanpuri, also an accused in the case, had died in 2009.
According to the statement, the couple, along with others, collected Rs 50,000 to purchase weapons and cartridges to “take revenge after the communal riots in Ahmedabad”. “To avenge the 2002 post-Godhra riots, three men from the city, Waris Pathan, Naseem Pathan and Nadir Khan Pathan, decided to buy arms and ammunition by collecting funds. They collected Rs 50,000 from people in 2005 and gave it to one Ghulam Rabbani Shaikh to buy guns and cartridges from Uttar Pradesh,” it added.
All four persons were arrested in 2005 and 10 countrymade guns as well as an equal number of cartridges were seized from them, the statement said. They are currently facing trial, the ATS said.
“Their interrogation revealed that Feroze Kanpuri and his wife Anjum Kanpuri were also involved in the crime. As directed by Ghulam, they had gone to Dahod in their vehicle and collected some of the arms and delivered them to Waris in Ahmedabad,” the statement said.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (ATS) S L Chaudhary told The Indian Express, “They were feeling insecure and thus bought the weapons.”

UY8J57ISLK_SFCDUB0DHI79TOO,Lok Sabha elections: Voters in Pune constituency drop as citizens move to outskirts,Ajay Jadhav,"Updated: January 24, 2024 20:15 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/voters-in-pune-constituency-drop-as-citizens-move-to-outskirts-9125907/,"The trend of citizens moving from the central part of Pune to the outskirts is likely to impact the upcoming elections as the Pune Lok Sabha constituency has seen a decrease of around 1 lakh voters compared to five years ago even as the suburban and rural areas of Pune have seen a corresponding increase in voters.
There are 21 Assembly segments in Pune district – six each in the Lok Sabha constituencies of Pune, Baramati and Shirur and three in Maval Lok Sabha constituency. As per the final voters’ list for Pune district as of January 1 this year, as declared by the District Election Office, there are 81,27,019 total voters in the district. Of these, 20,03,316 are in Pune Lok Sabha constituency, 23,15,968 in Baramati, 24,79,742 in Shirur and 13,27,993 in half of Maval Lok Sabha constituency (three Assembly segments in Maval fall under Raigad district).
“There has been an increase of 1,75,599 voters in the district in the last year and the maximum registration of 97,350 voters is of female voters in the year,” District Collector Rajesh Deshmukh said.
However, if the electoral data of 2019 is compared with 2024, Pune district has seen an increase of 3,97,802 voters – an increase of 5.15 per cent.
The Lok Sabha constituency-wise comparison of data reveals that voters in Pune Lok Sabha constituency decreased by around 1 lakh – 4.75 per cent less than 2019. On the other hand, Shirur Lok Sabha constituency witnessed an increase of 2.4 lakh voters (a jump of 10.73 per cent) and Baramati saw an increase of 1.5 lakh (6.91 per cent) in comparison to 2019. The increase of voters in both Lok Sabha constituencies is mainly due to an increase of voters in the suburban area of Pune city that falls in the two constituencies.
“The logic behind the decrease in voters in the Pune Lok Sabha constituency and the increase in other adjoining Lok Sabha constituencies seems that the citizens from the central part of the city are shifting to the outskirts for various reasons. Also, many of the new voters coming to Pune prefer homes in the outskirts where houses are affordable,” said civic activist Vivek Velankar.
“There is nothing unusual over the voters’ numbers decreasing in Pune Lok Sabha constituency considering the changing demography of the city. Citizens prefer to move to the outskirts due to affordable houses and other reasons,” BJP leader Ujjwal Keskar said.
The outskirts of Pune city are witnessing rapid growth and an increase in the number of residential localities, he said, and as the outskirts are part of other Lok Sabha constituencies, there is an increase in voters in Baramati and Shirur Lok Sabha constituencies.
Congress leader Mohan Joshi, who contested the Pune Lok Sabha seat in 2019, said the possibility of citizens moving out of the city towards the outskirts cannot be ruled out but it does not explain the drastic change in voter numbers. “We are planning to take up a drive to visit each house in the Pune Lok Sabha constituency to verify the voters as we suspect that the ruling political party might have worked towards ensuring the pockets of Congress voters in the city are dropped from the electoral roll,” he alleged."

The review at the U.N. in Geneva is the first since the global body’s top rights official released a report in 2022 saying the detention of Uyghurs and other Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region may constitute crimes against humanity. Beijing denies any abuses.
China has been lobbying non-Western countries to praise its human rights record ahead of the meeting by sending memos to envoys in recent weeks, diplomats told Reuters.
China’s diplomatic mission did not comment on the reported lobbying. Its delegation in Geneva said on Tuesday it had made progress since its last U.N. review in 2018, saying it had lifted nearly 100 million people out of poverty.
“We embarked on a path of human rights development that is in keeping with the trend of the times and appropriate to China’s national conditions and scored historic achievements in this process,” said Ambassador Chen Xu at the meeting.
Some 163 countries are set to speak at the Tuesday session and countries had only 45 seconds each to speak.
Many countries lauded China’s efforts on human rights, including Ethiopia and Cameroon. Western countries raised concerns including Germany, which cited human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet, and Canada which called for China to repeal a controversial Hong Kong national security law.
Eric Chan, Hong Kong’s chief secretary, praised the law.
“The days of social disturbance and fear are now over. Stability as well as law and order has been restored and our city is back on track,” he told the U.N. meeting.
Amnesty International’s Sarah Brooks said the meeting risked working as a “fig leaf” for China and countries pursuing closer ties with Beijing.
A protest is planned later on Tuesday outside the U.N. building with Tibetan, Uyghur and Hong Kong activists and Chinese dissidents."

While the Mumbai Police registered eight FIRs, the Navi Mumbai police registered an FIR and arrested five persons on the charge of attempt to murder in connection with a clash that took place in Panvel between locals and some Shiv Sena workers on Monday.
The incidents in Mumbai occurred in areas that included Vakola, Govandi, Bhoiwada, Girgaon, Malvani, Oshiwara, Antop Hill and Juhu. The police have also arrested at least five persons.
The police claimed that while the incidents were not as serious as the one on Mira Road, several minor incidents were witnessed in Muslim-dominated areas in city. The incidents mainly involved heated argument between residents of the area and members of Shobha yatras who were on vehicles bearing saffron flags and shouting slogans.
In Santa Cruz (East), a complaint was filed with the Vakola police regarding alleged insult to a religious flag. People present in the Shobha Yatra caught the accused Saud Mehmud Qureshi (27) and handed over to the police.
In another incident in Govandi area, one Prithviraj Jogdand (23), was arrested for posting objectionable and provocative post on WhatsApp. He was booked for hurting the religious sentiments on the complaint of a young man.
In Bhoiwada and Malwani, police registered a case against one Mufeez Ahmed (55) and Irfan Qureshi respectively for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
At least 20 unidentified people were also booked for alleged stone-pelting at the rally.
Cases were also filed in Islampura area, Antop Hill and Juhu for hurting sentiments.
In Navi Mumbai, the police registered a case of attempt to murder along with rioting and arrested five persons for clashes with Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde Group) party workers when they were taking out a procession on bikes and cars from the area on Monday afternoon.
Navi Mumbai DCP (zone II) Pankaj Dahane said, “In the clashes that took place between the two sides, we have registered an FIR and arrested five persons. Some five to seven people are still on the run and will be nabbed soon.” The FIR was registered by the Navi Mumbai Police under sections related to attempt to murder, rioting and common intention.
The incident took place in the Kutchi Mohalla area of Panvel after local residents got into a fight with Shiv Sena (Shinde group) party workers from Kharghar who were taking out a rally through the Muslim-dominated neighbourhood. As per the FIR, there were 15-20 bikes and two four-wheelers that were part of the rally.
The FIR was based on a complaint given by Chinmay Sonawane, a Shiv Sena Vibhag Pramukh. Sonawane said that after the rally was over, Kshitij Shingare, Panvel Vidhan Sabha Yuva Sena head, had organised lunch at Samarth godown. He said that they were led by Shingare, who was riding ahead of all.
His statement added, “Instead of leading us to Samarth godown to have lunch, he said let’s go through Panvel and we followed him. Our bike then passed a Muslim Naka and reached Safa Mosque. While 10 bikers had gone ahead, we were left behind.”
He added, “nearly 10-15 Muslim youngsters who had gathered then attacked us and damaged our vehicles.” Based on the statement, the police registered the FIR and made the arrests."

With special needs volunteers and sign language experts in tow, the differently-abled interacted with the rich flora, fauna and heritage of the city’s sole botanical garden-zoo, as a part of the pilot project.
Organised by NGO Project Mumbai, the pilot tour saw the participation of nearly 30 persons with disabilities, which consisted of adolescents and the elderly.
Starting from the Penguin exhibits, the participants of the hour-long walk, which was conducted in two batches, toured around the birds and reptiles enclosure, while learning about the history and heritage structures of the 161-year-old zoo.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Dr Abhishek Satam, a biologist at the zoo said, “Normally, the zoo is shut to the public on Wednesday for maintenance works. In order to maximise their comfort and ensure that the differently abled get proper attention, this tour was organised today.”
Satam added, “While normally animals are not present in their exhibits on Wednesday, the participants were taken on a walk across the zoo. They interacted with the flora and fauna of the zoo, the bird exhibits, reptile section as well as heritage structures which are situated within the premises. Since this was the pilot tour, the walks were short and about an hour long.”
To cater to the needs of participants with hearing impairments, the tour appointed sign language experts. Project Mumbai, who organised the walk, told Express: “The participants, most of whom were children, arrived with their parents and guardians. The zoo officials guided us during the tour who tended to the questions of the inquisitive participants.”
According to senior zoo officials, while this was a pilot initiative, the civic body may consider making the exclusive tour for the differently abled a regular feature at the zoo, depending on the responses to the Wednesday walk."

Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will also attend the Purnea rally.
This was confirmed by Congress MLC and senior party leader Prem Chandra Mishra on Monday. “Rahul Gandhi will enter Bihar (from West Begal) on January 29 through Kishanganj and will attend a rally in Purnea on January 30. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has confirmed his participation in the Purnea rally,” Mishra told reporters, adding that Rahul would further travel to Araria and Katihar before re-entering West Bengal on February 1.
The Kishanganj Lok Sabha seat is currently held by the Congress. It is the only seat that the Mahagathbandhan won in the 2019 general elections. The Congress has focused on the Seemanchal region, comprising the Lok Sabha seats of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnea and Katihar. At present, the JD(U) represents Purnea and Katihar seats, while the BJP represents Araria.
Mishra, who has been made the chairman of the media committee for the Yatra, said Rahul’s yatra would cover 425 km and seven districts of Bihar in two phases.. “In the second leg, of which the schedule will be shared in due course, the Yatra will cover south Bihar districts of Aurangabad, Kaimur and Rohtas,” he said.
Lack of consensus on seat-sharing in Bihar for the Lok Sabha elections has led to speculation of frosty ties between the Congress and the JD(U). Nitish’s consent to attend the rally is being seen as a move to show solidarity among the INDIA bloc allies.
A JD(U) leader said: “We were never averse to Congress’s yatra, but had wanted to make it an INDIA bloc march. Now that Rahul Gandhi has decided to address a meeting in Purnea, Nitish Kumar would attend it. It will be a great sign of solidarity.”
An RJD leader said: “Deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will attend the Purnea rally. We all are trying to put up a unified show for the INDIA bloc.”
Congress leader Mishra said an invitation has been extended to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, “who may attend the rally in Purnea, or at Katihar scheduled on January 31, as per his availability in view of an ED summons”.
The Enforcement Directorate has asked Prasad and his son Tejashwi, to appear at its office in Patna on January 29 and 30 respectively for questioning in connection with the alleged land-for-jobs scam.
Mishra said other alliance partners like state leaders of CPI and CPI(M), besides CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya “have also been invited and they have agreed to lend their support to the Yatra”.

Joking that the media was saying that Modi would blow the bugle of the Lok Sabha election from Bulandshahr, the prime minister said, “Modi blows the bugle only for the welfare of the poor. Modi never needed to blow the election bugle. For Modi, the people themselves blow that bugle. And when they do so, Modi does not have to spend his time blowing the election bugle. He sits at the feet of people and works for them with sewa bhaav (spirit of service).”
Modi added, “On January 22, in Ayodhya Dham, I had darshan of Prabhu Shri Ram, and here I am lucky to get darshan of janata janaradan (common people). West UP got projects worth more than Rs 19,000 crore today—railway line, highway, petroleum pipeline, water, sewage, etc.”
He then recalled Kalyan Singh, an OBC leader of the BJP. “This region has given the country an illustrious son in Kalyan Singh-ji, who did both Ram Kaaj and Rashtra Kaaj (service of Ram and to the nation) all his life. He must be happy looking at Ayodhya Dham wherever he is today. The country has fulfilled his dream and that of others,” he said. “Yet, we have to increase our pace (of work) to fulfil his dream of a strong nation and true social justice. Pran pratishtha has happened, now rashtra pratishtha (glory of the nation) is required. We have to move from dev (God) to desh (country) and from Ram to rashtra (nation). By 2047, we have to make India a developed country.”
The late Singh was Uttar Pradesh chief minister when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992.
The prime minister accused early governments after independence of ignoring Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state. “After Independence, for a long time development was limited to select areas. A large part of the country was deprived of it. UP was not focused on, despite having the largest population. This happened because those who ran governments in those times behaved like rulers, trying to divide people and keeping people deprived to stay in power. Generations in UP have suffered because of this. And the country also suffered. If the biggest state was weak, how could the country be strong? Will we not have to empower UP to make India powerful? I am an MP from UP; I have the responsibility,” he said.
“Many highways are coming up in UP. The first Namo Bharat train project has begun in west UP. Metro services are coming up in many cities of UP. When Jewar international airport is ready, this region will grow new wings. West UP is now becoming a major centre for employment generation. One industrial smart city has come up in Greater Noida of west UP. It is ready for investors from across the country. This will also benefit small enterprises in west UP. Our farmers and workers will also benefit,” he said. “UP is far away from the sea. So gas and petroleum products needed for industry used to be brought here by road. New airports and a dedicated freight corridor will solve this problem.”
One part of western UP being a sugarcane belt, Modi congratulated Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for increasing the state advised price for sugarcane. He added that his government had ensured that money was transferred straight into farmers’ accounts for their produce they sold in the mandi. The PM also said the government had placed Rs 2.75 lakh crore in the accounts of farmers and started the world’s largest scheme to develop cold storages across the country for farm produce to be stored.
“Our government is encouraging ethanol production so that sugarcane farmers earn more money. We are ensuring cheap fertilisers for farmers. One urea bag costs less than Rs 300 here; (elsewhere) in the world it costs Rs 3,000. Now nano-urea has been made. One bottle has the power of one sack of fertiliser,” the PM said.
Modi also listed out some other of his welfare schemes, like those related to the construction of toilets, free rations (5 kg for 80 crore people), free treatment and the provision of tapped water in “crores of homes”.
“Today, the country considers Modi’s guarantee as a guarantee that every guarantee will be fulfilled. Modi is guaranteeing saturation of schemes so that they reach each labharthi (beneficiary) in the country. Modi is guaranteeing 100 per cent reach. When the government reaches 100 per cent beneficiaries, there is no scope for discrimination or corruption. This is true secularism and true social justice. Whatever the section of society, the needs of all the needy are alike. So, Modi wants to reach everyone who is in need with high speed,” he added.
Modi said that “empty slogans” of Gharibi Hatao were once used—hinting at former prime minister Indira Gandhi—and added that some even enriched their own families by telling lies in the name of social justice, alluding to parties like the SP and the RJD.
“The common poor, Dalit and backward person was scared of criminals and riots. Now things have changed. Modi is honestly committed to service. About 25 crore people have come out of poverty and others look forward to the same prospect. For me, you are my family. Your dreams are my resolution. When common families will be empowered, that will be Modi’s poonji (capital).”
Earlier, Adityanath said the PM came to Bulandshahr by road despite adverse weather. He thanked Modi for conferring the Bharat Ratna on the late social justice icon Karpoori Thakur."
V8BFZW522T_BWGZ1IB6S7YQ0NE,Eight people found shot to death at two locations near Chicago; manhunt on for shooter,_,"January 23, 2024 08:01 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/chicago-shooting-many-members-of-family-killed-9122829/,"A man shot and killed 8 people at three locations since Sunday in the Chicago suburbs and remains loose, authorities said Monday.
Police in Will County and the city of Joliet said they did not know of a motive for the killings, but said the man knew the victims. The FBI’s fugitive task force was assisting local police in the search for the suspect, Joliet Police Chief William Evans said.
The victims were found Sunday and Monday at three separate locations, authorities told reporters Monday evening, several hours after warning on social media that the man should be considered “armed and dangerous.”
One of the people killed was found Sunday in a home in Will County. Seven others were found Monday at two homes in Joliet. Authorities said they also believe another shooting in Joliet that wounded a man on Sunday is connected to the string of violence but would not discuss their evidence.
“I’ve been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with,” Evans said during a news conference outside the Joliet homes Monday evening. Will County Chief Deputy Dan Jungles said during the news conference that deputies had been staking out one of the houses since Sunday evening in case the suspect in that day’s shootings returned to them. When no one showed, deputies finally went to the door of one of the houses. No one answered so they tried the other house, which they knew was linked to the first house and found the first bodies. Jungles didn’t offer any further details.
Jungles said he didn’t have any indications yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead. He said that autopsies are pending.
Evans said the victims found Monday in the houses were family members. Asked if the victims were members of the suspect’s family, Jungles said he couldn’t comment except to say that the suspect knew them.
Teresa Smart lives about a block away from where seven of the victims were found and said she worries she and her family won’t be able to sleep tonight. “This is way too close to home,” she said, adding that police cars are blocking streets throughout the neighbourhood.
“I keep looking out the window and double checking my doors,” she said. “It’s super scary.”

VA08L13J8P_H1EYLIRF7AC123J,Express View on Oscars nominations: Twist in the tale,_,"January 25, 2024 06:50 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-oscars-nominations-twist-in-the-tale-9126339/,"The announcement of the nominations for the 96th annual Academy Awards might as well have been scripted by a Hollywood writer, one who knows just how to balance the predictable with a twist or two, in order to get a buzz going. And so, the nominees, across a slew of categories, include some of the biggest hits of 2023 as well as its most critically acclaimed: Barbie, Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Past Lives, Anatomy of a Fall, Maestro, The Zone of Interest, Poor Things and The Holdovers.
The big picture is of an industry that, after years of struggling against audience apathy for anything that is not a “tent pole” film (such as one from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), seems to be rediscovering its creativity. If the summer of 2023 belonged to the “Barbenheimer Effect”, wherein two highly original, idiosyncratic films also manage to find a massive global audience, the rest of the year was peppered with smaller, but no less distinctive projects.
Yet, the nominations themselves send out a more mixed message. If this year marks the first time a Native American actor has an Oscar shot (Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon) and has a solid representation from non-American cinema (Anatomy of a Fall, Past Lives, The Zone of Interest and Poor Things), there is also the snub to the two women behind one of the year’s most successful films. For Barbie fans, director Greta Gerwig and lead actor/producer Margot Robbie were shoo-ins for their categories and the fact that they have been ignored, while male lead Ryan Gosling scored a nomination, only underlines the message of their film: In a male-dominated world, women are sidelined. If the Oscars this year are rich in cinema, they’re richer in irony."

VE9ZUGOKCB_I0IG907KSW9XMLX,Decode Politics: Why Mamata Banerjee has served Congress an ultimatum,Ravik Bhattacharya,"Updated: January 25, 2024 07:35 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/decode-politics-mamata-banerjee-congress-ultimatum-9126027/,"Reluctance to let go of her supremacy in West Bengal, reservations regarding the CPI(M) as an alliance partner, disillusionment with the Congress and, more importantly, concerns regarding its minority vote bank – all seem to have played a part in Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee hardening her stance on the INDIA alliance.
While the seat-sharing in Bengal was never expected to be easy, and there were voices from all sides needling the other, the Chief Minister suggested Wednesday that the doors to talks with the Congress were closed, and that the issue of national alliance would now be decided only after the elections.
The Congress adamance
Indicating the thinking within the TMC, a senior party leader and MP said that the party expected the BJP to get a massive boost from the grand show around the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, atop its recent Assembly wins in the Hindi heartland states.
“At this moment, there is need for a joint effort against the BJP, for which our party chief has been trying for months. But no one is listening to her… Her proposal of 2 seats to the Congress in Bengal was rejected. Her initial proposal that the Congress contest 300 seats and the regional parties field candidates in the rest also got no response. What is the point in being in such an alliance, where one party does not seem serious enough to take on the BJP?” the leader said, adding that the Congress should not forget that “Mamata Didi stopped the BJP in its tracks in the Assembly polls (2021)”.
The TMC leader also accused the Congress of showing highhandedness and “undermining an important leader like Mamata Banerjee”, claiming they had not called her for an INDIA meeting, nor invited or informed her about the Bengal leg of Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra. This has been denied by the Congress.
The TMC cites the Congress recent performance in Bengal to make its point. While Malda and Murshidabad, with a total 5 Lok Sabha seats, are considered Congress strongholds in the state, the party won only 2 of these in 2019. In the 2021 state polls, the party could not win a single seat in the entire state, including these strongholds. While the TMC won 8 of Malda’s 12 seats and the BJP 4, it took 21 of Murshidabad’s 22 Assembly segments and the BJP 1.
The BJP challenge
Mamata has much to lose if she cedes her “supremacy” in Bengal at a time when the BJP is snapping at her heels, and many of its leaders are facing serious corruption charges or cases.
With 42 Lok Sabha seats, Bengal is an important state and the TMC’s 23 currently make it the fourth largest party in the Lok Sabha. With the BJP right now at 17, giving the Congress more than 2 seats (which the Congress currently holds) is not palatable to the TMC.
“Firstly, the TMC is more likely to win against the BJP… Leaving seats to the Congress will only work in the BJP’s favour. Secondly, if the Congress fails nationally and the BJP wins the Lok Sabha polls, the Trinamool needs to have the numbers to be a strong Opposition, be a check against the Centre,” a TMC state leader said.
The minority vote
The minority vote that has been behind her for a while now is one of Mamata’s biggest strengths, also adding to her clout outside the state. The TMC has had several scares on that front, especially the emergence of the Indian Secular Front (ISF) led by influential cleric Naushad Siddiqui in Bengal. The Congress and CPI(M) had tied up with the Front in 2021, which won 1 Assembly seat. In the panchayat polls last year too, the ISF performed impressively.
What was another eyeopener for the TMC was its shock defeat in the bypolls to the minority-dominated Sagardighi seat in Murshidabad last year – though the Congress’s winning MLA later moved to the TMC.
After several changes in the party structure to reach out to the Muslims, the TMC chief has made strong statements against the BJP and its brand of politics lately, going much further than the Congress will dare venture.
On the day of the Ram Temple consecration ceremony, Mamata’s No. 2 Abhishek Banerjee said his religion could not accept a place of worship “built on hatred, violence and the dead bodies of innocents”. Mamata herself led an all-faith rally, visited different places of worship, and in the speech that followed said that “somebody goes to a temple and thinks that is sufficient” to fight against the BJP.
The Left as the enemy
The fourth factor for Mamata remains her long-standing animosity with the Left, having built her political career fighting almost singlehandedly against its dominance in the state. She has been known to be unhappy about the Congress leadership’s proximity with the CPI(M) – out of proportion to its electoral clout – and recently complained about the Left party “hijacking” INDIA meetings.
The Left too has been averse to any peace overtures towards its arch rival in Bengal, and has said as much."
VEVFPV0LVC_IV39AHP41DKSONA,A third World War is not beyond realm of possibility: UN General Assembly President,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 22:21 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/third-world-war-not-beyond-possibility-un-general-assembly-president-9126279/,"The situation in the Red Sea is “extremely disturbing” and it has the potential to escalate further, President of UN General Assembly Dennis Francis said on Wednesday.
At a media interaction, Francis cautioned against “regionalisation” of the conflict, adding a “third World War is not beyond the realm of possibility.” The president of the UN General Assembly, who is on a five-day visit to India, also strongly pitched for reform of the UN Security Council, saying its present composition does not reflect contemporary geopolitical realities.
Francis complimented India’s call for a two-State solution to the conflict in Gaza, describing New Delhi’s position as “highly responsible, pragmatic, sensible and necessary”.
On the situation in the Red Sea, Francis said it is “extremely disturbing.
“That is an extremely disturbing situation. It would appear that third parties are facilitating this action being taken by the Houthis in the Red Sea — very damaging and very dangerous,” he said.
“Because the last thing you really want is the regionalisation of that war. You do not want that because that would mean escalation and escalation breeds further escalation. So, a Third World War is not beyond the realm of possibility,” he said.
The top UN diplomat held “comprehensive talks” with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar covering a wide-range of issues including the situation in Gaza, the conflict in Ukraine, India’s engagement with the UN and UN Security Council reform.
“So glad to welcome @un_pga Dennis Francis this afternoon in New Delhi. His positive sentiments for our G20 Presidency and Voice of Global South Summits were notable. They have strengthened multilateralism,” Jaishankar said on ‘X’.
“Appreciated his position on need for urgency of reforms in international institutions especially the UN Security Council,” he said.
On the situation in Gaza, Francis said it is very worrying, adding that “peace peace is the only way”. The geopolitical realities of today are not reflected in the Council, he said.
On reforms of the UN Security Council, he said it is “inescapable”.
“The fact of the matter is that the Council in recent years has been progressively unable to take the decisions to assist and support strengthening of international peace and security largely for geopolitical reasons,” he said.
Asked about India’s aspirations to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Francis said the country is a highly respected member of the UN.
“It (India) is a leader in many ways. And I am sure that that fact is not lost on the members of the General Assembly,” he said.
Francis said global dynamics of geopolitics often get into the functioning of the UN Security Council and that results invariably in the use of veto-power by one or the other party.
“Often this causes immense frustration in the general assembly but also beyond. The reform of the UN Security Council is absolutely necessary. I do not think there is any member of the United Nations that would deny that,” he said.
Explaining the delay in rolling out the much needed reforms, he appeared to blame the five permanent members of the top global body.
“If you are in a privileged position, you are not in a hurry to lose privileges. I think it is well appreciated that the existing formula is woefully inadequate,” he said.
“The reform is inescapable. The question is what would be the formula for undertaking the reform,” he added.
India has been pressing for reform of the United Nations, especially the UN Security Council. New Delhi has been particularly upset over lack of any meaningful movement forward in the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) on Security Council reform.
India is a strong contender for a permanent membership at the UN Security Council.
At present, the UNSC comprises five permanent members and 10 non-permanent member countries which are elected for a two-year term by the General Assembly of the UN.
The five permanent members are Russia, the UK, China, France and the United States and these countries can veto any substantive resolution.
The President of the UN General Assembly also hailed India for its role in making the African Union a full member of the G20.
“There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that India’s outreach to Africa particularly with regard to its facilitating the membership of the African Union in the G20 demonstrates India’s leadership in the international arena,” he said.
“But more than that it demonstrated India’s long-standing commitment to assist and facilitate development in the Global South,” Francis added.
Belonging to the diplomatic service of Trinidad and Tobago, Francis has announced his presidency priorities to include peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability.
The theme of his Presidency of the 78th UNGA is ‘Rebuilding trust and reigniting solidarity.’"

VHE5J1NCWC_D20X1OG14O6BGLX,"Congress hopes to placate Mamata, resolution in Punjab difficult",Manoj C G,"Updated: January 25, 2024 07:47 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/tmc-india-alliance-mamata-banerjee-remarks-reactions-9125469/,"Exactly seven months after the Congress and several regional parties came together in Patna and resolved to contest the Lok Sabha elections against the BJP unitedly, the Opposition grouping — christened INDIA later — showed the first serious signs of unraveling on Wednesday. However, the Congress, which is being blamed for the cracks in West Bengal and Punjab, appeared hopeful of placating at least West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee. As for Punjab, the Congress leadership appeared resigned to the fact that an alliance with the AAP was difficult.
Hours after Banerjee declared that her party would contest the Lok Sabha polls alone in West Bengal, sources in the Congress said its top leadership was trying to get in touch with her, and asserted that there would be at least a tactical alliance in the state. Seeking to placate her, the party said it could “not imagine” the INDIA bloc without Banerjee. It also hung on to her remarks that she was determined to fight the BJP.
Banerjee’s remarks came a day before Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is scheduled to enter West Bengal.
Both AICC general secretary in charge of organisation, K C Venugopal, and Congress communication head, Jairam Ramesh, said the party was hopeful of sorting out the differences with the TMC. The TMC, on the other hand, maintained that the Congress’s demand for more than two seats in West Bengal was “unreasonable” and “like asking for toffees”.
The Congress always knew that seat-sharing in Bengal would be a challenge given its state unit’s aversion to it, as well as the Left parties’ reluctance regarding a three-way seat-sharing pact. However, what it did not expect was Banerjee saying the issue of a national alliance could be decided after the elections, and the Congress should contest 300 seats and leave the rest to the regional parties, which, she said, were together. If the Congress was not agreeable, the regional parties could go ahead and contest on their own, she said.
At the heart of the tussle between the Congress and TMC is the former’s demand for at least six seats in West Bengal, and reluctance to part with any seats in Assam and Meghalaya. TMC sources said that in the last elections, the Congress recorded over 30% vote share in only two seats (Berhampore, Malda Dakshin), and added that the party could think of increasing the offer marginally if the Congress reciprocated in Assam and Meghalaya.
The scrimmage between the Congress and AAP, too, is over the former’s reluctance to enter into seat-sharing pacts in Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa. While the Congress is agreeable to an understanding in Delhi, it is not keen on similar pacts in Punjab and other states. Sources in the Congress said an alliance with the AAP was on the cards in Delhi.
“The situation in Punjab is similar to that of Kerala where the Left and Congress are fighting against each other despite being members of the INDIA bloc. So, chances of an AAP-Congress alliance in Punjab are next to impossible. Mann’s statement that the AAP would contest in all the 13 Lok Sabha seats is not a setback in that sense. We are also prepared to fight in all 13. But an alliance in Delhi and some minor adjustment in Haryana and Gujarat is very much possible,” said a senior Congress leader. Congress leaders admitted that the statements by Banerjee and AAP’s Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann were damaging to the alliance in terms of optics.
Meanwhile, seat-sharing arrangements in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have not made much headway either.
In Bihar, the pact is more or less sealed (17 seats each for JD-U and RJD, 5 for Congress, 1 for CPI-ML Liberation). But Congress allies like the JD(U) are keeping a wary eye on the developments elsewhere. JD(U) leaders hold the Congress responsible for the delay in other states, blaming its insistence on an “unreasonable” number of seats in states where it is a marginal player, and unwillingness to share in states where it is a dominant force.
The JD(U) is also upset over the delay in finalising the leadership roles within the INDIA bloc. A week has passed since the bloc held an online meeting – which was skipped by Banerjee, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav and Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Uddhav Thackeray — but the bloc is yet to even announce the decision to appoint Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge as the chairperson and Nitish Kumar as the convener. Banerjee, for one, is said to be unhappy with the decision, indicating that the TMC felt sidelined. She had underlined that she was the one who suggested the INDIA name for the bloc.
On Wednesday, the Congress sought to play down Banerjee’s remarks, saying the TMC was an important pillar of the alliance and it could not imagine the INDIA bloc without her. “If you look at the full statement of Mamata Banerjee… she has said that she wants to defeat the BJP. That she will not step back in her fight against the BJP. We are entering West Bengal with that spirit,” Jairam Ramesh said. “When you are on a long journey, there will be speed-breakers on the way at times, there will be red lights… That doesn’t mean we will step back. Chalta rahta hai (such things happen), we cross the speed-breakers, red lights will turn into greens,” he added."

Gupta had even started his career with Dutt in the 1994 film Aatish. In a new interview, Sanjay Gupta spoke about his relationship with the actor with whom he collaborated on Kaante, Plan, Musafir, Zinda among many others.
Gupta spoke about the muhurat of his first film Aatish and how it “generated a lot of buzz” from the start. He recalled that even when they shot for the film in Mauritius, “Sanjay Dutt was a kid in a toy store because the army gave us their guns.” He claimed that the “fire power” seen in Aatish had not been seen in any film before. “We were let loose that go do whatever you want,” he said.
Sanjay Gupta also addressed their fallout that lasted for over four years and said that “nothing went wrong” between them. “I think what went wrong were the people around us. There were people around us who tried to create too many misunderstandings. We didn’t speak to each other for four years. But we never spoke ill about each other,” he shared with YouTuber Siddharth Kannan.

Gupta claimed that he did not have any work for three years as many people in the film industry stopped entertaining him. “People had stopped taking my calls because they were saying that Sanjay Dutt has said ‘don’t work with him’, which Sanjay never said,” he said. Gupta said that he was “very hurt” by the whole incident.
He shared that they patched up a few years later at Amitabh Bachchan’s 70th birthday party. Recalling that Dutt called out his name, he shared that they just hugged each other and cried, and made up instantly. But Gupta said that he made a rule that they would never work or drink together. “That time, I took a stand. I said we won’t do two things. We won’t drink together and we won’t work together. Now both of us are hungry, desperately searching for the right script,” he said.
Sanjay Gupta said that he is working on a sequel to his film Zinda, which originally starred Sanjay Dutt and John Abraham.

According to police, the arrested person, Jamnadas Maganlal Mehta, was staying with his brother Arvind and his family, comprising wife and children, on Samuel street in Pydhonie.
An officer said, “Jamnadas is unmarried and wanted to sell the house they were staying but Arvind had been opposing it. There has been a dispute over this for the past few years.” The investigators said that late Sunday,
Jamnadas initiated a conversation about selling the house, leading to a verbal spat between the brothers. In a fit of rage, the accused allegedly got a knife from the kitchen and stabbed Arvind on his neck.
Arvind’s wife Kalpana, who is a complainant in the case, was present in the house at the time of the incident. The accused allegedly assaulted Kalpana as well. Arvind was rushed to a nearby hospital where he is being treated. “He is grievously injured and is not in a state to talk. We recorded the statement of his wife and registered a case against the 80-year-old man after which a team was sent to his house and he was arrested,” said an officer.
Police said that Jamnadas has been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 37(1) and 135 of the Mumbai Police Act."

The GLADA’s chief additional chief administrator in the complaint to the police said that Garcha via his firm M/S GS Township, had got a license in 2010 to develop a colony on 70 acres of prime land in Lalton Kalan village. However, he neither got the license renewed, nor completed the project. The complaint further adds that Garcha also did not allegedly pay pending dues amounting to Rs 14.33 crore including EDC license fee and penal interest.
The complaint further said that the license to Garcha’s firm to develop the colony was issued under the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act which was valid till December 2013.
Garcha, two-time former MLA from Ludhiana, has been booked in an FIR registered at Sadar police station under section 36(1) of Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act.
His son Harjinder Singh Garcha said that they had a joint agreement with Delhi-based firm Earth Infrastructure to develop the colony.

The incident took place on January 22 which marked the opening of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
A purported video of the alleged incident also went viral on social media where a group of men can be seen climbing over the mosque and recording a video while hoisting the saffron flags.
“Some anti-social elements forcefully tried to enter the Shahi Masjid in Tajganj while hoisting saffron flags on January 22. Around 3.30 pm, about 1,000-1,500 people with sticks forcefully entered the mosque and raised objectionable slogans,” reads the FIR, which was registered after a complaint by the mosque’s caretaker  Zahir Uddin. “They created chaos in the mosque and hoisted saffron flags on the mosque’s minarets, walls and inner premises,” the complainant alleged.
“The 11 accused included Sunny (24), Himanshu (19) and Sunny (25),” said a police official. An FIR under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 452 (house-trespass) and 505 (2) [statements creating or promoting enmity] has been lodged at Tajganj police station."

The bench observed there was sufficient material against the doctor and his custodial interrogation was essential.
The bench passed an order on January 19 in a pre-arrest bail plea by Dr Hiten Kania in connection with a complaint filed by Dharmang Dedia, a general store owner from Borivali (West), who sought admission for his daughter in KEM Hospital’s Medical College. As per the FIR, Dedia visited Dr. Kenia’s clinic. The applicant told him he could facilitate his daughter’s admission under the 5 per cent management quota.
Kenia allegedly said he had a “reliable source” to enable the same. The FIR stated Dedia and another parent Jimi Desai paid a total Rs. 1.15 crore (nearly Rs. 62 lakh each) to Kenia, who in turn allegedly assured them that the amount would be returned if admissions were not confirmed.
As their wards could not secure admission through any other college, the two pursued the matter with Kenia. However, they could not avail management seats as promised. As their money was allegeldy never refunded, the aggrieved parents registered an FIR  against Kenia.
The bench rejected Kenia’s submission, noting there were WhatsApp messages exchanged. The HC rejected Kenia’s plea, noting there were incriminating bank entries on record and the same was required to be probed."

Section 3 and Section 4 of the 1991 Act essentially declare that the religious character of a place of worship, barring the one at Ayodhya, shall continue to be the same as it was on August 15, 1947, and that no person shall convert any place of worship of any religious denomination into one of a different denomination or section. This is the constitutional bar under the Places of Worship Act, 1991 which forms the basis of deciding the title of the disputed site.
While hearing a plea challenging the maintainability of the Gyanvapi suit, the Supreme Court had in May 2022 observed that “finding the nature of the religious place” is not barred under the 1991 law. “…the ascertainment of a religious character of a place, as a processual instrument, may not necessarily fall foul of the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 (of the Act)…,” it had said. Essentially, this ascertainment is limited to 1947 and not prior to the construction of the mosque itself.
The Supreme Court is, however, yet to hear final arguments to decide whether the 1991 Act bars even the filing of such a plea. So far, only oral observations have formed the basis of this argument but the Court is yet to conclusively rule on the issue.
Separately, a constitutional challenge to the 1991 Act is also pending in the Supreme Court. It had in 2019 indicated the case could be referred to a larger constitution bench. However, the Centre is yet to file a response in the case.
Though the voluminous Archaeological Survey of India report submitted to the Varanasi court, and to both the parties to the dispute now, suggests “there existed a Hindu temple prior” to the Gyanvapi mosque, it would be considered expert evidence that could be contested in Court.
Essentially, Courts will have to determine first whether the ASI report can be relied upon conclusively and then what does the existence of a Hindu temple mean to the religious character of the mosque on August 15, 1947.
A similar ASI report in 2003 was cited in the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi suit. While pronouncing its order in November 2019, the Supreme Court had rejected the ASI report as inconclusive.
“The report concludes on the basis of the architectural fragments found at the site and the nature of the structure that it was of a Hindu religious origin. The report rejects the possibility (urged by the Sunni Central Waqf Board) of the underlying structure being of Islamic origin. But the ASI report has left unanswered a critical part of the remit which was made to it, namely, a determination of whether a Hindu temple had been demolished to pave way for the construction of the mosque. ASI’s inability to render a specific finding on this facet is certainly a significant evidentiary circumstance which must be borne in mind when the cumulative impact of the entire evidence is considered in the final analysis,” the Supreme Court had said in its Ayodhya judgement."
WB2EK47Z9O_8DZJWEFIW7P42HB,The 2024 flight chaos was no act of god,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 22:37 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-2024-flight-chaos-was-no-act-of-god-9123853/,"A passenger on his honeymoon flight to Goa attacked a co-pilot after 13 hours of waiting. Frayed nerves in north India’s airports are on display in social media exchanges. Was this chaos inevitable or was it avoidable? Since flights are man-made, the chaos was hardly an act of God.
That fog would smother northern India and Delhi’s airports every winter is expected. This is not an exceptional year, even though this fog seems to have been irritatingly insensitive and persistent, compounded by heavy pollution. If India wants to fly, our population needs CAT-III ILS systems at airports working during the fog season. We need both of the IGI Delhi runways to be operational. The CAT-III system seems to have failed and one runway was and continues to be “under repair”. The extent of “inconvenience” caused to passengers had no limits. Passengers were made to wait well beyond the standard two-hour window. Kept waiting for 13 hours, passengers would have reached their destinations faster by train.
Airlines often resort to the phrase “extraordinary circumstances” or factors stated to be “beyond the control of the airline”, but what exactly constitutes such extraordinary circumstances has never been identified with any degree of certainty. If you want redressal on account of a cancelled flight, you may look for guidance from the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in what are called the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs). A significant CAR is the one made effective on August 6, 2010 and revised on February 15, 2023 (Facilities to be provided to passengers by airlines due to denied boarding, cancellation of flights and delays in flights). A 2016 draft amended CAR and would have penalised the airline industry with compensation per passenger of Rs 5,000 for delays of more than three hours, Rs 10,000 for delays of more than four hours upto 12 hours and Rs 20,000 for delays of more than 12 hours. But those amendments were never implemented.
For more than seven years, the DGCA has been ruminating as to whether or not they should come down heavily on the airlines and fine them for delays “due to airlines fault (excluding force majeure)”. Decision-making simply escaped the attention of the (un)concerned Ministry of Civil Aviation of “MoCA” and its officers. Meanwhile, in the European Union, EC Regulation No. 261 of 2004 has been in operation for nearly two decades (since February 11, 2004). Whenever passengers have been inconvenienced through cancellations or delays, they have a “Right to Compensation” starting at Euro 250 and continuing upto Euro 600. There is also a right to reimbursement or rerouting and a “Right to Care” through refreshments and hotel accommodation. India has presently only picked up the idea of offering meals and refreshments in relation to waiting time and, after a 24-hour delay, hotel accommodation “when necessary”.
Sadly, these provisions are out of step with today’s fares and airline earnings. There is hardly any special arrangement made for disabled, old, infirm or even business/first class passengers who pay three-four times the fare and are subjected to exactly the same treatment (possibly with a wider seat and lounge access). No airline wants to pay compensation at these rates multiplied by, say, 160 passengers per flight every time there is a delay. Of course, this gives rise to litigation and more consumer cases, but even if the fines were imposed by law, the only way to implement them would be through an efficient machine-driven mechanism monitored by the regulator.
A consumer/passenger knows better than to sue an airline for the grand sum of Rs 5,000 which will be disputed, ending up in a consumer forum. That dispute will be answered with an airline reply filed weeks or months later. It will become a test case that is decided after a long time. No sensible consumer/passenger would file and pursue such a dispute. Even activists would be reluctant to find all the passengers on a particular flight and sue the airline for the amount of Rs 5 to 20,000 per passenger.
As an example, in the consumer case of Chandrikaben J Patel, decided in 2019, the National Commission awarded a sum of Rs. 30,000 to aggrieved senior citizen passengers for a delayed flight ordeal after more than six years of litigation. Further problems also emerge once the airline responds saying that the delay was not their fault and was caused by some external cause, like an act of god. This would call for evidence for the cause of delay and may take another year or more to be decided by the concerned consumer forum. Consumer forums and courts cannot ordinarily award compensation to non-parties, meaning people who did not go to court for redressal.
The DGCA has previously stepped in, imposing fines that benefit the MoCA but not the suffering passengers. There is no mechanism for distributing fines collected by the DGCA/MoCA to the affected passengers who suffer delays, indignity and harassment. This calls for amendment and a change of law to bring in a smooth mechanism of redressal, involvement of the regulator in that mechanism and automatic distribution to passengers affected.
The state of the law and regulations reflects a clearly unpalatable situation for India’s consumers and passengers, yet airlines tend to say that it is one of the most regulated and taxed aviation markets in the world. Good airlines have struggled to stay afloat. Jet Airways, Kingfisher, Go First, etc., stand out as examples of those who couldn’t stay airborne. Perhaps the Ministry of Civil Aviation should revisit aviation regulations and the civil aviation requirements to make the system fair to both passengers and airlines. Given our new abilities to track weather conditions, forecast the impact of fog, availability of Instrument Landing Systems and CAT-III runways, all major airports must now be enabled with such technology. Many of us have waited endlessly at an airport that does not have a CAT-III facility for visibility to extend beyond 5,000 metres (so that the aircraft can take off). Perhaps the time has come for India to appreciate the need to reduce its dependence on god and change its policies towards technology, science and transparent regulatory practices.

Macron, who will grace the Republic Day celebrations at the Kartavya Path, will kick-start his two-day trip to India from Jaipur where he will visit the Pink City’s stunning hilltop fort of Amber, the iconic Hawa Mahal and the astronomical observation site of Jantar Mantar.
The French president’s visit is taking place as top negotiators from the two sides are looking at finalising two mega defence deals for India’s procurement of 26 Rafale-M (marine version) fighter jets and three French-designed Scorpene submarines.
It is understood that significant progress has been made in the negotiations including on price and various other technical aspects for the procurement of the mega key platforms.
“This reciprocal invitation to national day celebrations is unprecedented, and shows the deep mutual trust and unwavering friendship underpinning Indo-French ties,” a French readout said.
PM Modi was the guest of honour at the prestigious Bastille Day Parade in Paris in July last.
“President Macron’s visit will consolidate the ambitious renewal of the France-India strategic partnership that the two leaders decided on in Paris on July 14 through the ‘Horizon 2047 Roadmap’,” the readout said.
President Macron will be accompanied by a ministerial delegation comprising Stéphane Sejourné (Europe and Foreign Affairs), Sébastien Lecornu (Armed Forces) and Rachida Dati (Culture), a business delegation along with eminent personalities, including ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.Twenty-five years after the launch of their strategic partnership, France and India have embarked on new common goals for the next 25 years, the readout said.
“Accordingly, President Macron’s talks with Prime Minister Modi will seek to advance our cooperation and finalise new initiatives under the three pillars of the Roadmap,” it added.
On the security ties, the readout said France and India have developed a “trust-based” cooperation aimed at strengthening strategic autonomy that is illustrated by close cooperation in the defence sector, including advanced platforms and technologies. It said the two countries are also key partners in contributing to international peace and security, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, where we implement a “joint strategy”. “This visit will seek to advance common initiatives to respond to the key challenges of our times, including climate change, biodiversity loss, poverty eradication, and the changes wrought by new technologies,” it said.
On people-to-people engagement, Paris said Macron’s visit will stress France’s commitment to creating more opportunities for Indian students, artists, investors and tourists. “Special focus will be given to initiatives fostering student mobility, in support of President Macron’s announcement that France seeks to welcome 30,000 Indian students by 2030,” it said. “Business ties and cross-investments will also be promoted during the visit, under the banner of France’s “Make It Iconic” nation-branding campaign, which has targeted India as a priority country,” it added.
In his nearly six-hour stay in Jaipur, Macron will also join Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a road show before the two leaders hold wide-ranging talks at a luxury hotel Taj Rambagh Palace on all key aspects of India-France ties and various geopolitical upheavals.
The PMO said in a statement that Modi will welcome Macron at around 5.30 pm, and the two leaders will visit various places of cultural and historical significance in the city, including Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal and Albert Hall Museum.
The French president’s aircraft is scheduled to land at Jaipur airport at 2.30 pm on Thursday and he will depart for Delhi at around 8.50 pm, according to the Ministry of External Affairs. The roadshow is scheduled to start at the Jantar Mantar area at 6 pm while Modi and Macron are set to begin their talks at 7.15 pm.
In their talks, Modi and Macron are also expected to deliberate on expanding maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the situation in the Red Sea, the Hamas-Israel conflict and the war in Ukraine.
Macron is scheduled to leave for New Delhi from Jaipur at 8:50 pm. On Friday, Macron will witness the Republic Day celebrations as the Chief Guest.
A 95-member marching contingent and a 33-member band contingent from France will take part in the parade. Two Rafale fighter jets and an Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft of the French air force will also feature in the celebrations. The French marching contingent from the French Foreign Legion features six Indians.
President Macron will also attend the ‘At Home’ reception by President Droupadi Murmu at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. He is also scheduled to hold a meeting with Murmu at 7.10 pm."

As he didn’t have an ID card, police were at a loss as to who he was. Eventually, it was AI software that helped cops crack the case and led them to three people who killed him.
At first, DCP (North) Manoj Kumar Meena formed a 30-member team, under Sub-Inspector Satender Singh, to paste notices in all areas and police stations for possible identification. Said the DCP, “Around 2,000 hue and cry notices were affixed at ISBTs, railway stations, parks and police stations.:
After two days, the team decided to make a few changes to the face of the deceased and get his picture reprinted.
“His face structure had changed… it had shrunk… and the lips had turned pale… Generally, family members are unable to identify their kin in such cases,” said an officer.
Using their in-house software tools, the North district police made a new photo of the victim — in this, his eyes were open, lips brightened and face restructured to its possible original form. “We also added a few vehicles in the background. We then sent out the notices again with the new face,” added another officer.
On January 14, the man’s family was at Chhawla police station to lodge a missing report when they spotted the notice. His brother contacted police and the deceased was identified as Hitender (35), a resident of Daulatpur village.
The brother, Rahul, in his statement, told police that Hitender worked at an audit firm and used to come home once or twice a week. “He left home on January 2… On January 9, his wife told us his phone was not reachable,” he said.
Said DCP Meena, “Rahul contacted Hitender’s friends and came to know that he was last seen with three people — James, Rocky and a woman — on January 9… when Rahul called up James, the latter told him Hitender was with him till 10.30 pm. Rahul also found out that there was a dispute over money between James and Hitender.”
Eventually, a post-mortem was carried out and it was opined that Hitender died of strangulation.
A case of murder was lodged and after raids, three persons — Paramveer Singh alias James (32), Harneet Singh alias Rocky (35), and Priyanka alias Annie (27) — were arrested.
Said the DCP, “During questioning, the accused said the incident took place on the intervening night of January 9 and 10. A month ago, the deceased had abused Paramveer and he held a grouse… So he hatched a plan… he took Hitender to his rented flat in Chander Vihar and offered him liquor after which he strangled him with a bedsheet. He, along with Harneet and Priyanka, dumped his body at the park.”
Hitender is survived by his wife and son.
In March last year, the Delhi Police had solved a case of murder of a 23-year-old man, Raj Kumar, using AI.
An officer said the body was found in an abandoned spot in Inderlok and his lips were mutilated. “This irregularity was impacting his overall face structure and after the lips were returned to their original form using AI, his body was identified.” He was murdered by three persons, who were later arrested."

During the Shobha Yatra, Macron and Modi will travel from Jantar Mantar to Hawa Mahal 6 pm onward, covering a kilometre in the Pink City.
This roadshow will be similar to the one Prime Minister Modi had hosted for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September 2017 in an open-top vehicle in Ahmedabad. In February 2020, also in Ahmedabad, he led a red-carpet welcome for US President Donald Trump who was greeted by people of the city.
“This is one of the unique formats, where a visiting foreign leader is given a royal style welcome involving people of the country,” a senior official, in charge of the arrangements, said.
Modi and Macron will meet for dinner at Jaipur’s Taj Rambagh Palace, where they will hold a conversation on bilateral and global issues of concern and interest.
Macron, who will be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on January 26, will begin his Jaipur trip by visiting Amer Fort, Jantar Mantar and Hawa Mahal on Thursday. He will be the sixth leader from France to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations.
Sources said Macron’s visit is a unique reciprocal gesture involving visits by Heads of States on successive national days — the PM visited France on its National Day on July 13-14, 2023.
While this visit caps the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Strategic Partnership between the two countries, the two leaders have met half a dozen times in 2023 alone, including on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in New Delhi last September.
“With France, we have a special relationship. Firstly, the visit caps a milestone year of the 25th anniversary of our strategic partnership. India-France Strategic Partnership, the first that India signed with any Western country, has seen all round progress – in bilateral, regional and international context. India and France have traditionally enjoyed close and friendly relations and share a deep and enduring Strategic Partnership covering all aspects of bilateral cooperation which involves a strategic component,” an official said.

Launched on January 26, 1998, the Strategic Partnership that was the first-ever for India among the Western countries and a first for France outside the EU, embodies the core vision of both countries to develop their respective strategic independence by drawing on a concrete bilateral cooperation.
Defence and security, civil nuclear matters and space constitute principal pillars of this partnership that now includes a strong Indo-Pacific component.
In recent years, this partnership has broadened to domains including counter-terrorism, maritime security, climate change, renewable and sustainable development, digitalisation and cyber security among others. “Discussions will take place on all these issues,” the official said.
Sources said that the salience of the partnership is growing in the changing world, complex geo-political environment and in pursuit of respective national ambitions.
Modi and Macron are also expected to deliberate on expanding maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the situation in the Red Sea, the Hamas-Israel conflict and the war in Ukraine.
On Friday, at the Republic Day parade where Macron will be chief guest, a 95-member marching contingent and 33-member band contingent from France will take part in the parade. Two Rafale fighter jets and an Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft of the French Air Force will also feature in the parade.

WN288UYJ7W_AWL703B1NGPE8TI,Express View on India’s energy future: Going solar,_,"January 26, 2024 06:43 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-indias-energy-future-going-solar-9128072/,"In one of his first decisions after becoming Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had set a target of installing 100 GW of solar power in the country by 2022 — 40 per cent of this energy was to be generated from rooftop installations. Though the country’s renewable energy (RE) sector has made appreciable strides in the past 10 years, it missed the 100 GW target by a long margin — the 2022 deadline has been pushed back to 2026. The patchy performance of rooftop installations is a major reason for this failure — the capacity of such systems is currently less than 12 GW. The Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana (PMSY), a new scheme announced by PM Modi on Monday, can place the decentralised solar power segment on a better footing. It aims to take solar power to one crore households.
Installing solar power is expensive for an individual household. That’s why less than a fifth of the rooftop installations are in the residential sector. At the same time, subsidies on energy generated from conventional power sources make RE an unattractive proposition. Central and state government subsidies for solar installations, in contrast, are offset by deterrents such as cumbersome procedures and quality issues. The government’s failure to frame convincing solutions, especially its flip-flops, seem to have made the problem more intractable. Its 2019 policy required households availing the subsidy to buy solar panels and inverters from companies empaneled by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The provision was meant to enable the government to monitor the quality of the rooftop systems. But the centralised system restricted consumer choice and three years later, the ministry relaxed this requirement. “The government will publish the lists of solar panel manufacturers and inverter manufacturers whose products meet the expected quality standards,” the MNRE noted. By all accounts, the change has not made a perceptible difference.
Companies, too, face difficulties in achieving economies of scale when they target individual households. Vendors, therefore, prefer servicing commercial consumers. Gujarat — the state with the most rooftop installations — has tried to address these issues with aggressive awareness campaigns and timely disbursal of subsidies. But with the grid getting a substantial amount of electricity from households, the state’s discoms are confronted with the most difficult problem with RE — intermittent supply. The details of PM Modi’s new scheme are not yet in the public domain. The government would do well to learn the right lessons from the country’s past experiences with solar power."

According to a government order issued on Wednesday, employees willing to opt for the new pension scheme will have to apply before June 30. And those who do not opt for the old pension scheme will continue under the new pension scheme.
Department heads will have to compile lists of employees opting for the old pension scheme and submit them for approval by the end of August 2024, the order read.
In its election manifesto, the Congress had promised to “sympathetically consider” the implementation of the old pension scheme for more than 3.5 lakh government employees.
P Guruswamy, president of the Secretariat Employees Association, told The Indian Express that the January 24 order followed a Supreme Court ruling that directed governments to implement the old pension scheme for such employees whose posts were notified before April 2006.
“Based on this order, the Centre had issued directions to all state governments,” he said, noting that the new order benefited only around 13,000 people, while the demand was to bring all government employees under the scheme.
Guruswamy said that out of the 3.5 lakh employees, around 2.5 lakh worked in state-run boards and corporations, adding that the cabinet had discussed the proposal for implementing the old pension scheme.
Government employees have staged several protests over the past few years demanding the restoration of the old pension scheme. Past state governments, however, dragged their heels owing to the financial burden the scheme would put on the exchequer.
The finance department has also flagged the significant outgo required for pension expenses over the past few years. In March last year, the BJP government formed a panel to study the implementation of the old pension scheme.
It may be recalled that Congress governments in Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan had decided to revert to the old pension scheme."

“She (Mamata Banerjee) is now looking for an excuse to leave the INDIA alliance. She has a setting with the BJP, and it has been proved again. She has to save her family from the CBI and ED. So, she is doing what the BJP is dictating,” CPI(M) state secretary Mohammed Salim said.
“Yesterday, state government officials had a meeting with the Central government officers in Delhi, and today she gave this reaction. One can understand what is going on,” Salim added, referring to the meeting of the state and Central officials over pending dues to West Bengal.
The Indian Express on Tuesday reported that after the meeting, senior officials of the West Bengal government expressed hope “of early resolution” and release of the funds to the state. For over a year, the TMC government in West Bengal has accused the BJP government at the Centre of withholding the state’s share of funds under various schemes, including MGNREGA (rural job guarantee scheme) and PM Awas Yojana (PMAY).
“We have to fight together for upholding independence and democracy, as going with the TMC will not save the Congress… Our condition is that it (Congress) must not have any truck with the TMC,” Salim said.
Meanwhile, senior Congress leader from Bengal, Deepa Dasmunsi, echoed Salim, “Her (Mamata Banerjee’s) statement is proving that she is acting in the hands of the BJP.”
However, her party colleague and state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury refused to comment on the TMC chief’s remark.  Speaking to mediapersons in Cooch Behar in north Bengal, Chowdhury said: “I have come here to see the preparation for Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra… I do not know who will join the yatra and who will not. I am also unaware who is saying what.”

WQP32JAG09_ZDIBWNGAE93WQAO,"On Maldives’ ties with China, India must send out a clear message",Vivek Katju,"Updated: January 29, 2024 09:39 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-maldives-relationship-opinion-9128810/,"Developments in India’s ties with Maldives, following the election of Mohamed Muizzu as President in November last year, once again, profile the country’s difficulties in dealing with its immediate neighbourhood. These problems with neighbouring countries are not new but they have been exacerbated because of China’s persistent assertiveness in the region. India has sought to broadly counter China’s activities by seeking to bring in many neighbouring countries within the fold of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “sabka saath, sabka vikas”. However, the neighbours are clearly finding it impossible to overlook Chinese overtures even while emphasising their links with India. The neighbourhood situation does not present a comforting picture for India, including in the security sector.
India needs a cogent and enduring framework of engagement with its neighbours which harmonises its interests and those of its neighbours. Before a few thoughts on such a framework are offered, a look would be useful at what has happened between India and Maldives after Muizzu’s victory. Muizzu, who has a reputation for being close to China, contested the election on the plank that he would ensure the removal of Indian defence services contingents from Maldives soil. After his victory, he was quick to assert that he would fulfil this pledge. Two days later, after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of COP28 in Dubai on December 1, 2023, Muizzu said India had agreed to withdraw its “military personnel” from Maldives. The Indian statement on the meeting was silent on the question of defence services personnel. Instead, it emphasised the two leaders’ decision to set up a “core group” to strengthen “people-to-people linkages, development cooperation, economic relations, climate change and sports”.
Modi visited Lakshadweep early this month. He extolled its natural beauty and called on Indian tourists to visit the islands. There was nothing wrong with Modi asking Indians to visit Lakshadweep. Perhaps, some Indians while echoing Modi, need not have said that Indians should go to Lakshadweep instead of the Maldives. However, even if they did so, there was no reason for Maldivian ministers to abuse Modi and India. The Indian outrage was natural and Muizzu quickly dismissed the ministers but the damage was done. It added to the unease caused by Muizzu’s demand on Indian military personnel.
Muizzu visited China on January 8-12. He was warmly welcomed by the Chinese leadership led by President Xi Jinping. The China-Maldives relationship was elevated to the status of a “comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership”. Clearly, China is playing the Maldives card with gusto and, in Muizzu, has a committed partner who is willing to make “snide” remarks about India. On his return from China, Muizzu said, “We may be a small country, but that does not give you a licence to bully us”. It does not require any great imagination to comprehend who “you” refers to in this context.
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met his Maldives counterpart Moosa Zameer recently in Kampala on the sidelines of the NAM summit. Jaishankar tweeted, after the meeting, that he had “A frank conversation on India-Maldives ties”. Meanwhile, the core group set up by Modi and Muizzu has also met. The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson said that both sides are working to find “mutually workable solutions” to “enable continued operation of Indian aviation platforms that provide humanitarian and medevac facilities to the people of Maldives”. These platforms are of the Indian Air Force and the military contingent in Maldives is for their operations.
It is good that Jaishankar has had a candid conversation with his Maldives counterpart. It is not difficult to estimate the message that Jaishankar would have given to Zameer. He would have stressed that India respects Maldives sovereignty and its choices. He would have also emphasised that India would be a reliable development partner. However, what India will not be able to accept is for a neighbour like Maldives to become a base from where its security comes under threat. It is natural for a country like India to draw such a red line not only in the context of Maldives but also in respect of other neighbours. It is precisely here that the Chinese are showing no regard for Indian concerns in the immediate neighbourhood.
For over six decades, China has used Pakistan as a cat’s paw against India, including through assisting it with the development of Pakistan’s strategic weapons and delivery systems. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor with its special focus on the Gwadar port has further strengthened Pakistan’s client status. It is not feasible to consider that China will permit Pakistan, even if saner elements within it so wish, to normalise ties with India. China is also seeking to build ties with the Taliban regime to utilise the mineral wealth dormant in the Hindu Kush for its industries in its western regions. India has made openings with the Taliban regime but there is a strange reluctance to move forward. Besides, India’s current visa regime for Afghanistan is counter-productive for its interests. The Chinese are actively moving ahead in Nepal, putting pressure on Bhutan and have their talons in Sri Lanka. Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh considers that it has a coincidence of interests with India but some segments of Bangladesh’s society and polity do not share that view.
For over three decades, India’s other neighbours have witnessed this country being unable to take decisive action to successfully combat Pakistani terrorism. That did not send a message of Indian strength. Again, during these decades, the Indian economy grew substantially but China outstripped India by a factor of six. That too sent out a message to the neighbourhood. These have to be countered.
Modi’s Balakot action of 2019 displayed a determination to use coercive elements of national power to counter terror. A red line was drawn. What is needed is that, quietly and subtly, a series of Indian security red lines have to be enunciated for the region while emphasising the Modi doctrine of “sabka saath, sabka vikas” and of non-interference in the neighbours’ internal affairs. And if the red lines are breached, forceful action will necessarily have to be undertaken.

Nearly 120 workers were ousted from their jobs in December after they raised allegations of sexual harassment and their salaries being deducted. Many workers also complained that they have not been getting their salaries regularly.
On Monday, the sanitation workers conducted a march against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. Two male sanitation workers also tonsured their heads against the administration’s decision to remove them from their jobs at the hospital.
One of the sanitation workers, Satvir, who got his head tonsured, said that supervisors have been deducting his salary for a long time, and he never received any support from the hospital authorities when he complained. “When the women sanitation workers raised the issue of sexual harassment, we decided to raise other issues related to wage norms,” Satvir added.
According to the Safai Kamgar Union, three workers, along with an activist were also, held by the police. A case under various sections of the IPC including criminal conspiracy and assault or use of criminal force obstructing a public servant from discharging duty was registered.
A Delhi government spokesperson said the health minister had assured the workers that action will be taken to ensure that workers are not targeted by vested interests. “It will be ensured that services of no worker are illegally terminated by authorities. There were clear written instructions sent to the Health Secretary,” the official added."

The committee has been formed under Transport Minister Dayashanker Singh and has Chief Secretary Durga Shankar Mishra, Director General of Police (DGP) Vijay Kumar besides Additional Chief Secretary to Chief Minister, SP Goyal, and Principal Secretary (Urban Development) Amrit Abhijat.
According to the administration, more than 8 lakh devotees had “darshan” at the new Ram Temple in the last three days. Of these, 5 lakh pilgrims had darshan on the first day itself on Tuesday when the temple was thrown open for the public.
“The committee has been set up on the instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to oversee the arrangements for the smooth ‘darshan’ of Shri Ram Lalla and the overall management of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi complex,” said a government spokesperson.
Apart from regular devotees coming from different parts of the country and abroad, the RSS has set the target of bringing functionaries and devotees from at least two “prants” (regions) every day from January 26 to February 21. The RSS workers had extended ‘Akshat invitations’ to people in villages across the country to visit Ayodhya after the consecration ceremony.
Functionaries from the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh and the Uttrakhand region are expected to arrive on Friday, followed by UP’s Meerut region and Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor region the next day, it is learnt.
Workers from Jodhpur and Jaipur regions in Rajasthan are scheduled to arrive on January 28, while functionaries from Kashi and Goraksh regions in Uttar Pradesh are expected to arrive on January 30.
A tent city has been set up in the Green Field Township to accommodate 25,000 devotees, officials said.

After the meeting, senior officials of the West Bengal government told The Indian Express that they were hopeful of a resolution and early release of the funds to the state.
For over a year, the TMC government in West Bengal has accused the BJP government at the Centre of withholding the state’s share of funds under various schemes, including MGNREGA (rural job guarantee scheme) and PM Awas Yojana (PMAY). Last week, state government officials said the Centre has been withholding Rs 7,000 crore funds under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) for allegedly not adhering to “branding standards” that include the display of the logo and a photograph of the Prime Minister at ration shops.
A senior IAS officer, who was present in Tuesday’s meeting, on the condition of anonymity said: “The Central government officials asked us about the alleged corrupt practices they found in the implementation of MGNREGA in the state and what steps we have taken. They also asked why we are not using the logo and the photograph of the prime minister in the NFSA scheme. We explained all their queries point-by-point. We think they were satisfied with our answers.”
“There are many differences between the Central and state governments. We have tried to minimise them. Now, we will have to see what stance they will take, and accordingly, we will take our next steps,” the senior officer said.
Sources said the six senior officers of the West Bengal government who took part in the meeting were state Finance Secretary Manoj Pant, state Health Secretary Narayan Swarup Nigam, state Forest Secretary Vivek Kumar, state Panchayat and Rural Development Secretary P Ulganathan, state Food Secretary Parvez Siddiqui, and state PWD secretary Antara Acharya. From the Centre, the meeting was attended by officials of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and Union Ministry of Rural Development.
After meeting the Prime Minister on December 20 last year, Chief Minister Banerjee had said that Modi assured her of holding a joint meeting of government officials to look into the state’s demands on releasing Central funds for various projects."

FRONT PAGE Bharat Ratna for ex-Bihar CM, ‘Jan Nayak’ Karpoori Thakur
Syllabus:
Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance
Mains Examination: General Studies I: Post-independence consolidation and reorganization within the country.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What’s the ongoing story- President Droupadi Murmu has conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously to two-time Bihar chief minister and socialist icon Karpoori Thakur, the Rashtrapati Bhavan announced on Tuesday.
• Personality in News-Karpoori Thakur
• Why Karpoori Thakur is also known as ‘Jannayak’, or the leader of the people?
• For Your Information- Karpoori Thakur was born in village Pitaunjhia (now known as Karpoori Gram), in the Samastipur district of Bihar. He participated in the freedom struggle and was also jailed for it. In independent India, he was voted in as an MLA in 1952. He remained an MLA till his death in 1988, except when he became an MP in 1977 and when he lost an Assembly election in 1984, amid the sympathy wave for Congress after Indira Gandhi’s assassination.
Thakur was education minister of Bihar from March 5 1967 to January 28, 1968. He became the state’s chief minister in December 1970 with the Samyukta Socialist Party, but his government fell after six months. He came to the post again in June 1977, but could not finish a full term, losing power in about two years. This happened due to a reservation policy he implemented, on which we’ll elaborate later. As a new crop of social justice leaders became more powerful in Bihar, Thakur slowly lost the pre-eminence he had enjoyed. While his policy decisions were polarising, he was respected personally for his clean image and his refusal to enrich himself on government funds.
A popular anecdote about him is that when he first became an MLA in 1952, he was selected for an official delegation to Austria. He did not own a coat, and had to borrow a torn one from a friend. When Josip Tito, the president of Yugoslavia, noticed the torn coat, he gifted Thakur a new one. When Thakur died in 1988, after three decades in public life, his home was little more than a hut.
Thakur is known for many of his decisions — removing English as compulsory subject for the matriculation examinations; prohibition of alcohol; preferential treatment for unemployed engineers in government contracts, through which around 8,000 of them got jobs (this was when unemployed engineers were staging regular protests for jobs; one such protester was Nitish Kumar); and a layered reservation system. It was this last decision that went on to have the loudest impact for Bihar as well as the country.
In June 1970, the Bihar government appointed the Mungeri Lal Commission, which in its report of February 1976 named 128 “backward” communities, 94 of which were identified as “most backward”. The Janata Party government of Thakur implemented the recommendations of the Commission. The ‘Karpoori Thakur Formula’ provided 26% reservation, of which OBCs got a 12% share, the economically backward classes among the OBCs got 8%, women got 3%, and the poor from the “upper castes” got 3%. This was much before the central government came up with the EWS quota, and demands of layered reservation gained momentum amid caste census demands.
In the short term, however, The ‘Karpoori Thakur Formula’ cost him dearly. His government fell, and he witnessed major opposition from upper castes. Jayant Jigyasu, national spokesperson of the RJD, told The Indian Express, “After the landmark reservation policy was passed, Thakur had to face derogatory and even abusive slogans from the upper castes, directly targeting his caste. One such went ‘Karpoori kar poora, chhod gaddi, dhar ustura (Finish your work, Karpuri. Step off the chair, go hold a razor)’, a reference to his caste’s traditional occupation of a barber. A point to be noted is that this venom came his way even though he faced no charges of personal corruption or ‘lawlessness’ during his tenure.”
Politically too, his decision of bringing in the reservation policy has been seen as hasty. Jagpal Singh, former professor at IGNOU, in a 2013 paper contrasted Thakur’s way of working with Devaraj Urs of Karnataka: “Unlike Karpoori Thakur, Urs introduced the reservation policy during the last two years of his seven years of rule, after having consolidated his position for most of his rule. About the lack of proper preparation on the part of Karpoori Thakur, Urs remarked, “Karpoori Thakur climbed into the ring before he learned how to box”,” Singh wrote. However, Thakur did keep his promise to his core voters, irrespective of the consequences.

Syllabus:
Preliminary Examination: Indian Polity and Governance-Constitution, Political System, Panchayati Raj, Public Policy, Rights Issues, etc.
Mains Examination: General Studies II: Indian Constitution—historical underpinnings, evolution, features, amendments, significant provisions and basic structure.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What’s the ongoing story-Bangladesh, and others in the Commonwealth have imported this Indian judicial invention. It brought out the worst in confrontational politics, governance, intra-judicial divisiveness but also the best in advocacy, idealism and independence amidst great pressure
• “The best way to institutionalise tyranny and constitutionalise dictatorship would be to amend the Constitution at the will of the majority”-Do you agree?
• “Even a constitutional amendment, validly passed by Parliament’s special majority, can be declared unconstitutional, if it violates the Basic Structure (BS) of the Constitution”-Know in detail
• “The Basic Structure Doctrine has a very debatable jurisprudential basis”-Why this particular sentence is in news?
• First of all, what is Doctrine of the ‘basic structure’?
• How has the doctrine of basic structure evolved?
• What are the basic features of the doctrine of basic structure?
• What power is granted by Article 368 of the Indian Constitution?
• Shankari Prasad case (1951), Golak Nath case (1967), Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), Indira Nehru Gandhi case (1975), Minerva Mills case (1980), Waman Rao case (1981) and the evolution of basic Structure of the Constitution-connect the dots
• For Your Information-The Basic Structure Doctrine emerged from the Kesavananda Bharati judgment of the Supreme Court, delivered by a majority of 7:6 on April 24, 1973. It held that Parliament could not alter the basic structure of the Constitution by an amendment. There is no exclusive and definitive list of what the basic features are, for the judiciary decides this on a case-by-case basis.
In consequence, as cases accumulate, the list of areas off-limits to the executive gets longer. This creates a peculiar political environment where frenzied elections generate tall mandates that are undeliverable. The executive remains hamstrung, constrained not just by limited material resources but bound by limited and uncertain legal room to manoeuvre. The consequence of this gap between parliamentary competence and executive impotence knocks the wind out of the power and capacity of electoral democracy.
The political culture it breeds is known as “cheap talk” in game theory, seen in such emphatic gestures as grandstanding and heady rhetoric followed by inaction, empty rhetoric and costless, non-binding, unverifiable communication between politicians and the electorate. The Basic Structure Doctrine puts “procedure established by law” below “due process” in the functioning of the legislative process.
Its political profiling as “sacrosanct” puts it beyond the ken of politics. In 1951, right at the outset of post-colonial India’s journey into uncharted territory, no less a democrat than Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had taken the bold step to initiate the process to restrict the freedom of speech and expression and got Parliament to pass the First Amendment.
In retrospect, one is grateful for his boldness and sagacity in undertaking the necessary changes in the core principles of the Constitution for the validation of zamindari abolition laws and provisions that stipulated that the right to equality does not bar the enactment of laws that provide special considerations for underprivileged sections of society. Article 368 of the Constitution clearly stipulates that “Parliament may in exercise of its constituent power amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any provision of this Constitution in accordance with the procedure laid down in this article.”

Centre’s sovereign AI push: Compute mission may get over `10,000 crore
Syllabus:
Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.
Mains Examination: General Studies III: Awareness in the fields of IT, Space, Computers, robotics, nano-technology, bio-technology and issues relating to intellectual property rights.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What’s the ongoing story- The Centre’s ambitious artificial intelligence (AI) Mission may soon head for Cabinet approval and could have an outlay of more than Rs 10,000 crore, Union Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar told reporters Tuesday.
• What is sovereign AI?
• How will India regulate AI?
• What are the key highlights of GOI’s ambitious artificial intelligence (AI) Mission?
• For Your Information-As part of the programme, the government wants to develop its own ‘sovereign AI’, build computational capacity in the country, and offer compute-as-a-service to India’s startups. The Indian Express had earlier reported the capacity building will be done both within the government and through a public-private partnership model, highlighting New Delhi’s intention to reap dividends of the impending AI boom which it envisions will be a crucial economic driver.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the AI Mission and said its aim was to establish the computing powers of AI within the country. This, he said, will provide better services to startups and entrepreneurs and also promote AI applications in the sectors of agriculture, healthcare and education.
In total, the country is looking to build a compute capacity of anywhere between 10,000 GPUs (graphic processing units) and 30,000 GPUs under the PPP model, and an additional 1,000-2,000 GPUs through the PSU Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Chandrasekhar had earlier told this paper.
For context, according to a 2020 blog by Microsoft, the company had developed a supercomputer for OpenAI – the firm behind ChatGPT – which consisted of 10,000 GPUs among other things. The government is exploring various incentive structures for private companies to set up computing centres in the country – ranging from a capital expenditure subsidy model which has been employed under the semiconductor scheme, a model where companies can be incentivised depending on their operational expenses, to offering them a “usage” fee, Chandrasekhar had said.
Computing capacity, or compute, is among the most important elements of building a large AI system apart from algorithmic innovation and datasets. It is also one of the most difficult elements to procure for smaller businesses looking to train and build such AI systems. The government’s idea is to create a digital public infrastructure (DPI) out of the GPU assembly it sets up so that startups can utilise its computational capacity for a fraction of the cost, without needing to invest in GPUs which are often the biggest cost centre of such operations.
Apart from building computing capacities, the government is also working on building datasets and making them available to Indian startups.In May 2022, the Information Technology (IT) Ministry released a draft of the National Data Governance Framework Policy under which it proposed the creation of an India Datasets platform, which will consist of non-personal and anonymised datasets from Central government entities that have collected data from Indian citizens or those in India. The idea is that the non-personal data housed within this programme would be accessible to startups and Indian researchers, the draft proposal said.

Direct tax-GDP ratio rose to 15-year high in FY23, tax buoyancy dipped
Syllabus:
Preliminary Examination: Economic and Social Development-Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.
Main Examination: General Studies III: Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilization, of resources, growth, development and employment.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What’s the ongoing story-Direct tax-to-GDP ratio, which reflects the share of taxes in the overall output generated in the country, rose to a 15-year high of 6.11 per cent in the financial year 2022-23.
• What is tax-GDP ratio?
• Direct tax-to-GDP ratio reflects what?
• “Direct tax-to-GDP ratio, which reflects the share of taxes in the overall output generated in the country, rose to a 15-year high”-Why this is significant?
• For Your Information-Direct tax-to-GDP ratio, which reflects the share of taxes in the overall output generated in the country, rose to a 15-year high of 6.11 per cent in the financial year 2022-23, time-series data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) under the Ministry of Finance showed Tuesday. This was accompanied by an increase in the income tax return filers in India to 7.4 crore in FY23, up 6.3 per cent from FY22, even as the tax buoyancy — the growth rate of taxes in relation to the economy’s nominal growth rate — declined to 1.18 in 2022-23 from 2.52 in 2021-22 and 1.29 in the pre-Covid year of 2018-19.
The cost of tax collection — indicating the expenditure on tax collection as a proportion of the total tax collections — inched lower to 0.51 per cent in FY23, the lowest level since 2000-01, but it increased in absolute terms to Rs 8,452 crore, the highest level since 2000-01, the year for which data is last available, the CBDT data showed.
Tax buoyancy had stood at (-)1.21 in 2019-20 and it was not computed for the financial year 2020-21 as both the nominal GDP and tax collections contracted from the previous year. Tax buoyancy had improved to 2.52 in 2021-22 due to a low base effect. Now, tax buoyancy inched lower to 1.18 in 2022-23 even as the growth rate for taxes was recorded at 17.79 per cent in 2022-23, higher than 15.11 per cent nominal GDP growth.
A tax buoyancy greater than 1 reflects a faster growth in taxes as against the country’s national income. Net direct tax collections, which reflect collections after refunds, “increased by 160.52 per cent to Rs 16.63 lakh crore in FY 2022-23 from Rs 6.39 lakh crore in FY 2013-14”, CBDT said in a statement. Gross direct tax collections stood at Rs 19.7 lakh crore in FY 2022-23, a rise of 173.3 per cent from Rs 7.21 lakh crore in FY 2013-14, it said. On a year-on-year basis, net direct tax collections increased by 17.8 per cent, while gross direct tax collections rose by 20.5 per cent.

Syllabus:
Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.
Mains Examination: General Studies II: Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests.
Key Points to Ponder:
• What’s the ongoing story-Canada’s federal government has said it is capping the number of international student visas for a period of two years beginning with the coming academic session. Fewer visas will mean fewer Indian students will be able to travel to Canada for a college degree.
• By how much is Canada cutting the number of international student visas?
• Why has Canada taken these steps to curb the influx of international students?
• Who specifically will be impacted by the decisions?
• Will there be implications for Indians?
• How did India’s relationship with Canada fare historically?
• India-Canada bilateral relations-know in detail
• How have India-Canada relations deteriorated in recent months?
• Why recent allegations by Canada are troubling and unprecedented?
• “Anti-India activities” and “politically-condoned hate crimes” are some of the harsh terms that India has used to describe situation in Canada—What has caused India to take such a decisive step?
• Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world-Can you tell little more on this?
• For Your Information- Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world, numbering 16 lakh people of Indian origin, accounting for more than 3 percent of the total Canadian population and 700,000 NRIs. India became the top source of foreign students studying in Canada — 2.3 lakh, according to 2022 data. India’s total trade with Canada (goods and services) in 2021-22 was US $11.68 billion, much below potential, but when it comes to India’s import of pulses, almost 30% of the total import comes from Canada.
Canadian pension funds have cumulatively invested around US $55 billion in India. Cumulative FDI from Canada since 2000 is about US$4.07 billion. All these have continued despite speed bumps like the recent pause in trade talks — and despite challenges over the Khalistan issue.
As per the 2021 Canadian census, Sikhs account for 2.1 per cent of Canada’s population, and are the country’s fastest growing religious group. After India, Canada is home to the largest population of Sikhs in the world. Today, Sikhs lawmakers and officials serve at all levels of Canada’s government, and their burgeoning population is one of the most important political constituencies in the country. In 2017, Jagmeet Singh, 39, became the first Sikh leader of a major Canadian political party when he took the reins of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP).

WXJ9LBNP6J_QULY73HNU2KO9EA,"Criticism to own temple runs, Opposition walks the tightrope",_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 07:49 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/ram-temple-vijayan-abhishek-banerjee-dmk-9121938/,"From maintaining tactical silence to attacking the BJP government for “blurring” the lines between religion and State, to remembering Ram for the virtues of truth and ethical governance and making temple visits or taking out religious processions, to even lighting diyas to mark the day as urged by the Prime Minister. The Opposition INDIA bloc stayed away from the Ayodhya consecration event but its apprehensions regarding the mandir’s resonance and political potency were apparent in how they walked the tightrope.
Most of the leaders appeared cautious as PM Narendra Modi, in his speech after the consecration, framed the Ram Temple as a symbol of peace, patience, harmony, and linked it to the country. “Ram is not a dispute, but a solution”, “Ram does not belong only to us, but to all”, Modi said, making repeated exhortations of “Dev to desh, and Ram to Rashtra”.
Not surprisingly, the one who put the furthest distance between his government and the Ayodhya celebrations was Pinarayi Vijayan, the CPI(M) stalwart and Chief Minister of Kerala, where the electoral landscape is largely divided between the Left and Congress, and the BJP is not yet a powerful force.
“We had a strong tradition of maintaining separation between religion and the State. But that line… seems to be getting thinner,” Vijayan said in a video message. “It has come to a point in time when the inauguration of a religious place of worship is being celebrated as a State event… As those who pledged to preserve and protect our Constitution, let us reaffirm our commitment to its secular character by declining to participate in the event and upholding our constitutional responsibilities.”
The CPI(M) had been the first to turn down an invitation for the Ayodhya event, and had criticised the government for announcing a partial holiday on Monday to mark the occasion.
The Trinamool Congress, which has seen the emergence of the BJP as its biggest threat, was also sharply critical of the temple event. Ahead of the all-faith rally held by the party in Kolkata on Monday, as a counter to the BJP’s consecration celebrations, its national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee posted that his religion did not teach him to “accept and embrace a place of worship… which has been built over hatred, violence and the dead bodies of innocents”.
Addressing the rally later, TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee said religion and politics should be kept separate.
My RELIGION has not taught me to accept and embrace a place of worship, whether it be a MANDIR, MASJID, CHURCH or GURUDWARA, which has been built over HATRED, VIOLENCE and the dead bodies of innocents. Period!
— Abhishek Banerjee (@abhishekaitc) January 21, 2024
The Congress found itself caught in a war of words with the BJP government in Assam over a temple that its leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on a Manipur to Mumbai Yatra, wanted to visit on Monday to offer prayers. The Congress, which turned down the consecration invite for its top leadership, has been at pains to emphasise that it is not against Ram but the BJP’s politicisation of the event, and questioned the denial of permission to Rahul to visit a revered shrine.
“Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when?” Rahul asked as he sat on a protest surrounded by supporters, who sang ‘Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram’, before the Yatra finally decided to move along.
Incidentally, at least two Congress leaders – Himachal Pradesh minister Vikramaditya Singh, and former Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Nirmal Khatri – attended the Ayodhya event.
Hours after the consecration ceremony, Congress CWC member and Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Shashi Tharoor, posted a picture of the Ram idol on X with a caption “Siyavar Ramachandra ki jai.”
Talking to The Indian Express on the invitation extended to its top leadership, Tharoor had last month said that he would “love to visit the Ram temple one day, but not during a grand political extravaganza like the inauguration and not before the elections, so that no political statement is read into my going”.
“I hope each of the invitees is left free to make a personal choice, rather than be described as ‘anti-Hindu’ if they don’t go or ‘playing into the BJP’s hands’ if they do attend,” he had said then.
In Kerala, the Congress, pushed into a corner by an aggressive BJP, was divided on the issue of attending the Ayodhya event.
In Himachal Pradesh, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu visited the Hanuman temple in Jakhu and announced that an 111-feet statue of Ram would be built at the temple. He also lit diyas at his official residence.
Ex-Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath, whose decision to lean heavily on Hindutva in the recent Assembly elections has come under question after the party lost, put up a post congratulating people on the occasion of ‘Pran Pratishtha’, but criticised the BJP for giving a political colour to the ceremony.
Nath said the BJP government was only obeying Supreme Court orders, and said: “Lord Ram has always been, and will always be, at the centre of faith for all of us. Politics on this is like playing with religious freedom and traditions.”
Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, whose government refused to announce a holiday of any duration to mark Monday’s event, unveiled a Hanuman statue in Bengaluru Rural. After the event, the Congress CM questioned the installation of a lone statue of Lord Ram in Ayodhya. “Ram cannot be complete without Lakshman, Sita and Anjaneya (Hanuman). They (BJP) are separating Ram,” he told PTI, adding: “Congress worships Ram of Mahatma Gandhi, whereas the BJP does not worship him.”
Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray offered prayers at the Kalaram Temple in Nashik, located at the site where Ram is said to have stayed during his exile. He was accompanied by his wife Rashmi Thackeray, and sons Aaditya and Tejas. Party Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut was also present.
Earlier in the day, he visited the memorial of V D Savarkar in Bhagur, the birthplace of the late Hindutva ideologue.
Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh posted on X a short animated video showing Lord Ram arriving in Ayodhya with Laxman and Sita, and said: “Siyaram resides in that pure heart which respects customs, ethics and decorum… Those who follow ‘Riti (custom), Niti (policy) and ‘Maryada’ (decorum) shown by Lord Ram are his true devotees.”
AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal shared a picture of the newly unveiled Ram idol in Ayodhya, captioning it: “Hearty congratulations and best wishes to all of you on this sacred occasion.” He also said he would be “serving the people of Delhi by taking inspiration from the concept of Ramrajya”.

Many others, like JD(U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and DMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin maintained a tactical silence. This is despite a row erupting on social media between the BJP and Udhayanidhi over his earlier statement saying he did not agree with “a masjid being demolished to build a temple”.

X677PHUKK6_P6O94L76NSYCV6E,"What is climate misinformation, and why does it matter?",_,"January 23, 2024 18:23 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/climate-change/what-is-climate-misinformation-and-why-does-it-matter-9123886/,"Misinformation is when people share false information or selectively present data about fossil fuel emissions or climate change that doesn’t give the full picture, potentially influencing how others think about the issue. It doesn’t have to be deliberate — some misinformation can be the result of a simple mistake, or a misunderstanding of a complex subject.
An example is greenwashing, a way that businesses make their environmental credentials seem more environmentally friendly than they actually are. Some fashion brands, for example, tout their use of renewable, natural fibers and recyclable packaging, distracting from the countless racks of fast, disposable fashion they produce every few weeks.
Disinformation, on the other hand, is when climate deniers and other groups or official organizations deliberately publicize false information or spread hoaxes to further their own agenda against climate science and government polices intended to benefit the environment.
How does misinformation influence efforts to tackle climate change?
Major fossil fuel companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil, BP and the Global Climate Coalition, a front group for companies with links to fossil fuel industry that was disbanded in 2002, have been accused of discrediting climate science or hiding their continued fossil fuel investments with lobbying and feel-good ads since the late 1970s.
Groups like The Empowerment Alliance in the US or the Responsible Energy Citizen Coalition in Europe, for example, use a tactic known as astroturfing — allegedly acting like a spontaneous grassroots movement — to support natural gas derived from fossil fuels and discredit green policies, often with funding from unclear sources.
Misinformation and lies are also published by certain media outlets, or promoted by populist politicians. When cyclone-fueled flooding caused more than 40 fatalities in Brazil in September 2023, government opponents and a prominent journalist blamed the deaths on dam failures in an attempt to turn attention away from efforts to mitigate the extreme effects of global heating.
Social media, along with manipulated photos or videos, have made the spread of such misinformation even easier — especially when linked with conspiracy theories, like the recent backlash against sustainable urban planning trend 15-minute cities​.​​​​​​
Climate Action Against Disinformation, a global coalition that works to confront climate mis- and disinformation, found climate denial tweets with hashtags like #ClimateScam have surged on Twitter (now X) following Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform.
Misinformation has also infiltrated policymaking in recent years, most notably during the US presidency of Donald Trump. He repeatedly criticized renewable energy and dismissed climate science both before and during his time in office, often calling global warming a hoax.
Trump would eventually pull the US out of the 2015 Paris Agreement, delaying US — and likely global — climate action for years.
Why does climate misinformation matter?
As greenhouse gas emissions and global temperatures hit one record high after another, time is running out to address global heating. Most scientists agree that we need to act now, but climate misinformation is leading people to question proven climate science — that humanity has triggered climate change — and cast doubt on solutions, undermining public support for the fight against climate change.
In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recognized for the first time that “[r]hetoric and misinformation on climate change and the deliberate undermining of science have contributed to misperceptions of the scientific consensus, uncertainty, disregarded risk and urgency, and dissent.”
Advocacy groups like Climate Action Against Disinformation, governments including the European Union and worldwide organizations like the United Nations, the World Meteorological Organization and the World Health Organization, among others, are working to call out and counter the misinformation.
Many media organizations have also dedicated resources to climate reporting and dispelling environment myths and deception."
X7PGAZ4S6D_H6LU1A1W8TAJNYY,New criminal laws to make India’s justice system ‘world’s most modern’ in 5 years: Amit Shah,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 01:22 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/new-criminal-laws-justice-system-worlds-most-modern-amit-shah-9124007/,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday that until the introduction of the three new criminal laws, the “justice system was crippled” and the laws will see smooth implementation and enforcement by the next five years, making India’s criminal justice system the “world’s most modern.”
Inaugurating the 5th International and 44th All India Criminology Conference on Behavioural Forensics at the National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) in Gujarat’s Gandhinagar, the Union minister suggested that forensic science be used in prosecution, jurisprudence and education to reduce crime rates. He added that the National Education Policy (NEP), expanding the footprint of forensic science establishment, including expansion of NFSU, and the three new laws, are to be seen cohesively and not in isolation, towards a better criminal justice delivery system.
He was referring to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, the three new laws passed by the Lok Sabha that seek to overhaul the country’s criminal justice system.
“Perhaps for the first time in India, after experimenting in two-three areas, we took a brave decision that for offences with more than seven years, we have made visits to crime scenes by forensic officers compulsory. I believe this will simplify investigation,” he said.
The only way to make justice available, accessible and affordable for all is the use of technology. The new criminal justice system envisaged by PM @narendramodi Ji imbibes state-of-the-art forensic science technology in investigation, prosecution and final justice delivery.… pic.twitter.com/lsXXGDd3u2
— Amit Shah (@AmitShah) January 23, 2024
“We are also making an effort to make the process modern… It has different stages, different deadlines but maximum by five years, India’s criminal justice system will be the world’s most modern criminal justice system… These three changes – education (with NEP), forensic science (with NFSU expansion) and criminal justice system (with the introduction of three laws) – if seen in a box then, there can be immense change,” Shah said.
“If the visit of forensic science officers (to crime scenes) is made compulsory, then we need human resources and I assure you that after five years, this country will get more than 9,000 scientific officers and forensic science experts every year and we have made arrangements for the same,” he added.
“We made a modus operandi bureau when I was home minister in Gujarat and then at the Centre. I believe we can go a step forward by studying behaviour and coordinate accordingly in primary education, then we can stop the emergence of criminals.”
“Some crimes are committed due to circumstances but by understanding psychology and behaviour if we can provision for the same then a lot of people can be saved and can reduce a significant decrease in crime rate in our country… Forensic science cannot serve society in isolation, until we integrate it with all stakeholders in the criminal justice system. It should be used in prosecution, in jurisprudence, in education,” Shah said.
Highlighting the importance of integrating multiple databases, Shah underlined the role of technology to stay ahead of criminals especially with fast-changing “form, mode and method” of crime.
Laying down four challenges that lie ahead, Shah said these include “turning towards modern policing by using technology and maintaining basic policing principle, without compromising on basic policing principle”, “not letting human presence decrease by the use of technology,” preparing a network to identify and protect our system from “hybrid and multidimensional threats – be it in the form of AI” and to “make our criminal justice system the world’s most modern by adopting forensics”.
He said “technology is such an area where the whole world can help each other and that can happen if there’s a uniformity in criminal laws, and we should work towards the same.”
“We will create several databases and the home ministry has worked hard because law and order is a state subject. Different ideologies in different states with governments of different political parties. If a circular is issued they see it with suspicion whether it will be politically used. But everyone has come on the same page and a lot of databases have been successfully generated,” he said.
“A lot of work is going on towards data integration and the work of analysing it by using AI is underway. Through (Inter-Operable Criminal Justice System) ICJS-1 and 2, through (Crime and Criminal Tracking & Network Systems) CCTNS, more than 8,000 FIRs have been registered. Every police station in the country except for seven, have been joined in the computer network and with the database. In e-court (database), more than 15 crore prosecutions’ data has been made online and it is available in all Indian languages. Through e-prison (database) nearly 2 crore prisoners’ data have been taken on record…and through e-forensics (database), more than 19 lakh forensic results of the past three years have been taken online,” the minister added.
Shah also felicitated NFSU Vice-Chancellor J M Vyas for 50 years of service in forensics, while the V-C welcomed the Union minister by him presenting a ‘Ram Darbar’ souvenir, a day after the Ayodhya Ram temple consecration ceremony.
Gujarat Law Minister Rushikesh Patel, who was present at the inaugural function, added, “The Ram Mandir ceremony saw many dignitaries in attendance. Despite the security threat, the programme went smoothly because of technology and experts, and it has contributions from NFSU… I want to congratulate you for the same.”
NFSU and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also signed an MoU for setting up a centre of child rights’ advocacy.
Retd Justice Arun Kumar Mishra, chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), emphasised that “we need a victim-centric approach recognising victims as an integral part of the legal process” while hailing the three new criminal laws.
Mishra said, “The object of modern penology is to punish, reform and rehabilitate the offender. Probation, parole, indeterminate sentences and open prisons help in rehabilitation. Recent criminal laws, notably BNS, has prioritised speedy justice and simplified legal procedures for the benefit of the common man and have brought about long emergent reforms repealing archaic laws to be enforced now.”
“The new BNS decriminalises suicide attempts which is entirely in tune with section 115 of Mental Healthcare Act 2017. Attempted suicide will no longer be a criminal offence. BNS 2023 ensures technology, forensic science in criminal investigation and provisions for electrical communication in legal processes. The legislation emphasises citizen-centric practices, ensuring victims receive timely information digitally and specific time limits in investigation and judgment pronouncement,” he added."
XCW994YKRH_99JCRB7YMMT6RG6,Man kills business partner’s son over land deal,Gopal B Kateshiya,"Updated: January 23, 2024 09:04 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/man-kills-business-partners-son-over-land-deal-9122642/,"The son of a land dealer from Surat was allegedly beaten to death by his father’s business partner and others over a monetary dispute at Valukad village in Bhavnagar district late Sunday. The police said the accused made away with Rs 1.1 crore in cash that the victim and his father had carried from Surat to seal a land deal.
The police said the incident took place on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday when Tulsi Lathiya (55), his sons Vipul (36) and Nilesh, went to Valukad for the land deal. While Vipul was into selling garments online and was living with his father in Surat, Nilesh works in a private firm in Jamanagar.
According to an FIR registered at Vartej police station in Bhavnagar, Tulsi and his sons went to the house of Labhu Savani, a resident of Valukad and Tulsi’s business partner. The FIR stated that around a month ago, Tulsi and Vipul had come to Valukad to see a 40-bigha plot that Labhu had proposed to purchase in partnership at a cost of Rs 5 crore. Tulsi and Labhu had agreed that the former will pay Rs 1.1 crore and Labhu Rs 4 crore for the land.
Bhavnagar SP Harshad Patel told The Indian Express, “After dining at Labhu’s home, they all went to Labhu’s farmhouse to count the cash that Tulsi had brought. However, some argument ensued. As per Tulsi’s complaint, Labhu called his son Darshan Savani, who came to the farmhouse with four other men. They confined Tulsi and his sons in a cottage and beat them up with sticks, accusing Tulsi of usurping their money in a land deal the two had struck in Surat around a year ago.”
According to the FIR registered on the basis of Tulsi’s complaint, after Vipul fell unconscious following bleeding from his head, Labhu, his son and the four unidentified men fled, taking the cash with them. They also allegedly threatened Tulsi and others that they would be killed if they approached the police.
Tulsi and Nilesh rushed Vipul to government-run Sir Takhtasinhji General Hospital in Bhavnagar city where doctors declared him brought dead on arrival. Nilesh was admitted to the hospital for treatment.
According to the FIR, Darshan is a soldier with the Army. “The father and son, along with four others, have gone underground… An FIR has been lodged at Vartej police station,” Patel said. Labhu and others have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 396 (dacoity with murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 120 (criminal conspiracy) and 306(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.
The FIR quoted Tulsi as saying that around a year ago, Tulsi, Labhu and a person named Pravin Nakrani had given Rs 75 lakh to a man called Ajit Darbar as token for purchasing Darbar’s 24-bigha agricultural land in Boghan village. The three partners had the land levelled. However, that land deal fell through and Darbar promised to return Rs 90 lakh, including expenses incurred for levelling the land. “However, he has not returned that money till date. So, I and my partner Labhu… had an ongoing dispute about it,” the FIR quoted Tulsi as saying."
XEKJIQ6UA0_HYKP9U5IW1JKEEK,"Congress hopes to placate Mamata, resolution in Punjab difficult",Manoj C G,"Updated: January 25, 2024 07:47 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/tmc-india-alliance-mamata-banerjee-remarks-reactions-9125469/,"Exactly seven months after the Congress and several regional parties came together in Patna and resolved to contest the Lok Sabha elections against the BJP unitedly, the Opposition grouping — christened INDIA later — showed the first serious signs of unraveling on Wednesday. However, the Congress, which is being blamed for the cracks in West Bengal and Punjab, appeared hopeful of placating at least West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee. As for Punjab, the Congress leadership appeared resigned to the fact that an alliance with the AAP was difficult.
Hours after Banerjee declared that her party would contest the Lok Sabha polls alone in West Bengal, sources in the Congress said its top leadership was trying to get in touch with her, and asserted that there would be at least a tactical alliance in the state. Seeking to placate her, the party said it could “not imagine” the INDIA bloc without Banerjee. It also hung on to her remarks that she was determined to fight the BJP.
Banerjee’s remarks came a day before Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is scheduled to enter West Bengal.
Both AICC general secretary in charge of organisation, K C Venugopal, and Congress communication head, Jairam Ramesh, said the party was hopeful of sorting out the differences with the TMC. The TMC, on the other hand, maintained that the Congress’s demand for more than two seats in West Bengal was “unreasonable” and “like asking for toffees”.
The Congress always knew that seat-sharing in Bengal would be a challenge given its state unit’s aversion to it, as well as the Left parties’ reluctance regarding a three-way seat-sharing pact. However, what it did not expect was Banerjee saying the issue of a national alliance could be decided after the elections, and the Congress should contest 300 seats and leave the rest to the regional parties, which, she said, were together. If the Congress was not agreeable, the regional parties could go ahead and contest on their own, she said.
At the heart of the tussle between the Congress and TMC is the former’s demand for at least six seats in West Bengal, and reluctance to part with any seats in Assam and Meghalaya. TMC sources said that in the last elections, the Congress recorded over 30% vote share in only two seats (Berhampore, Malda Dakshin), and added that the party could think of increasing the offer marginally if the Congress reciprocated in Assam and Meghalaya.
The scrimmage between the Congress and AAP, too, is over the former’s reluctance to enter into seat-sharing pacts in Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Goa. While the Congress is agreeable to an understanding in Delhi, it is not keen on similar pacts in Punjab and other states. Sources in the Congress said an alliance with the AAP was on the cards in Delhi.
“The situation in Punjab is similar to that of Kerala where the Left and Congress are fighting against each other despite being members of the INDIA bloc. So, chances of an AAP-Congress alliance in Punjab are next to impossible. Mann’s statement that the AAP would contest in all the 13 Lok Sabha seats is not a setback in that sense. We are also prepared to fight in all 13. But an alliance in Delhi and some minor adjustment in Haryana and Gujarat is very much possible,” said a senior Congress leader. Congress leaders admitted that the statements by Banerjee and AAP’s Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann were damaging to the alliance in terms of optics.
Meanwhile, seat-sharing arrangements in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have not made much headway either.
In Bihar, the pact is more or less sealed (17 seats each for JD-U and RJD, 5 for Congress, 1 for CPI-ML Liberation). But Congress allies like the JD(U) are keeping a wary eye on the developments elsewhere. JD(U) leaders hold the Congress responsible for the delay in other states, blaming its insistence on an “unreasonable” number of seats in states where it is a marginal player, and unwillingness to share in states where it is a dominant force.
The JD(U) is also upset over the delay in finalising the leadership roles within the INDIA bloc. A week has passed since the bloc held an online meeting – which was skipped by Banerjee, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav and Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Uddhav Thackeray — but the bloc is yet to even announce the decision to appoint Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge as the chairperson and Nitish Kumar as the convener. Banerjee, for one, is said to be unhappy with the decision, indicating that the TMC felt sidelined. She had underlined that she was the one who suggested the INDIA name for the bloc.
On Wednesday, the Congress sought to play down Banerjee’s remarks, saying the TMC was an important pillar of the alliance and it could not imagine the INDIA bloc without her. “If you look at the full statement of Mamata Banerjee… she has said that she wants to defeat the BJP. That she will not step back in her fight against the BJP. We are entering West Bengal with that spirit,” Jairam Ramesh said. “When you are on a long journey, there will be speed-breakers on the way at times, there will be red lights… That doesn’t mean we will step back. Chalta rahta hai (such things happen), we cross the speed-breakers, red lights will turn into greens,” he added."

The CM also said that Ram Rajya was the basis of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies, ideas and schemes.
The CM assured the people that no one would become a hurdle in the “parikrama (perimeter)” of Ayodhya, that there wouldn’t be any firing on its streets nor imposition of curfew. “Ram’s sankirtan will buzz on the streets and Deeopstav and Ramotsav will be celebrated here,” the CM said.
Adityanath also said that for centuries, Ayodhya had remained neglected, as it faced deliberate disregard that hurt the Sanatan faith. He added that today, every city and village of the country had become Ayodhya dham and that every road led to Shri Ram Janmabhoomi, as every tongue chanted Ram-Ram and the entire country became “Ram-may (full of Ram)”.
He also said that Shri Ram Janmabhoomi would probably be the first such matter on which the majority community had fought at many levels for many years to build a temple at the birthplace of its deity. Adityanath said every section of society, from saints, sanyasis, priests and nagas, to intellectuals, politicians and tribals, had contributed towards Lord Ram’s work.
“We are overwhelmed today. The temple has been built at the same place for which a commitment had been made,” Adityanath said, expressing gratitude to PM Modi for ending the long wait for the accomplishment of the resolution.
The CM said Lord Ram’s life teaches patience of the kind the Indian community had maintained over the centuries, even as their commitment grew in strength every day. “Today, the entire world is watching the grandness and divinity of Ayodhya. Everyone is eager to come to Ayodhya,” he said, adding that it was getting established as the cultural capital of the world.
Highlighting the infrastructure being developed in Ayodhya, the CM gave credit to the PM’s commitment, willpower and foresight. He said funds of several thousand crores were being spent for an “Ayushman, swachh, saksham, suramya, sugamya, divya and bhavya Ayodhya.”
Adityanath also said that development of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple was a spiritual ritual in the cultural renaissance of India. “This is a rashtra mandir. Pran pratistha of Shri Ram Lalla is a historic occasion of national pride,” the CM said.

Speaking to the media in Siliguri, Chowdhury said the schedule of the yatra, set to resume from Falakata in Cooch Behar on January 28, was submitted to the state administration long ago. “Then, the administration said nothing but now they are saying they are not ready to give permission. We faced hindrances in Manipur and Assam, and now we are facing the same problem in West Bengal as well,” he said.
“We were denied permission to hold a public meeting in Siliguri. We expected better cooperation from the state government. Anyway, the route and the itinerary of the Yatra remain the same except for a few changes,” he said.
The Yatra, which began in Manipur on January 14, entered Cooch Behar in West Bengal from Assam on Thursday, and took a two-day break. It will travel through north Bengal on January 28 and 29 and then enter Bihar on January 29 evening.
The Bengal leg of the Yatra comes amid rumbings within the INDIA bloc, with TMC chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee saying that her party would contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls independently. She also said the TMC would not join the yatra as the Congress had not let her know of the Yatra entering the state.
Countering Chowdhury’s claims, the TMC said the administration in Bengal is free of political influences. “Adhir Chowdhury is responsible for the INDIA alliance falling apart in West Bengal. Secondly, all Opposition parties conduct programmes in the state, nobody faces any problems. The administration must have taken the decision as there are board examinations in schools,” said TMC MP Santanu Sen.
The BJP said that Congress was getting a taste of “authoritarianism” from its ally. “Does the TMC own Bengal that they will decide who will get permission to hold a rally? Now, the Congress, which complains against the BJP, is getting a taste of authoritarianism from its ally TMC,” BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

XHBGDHRAYA_6YF6NS94180CO5F,"Decode Politics: Lok Sabha polls to INDIA, why for BJP, getting Nitish a win-win",Liz Mathew,"Updated: January 27, 2024 09:35 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/why-for-bjp-ls-polls-to-india-getting-nitish-a-win-win-9127900/,"In August 2022, when Nitish Kumar led the JD(U) out of the NDA for the second time, and joined hands with the RJD to form an alternative government, the BJP had termed it “good riddance”.
But privately, party leaders admitted that the exit of the JD(U) could hurt the BJP’s 2024 Lok Sabha calculations in the politically crucial and key Hindi heartland state of Bihar.
On Thursday, amid feverish talk of the Bihar Chief Minister opening channels with top BJP leaders, at least three state BJP leaders told The Indian Express that if the JD(U) returns to the NDA, it would not just be a morale booster for the BJP but also practically demolish the INDIA bloc at the national level.
A party leader said Nitish’s entry would be just the kind of push the BJP needs in Bihar, to turn the spring in its step after recent Assembly wins and the January 22 consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, into sure-shot victory.
Sources in the BJP also confirmed that talks between the two sides had been on for the last few days. “But the condition from the BJP state unit was that Nitish should not insist on continuing as CM. However, our top leadership is conscious of what it is doing,” a senior leader from the Bihar BJP said.
Another party leader from the state said that Nitish is in direct touch with the top leadership, and that the state unit does not have much of a say. “However, it is more or less clear that Nitish Kumar is keen on returning to the BJP and becoming a part of the NDA again.”
The leader pointed out that Nitish was cognisant of the fact that in 2019, an alliance with the BJP had helped the JD(U) win 16 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats it contested. “He knows that he can win more seats with the BJP, even if the JD(U) contests fewer constituencies, because he can avail the benefits of the current wave in favour of the BJP due to the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Also, many senior leaders in his party are more partial towards the BJP than the Congress,” the leader said, also confirming that Nitish’s one demand was staying on as CM.
Other sources too said that the BJP had based its calculations entirely on the Lok Sabha elections. “Nitish Kumar and the JD(U) bring a 15% vote share… Even if the BJP again won 17 of the 17 it contested last time, the absence of the JD(U) votes could make things tougher,” a party leader said, adding: “But, above all, the BJP will gain by breaking the INDIA bloc into pieces.”
The leader added: “The BJP central leadership has always been conscious of what the JD(U) brings to the table. In the state where caste formulation is still a crucial factor in electoral politics, the relevance of Kumar and his JD(U) cannot be ignored.”
Incidentally, both the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) factions are already with the BJP. The BJP’s promotion of Chirag Paswan at the JD(U)’s expense was seen as one reason for Nitish switching sides in 2022.
While gains to the BJP are clear, Nitish’s exit would be a blow that the INDIA bloc may also find difficult to recover from, after the snubs from the Trinamool Congress’s Mamata Banerjee and Aam Aadmi Party’s Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday.
Top sources in the BJP predicted more such setbacks to the Opposition bloc in the run-up to the fast-approaching Lok Sabha elections, with the BJP doors open to individual leaders as well as smaller parties.
Recently, former senior Congress-turned-AAP leader Ashok Tanwar joined the BJP in Punjab, while on Thursday, former Karnataka CM Jagadish Shettar rejoined the BJP, months after having crossed over to the Congress.
“More Opposition leaders, including from the Congress, will be joining the BJP. What the BJP wants is the NDA getting close to 400 seats, if not the BJP,” a senior party leader said."
XI2MYI8QCJ_GFLAZA7CPZICWA5,Delhi HC sets aside order directing disclosure of PM CARES Fund tax exemption,Malavika Prasad,"Updated: January 23, 2024 03:39 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-hc-order-disclosure-pm-cares-fund-tax-9122496/,"The Delhi High Court on Monday set aside an order of the Central Information Commission (CIC) directing the Income Tax Department to disclose certain information to an RTI applicant regarding tax exemption granted to PM CARES Fund.
The order came on a petition moved by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO)/Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax HQ Exemption challenging CIC’s April 2022 order directing the CPIO to provide the copies of all documents submitted in the exemption application and copies of the file notings granting the approval related to PM CARES Fund under the RTI application filed by one Girish Mittal.
This information was denied to Mittal by the CPIO and the Appellate Authority on the ground that the information sought is exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act.
A single judge bench of Justice Subramonium Prasad said, “The CIC does not have the jurisdiction to direct furnishing of information, provided for in Section 138 of the IT Act.”
The HC held that even if the CIC had the jurisdiction, the “failure to give PM CARES, notice of hearing”, would in itself have vitiated the CIC’s order.
Perusing through the provisions of the RTI Act and the Income Tax Act, Justice Prasad observed that the IT Act is a “special” Act governing all provisions and laws relating to income tax and super-tax in the country; while on the other hand, RTI Act is a “general Act which deals with the providing of information to citizens to enable them to realise their Right to Information”. The HC said in the present case, IT Act will prevail over the RTI Act.
“…Section 138 (1)(b) and Section 138 (2) of the IT Act lay down a specific procedure relating to disclosure of information to a third party under the IT Act would override Section 22 of the RTI Act. The information sought for by the Respondent (Mittal) is clearly covered by Section 138(1)(b) of the IT Act. The satisfaction of Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is, therefore, necessary before such information can be divulged. That satisfaction cannot be abrogated to any other authority under a general Act for divulging the information sought for,” the HC observed.
Justice Prasad further noted that the information sought by Mittal has been sought from the CPIO of Income Tax Department and “not from the PM CARES Fund”.
“Since the information sought for by the respondent relates to a third party, PM CARES Fund ought to have been heard. Section 11 of the RTI Act prescribes that any information related to a third party can only be divulged after giving notice to the said third party. In view of the above, the CIC ought to have followed the procedure specified under Section 11 of the RTI Act before ordering for grant of information,” the HC held.
The High Court, therefore, allowed the plea filed by the CPIO, IT Department, and set aside the CIC order.
The CPIO had denied Mittal information under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, which provides for exemptions from disclosure of personal information which has no relationship to any public activity/interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the CPIO or the SPIO or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.
Meanwhile, Mittal had argued that there is an “overwhelming public interest” in directing the authority to supply the information sought for as PM CARES Fund has been created to “serve the public”.
He argued that the PM CARES Fund is a charitable fund established to provide relief to the public during the Covid-19 pandemic or any similar emergencies.
He had contended that the Income Tax Department had on March 27, 2020, approved the applications given by the PM CARES Fund for grant of exemption on Income Tax, adding that he wanted to know the “exact procedure followed by the Income Tax Department in granting such a swift approval and to see whether any rules or procedure were by-passed by the Income Tax Department in granting such approvals”."

The Central government has instituted an annual award known as Subhash Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar to recognise and honour the invaluable contribution and selfless service rendered by individuals and organisations in India in the field of disaster management.
The award is announced every year on January 23, the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The award carries a cash prize of Rs 51 lakh and a certificate in case of an institution, and Rs 5 lakh and a certificate in case of an individual.
“Under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the country has significantly improved the disaster management practices, preparedness, mitigation, and response mechanisms resulting in significant reduction in casualties during natural calamities. The Union Home Minister continuously reviews disaster preparedness and stresses upon training of communities and adopting best practices by the stakeholders to minimise loss of life and property,” said a Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson in a statement.
For the award of 2024, online nominations were solicited from July 1, 2023, onwards. In response to the award scheme, 245 valid nominations were received from institutions and individuals.
“The 60 Parachute Field Hospital in Uttar Pradesh was established in 1942. It had provided medical assistance during the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, the 2015 Nepal earthquake under the operation name Maitri, and Indonesian tsunami as part of operation Samudra Maitri in 2018. In February 2023, in response to the 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the unit rapidly assembled a 99-member team and established India’s pioneering level-2 medical facility in Turkey overcoming resource constraints and language barrier to set up a 30-bed hospital in Hatay province’s school building. The unit provided a wide range of medical services, including rescue, triage, surgery, dental treatment, X-ray, lab facilities, and offered care to 3,600 patients during a 12-day period as a part of Operation Dost,” the spokesperson said."

According to senior officials, the charred body of an unidentified man was recovered in the morning, with no other injuries reported in the fire.
Ravindra Ambulgekar, Chief Fire Officer, Mumbai Fire Brigade told The Indian Express, “The flames were extinguished in the morning and the cooling operations are ongoing. The fire broke out and spread to nearly 400 to 500 shops inside the wood market. Therefore, the fire spread instantly”.
Speaking to The Indian Express, senior officials from the ward’s fire office said that the fire broke out at the timber market situated near a popular eatery at Grant Road. “The fire erupted in one of the shops inside the old wood market in the locality. The blaze then spread to the other shops located in the vicinity, most of which were wooden godowns,”
The civic body is yet to determine the cause of the blaze.
CFO Ambulgekar said, “We are still investigating the cause of the fire. The cause of the fire will be known once we prepare our detailed report.”
Meanwhile, responding to questions, an official from the BMC’s Disaster Management office said, “The people inside the nearby high-rise had vacated the building themselves in time ensuring that no one was trapped”.
The fire, which broke out at one of the shops at the old wood market in Grant Road, was reported at 2.07 am on January 26 and was declared level IV at 3.03 am.

Two lines from the high-rise buildings were also deployed to put out the fire."
XKVDBZ0NZK_TKCA6NIKCA14ESG,Bharat Ratna: Was Karpoori Thakur’s contribution to nation building greater than that of Narasimha Rao?,Sanjaya Baru,"January 25, 2024 16:11 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bharat-ratna-karpoori-thakur-contribution-nation-building-greater-narasimha-rao-9127460/,"The Union government’s decision to posthumously name Bihar politician Karpoori Thakur as Bharat Ratna has once again turned the spotlight on the politicisation of the nation’s highest civilian honour. The late Karpoori Thakur, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted, was known for his modesty and simplicity. There are, however, many such Gandhians in public life who have lived the life of Karpooriji. But then, not many whose honouring would have political benefits for Modi, that too in a state like Bihar. The PM should be complimented for his transparent honesty in drawing attention to the political qualifications and social origins of Karpooriji.
The Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour, is the one award that the President and Prime Minister have the power to personally name an individual for. There is a procedure for the selection of all other Padma awardees. A group of officials and non-officials, the latter being ones regarded “reliable” by the government of the day, sit for days to put together a list of all Padma awardees. The President and Prime Minister can suggest names to this committee of officials before their list is forwarded to the PM for approval and subsequent forwarding to the President. This procedure has been made more elaborate over the past decade with the public at large being invited to name a person for a Padma “through proper channel”.
There have been instances when the President of India took the initiative to select a name for the highest honour. The first such case was when in 1955 President Rajendra Prasad chose to name Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Since the announcement of the award and its handing over is made by the Rashtrapati, Prasad had to wait till he was no longer Rashtrapati for Prime Minister Nehru to name him.
That the Bharat Ratna is an honour bestowed directly by the President and the PM has made it special. The award honoured itself with its first ten awardees that included physicist C V Raman, engineer M Visvesvaraya, Indologist P V Kane, educationist, social reformer and fighter for women’s rights D G Karve, Gandhian P D Tandon, philosopher S Radhakrishnan, and the first governor-general C Rajagopalachari. The first posthumous awardee was Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. He earned the honour after his handling of the 1965 war with Pakistan.
The first time a selection for this honour may have raised eyebrows was in 1975 when V V Giri was named. He was a prominent labour leader before becoming President but one could argue he was not in the same category of eminence as the first ten awardees. The first time the Bharat Ratna became purely political was when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi honoured her former party President and Congress Party leader from Tamil Nadu, K Kamaraj. Kamaraj was undoubtedly a popular politician and a genial person, but his greater contribution was to his party rather than the country.
Indira Gandhi redeemed herself in her second term naming Mother Teresa and the Gandhian Acharya Vinoba Bhave. Rajiv Gandhi blotted his record naming M G Ramachandran posthumously. That was a blatant politicisation of the award since the Congress party sought to maintain its alliance with the AIADMK.
Interestingly, short-term PMs with just about a year in office made better use of the opportunity. This may well have been their way of seeking public approval for themselves. Consider the choices of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar — B R Ambedkar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Morarji Desai, Rajiv Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, the only non-Indian to be so honoured. No controversy there.
The Bharat Ratna regained its glory during the tenure of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. His list was a who’s who of eminent persons — Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, J R D Tata and Satyajit Ray. Prime Minister Rao was the only PM to name an industrialist as Bharat Ratna when he named JRD in January 1992. JRD’s choice was significant not only because he was the first and only business leader to be so honoured. It was also New Delhi’s message to Mumbai in the wake of Rao’s “New Economic Policies” and the liberalisation of the economy.
JRD had become a symbol of the movement for “free enterprise” during the era of the “licence-control-permit Raj”, having played a key role in the launching and financing of the Swatantra party. No other business leader has since been named as Bharat Ratna, even though the family of industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani lobbied hard to secure that honour posthumously for him. In 2016, Dhirubhai’s friend and benefactor, President Pranab Mukherjee named him for a Padma Vibhushan.
The Bharat Ratna acquired glory during the tenure of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee whose choice of both politicians and artistes was impeccable — M S Subbulakshmi, C Subramaniam, Jayaprakash Narayan, Amartya Sen, Gopinath Bordoloi, Pandit Ravi Shankar, Lata Mangeshkar and Ustad Bismillah Khan. Though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh continued this tradition of keeping the honour largely non-political by naming Bhimsen Joshi, Sachin Tendulkar and scientist C N R Rao for the honour, he regrettably ignored the legitimate case of his political mentor P V Narasimha Rao.
Historians, economists and foreign affairs analysts will long remember the policy legacy of Narasimha Rao. He not only provided political leadership to a fundamental shift in economic policy that has stood the country in good stead but also led India out of the difficult geopolitical environment of the post-Cold War world. Rao’s economic policies not only saved the country from an ignominious external payments default but also stimulated the rise of private enterprise. Not surprisingly, one of India’s few truly self-made billionaires and a distinguished business leader N R Narayana Murthy recently called Rao the architect of India’s economic rise. “In 1947 we won political freedom,” said Murthy, “In 1991 we won economic freedom.”
Neither Singh nor Modi, both of whom can claim to have taken the economy forward on a path laid out by Rao have bothered to use their decade in office to honour their distinguished predecessor. Many in Rao’s home state of Telangana see a bias against South India in this political judgement of Delhi’s leaders. Was Karpoori Thakur’s contribution to nation building greater than that of Rao?

XN2F7JVUBG_V3ROJ07L9B88UVG,50 per cent of Type 2 diabetes patients are asymptomatic: What tests should they take to detect their condition?,_,"Updated: January 26, 2024 22:50 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/type-2-diabetes-asymptomatic-patients-test-9129087/,"Type 2 diabetes is often dubbed the silent epidemic, with a significant portion of individuals carrying the condition unaware of their predicament. Studies indicate that up to 50 per cent of Type 2 diabetes patients are asymptomatic, meaning they experience no noticeable symptoms despite having elevated blood sugar levels. This poses a considerable health risk, as early detection and management are pivotal in preventing complications associated with diabetes.
Asymptomatic individuals may not realize they have diabetes until complications arise, such as heart disease or kidney problems. Therefore, understanding when to start testing blood sugar becomes crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes.
How early should one begin testing for blood sugar? The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that individuals with a higher risk of developing diabetes should start testing their blood sugar levels early. High-risk groups include those with a family history of diabetes, individuals with obesity, high blood pressure and those over the age of 45. Additionally, people from certain ethnic backgrounds, such as African American, Hispanic, Native American and Asian American, are more prone to developing Type 2 diabetes.
For individuals with no apparent symptoms but fall into these high-risk categories, regular blood sugar monitoring should commence around the age of 40.
What are tests for those with asymptomatic diabetes? Testing can be done through a simple fasting blood sugar test, which measures glucose levels after an overnight fast. Another effective test is the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), where blood sugar levels are measured before and after consuming a sugary solution at different times of the day. If your blood sugar level is 140-199 mg/dL two hours after the drink, then you are in the prediabetes stage, while any reading higher than 200 mg/dL indicates diabetes.
There’s always the Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Test that comes as part of any routine bloodwork. It shows the average blood sugar levels over the past few months. If your HbA1c level is higher than 5.7, then it means you need to consult a diabetologist.
Then there’s the Random Blood Glucose Test, which measures the glucose levels in the blood at any given time, regardless of when the person last ate. It can give you an idea of the tendency of blood glucose spikes in your body.
You could also check for autoantibodies in your bloodstream. Now these are antibodies that mistakenly target and attack the body’s own tissues or organs.
A simple urine test is used to detect the presence of glucose in the urine. A high level is a red flag.
However, it’s essential to note that recommendations might vary based on individual health profiles. Those with additional risk factors or a strong family history of diabetes may need to initiate blood sugar testing earlier. Consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial to determine the most appropriate screening schedule tailored to individual circumstances.
Any unknown conditions that we need to factor in? Aside from age and risk factors, other signs that warrant blood sugar testing include unexplained weight loss, frequent infections and a history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Individuals experiencing increased thirst, hunger, or fatigue should also consider blood sugar testing, as these symptoms could be indicative of underlying diabetes."

This year, this joyous occasion will fall on a Friday. It signifies the moment when India became a republic, free from the rule of the British Empire.
The Indian Constitution holds the highest authority in our nation. It serves as the guiding framework for citizens, encompassing fundamental rights, directive principles, and the responsibilities that both citizens and government institutions must adhere to.
India achieved independence from the British Empire on August 15, 1947. However, at that time, the country did not possess a constitution. The constitution was crafted approximately two weeks later by the Constituent Assembly of India, which included prominent figures like Dr. Rajendra Prasad, B. R. Ambedkar, B. N. Rau, and many others. It officially came into effect on January 26, 1950. Hence, when the Constitution of India was adopted on November 26, 1949, it was deemed fitting to celebrate and enforce this document on a day associated with national pride—January 26.
This occasion is celebrated with grandeur in every city across the country, with the most impressive display taking place in the national capital, New Delhi. The Republic Day parade commences from Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President’s residence) and proceeds to India Gate. The President of India hoists the national flag, while all those in attendance sing the National Anthem, “Jana Gana Mana.” Following this, a 21-gun salute is fired by the Indian Army Regiment of Artillery.
The parade includes contingents from the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, all adorned in their official regalia. Schoolchildren, army personnel, and NCC cadets join forces for special displays, tableaux, and exhibits representing each state. India also exhibits its military prowess during the event. Those interested in witnessing the parade can secure tickets online.
Being invited as the Chief Guest at Republic Day celebrations is the highest honor bestowed by a country in terms of protocol. The Chief Guest plays a central role in various ceremonial activities that have become an integral part of the event’s fabric and lead-up.
The Chief Guest receives a ceremonial guard of honor at Rashtrapati Bhavan, followed by an evening reception hosted by the President of India. They also lay a wreath at Rajghat in honor of Mahatma Gandhi. There is a banquet held in their honor, a lunch hosted by the Prime Minister, and calls from the Vice-President and the External Affairs Minister.
The selection process for the Chief Guest begins nearly six months before the event and involves careful considerations. The nature of the relationship between India and the guest country is a central factor. The invitation to be the Chief Guest at the Republic Day parade signifies the highest level of friendship between India and the guest’s nation. Political, commercial, military, and economic interests of India play a pivotal role in the decision, with the Ministry of External Affairs aiming to strengthen ties with the guest country in all these aspects.
The Republic Day 2024 Parade is scheduled to commence at 10:30 AM on January 26th (Friday) at Kartavya Path. The venue has a seating capacity of 77,000, with 42,000 seats reserved for the general public. The parade is expected to last for approximately 90 minutes.
The theme of the Republic Day 2024 parade revolves around ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘Bharat – Loktantra ki Matruka,’ emphasizing India’s role as a nurturer of democracy.
The Chief Guest for the Republic Day 2024 Parade is French President Emmanuel Macron. The parade will also feature a 95-member marching contingent and a 33-member band contingent from France.
Ticket prices for the general public have been kept affordable. Tickets for the Republic Day Parade on January 26th are priced at Rs 20 per ticket for 4,320 tickets and Rs 100 per ticket for 37,680 tickets.
The Beating Retreat Ceremony is scheduled for January 29th (Monday), and tickets are available for Rs 100 per ticket. Only 1,200 tickets are available for this event, and they can be booked through the dedicated portal http://www.aamantran.mod.gov.in or the MSeva Mobile App, which is available on Google Play Store."

Dhankhar spoke at the launch of the Law Ministry’s year-long pan-India campaign “Hamara Samvidhan, Hamara Samman,” to mark the 75th year of India as a Republic.
The Vice President also launched the Nyay Setu App, which is aimed at providing a unified interface for legal information, legal advice, and legal assistance.
According to the ministry, the event was envisaged to instill a sense of pride and responsibility to uphold the ideals outlined in the constitutional framework.
Union Minister of Law and Justice Arjun Ram Meghwal said it is important for citizens to know the Constitution. “Our Constitution is both rigid and flexible. Which is why it is important to know the Constitution,” he said."

Sweden has not fought a war in two centuries, staying neutral through the two World Wars and the Cold War. In recent years, while it joined the European Union and collaborated with NATO, it showed no intention of actually joining the military alliance its powerful neighbour, Russia, is hostile to.
However, this neutrality had to be abandoned after Russia invaded Ukraine. With public opinion increasingly in favour of joining NATO, both Sweden and Finland applied for membership in 2022. While Finland’s bid was cleared, Sweden ran into stiff opposition from Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Once a country is a NATO member, an attack on its territory is considered an attack on the US-led alliance, and all 31 members are obliged to defend each other.
Turkey had accused Sweden of going soft on groups it sees as terrorists, such as the Kurdish militant outfit the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Quran-burning protests held in Sweden, which its government says are protected under freedom of speech laws, further soured its relationship with Turkey.
When Turkish legislators cleared Sweden’s bid recently, Fuat Oktay, a senior member of Erdogan’s party, told parliament that Sweden had tightened its anti-terrorism laws, cracked down on the PKK’s activities, and lifted restrictions on arms sales to Turkey, AP reported. Sweden has also said it will support Turkey’s EU membership bid.
Erdogan had also linked Turkey’s support to Sweden with the US agreeing to sell 40 F-16 fighter jets to Ankara. While the US had not said the deal would depend on Turkey’s Sweden actions, the sale is expected to go through now.
Hungary had been seen as following Turkey’s lead in blocking Sweden. Its grievances with the country include Stockholm’s negative remarks about the rule of law and state of democracy under Orban. Orban is also more friendly with Russia than other NATO nations. After Turkey’s move, Orban said Tuesday that he had invited Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson to Budapest to discuss “future cooperation in the field of security and defence as allies and partners,”reported AP.
Once Sweden becomes a member, almost all of the Baltic Sea coastline, except that in Russia’s control, will become NATO territory. This will provide the alliance strategic bases close to Russia, make supply lines more streamlined, and make it easier to defend assets in the sea.
Sweden’s military, though numerically small, is modern and experienced in past NATO missions. Importantly, it has advanced aircraft and submarine capabilities."

The 27-nation European Union and the Geneva-based UN rights office say the death penalty violates the right to life and does not deter crime.
Kenneth Eugene Smith was put to death in Alabama on Thursday with pure nitrogen gas, a first-of-its-kind execution that placed the United States at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment.
Smith appeared to shake and convulse before being pronounced dead at an Alabama prison after breathing the gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation.
“He was writhing and clearly suffering,” Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office, said at a regular UN briefing in Geneva. “Rather than looking for novel, untested methods to execute people, let’s just bring an end to the death penalty. This is an anachronism that doesn’t belong in the 21st century.” She said the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, had written to authorities in Alabama about the issue, and said his office will continue to speak out and use “every tool in our toolbox” to prevent other states from doing so.
It was the first time a new execution method has been used in the US since 1982, when lethal injections were introduced and later became the most common method.
“According to leading experts, this method is a particularly cruel and unusual punishment,” the diplomatic service of the EU said in a statement. It also expressed concern that the number of executions in the US increased last year.
“Twenty-four people were executed in five states despite a steady, overall decline of the use of capital punishment in the US since 2020,” it said. “We call for states that maintain the death penalty to implement a moratorium and move towards abolition, in line with the worldwide trend.”"

The SIT has also nabbed another partner Gopal Shah — a former Town Development Officer (TDO) of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) — from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. Officials of the SIT confirmed to The Indian Express that Shah, a partner in the joint venture M/s Kotia Projects, had been held from Raipur by a team of the Vadodara crime branch and was “in transit” to Vadodara.
“We have nabbed Gopal Shah from Raipur in Chhattisgarh. He will be formally arrested once our team brings him to Vadodara. He is in our custody in transit… His arrest will help the investigation in the right direction,” Zone 4 Deputy Commissioner of Police Panna Momaya, who is a supervising officer of the SIT, said.
Shah, an architect by profession, ran a firm named ‘Planning Solution’ and allegedly joined M/s Kotia Projects as a consultant partner in 2016, which helped the developer to qualify for the bid of developing the Motnath lake in Harni in the second attempt of the bidding process after being initially disqualified by VMC for “having no experience” in the field, sources in the SIT said.
On Wednesday, the SIT sought a 10-day remand of Kotia to complete a “deep” investigation into the tragedy, including ascertaining details of the contracts between VMC and the developer as well as the sub-contracts awarded by the developer.
District Government Pleader Anil Desai, who appeared for the SIT, said, “The police had sought a remand of 10 days on the ground that a probe was necessary to ascertain who all were involved in running this boating facility that showed gross negligence resulting in the loss of 14 lives, including 12 children…the details of the contract, permissions received to run such a facility as well as the involvement of other persons, who may not be part of the contract. The court has granted a remand until January 31.”
Meanwhile, Youth Congress leader Kuldeepsinh Waghela threw ink at Kotia as a mark of protest while he was being produced in court Wednesday. Police held Waghela from the spot, who said that he was protesting the “disregard for human life shown by Kotia” by running a facility that “clearly violated basic safety practices”."

XV8YR6QECM_LGGVA7PICLPNML3,The debate over the ‘caste question’: How minorities’ reservations were decided by the Constituent Assembly,_,"Updated: February 7, 2024 20:35 IST",20240125,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/research/the-debate-over-the-caste-question-how-minorities-reservations-were-decided-by-the-constituent-assembly-9127571/,"“In India there are castes. The castes are anti-national. In the first place because they are about separation in social life. They generate jealousy and antipathy between castes. But we must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality.”
〜 Dr BR Ambedkar in his final speech to the Constituent Assembly in 1949.
When the Constitution of India was being drafted by the Constituent Assembly, discussion on minority rights was a key feature in the debates. While they started as a means of establishing political safeguards for minorities, the debates concluded by providing reservations and affirmative action only for ‘backward classes’ and not religious minorities. They also demonstrated the varied criticisms and opinions of the members in producing the present provision of reservations in the Indian Constitution.
Before debating the provisions for the protection and upliftment of caste minorities, the Constituent Assembly deliberated on defining the term “minority”. Political scientist Rochona Bajpai in an article Constituent Assembly Debates and Minority Rights (2000) says that minorities encompassed three kinds of communities — religious minorities, Scheduled Castes, and ‘backward tribes’.
Discussions regarding the definition of minority were crucial to deciding the nature of provisions needed. It was relatively easier to demarcate religious minorities and draft a framework of equal citizenship to the Indian state regardless of religious affiliations. However, it was not the same in the case of caste as inclusive citizenship would not address the fundamentally hierarchical and undemocratic character of the caste system. The question of who the caste minorities are and how the term ‘minority’ might be defined remained.
Freedom fighter and farmers’ leader NG Ranga believed that the masses in India are the real minority. “These people [the masses] are so depressed and oppressed and suppressed till now that they are not able to take advantage of the ordinary civil rights. These are the real minorities who need protection”, he argued during the Constituent Assembly Debates in 1948.
For Ranga, the term minority did not denote the numerical status of any group. Instead, as Bajpai writes, it signified that “the group that suffered from some kind of a disadvantage with respect to the rest that entitled it to special treatment from the state.” Bajpai further says that the numerical strength of these communities only increased their importance to the socio-political fabric of India and prompted the debate on proportional representation. Many groups including the All-India Hindu Depressed Classes Association, which was founded by Ambedkar in 1930, submitted a plea that the Constitution must provide representation for Scheduled Castes in proportion to their population. The Association aimed to achieve representation of socially marginalised groups such as Dalits in India’s political institutions.
Sri Nagappa, a Scheduled Caste Congress representative from Madras, felt that it was important for the Scheduled Castes to be considered a minority. During the debate, he said, “recognition as a minority is crucial if we want to resist appropriation into one or other community.”
Nagappa’s arguments questioned the position of Dalits and untouchables within Hindu society. Lawyer and member of the Constituent Assembly elected from Bombay, KM Munshi, said the term minority was “defined in international treaties and law along racial, religious and linguistic lines, but the Scheduled Castes are none of these”.
He argued that the Dalits were “part and parcel of the Hindu community and the safeguards given to them to protect their rights are only till they are completely absorbed into Hindu community”. As a result, for Munshi, the Scheduled Castes were Hindus and not a minority, and therefore did not require constitutional reservations and protections in a Hindu-majority country.
Research scholar Zubair Ahmad Bader in an article Difference and Reservation: A Reading of the Constituent Assembly Debates argues that the minority debate was tied to the question of difference and disadvantage. Bader notes that the arguments about minority status in the Constituent Assembly highlighted social, cultural or economic differences between communities that were perceived to belong to the same religion.
Tribal groups led this discussion saying that they not only were culturally distinct but also had land rights, which would have to be constitutionally affirmed. Author Jagannath Ambagudia in a 2011 article, Protective Discrimination and Social Justice: Exploring Constituent Assembly Debates writes that isolation of tribal areas and state protection of Scheduled Tribes in cases of encroachment, hostility or exploitation by non-tribals is necessary.
Historian Shabnum Tejani writes that the debate around defining the term minority revealed profound differences in the ideas of democracy among the Assembly members. Scheduled Caste leaders thought of democracy as a means of political and social emancipation. Other leaders like Debi Prosad Khaitan, an upper caste Congress member who was elected to the Constituent Assembly from Darjeeling, feared that if the Scheduled Castes and Tribes were made to be a separate category, along with religious minorities, they would make up more than half of the population. “Independent India could not be composed of a series of minorities, he warned, this was not democracy as people knew it”, he argued.
Now, the dilemma before the Constituent Assembly was to find a constitutional method to politically recognise communities while at the same time fostering national unity and an inclusive democratic structure. Tejani argues that further debates about this predicament brought into question the aim of reservations also. Were reservations a method to celebrate India’s diversity or were they a means for social and political emancipation?
In his 1936 essay The Annihilation of Caste, Ambedkar argued that “caste is not a division of labour but also the division of labourers”. Hence, along with the minority question, Ambedkar was also faced with the trouble of envisaging a constitution that would guarantee the eradication of caste as an institution and secure lower castes adequate political representation.
Madhav Khosla in his book India’s Founding Moment writes that Ambedkar approached the caste question in three ways. First, by introducing ‘backwardness’ as the principle to identify groups that required constitutional protection and reservations. Although vague, Ambedkar, in a speech in the Constituent Assembly in 1948, clarified his position on the matter.
He argued that caste operates differently in different regions. A community belonging to the Shudra varna in Punjab might not be on the same socio-economic level as a community of the same caste in Karnataka. Therefore, backwardness concerning the socio-economic and political status of the community must be taken into consideration while drawing up the list of communities for constitutional protection. Ambedkar left this task to the State governments.
Khosla argues that introducing backwardness as a means of evaluation was also Ambedkar’s way of reconciling the multiple positions on the minority question. He writes, “The focus on backwardness shows that there was no particular group identity that the Constitution sought to protect. For Ambedkar, the concept of “backwardness” could reconcile the equality of opportunity with the inclusion of specific communities in public life”.
Secondly, the introduction of the ‘backwardness’ evaluation criteria also underpinned class status along with caste. Any scheme of reservations would operate on the principle of equality of opportunity. For instance, reservations would have to be confined to a limited number of seats to make space for everyone eligible for the post.
As a result, the concept of backwardness would be relative. A group could only be considered as backward with respect to other communities. Khosla writes that despite being a numerical minority, the Sikh community was denied preferential treatment because it was “backward relative to other communities.”
Social worker Hriday Nath Kunzu who was elected from United Provinces, supported Ambedkar on this particular argument. He said, “protection can only be granted to a class, whether you call it a minority or backward, only on the ground that it is backward and if left to itself would be unable to protect its interests.”
Thirdly, the concept of backwardness in some ways also resolved the question of whether reservations were for social emancipation or to highlight India’s diversity. Ambedkar’s policies made it quite clear that the purpose of reservations was for the social and political emancipation of backward groups.
Despite being pragmatic towards the criteria for reservations and resolution for the minority question, Ambedkar failed to tackle the minority question effectively. The substitution of minorities with “backward classes” provided no resolution for a definition of minority and the distinct cultural identities that were put forth by several leaders.
Responses to Ambedkar’s approach
Many members of the Constituent Assembly, like TT Krishnamachari and Hriday Nath Kunzu were critical of some parts of Ambedkar’s approach to the caste and minority question. Kunzu and Ramchandra Manohar Nalavade argued that the word ‘backward’ is not defined anywhere in the Constitution. “Article 301 already provides for the appointment of a Commission to enquire into the condition of the backward classes. But only those classes that are educationally or socially backward will be looked into”, Kunzu said.
While Kunzu agreed and supported Ambedkar on some attributes, he believed that ‘backward’ is open to interpretation, has to be defined more robustly, and cannot be left to the states or the courts to deliberate. Kunzu further argued that if constitutional protection for the backward classes is indefinite it might lead the State to believe that its duties towards them are restricted to the facilitation of the provision of reservations. As a result, the reservation must be reviewed and revisited from time to time, he argued.
Krishnamachari argued that there was confusion about the relationship between the definition of “backward” and caste. “The intention of the framers as to who should come under the category of backward classes is unclear. It does not say ‘caste’. It says ‘class’. Is it a class which is based on grounds of economic status or on grounds of literacy or on grounds of birth?”
Krishnamachari believed if literacy rates were considered to draw the list of backward classes, more than 80 per cent of India’s population in 1949 would be backward.
Ambedkar justified the use of the word ‘backward’ by citing the equality of opportunity for citizens and the limited number of seats reserved for groups that have historically not had the opportunity to enter administration. He argued that the Assembly has to safeguard these two factors and said, “unless you use some such qualifying phrase as “backward” the exception made in favour of reservation will ultimately eat up the rule altogether.”
Despite Ambedkar’s justification of reservations, prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru believed that the abolition of reservations for minorities is a “historic turn in our destiny”. He argued that granting safeguards to minorities will isolate them. “Maybe you protect them to a slight extent, but at what cost?”, he asked. Nehru feared that reservations might also forfeit inner sympathy and fellow feelings with the majority of the country.
Although Nehru felt uncomfortable about reservations, he supported reservations for Scheduled Castes. He said, “Frankly, I would like to put an end to reservations but in the present state of affairs in India it would not be a desirable thing to do with regards to the Scheduled Castes”. Nehru affirmed that he did not look at the question of reservations through the lens of religion or caste. He preferred to approach it from the point of view of helping a backward group.
Ultimately, the Constituent Assembly granted reservations for employment for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under Article 16(4A) of the Constitution. It did not take into consideration religious minorities, despite the first draft of the Report of the Advisory Committee on Minorities recommending reservation for religious minorities along with SCs and STs. Initially, the reservations according to the report were sanctioned for only 10 years but have been renewed every year since. Even Christian and Muslim SC and ST communities do not have reservations.
The Partition influenced the decision to not grant reservations to religious minorities. Sardar Vallabhai Patel in 1949 submitted the report of a special sub-committee to consider the problems facing minority populations in East Punjab and West Bengal.
The committee comprised Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, KM Munshi and Ambedkar. The panel thought that conditions in the country had changed to such an extent that “it was no longer appropriate in the context of free India and of present conditions that there should be reservations of seats for Muslims, Christians, Sikhs or any other religious minority.”
They believed that reservation for religious communities might lead to “certain degrees of separatism and was to the extent contrary to the conception of a secular democratic state.” They believed that the Fundamental Rights of the freedom of religion and rights of minorities to maintain their own educational institutions were sufficient safeguards to protect minorities. However, the Advisory Committee agreed that “the peculiar position of the Scheduled Castes would make it necessary to give them reservations for a period of ten years as originally decided.”
Ambedkar attempted to resolve multiple positions on the caste question by introducing the concept of backwardness and reservations as a method of creating a society that transcended caste. However, as political theorist Sudipta Kaviraj says, “We have moved from a framework that recognized equality beyond caste to one where equality-based claims are made through caste”.

Y3JDUVLEOS_CR28CJ15Z47I88P,Punjab and Haryana High Court directs Chandigarh admin to allot 3 plots in Sarangpur to develop Court infra,Jagpreet Singh Sandhu,"January 22, 2024 15:01 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-haryana-high-court-judges-9121886/,"The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently directed the Chandigarh administration to allot three plots to it in Sarangpur on account of the rise in the number of sanctioned strength of judges over the years.
The order came while the Court was hearing a plea from Vinod Dhatterwal, secretary, Punjab and Haryana High Court Employees Association, concerning the requirement for additional space for the high court.
In November last year, the Chandigarh administration had told the high court that it is “considering to give separate land at Sarangpur near PGI, Chandigarh for keeping the judicial record of this High Court.”
During the hearing of the matter, the division bench of Acting Chief Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Nidhi Gupta observed, “This High Court was constructed in the year 1954 with sanctioned strength of 09 Judges and at that time, there were about 200/250 registered Advocates. As on today, the sanctioned strength of the High Court Judges is 85 and there are about 10000 to 12000 registered Advocates in the High Court.”
The Bench further observed, “In the gap of almost 70 years, the sanctioned strength of the High Court Judges has arisen from 09 to 85 and at present, there are 69 Court Rooms in the High Court building, in which Permanent Lok Adalats as well as Mediation Centers are also working. Further, this Court is in the process of appointing 10 Counsellors and extra staff will be required for their back-up. In the next 50 years, there can be further increase in the sanctioned strength of the High Court Judges to the extent of 140/150.”
The Bench said to accommodate so many judges as well as administrative staff, land in Sarangpur, which consists of two plots of six acre each and one plot of 2.86 acre, should be allotted by the Chandigarh administration in favour of the high court.
The Bench further said that the Court in December 2023 had observed that it would give up its building in Sector 17 and Industrial Area Phase-I, Chandigarh, if the three plots were allotted.
“However, at that time, the increase in the sanctioned strength of the High Court Judges from 09 in the year 1954 to 85 in the year 2024 as well as the further increase in the next 50 years, had not been examined. Hence, now since this fact has also been examined, it is made clear that if the aforesaid three plots are allotted to the High Court, the High Court will not give up its building situated in Sector 17 and Industrial Area Phase-I, Chandigarh,” it noted.
The matter was adjourned to January 24."

A division bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora, in its January 22 order, observed, “If the choice of a partner in a marriage is left unregulated, incestuous relationship may gain legitimacy.”
The high court said there was no merit in the challenge to Section 5(v) (conditions for a Hindu marriage) of the Hindu Marriage Act as raised in the plea filed by a woman. The woman had sought to strike down the provision. She was also aggrieved by a trial court’s order declaring that the marriage between her and her distant cousin was solemnised in contravention of the provision of the Act and was held null and void.
She had moved an appeal against the trial court’s order before the high court which had been dismissed. She then moved a plea in the high court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 5(v) Hindu Marriage Act, which bans ‘sapinda’ marriages.
The bench further said that it was unable to accept the woman’s contention that Section 5(v) HMA is violative of Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution as the exception in the section is only for marriages between people on the basis of custom having force of law, which requires stringent proof and its existence is to be adjudicated upon by court of law.
The bench said that the woman had been unable to prove the “existence of custom in the facts of her case and has relied upon consent of parents” which cannot take the place of custom.
The bench also said that no tenable grounds in law for challenging the provision were placed before the court and added that the petitioner had failed to plead any “legal grounds” for challenging the restriction imposed by the provision.
“The impugned sub-section enacts that no marriage can be solemnised between parties who are related to each other as sapindas, unless such marriage is sanctioned by usage or custom governing the parties. The custom which permits marriage between persons who are sapindas of each other must fulfil the requirements of proof of a valid and existing custom as envisaged in impugned Section and under Section 3 (a) of the HMA Act, which defines the expressions ‘custom’ and ‘usage’,” the high court said.
However, the bench added that the woman can initiate legal proceedings against her former husband before an appropriate forum as per law."

As per the statement issued by AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday, the committee would be visiting nine zones split across the 38 districts in the state.
Edappadi had urged his party cadre to act as bridge for facilitating meetings between the panel and representatives of various sectors of society, including farmers, weavers, fishermen, government officials, teachers, people belonging to unorganised sectors, women, students, industrialists, entrepreneurs, members of the non-government organisations, etc to learn their needs and expectations from the Member of Parliament and the central government.
As per the schedule, the panel would receive inputs from Chennai and Vellore zones on February 5, Villupuram and Salem zones on February 6 and Thanjavur, Tiruchirapalli zones on February 7. The panel members would visit Coimbatore zone on February 8, Madurai zone on February 9 and Tirunelveli zone on February 10.
Last week, the AIADMK had constituted four committees for drafting the party’s election manifesto, holding seat-sharing talks, chalking out startegies for electioneering and poll propaganda, and advertising.
Senior party leaders Natham R Viswanathan, C Ponnaiyan, Pollachi V Jayaraman, D Jayakumar, C Ve Shanmugam, S Semmalai, B Valarmathi, O S Manian, R B Udhayakumar and Vaigaichelvan are part of the 10-member panel formed for drafting the party’s election manifesto."
YD85WRLZ20_MWA23WCZXFCUW50,Actors shouldn’t be obsessed with themselves: Manoj Bajpayee’s advice to aspiring actors,Ravina Warkad,"January 23, 2024 11:33 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-international-film-festival-bollywood-actor-manoj-bajpayee-9123087/,"While interacting with the audience at the Pune International Film Festival, veteran actor Manoj Bajpayee challenged the popular saying that actors should be obsessed with themselves.
“The problem starts here. The moment you start thinking about how you are looking, how your mouth is twitching, you stop concentrating on your character and subconsciously, you are only thinking about your face,” said Bajpayee.
He revealed that he doesn’t look in the mirror nor the monitor during his performance. “Very early in my life, I realised that mainstream doesn’t need a face like this, but mainstream will definitely need a craft like me, but for that, I will have to work on it. It’s a choice I made very early on in life,” he said.
It was one of the many words of advice the actor shared for aspiring actors. Among other things, Bajpayee advised them to train in some form of music and dance to hone their craft. He shared that singing is a critical skill to excel in theatre. “I was very besura (dissonant), when I started learning to sing. But if you can’t manage to sing a little bit, you can’t survive theatre,” said Bajpayee, who has worked in numerous musicals including an adaptation of the West Side story.
Bajpayee also learnt Kathak for a play where he performed the role of a male dancer, who used to dance in the guise of a woman, which was a major success. At the age of 21, he started training in a semi-classical dance called Mahibanchav, which he pursued for four years.
“I realised my body language is not that great, so someone suggested I should learn the dance form. It really helped me a great deal. It has rhythm, some very aggressive mudras and postures,” said the veteran actor who has recently delivered hits on the OTT platforms such as ‘The Family Man’ and ‘Killer Soup’.
He also highlighted the importance of patience and steering clear of distractions in the early years while working on one’s craft. “Newcomers want to learn everything in five to 10 days. They don’t have patience because we are living in a time where Instagram and Twitter are such a big thing and making a 30-second reel is your achievement,” said Bajpayee, who trained with theatre actor Barry John for seven years.
When he met John, Bajpayee told him about his childhood dream of going to National School of Drama. John asked ‘why’ and promised to teach him things that the institute wouldn’t. John made Bajpayee write plays and assist him, among many other things.
Drawing lessons from this journey, his advice for aspiring actors was, “If you are able to become an institution in yourself, that will be just as good…There are many great actors who came out of the National School of Drama because they wanted to do something great with their lives as an actor.”
He also advised aspiring actors to really work on their craft first before entering the field as a professional. “The moment you have one student who is above average, there will be 50 people calling for some OTT, some theatre. It is up to the student to say that first I will learn the craft and then only I will get out and start working. Students should have the ability to say no to distractions,” Bajpayee said."

He then headed to the historic Amber Fort, one of Jaipur’s biggest tourist attractions. On the way there, he was greeted by thousands of school children and local residents who had lined the sides of the road.
At Amber, he was accompanied by External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar and deputy CM Diya Kumari. Macron also interacted with some French-speaking Indian students at Amber, as well as some local artists.
He then left for Jaipur’s Jantar Mantar, where PM Modi greeted him with a hug. The two were then given a tour of the astronomical observatory established by 18th-century ruler Sawai Jai Singh.

From there, Macron and Modi took out a roadshow that passed through the old walled city, where they were welcomed by people in large numbers. Specially decorated for the occasion, the walled city had life-size cutouts and hoardings of the two leaders, with many onlookers holding banners saying “Bienvenue” – French for welcome. The two also clicked a selfie during the roadshow.
Modi and Macron also did some shopping in the old city, and Macron was given a replica of the Ram Temple. In visuals from a shop, Modi could be seen explaining the BHIM UPI payment app to Macron.

Mann’s declaration came even as Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said the TMC is not in any discussion with the Congress, and that her party would go it alone in the 20 Lok Sabha election in the state.
While addressing the media, Mann said, “Desh mein Punjab banega hero, Aam Aadmi Party 13-0.” He was categorical in stating, “The AAP is not going with Congress in Punjab.”
Earlier this month, Bhagwant Mann seemed to soften his stance, hinting that the high command would make the final decision on any alliance with Congress. Subsequently, the AAP collaborated with Congress in the mayoral elections for the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.
Raghav Chadha, a party leader, announced in the national capital that this marked the beginning of electoral cooperation within the INDIA bloc, aiming to collectively challenge the BJP in the upcoming parliamentary elections.
He said the candidates will be chosen on winnability. “We have got a list of 40 probables out of which 13 will be selected. We will get them surveyed. Only those who fulfil the criterion of winnability will be given the ticket.”
Out of these 40, there were 2-3 probables or even more in some constituencies. The list included the sitting MP Sushil Kumar Rinku, he said.
All eyes have been on the AAP and Congress in Punjab with the Congress leaders opposing the alliance tooth and nail in the past on the plea that the AAP government in the state had unleashed vendetta on them and several leaders were being arrested by the Vigilance Bureau in corruption and other cases by the police.
The Opposition Congress had already started holding meetings in different constituencies, indicating that they would not have a truce with the AAP. Recently, in several feedback meetings with Congress general secretary in charge Devender Yadav, the party cadre had opposed any alliance. The Congress leaders had confirmed on anonymity that no alliance would take place in Punjab.
Punjab has 13 Lok Sabha seats. The AAP has only one MP from Punjab. The AAP has only one — Sushil Kumar Rinku from Jalandhar who had won in Lok Sabha byelection after the seat was vacated following the demise of Congress MP Santokh Chaudhary.
The Congress had six sitting MPs."

The former CM’s elder son and JDU Rajya Sabha MP Ramnath Thakur celebrated the “greatest news of his life” at his paternal village with his family and fellow villagers. Thakur’s younger son Dr Birendra Kumar Thakur celebrated with his family at a government flat in Patna. Both sons thanked PM Narendra Modi and the Central government for “bestowing the highest civilian award to the son of soil”.
Talking to The Indian Express, Ramnath Thakur said: “Getting the news of my father being conferred with Bharat Ratna on the eve of his 100th birth anniversary is the biggest news of my life. Saying that we are overwhelmed could be an understatement. It is a huge honour for all the poor and deprived and all those for whom my father worked all his life. I profusely thank PM Narendra Modi.” “This is not the time to react to who is saying what. Nor should we ascribe any political motive. It is a very special day that comes rarely in life… it feels like a dream coming true,” he said.
Ramnath’s daughter Namita Kumari said: “We all are overwhelmed. It is an honour for all Bihar people and all those believing in democratic values.”
At Dr Birendra K Thakur’s house in Patna, similar feelings echoed. “It feels like a dream being realised. We always knew my father was a special person. This honour is for all the downtrodden people of Bihar. We are greatly thankful to the PM for recognising his contributions,” he said.
Dr Thakur’s wife Kanaklata Thakur said: “It’s like another Diwali in our lives. I am fortunate to have got Karpoori Thakur’s blessings as father-in-law. I still remember the silk sari he had got me after my wedding. Bharat Ratna has elevated us all.”"

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) warned that the crisis is impacting global food prices, with longer distances and higher freight rates potentially cascading into increased costs.
“Disruptions in grain shipments from Europe, the Russian Federation and Ukraine pose risks to global food security, affecting consumers and lowering the prices paid to producers,” UNCTAD said in a statement.
This assumes significance as India has already witnessed rising food prices forcing it to announce export curbs on items including wheat, rice and sugar.
“Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to these disruptions, and UNCTAD remains vigilant in monitoring the evolving situation,” UNCTAD’s head of trade logistics, Jan Hoffmann said.
While current container rates are approximately half of the peak seen during the COVID-19 crisis, it will take time for the higher prices to hit consumers, with the full impact expected within a year, the UN trade body further said.
The Suez Canal, a critical waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, handled approximately 12% to 15% of global trade in 2023, UNCTAD said, estimating that the trade volume going through the Suez Canal decreased by 42% over the last two months.
“Average container shipping spot rates from Shanghai have more than doubled (+122 per cent ) since early December. More specifically, the rates from Shanghai to Europe have more than tripled (+256 per cent ), while rates to the west coast of the United States increased by 162 per cent, although ships on this route do not go through the Suez Canal,” the statement read."
YOY45SJ68E_HFIQ26MUQ98QJ0V,SC questions Centre’s stance on amendment restoring AMU minority status: ‘You have to stand by what Parliament has done’,Ananthakrishnan G,"Updated: January 25, 2024 04:55 IST",20240124,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/sc-centre-amu-minority-status-parliament-9125577/,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta’s submission that the government did not accept the 1981 amendment made by Parliament to the Aligarh Muslim University Act, and said it cannot take such a stand.
The top court said that “irrespective of which government represents the cause of the Union of India, Parliament’s cause is eternal, indivisible and indestructible” and that the government would have to stand by the amendment.
It began with Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who was part of a seven-judge Constitution bench hearing the question of AMU’s minority status, asking Mehta, appearing for the Centre, whether he accepted the 1981 amendment.
Presided by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, the bench also comprises Justices Surya Kant, JB Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma. The court is hearing a reference made to it by a three-judge bench in February 2019.
“This is an amendment by the Parliament. Is the government accepting?” asked Justice Khanna.
“I am not,” the solicitor-general responded.
Expressing surprise, the CJI said, “How can you not accept an amendment by Parliament? Mr Solicitor, Parliament is an eternal indestructible body under the Indian union. Irrespective of which government represents the cause of the Union of India, Parliament’s cause is eternal, indivisible and indestructible.”
He added, “And I can’t hear the Government of India say that an amendment which Parliament made is something I don’t stand by. You have to stand by this amendment. You have an option. Go through the amending route and change the amending Act again.”
The solicitor-general said,“I am not arguing a matter of A versus B. I am before a seven-judge Constitution bench answering constitutional questions. The amendment in question was subjected to challenge before the high court and there is a judgment declaring that it is unconstitutional for ABCD grounds and as a law officer, it is my right as well as my entitlement and duty to say that this view appears to be correct”.
The reference was to the 2006 Allahabad High Court ruling that held the 1981 amendment unconstitutional.
The CJI exclaimed, “This would be radical because a law officer would be then telling us that I don’t abide by what Parliament has done. You have to stand by what Parliament has done. Parliament is undoubtedly supreme in law making function. Parliament can always amend the statute, in which case a law officer can say I have an amended statute now… Can we hear any organ of the Union government say that notwithstanding a Parliamentary amendment, I don’t accept this amendment?”
The solicitor-general said he was supporting the 2006 judgment.
As the CJI reiterated that “Parliament” is an “eternal indivisible and indestructible entity under democracy”, the solicitor-general said he was not disputing that.
The CJI then asked, “How can you say I don’t accept the validity of an amendment?”
The solicitor-general responded, “Would a law officer be expected to say whatever amendments were made in the Constitution during Emergency were true only because they were made by the Parliament?”
“Here I have a judgment of the high court,” he added.
The CJI pointed out that was why “the 44th amendment came in”. “It came only to redress the evils which were perpetrated in the name of a constitution amendment”.
“Who will decide that these are evil being perpetrated?” asked the solicitor-general.
“Obviously you prove my point. The power to decide that is in the elected body, which is Parliament. Parliament can always say what we did during the Emergency was wrong and we are rectifying it…,” the CJI said.
“Not after it has been set aside by the division bench of a high court and therefore is not any more on the statute book,” the solicitor-general added.
“There is an affidavit filed by the government. It is not my stand. It could have been my stand also. But if I cannot argue that this amendment could not have been made, any law officer will have to support the amendments made during Emergency irrespective of whether it is my view or anybody else’s view that this was to remove some anomalies or bad things happening to the citizens of India,” the senior law officer said.
At this point, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the AMU Old Boys Association, referred to the then attorney-general defending the Emergency provisions brought in by the Indira Gandhi government. “I was sitting in the court when the Attorney-General Niran De was arguing that what is being done is right. I (Niran De) defend the Emergency provision. Why? Because he could not say otherwise,” Sibal added.
The solicitor-general responded that “the distinction is Niran De was not in a situation where one high court had struck it down and the provision was not on the statute book.”
As Sibal said the Madhya Pradesh High Court had struck it down, the solicitor-general replied that there were other high courts which had upheld it.
The solicitor-general added, “Everyone knows there are two versions. When asked by the court, ‘do we not protect Article 21 if somebody is being hanged or a personal liberty is being deprived’, Niran De’s answer was ‘yes you cannot do it’. It was not to defend the act, it was to instigate the court to act, and this is the position, ‘please interfere’.”
In 1967, the Supreme Court in S Azeez Basha vs Union of India, held that AMU was not entitled to minority status as it “was brought into existence by the central legislature and not by the Muslim minority”.
The minority status was restored by an amendment to the AMU Act in 1981 but this was challenged before the Allahabad High Court, which struck down the changes in January 2006.
AMU and the UPA government appealed against the high court decision. But the NDA government informed the apex court in 2016 that it was withdrawing the appeal filed by the previous government."
YOZX3SVSQ7_VK4Y35LZ0DPHHQ3,Galaxy Ring: What we know so far about Samsung’s new bling,_,"January 23, 2024 15:33 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/samsung-galaxy-ring-everything-to-know-9123550/,"At its Unpacked event on January 17, Samsung gave us a sneak peek of its newest wearable – the Samsung Galaxy Ring. While details were scant beyond a brief look at the ring itself, Samsung’s entry into this market could disrupt the dominance of wrist-worn bands and smartwatches.
The teaser left us with many questions about what exactly the Galaxy Ring will be capable of. But based on the category of device and the health-tracking features found in Samsung’s current wearables lineup, we can make some educated guesses. Here’s a rundown of what we know and what we hope to see when the Samsung Galaxy Ring is officially announced.
According to reports, the Galaxy Ring will come in four sizes to fit various fingers. That’s less sizing options than the eight offered for the Oura Ring. But it should still accommodate most users. There’s also a possibility that Samsung will send over a sizing kit first to ascertain the size of the finger before purchasing the right size. Oura Ring and the discontinued Amazon Loop did things this way to achieve a perfect fit and it’s possible Samsung could also do things in a similar manner.
While full details remain scarce, patent filings uncovered so far suggest the Galaxy Ring could offer robust health and activity tracking similar to the Oura Ring 3. Images of the device show three internal sensors identical to those inside Oura’s ring, likely capable of monitoring heart rate, temperature, and more.
Reports also indicate Samsung has patented smart home integration for the Ring, potentially allowing users to control devices like TVs. And an even more advanced patent details how the Ring could enable precise hand and finger motion tracking when paired with Samsung’s rumored XR glasses.
Of course, patented features don’t always make it to final production. But the wide range of capabilities Samsung is exploring shows the potential of the Galaxy Ring as more than just a health tracker. If Samsung manages to pack even a portion of these innovations into the wearable, it could establish the Ring as the most fully-featured smart ring on the market.
The Galaxy Ring could also go beyond the basics to monitor blood pressure, skin temperature, cycles, and even detect heart conditions like atrial fibrillation. Samsung would need FDA clearance for these more advanced health tracking abilities though.
The Galaxy Ring will likely connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth to sync data. We’d also love to see support for tap controls on the ring to do things like change music tracks or volume without touching your phone. But again, at this point this is only something we’d like to see and hasn’t been confirmed as a feature by Samsung.
In a recent interview, Samsung’s mobile digital health chief, Hon Pak, confirmed that the Galaxy Ring is scheduled to release before the end of 2024 and will come in a range of colours and sizes.
With a launch set for late 2024, Samsung may be en route to beat other major players to the smart ring space. The company has the chance to capture market share before the likes of Apple or Fitbit unveil any competing finger-worn tech.
Of course, a lot still depends on the final feature set and pricing. But if Samsung manages to imbue the Galaxy Ring with comprehensive tracking and seamless connectivity at a competitive cost, its design could help cement it as the go-to wearable for fitness-focused consumers. We expect more details to emerge in coming months as Samsung ramps up marketing so stay tuned."
YRBZAGB3TK_7VGPTANBGWK9EIO,Union Budget 2024: Expectations from agriculture sector,_,"Updated: January 24, 2024 13:12 IST",20240123,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/budget-2024-agriculture-sector-expectations-9123503/,"India’s growing population along with a constant rise in income levels is leading to a constant increase in demand for agricultural products and increasing burden on existing agricultural resources. The prevailing scenario indicates a need to improve productivity along with reducing costs and improving quality to make the most efficient use of the available resources. The growing adoption of cutting-edge agricultural techniques as well as incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information systems (GIS), drones, and remote sensing-based technologies in agriculture is a step in the right direction.
Although the agriculture sector has transformed significantly over the last few decades, challenges like fragmented landholdings, low productivity, limited mechanization, minimal value addition opportunities and insufficient credit availability prevent farmers from realizing higher prices. Another major problem is inefficient extension mechanisms, which makes it difficult for advanced agricultural practices to reach each and every farmer. Due to this farmers still use basic, traditional methods for cultivation.
India, one of the leading agricultural nations, still lags in productivity as compared to other developed countries. China’s agricultural productivity per hectare is 6.7 tons for rice and 5 tons for wheat, compared to India’s 2.4 tons for rice and 3 tons for wheat. This reduces overall farm output leading to lower price realization per acre. Therefore, there is a pressing need to focus on creating awareness about novel technologies among farmers to increase their adoption. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure that the necessary tools, implements and machines are made affordable for farmers and/or their credit needs are met.
Over 16% of fruits and vegetables, 10% of oilseeds, 9% of pulses, and 6% of cereals are wasted annually in India in the post-harvest stages, mainly due to improper storage conditions. Sufficient steel silos as well as warehouses should be made available while equipping them with modern sensors; this will reduce food grains losses significantly while making the system more robust. Emphasis should also be put on developing a network of micro-cold storages along with packhouses that will aid in reducing on-farm wastage of fruits and vegetables and give farmers a wider selling-window.
Given the large population and low literacy levels among farmers, it is difficult to make novel agricultural practices reach every farmer. The overburdening of extension has been resulting in lower productivity, with widening gap in information transfer. The focus should shift to modernizing the extension system with the intervention of technology. This will allow workers on the ground to reach out to more farmers with accurate information. The model followed by private seed and pesticide companies can be an inspiration.
Various efforts have been made to link farmers with buyers across geographies, particularly through e-NAM at the central level. Various states have also set-up their own e-mandis to make the operations smooth and transparent for farmers as well as traders. However, there is a need to revamp the mandi infrastructure. Attention should be given to setting up and efficiently maintaining facilities like grading centers, dryers, multi-commodity cooling centers, small godams, etc. along with the availability of reefer vehicles customized to the geography and crops traded. This will help farmers know the quality of their produce. It also increases the shelf life of their produce as well as provide them with much-needed bargaining power.
The agri-tech market is expected to rise by more than 600% in size in the next 5 years. Along with reducing the cost of cultivation and improving productivity and quality of output, agri-tech is expected to improve farmers’ share of consumer prices, and thereby, improve farmers’ income by up to 20%. The central government’s initiatives of IDEA and Agristack for streamlining of databases has already gained momentum in multiple states. It is needed that this data be made open source as envisaged. The start-ups are also being supported by the agriculture accelerator fund. However, the focus now has to be on streamlining the operations of these players on the ground. For achieving ease of operations, it is necessary that a single-licence be provided for operations within a state, especially for players involved in trading of agri-produce. Access to underutilized warehouses/infrastructure, provision of subsidies to set up solar powered infrastructure, and cold storages can go a long way in supporting startups in ramping up their operations quickly.
It is expected that the agriculture budget for 2024-25 addresses multiple pain-points of the sector simultaneously; thus, continuing the all-round development of the sector which is likely to show compounded impact in upcoming years.

A combative Nikki Haley brought her presidential campaign back to South Carolina on Wednesday after a disappointing defeat the night before in New Hampshire, and told a boisterous crowd in a cavernous ballroom in North Charleston that she would fight Donald Trump for the Republican nomination.
“The political elites in this state and around the country say we just need to let Donald Trump have this,” she told her supporters, who were jeering at the idea. “Listen. We’ve only had two states that have voted. We’ve got 48 more.”

Nowhere is more immediately important than South Carolina, where she served two terms as governor before being tapped to serve as Trump’s first ambassador to the United Nations. But just because it’s her home state does not mean it is friendly territory. As Haley looked to reinvigorate her campaign here on the ground, Republicans, as varied as local party officials and the chair of the Republican National Committee, stepped up the pressure on her to drop out. As she made her case for pressing on, the former president significantly consolidated his support.
While she spoke, the Trump campaign blasted out a fresh list of endorsements in South Carolina that now includes the state’s two senators, most of its House members, its governor and lieutenant governor, and much of its State House — more than 150 names in all.
“Welcome home to Trump Country, Nikki,” Austin McCubbin, Trump’s South Carolina director, taunted.

Some of Haley’s closest allies and confidants on Wednesday continued to insist that Haley had met her own expectations: She had winnowed the field and was now in the two-person contest she wanted, with time enough until the primary on Feb. 24 to spread her message to a broader electorate and draw contrasts between herself and Trump.
“For those of us in South Carolina, we have seen people doubt her, and we have seen her overcome those doubts,” said Kim A. Wilkerson, a retired president of Bank of America in South Carolina and chair of the board of trustees at Clemson University, Haley’s alma mater.
But those doubts appeared to be snowballing, and the drumbeat for her withdrawal only grew louder.
“Republican voters have sent a clear message — they want to see the GOP unite around our eventual nominee, which is going to be President Donald Trump,” the Republican Party chair of Georgia, Josh McKoon, and the state’s Republican delegates wrote in a joint statement Wednesday. “It is difficult to see how Ambassador Haley can secure the nomination.”
Even the chief strategist for Haley’s super PAC, SFA Fund, Mark Harris, acknowledged Wednesday she needed to expand her support state by state to remain viable, with South Carolina the next big target.
“We have to do better with Republicans; we have to do better with conservatives,” he said Wednesday. “We definitely have to grow in those key demographics to provide us a realistic path to the nomination.”
Harris said Haley and her super PAC would be in the race for the long haul. He pointed to the 17 Republican delegates she has amassed with the second-place finish in New Hampshire and third-place finish in Iowa. Until later in the process when the winner of most states will take all of that state’s delegates, Haley can continue to bolster her delegate count, giving her leverage to claim the nomination if circumstances, such as a criminal conviction on any of the 91 felony counts he faces, chase Trump from the race.
But Republicans in South Carolina and across the country worried that the strategy would only anger Trump and his supporters, effectively disqualifying her from consideration — this year or in the future.
Donors who don’t get in line could also find themselves at odds with Trump. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday night, Trump vowed: “Anybody that makes a ‘Contribution’ to Birdbrain” — Trump’s nickname for Haley — “from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp.”
Chad Connelly, a former South Carolina Republican Party chair who has stayed neutral in the race, was open about his concern: “Nikki is well liked here, and Trump is loved,” he said. “He’s going to roll her.”
History would tell Haley that the weeks before South Carolina Republicans vote can be rough. After Sen. John McCain of Arizona won the New Hampshire primary in 2000, he swept into South Carolina, predicting the state’s open primary would bring Democrats and independents streaming to his cause. Instead, a whisper campaign by supporters of George W Bush, the Texas governor then, spoke darkly and falsely of a Black daughter fathered by McCain out of wedlock. (He and his wife had adopted a daughter from an orphanage in Bangladesh.)
McCain’s defeat in South Carolina put Bush back on track to win the nomination.
Trump on Tuesday night hinted at a brutal campaign to come.
“Just a little note to Nikki,” he said at his victory speech, as he mocked Haley’s dress. “She’s not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already.”
Hollis Felkel, a veteran Republican political consultant in South Carolina who worked for the Bush campaign in 2000 and goes by Chip, said Trump supporters were already working to get as many state legislators and senators in the former president’s column — and letting lawmakers know there is a list of those who aren’t. The dirty tricks of the 2000 campaign were not exactly “the stuff of legends,” he said, but they were “pretty bad.”
“Now we’re dealing with a whole other level of vitriol, and politics have gotten exponentially more ugly” since 2000, he said. “She’s going to get hit from all sides with every innuendo and with every grudge that remains from when she was governor.”
Over the past few days, online influencers with close ties to the Trump campaign have begun posting misogynistic, highly sexualised videos and images of Haley on social media. One of the videos, produced by a group called the Dilley Meme Team, uses “deepfake” technology to put the sexual innuendo in her own voice. A second, released as New Hampshire voters were still at the polls Tuesday, brings up allegations of marital affairs that she has consistently denied but have dogged her since she was governor.
“The people of South Carolina are so much better than the politics of South Carolina,” Olivia Perez-Cubas, a Haley campaign spokesperson, said. “Nikki Haley has proven she fights and wins for the people, no matter what sort of garbage gets thrown at her from the political class.”
And Haley stepped up her own attacks on Trump’s mental faculties, his age and his courage.
“Get on a debate stage and let’s go,” she said at her rally. ”Bring it, Donald, show me what you’ve got.”
On Wednesday morning, she delivered her standard stump speech via Zoom to the Republican Party of the US Virgin Islands, where caucuses are scheduled for Feb. 8.
The Haley campaign posted two advertisements in South Carolina media markets, the first hitting Trump and President Joe Biden as “a rematch no one wants,” the second extolling her record as governor.
Meantime, the work of raising money to keep the campaign going against a tide of endorsements for Trump continued apace. A major fundraiser in New York City is planned for Jan. 30, whose co-hosts include billionaire financier Kenneth G. Langone and investors Henry Kravis and Stanley Druckenmiller. Another is on tap for Houston shortly thereafter.
Privately, however, her backers are dividing into two camps, according to donors, fundraisers and donor advisers who primarily spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. First there are those who are dutifully fulfilling obligations to fundraising efforts, despite believing that Trump’s nomination is all but assured and that she will likely back out within weeks.
And there are those — primarily donors whose resistance to Trump is absolute — who are still all in, believing that Haley needs the financial resources to wrest the nomination from Trump, or at least to keep her campaign alive in the event that something befalls him.
“Just keep her in this race,” said Fred Zeidman, a Texas businessman and one of Haley’s strongest backers. “She is the last one standing.”
As for her super PAC, Harris said he consulted with its biggest backers after the New Hampshire loss. “They’re jazzed up, and we fully believe we’ll have the resources we need,” he said.
Timothy C. Draper, a venture capital investor and early Haley backer who has been a major contributor to the PAC, said in an email Wednesday that “Democratic women who will likely vote for Nikki need to register Republican now to bring her enough delegates to win the primary.”
Draper’s perspective gets at a dynamic many donors pointed out Wednesday — Haley is running in the Republican primary, but in some ways is acting as a third-party candidate, drawing support from both sides. This bodes poorly for Haley, but it also suggests weaknesses for both Trump and Biden.
“There are all kinds of warning signs for Trump,” said Eric Levine, a New York lawyer who is co-hosting the Jan. 30 fundraiser. “He polled very poorly, very poorly, with independents and moderate Republicans. These are the very voters he is going to need to win the swing states.”
But after New Hampshire, Haley’s underdog campaign may be on life support. Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, urged the party “to unite around our eventual nominee, which is Donald Trump.” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, endorsed him, as did Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Deb Fischer of Nebraska.
Pete Hoekstra, the party chair of Michigan, where the Haley campaign has set its sights after South Carolina, also backed Trump and said in a statement, “we can start to focus our efforts on BEATING Joe Biden, rather than in-party fighting.”
A Democratic state representative in South Carolina, J A Moore, said he wanted Haley to stay in the race and sharpen her attacks on Trump, unless she would drop out and endorse Biden.
But, he warned, “She’s going to get creamed here.”"

CA Bhushan Arora, a Powai resident, was abducted on Wednesday and later the accused made a ransom call to his family asking for Rs 5 crore to be paid to them.
DCP (Zone X) Datta Nalawade said, “We have arrested four persons in connection with the kidnapping case. The four had invested huge amounts in Arora’s company Divine Power which they lost. It was in order to recover the money that they had invested that they abducted him and extort his family members.”
As per police, Arora’s wife Medha had said that Bhushan had left for office on January 17. When he did not return home by January 18, she approached the local Powai police where a missing person’s complaint was registered. As the police started probing the matter, the wife received a call from an unidentified person who demanded Rs 5 crore if she wanted Arora to be alive. The woman accordingly informed the police which began an investigation in the matter.
His wife informed the police that Arora had invested a large amount of money belonging to his relatives and friends in the stock market. However, he suffered losses in the stock market and soon investors started demanding the money back. When he expressed his inability to return the money, they had started threatening them, his wife told the police. The police then registered an FIR and began the probe.
During the course of investigation, the police found the accused had taken Arora to Navi Mumbai and the team started searching farm houses in the Panvel taluka. Later on Sunday, based on information, a team laid a trap in Kamothe area of Navi Mumbai and found two of the accused in a four-wheeler who were detained. The police found Arora in the same vehicle who was then rescued and reunited with his family.
Investigations revealed that Arora had invested large sums belonging to the accused in his company Divine Power which was lost. It was in order to recover the lost money that the accused committed a serious crime. Based on the interrogation of the duo, the police arrested two others who were involved in the crime. The accused have been identified as Amol Mhatre (49), Niranjan Singh (32), Vidhichandra Yadav (31) and Mohmand Suleman alias Salman Shaikh (20)."

Z00MF895YE_Z1LOTSL1SDCIL0Q,Communalism an obstacle to development of country: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah in Republic Day message,_,"January 26, 2024 14:49 IST",20240126,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/republic-day-2024-karnataka-cm-siddaramaiah-speech-9128967/,"Communalism has emerged as an obstacle to the development of India, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said in a recorded Republic Day message on Friday.
“We have to regretfully accept that we have not been able to make progress to achieve the development of an India that we dreamed about. There are new challenges in the path of development and the chief among them is the recent rise of communalism which poses a threat to our secular society, and this is a concern,” Siddaramaiah said in his message.
“The results of the Karnataka elections last year are a sign of hope for protection of the secular traditions of the country. Our government is ready to combat communalism. People should not fall prey to the politics of division of people on the basis of religion.
“The failures of elected governments and representatives are being hidden by creating caste and religion-based divisions in society. This is undemocratic and goes against the values of the Constitution,” he added.
Congress Chief Mallikarjun Kharge who was in Bengaluru on the occasion of Republic Day and participated in a flag-raising event at the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) office said 2024 would be a crucial year for saving the values enshrined in the Constitution.
“The year 2024 is a very important year for India. This year will decide whether we will be able to save the values of the Constitution and democracy or go back to the age where not all people are equal,” Kharge said in his message to party workers.
The Congress president said the Union government was using emotional issues to divert attention and hide the truth from citizens.
“The Constitution ensured fundamental rights, social justice, and political rights to every citizen. Today, these pillars are under attack from the government itself.
“The founding fathers of the Constitution – Pandit Nehru, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel, Babu Rajendra Prasad, Maulana Azad, and others – in the Constituent Assembly would have never imagined that the Constitution would face such challenges, Kharge said.
“Today, the fundamental and basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution to every Indian, are slowly being encroached upon and being eroded. The Constitution ensured fundamental rights, social justice, and political rights to every citizen. Today, these pillars are under attack from the government itself,” he added.
Karnataka Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot who spoke on behalf of the Congress government in the state – after the Republic Day parade at the Manekshaw Parade ground – said the value of “unity in diversity” must be protected in India.
“India is a nation where humanity has lived since ages. It is a country which is blessed with different religions, societies, cultures, and languages, all interplaying with each other in harmony. We have to establish peace and harmony amongst all by giving the message of ‘unity in diversity’ to the whole world and we should strive for consolidation and solidarity of our national unity,” the Karnataka Governor said."

Afterwards, the Arambai Tenggol claimed that the Meitei leaders had promised to convey the concerns of the community to the Centre.
Demands by the radical group, which has thousands of members and claims to represent and protect Meitei interests, include the delisting of Kukis from the Scheduled Tribe list, deportation of refugees to camps in Mizoram, border fencing, replacement of Assam Rifles with other paramilitary forces and revoking the Suspension of Operations agreement between Centre and Kuki militant groups.
While Chief Minister N Biren Singh was not at Kanmigla Fort, his name did figure in a list of signatories to demands that Meitei leaders had promised to convey to the Centre. Those in attendance included Minister of State for External Affairs and Inner Manipur Lok Sabha MP Rajkumar Ranjan Singh and Manipur Rajya Sabha MP Leishemba Sanajaoba.
The 37 MLAs who signed the list of demands included 25 from the BJP – including the CM, his Deputy Th Biswajit Singh, and Speaker Th Satyabrata Singh – four from the NPP, two from the JDU and one Independent. It also included all five MLAs from the opposition Congress, including former Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh.
Those who attended the meeting also said the elected representatives took an “oath” inside Kangla Fort – a historic site which served as the royal seat of the Manipur kingdom till 1891. The media was not allowed inside.
The Indian Express reached out to several MLAs who were at Kangla, but they either did not respond to calls or declined to elaborate on what had transpired.
Speaking to The Indian Express, one of the state’s 10 Kuki MLAs expressed surprise at how the MLAs could heed the call of a radical outfit.
In a statement, the ITLF, a Kuki-Zomi body based in Churachandpur, said, “For the first time in history, a militia that led attacks on innocent civilians because of their ethnicity and which openly displays sophisticated weapons stolen from police armouries was able to order state lawmakers, including the chief minister, to attend a meeting it had called and made the MLAs endorse their demands.”
It added, “Manipur state police and central security forces remained mute spectators as Arambai Tenggol leader Korounganba Khuman arrived at the venue in Imphal in a police vehicle, and the militant group proceeded to administer an oath-taking ceremony to the MLAs. All these happened even as a special team sent by the central government is camping nearby in the city. Why did the world’s largest democracy allow this… Today’s events have shown that Manipur’s government has submitted its authority to an armed militant group. ”
On Monday, a special Ministry of Home Affairs team, which landed in the state with the aim of peace talks with both the communities and to assess the current situation, had met Arambai Tenggol leaders.
After the meeting at Kangla Fort, Arambai Tenggol chief Korounganba Khuman addressed the public. PTI quoted him as saying: “The legislators, including Chief Minister N Biren Singh, today assured to convey it (the outfit’s demands) to the Centre. Our points included removal of Suspension of Operations, implementation of NRC, replacement of Assam Rifles and removal of Kuki illegal immigrants from Scheduled Tribe list to bring peace.”
He claimed that the elected representatives have promised to act within 15 days. “What we wanted to show today is that ministers and MLAs are under the public,” he said.
Quoting the legislators, he said, “If the Centre does not listen to our concerns, we (legislators) will take the movement to protect Manipur along with the people.”
The meeting at Kangla took place under heavy security. In a statement on Tuesday, the Superintendent of Police, Imphal West, had said that the outfit “has summoned all the ministers and MLA belonging to the valley districts at Kangla at 10 am”.
On Wednesday, thousands of volunteers from the group gathered in Imphal, while Meitei legislators began trickling into Kangla by around 9.30 am. The meeting ended around 11 am."

“The work of installing the statue of Lord Ram at the main junction on Handewadi road in Mohammadwadi-Kausarbaug area is in full swing…60 per cent of the work is complete. Only the finishing touches are being given to the statue. We are planning to get the statue inaugurated on April 17 on the occassion of Ram Navami,” said Bhangire, who was a former corporator of the Pune Municipal Corporation.
“The Chief Minister and both the deputy chief ministers will be invited for the function,” said Bhagire, who is also considered to be a close confidant of Eknath Shinde.
The statue is nine feet tall and weighs 650 kg. It will be kept in a bulletproof glass cover. The total cost of constructing the statue is around Rs 1 crore.
Bhangire informed the work on the statue was started after getting permission of all the concerned departments. “The project will be completed by social organisation Dashrath Baloba Bhangire Sevabhavi Mandal,” said the city Shiv Sena chief.
The resolution of installing the statue of Lord Ram was first passed by the Pune Municipal Corporation in 2019. However, since no work started, the civic administration tabled the resolution again in October last year for approval.
“The resolution was approved in November. Thereafter, the work was started by the social organisation,” said Sagar Kumavat, junior engineer of PMC.
“I don’t know if the work will be completed by April without discussing with the organisation undertaking the project. The PMC has only given land for the project, which is entirely being done by the outfit,” said Kumavat."

Here’s why",_,"Updated: January 22, 2024 10:34 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aser-2023-report-smartphone-usage-in-classroom-interner-usage-in-classroom-multimedia-classroom-skill-development-9120801/,"The educationist and media theorist Neil Postman argued that the path to learning is a difficult one — it requires attention to “sequence”,“perspiration”, “perseverance” and “perplexity”. Madhav Chavan’s article, ‘Classroom at a click’ (IE, Jan 18) is in complete opposition to the idea of learning as an arduous journey. Chavan celebrates the spread of technology and argues that it would make it possible to teach, learn and test “anytime-anywhere”. He says the recently released ASER 2023 Report indicates an increase in smartphone ownership and the ability to use them among youth in the age group of 14-18 years. However, the faith in digital technology as an enabler in accessing knowledge and widening opportunities needs to be scrutinised.
While Chavan acknowledges that increased school enrolment does not imply enhanced learning, he fails to see a similar distinction between smartphone access and learning. An increase in access to digital devices cannot ensure automatic knowledge construction or skill development.
My criticism of the uninhibited use of internet technology in education is threefold. First, a challenge to this is presented when the medium itself is placed under a scanner of critique. Sociologist Basil Bernstein called digital technology “quasi-pedagogical” wherein education becomes a process of transmission, and the provider of the transmission is often unaware of the consequences of such a transmission. Education, on the other hand, does not entail the transmission of information or transaction of ideas. It is an intended and planned activity involving the mutual construction of knowledge through dialogue and discovery. Even though internet technology brings a wide array of information at the learner’s disposal, it turns the process of learning into an act of telling and consuming. The information presented in “educational” videos is monological and unidirectional. The possibility of discussion, argument, and contestation of ideas in a classroom is undermined if the digital platform is accepted as an instrument to enhance the quality of education.
Second, the idea that learning can happen “anytime-anywhere” ignores the country’s socio-economic reality. It does not consider a student’s environment that could be fraught with violence, discrimination, or poverty. It undermines the significance of the classroom as a space where students can divorce themselves from their immediate realities and engage in the process of learning with their teachers and peers. In a society ridden with caste and religious distinctions, the physical classroom space provides a chance to overcome socioeconomic barriers and learn collaboratively. The uninhibited internet consumption can expose learners to ideas that could strengthen the identities they were ascribed at birth, rather than challenging them.
Finally, Chavan argues that technology can offer education that is different from schools and colleges — it would give importance to issues such as natural resource management, environment, and climate. His argument assumes that the training required for agriculture, forestry and fisheries can take place effectively online and easy connections can be made with environmental awareness. Such an argument overlooks the disconnect that internet technology creates. There are two ways to learn through digital means: By watching videos, and by attending a live class with a teacher. In the former, the video will most likely be generic and produced without knowing who the viewer is and what their specific context is. In the latter, the teacher could be anywhere in the country and the learners could also be from diverse backgrounds. In both cases, the learner will only receive information that might not be suited to their occupational specificity or geographical context. Moreover, formal training in traditional occupations such as agriculture needs to be interdisciplinary and include economic, demographic, geographical and scientific concepts — this seems beyond the scope of education “delivered” via a smartphone.
In a recent book, Mark West, who works in UNESCO’s education sector said education technology exacerbates inequalities, impoverishes the quality of education, slows down the process of socialisation and cultivates a behaviour of consumerism among students, parents and teachers. Instead of viewing education through digital means as an all-encompassing provider, adopting a sceptical stance would clear out the digital gloss and classrooms would emerge as reliable spaces for learning, albeit in need of reform.

Israel launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, which it now says is the principal headquarters of the Hamas militants responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.
Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that 21 soldiers were killed when a rocket-propelled grenade hit a tank that was guarding Israeli forces. At the same time, an explosion occurred in two, two-storey buildings where forces had planted explosives in order to destroy the buildings. The explosion triggered their collapse onto the Israeli soldiers.
“We are still studying and investigating the details of the event and the reasons for the explosion,” Hagari told an early morning press briefing.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog released a statement, on what he said was an “unbearably difficult morning”
“On behalf of the entire nation, I console the families and pray for the healing of the wounded. Even on this sad and difficult morning, we are strong and remember that together we will win,” he said.
Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that rules Gaza and is sworn to Israel’s destruction. At least 25,295 Gazans have been killed since Oct. 7, Gaza health authorities said in an update on Monday."

The young actor was speaking at the India Today Conclave and said, “From the number of people on set to the number of lights on set and the hair and the make up and the chaos, I feel like in the middle of it, I just felt extremely significant.” The 23-year-old actor said that everyone on the set was doing everything to “facilitate Zoya’s vision and knowing that on my first day and realising that, I felt extremely nervous and at the same time, incredibly responsible.”
While Suhana made her acting debut with The Archies, directed by Zoya Akhtar, Ananya was recently seen in Kho Gaye Hum Kahaan alongside Siddhanth Chaturvedi and Adarsh Gourav. Next up for Ananya is going to Vikramaditya Motwane’s cyber thriller, her OTT project Call Me Bae. She also has Akshay Kumar’s next, Shankara, in her kitty.

He was only playing in his school…”
Rahul Sharma, who works at a courier company, is inconsolable as he remembers his 12-year-old son Kintan Saraswat, three days after his death on January 20.
Saraswat, a Class 6 student at a Delhi government school in North Delhi, died a week after he was allegedly thrashed and assaulted by senior boys in his school after he accidentally hit them while playing with his friends during recess.
“He loved running and playing slide games with his friends. He accidentally hit a senior while sliding his way back to the classroom. The senior kid called others and they beat him up. My son was brutally assaulted and thrown to the ground,” said Sharma.
“Kintan told us the boys got very angry…When he reached home, he was crying and limping. When his condition deteriorated, we rushed him to Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital,” Sharma added.
Sharma also holds “negligence” by doctors and staff at the hospital responsible for Kintan’s death. “The staff told us the doctors (orthopaedic specialists) were on leave and asked us to come back after 2-3 days…We then took him to a doctor in Rohini who asked us to get a few other medicines. When Kintan took those, his condition further deteriorated. On January 19-20, we had to rush him to Deep Chand Bandhu again because he had fainted. He died later in the night…It all happened because of the negligence of doctors,” said the father.
Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Vatsala Aggarwal said, “The patient had first come on January 11 and upon seeing his condition, which was not severe at the time, he was attended to at the OPD. His X-ray was taken and a painkiller was given to him. He was asked to come back a few days later but he did not do so and came directly on January 20. He reached the hospital at a very critical stage with a high fever, vomiting and a high BP. Physicians, paediatricians and orthopaedic doctors saw him but the child could not be revived.”
Kintan’s family members said they also visited the school and requested the principal and the class teacher to investigate the matter.
‘Principal could have called police…’: Father
“I have been there at least thrice in the last 10 days. Isn’t it their responsibility to book the accused for hurting my son? My son never got into any fights. He told us those boys were seniors and were stronger. The principal could have called the police or at least suspended the boys…It’s been three days since he died. We are suffering…,” said Sharma.
The school authorities could not be contacted for comment.
Sharma remembers Kintan – his older child – as someone who loved making video reels and would often use his mother’s Instagram account to post his photos and videos. “He was inspired by Bollywood movie Shershaah and wanted to join the Indian Army,” said Sharma.
DCP (North) Manoj Kumar Meena confirmed the incident and said the police are awaiting a postmortem report before initiating legal action.
Meanwhile, the Delhi government said the incident took place outside the school campus. “(Our) heart goes out to the bereaving family, who lost their child in such a tragic incident. A prompt inquiry has been ordered already in the matter…,” it said in a statement."

The movie was also selected as the Indian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 67th Academy Awards. Director Shekhar Kapur says people asked him what was wrong with him for making a film that made viewers so uncomfortable and angry after making “sweet films” like Mr India and Masoom.
In this interview, the ace filmmaker opens up about how challenging it was for him to shoot Bandit Queen, especially the gang-rape scene, and reveals how he felt that being a Punjabi man, who shouldered the “weight of patriarchy” all his life, he had to confront the fundamental issues that were so close to home and yet hidden away somewhere on the third page of newspapers.
Shekhar Kapur, 78, shot Bandit Queen 30 years ago. He says it was one of the most challenging films in his career because he internalised it too much, which came naturally to him because he was “angry” at himself for believing he was a “sensitive man” but never confronted fundamental issues in the society through his films.
Bandit Queen is considered one of the most gutsy films in Shekhar Kapur’s filmography. Talking about the making of the movie, the filmmaker says, “What struck me was when I was living in Delhi, it was not more than 150 kms where all this was happening. So I had heard about her. Almost every day, things were written about her on the second or the third page (in newspapers). And yet I felt so distant from the issues. When I decided to do the film and went there to investigate what is happening exactly in that area, I was a bit shocked at myself and embarrassed with myself. I was also very angry because I was wondering how come something like this happen and we’d just put it away in the third page. The more I investigated it, the more I realised something about myself. I am a Punjabi man. All my life I have carried the burden of masculinity on my shoulders, the mardaangi. Films used to be about how a girl has to be shy and the man has to be a pursuer and I kind of had fallen into that trap. And the more I investigated Phoolan Devi’s story, the more I realised that the attitude I had grown up with is the attitude that led to rape. I realised that the whole politics of rape was not ‘Oh god, this man is so bad!’, but the attitude toward rape is formed when you are very young. In all the Hindi films you see, ‘Ladki kitni pyaari hai, kitni sundar hai, shy hai (the girl is so lovely, beautiful and shy).’ And now I was looking at a girl who wasn’t shy and I realised basically there was a lot of anger in me against myself.
“I was like how can I consider myself to be a sensitive man when I am not confronting this fundamental issue. So Bandit Queen was my anger at myself. It is a very angry film, it was against myself. What made me so insensitive for not looking at it before? So when I saw the results of my film, in the theatres or wherever I went, people would come out angry. People would ask me, ‘What happened to you, sir? You are such a beautiful filmmaker who made Mr India and Masoom. You’ve made such beautiful films! Yeh kya kar diya? (What have you done?)'”

Shekhar Kapur said dealing with his anger was not the only challenge. The bigger challenge was in shooting the gang rape scene for Bandit Queen. The film is based on the story of Phoolan Devi, a female dacoit who went through rounds of physical and sexual abuse, and then was prosecuted by the police for years before she turned into a politician.
“I had to understand the mindset of the girl who was raped and also completely understand the mindset of the rapist. I remember talking to the whole cast and telling them that we are not telling a particular story and every character in the film is a representation of society. We are looking at the society itself,” he says.
Shekhar reveals that almost all his cast members were freshly out of National School of Drama (NSD), and Seema Biswas was their senior. He shares that to make them comfortable with each other, he would make them scream expletives at each other.
“When I was prepping for the film, I took all my actors out. What you’ll notice in the film is that everybody has a hoarse voice. It is because people in rural India have hoarse voices. How we talk is in a very urban way, it is very intimate. But if you go to a rural area, when a child screams, the voice carries much further. I used to take my actors and put them in different corners of that area and make them shout at each other to make their voice hoarse. Every morning they used to scream at each other and make their voice hoarse. Not just that, most of my actors were from NSD, and Seema Biswas was their senior. I wanted them to get used to the fact that she was not their senior and that each one of them was a character. So every morning they would scream expletives at each other so they could get used to the language and the way they had to speak. They would otherwise never say that in front of Seema. And in return, she would scream all the expletives at them loudly. The people of the village thought this bunch of people from the city have gone mad. I had to recreate the emotional idea when I was in the shoot.”

Shekhar Kapur further opened up about how difficult it was for him to shoot the gang-rape scene in the film. “There was one particular scene where everybody had to help me. You know the gang-rape scene… I had imagined the whole gang-rape scene from Phoolan Devi’s point of view. Sometimes when I say this to people that you know that I tried to understand what it feels like to be raped, they say, ‘How do you know? You are a man. You are just saying these words…but what do you go through?’ I just can’t go and shoot that scene and not understand what it feels like. I remember locking myself in a room for two-three days trying to understand how to shoot that scene. I had imagined the whole rape scene, and we filmed the scene with my DOP Ashok Mehta. I would keep going out and throwing up because all I was shooting was close-ups. All I was shooting was the door opening and closing with people going in and out. In my head, I had imagined a two-night gang-rape on a woman and how it would feel. I remember I would go out, puke and come back and tell Ashok that I can’t shoot today and he’d still make me shoot it because I can’t make the actors go through the same thing. It was a small set. I would go out, puke, come back and shoot.”
When asked how different would Bandit Queen be if it was made in 2024, Shekhar promptly replies that he would make the film shorter.
“It is always difficult for a filmmaker to answer that question. With who I am now, of course, I’d make the film differently. I have grown up 30 years. The only way I’d know is by making another film because if you know what you are going to do, then why would you make a film? Every film that you do is an exploration. Bandit Queen, when I made it at that time, was an amazing exploration. What would I change now than I did on the original film — I’d make it shorter. I thought that the film was a bit long. I’d make the scene much shorter,” he concludes.

The accused builder at present is facing five criminal cases.
The searches covered Tekchandani’s residence, his office and two other premises in the city, the police said. The Mumbai police had last week registered an FIR against Tekchandani, his wife, the directors of his company Supreme Constructions and a few others at the Chembur police station. It was a fraud case in which the complainant had invested Rs 36 lakh in Tekchandani’s construction project at Taloja in Navi Mumbai. The project however got stuck a year before it’s deadline in 2017. The home buyers started asking Tekchandani the reasons behind it, but they only got vague promises, the police said.
Hundreds of flat buyers invested in Tekchandani’s project, but they neither got the flats nor their money back, the police complaint said.
A case of cheating and criminal breach of trust was then registered against him. The probe was transferred to the EOW which is now investigating the case carried out searches at his premises to find evidence. One of the FIRs against the accused builder involves an alleged fraud of 160 home buyers who were duped by him to the tune of Rs 44 crore."
ZI4HHL80IW_C3TCWV57SJEX321,200 arrested in long-pending criminal cases in Karnataka in last 6 months: Police,_,"Updated: January 23, 2024 09:11 IST",20240122,indianexpress.com,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/long-pending-criminal-cases-karnataka-police-9121876/,"In the last six months, the Karnataka Police arrested 200 people as part of efforts to reduce the number of long-pending cases before criminal courts in the state. The arrested individuals had open warrants issued for their arrest several years ago.
“As many as 200 absconding people in Karnataka have been arrested in the last six months in connection with long-pending cases. There have been 52 such arrests in Bengaluru, 36 in Dharwad and similarly in all districts as part of a concerted effort to reduce the number of cases pending trial on account of the failure to produce the accused in court,” a senior state police official said.
Last month, the arrest of a BJP worker in a long-pending case in Dharwad – linked to the violence following the demolition of the Babri Masjid – had resulted in protests by the BJP.
The BJP worker Srikant Pujari, 60, was among 36 people arrested in 2023 in long-pending cases of various types, including rioting, thefts, gambling and accidents, in the Hubbali-Dharwad region. Pujari was among 13 people named in a rioting case in December 1992 and had not been brought to trial, leading to his arrest on December 28, 2023. The BJP, however, accused the Congress government in Karnataka of targeting its worker.
“The arrests in Hubbali were part of efforts to clear long-pending cases. One of the missing accused who was arrested in the rioting case from 1992 obtained bail soon in December but the bail for the second accused was delayed and the issue took on a political colour,” a senior official said.
Similarly, on January 8, 2024, the police in the Tumakuru region of Karnataka arrested five people in a 19-year-old case pertaining to a Naxal attack on a police outpost in the Venkatamanhalli village on February 10, 2005 which resulted in the death of eight people.
The five arrested were among 42 who were missing and were not brought to trial even after local courts acquitted 29 accused in the case in the initial set of trials.
The Bengaluru police reported this month that in 2023 it had arrested people who were not brought to trial despite warrants being issued by the courts in 99 long-pending cases. “The efforts to clear long-pending cases from police and court files have been stepped up in recent years. This has helped reduce the pendency of cases. This is important in criminal cases because the accused are absconding and there is an open warrant from the court for their arrest which is several years old,” the senior Karnataka Police official said.
At present, Karnataka has a total of 10.14 lakh pending criminal cases with 10 long-pending ones that are more than 30 years old, 887 cases that date back between 20 and 30 years (0.9%), 26,703 cases that are 10 to 20 years old (2.63%) and 1.64 lakh cases that are five to 10 years old (16.22%), as per data from the National Judicial Data Grid. Nearly 72 per cent of the cases that are pending for more than five years are due to the non-securing of the accused by the police.
Criminal courts in Karnataka, which disposed of around 8 lakh cases in 2015, have since 2021 closed nearly 14 lakh cases per year."

The festival takes place in Konomiya Shrine in Inazawa town of Aichi prefecture and dates back to 1,250 years ago, reported The South China Morning Post. Around 10,000 people are expected to take part in the festival on February 22.
An official of the organising committee said that women were not explicitly banned from the festival this year and 40 women have expressed interest in taking part in the coming ritual offering of bamboo at the shrine.
“We have not been able to hold the festival like we used to for the past three years because of the pandemic and, in the time, we received a lot of requests from women in the town to take part,” the official said, as per the SCMP report.
The Hadaka Matsuri festival, which is traditionally open to only men, reportedly involves a local man who is designated as the shin-otoko, or “god man” in Japanese. Every year, hundreds of believers clad solely in loincloths parade through the town to the shrine, bathing each other in icy water, drinking sake (a local rice wine) and hefting portable shrines on long bamboo poles decorated with ribbons attempt. On reaching the shrine, they call out for the ‘god man’, who had been kept in solitude in the days leading up to the festival, and try to touch the completely naked man. It is believed that whoever touches the shin-otoko transfers their bad luck to him.
The report said that while women would be a part of the rituals in the run-up to the finale, they would not participate in the crowding ritual at the end.
Ayaka Suzuki, who is a part of the team taking part in the event this year, told a local paper that the event is the most important one in her town’s calendar and she had long wanted to be a part of it.
“I could have participated if I were a boy,” she reportedly told the Yomiuri newspaper, adding that she intends to “pray for the safety of my family and the people affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.”
Besides gender equality, experts have suggested that the mass migration from rural areas to cities for work has risked the demise of ancient traditions.
Sumie Kawakami, a university instructor who focuses on gender-related issues in Japan, told SCMP that she was “surprised and delighted” at the shrine’s decision. “I am very glad to hear this and it is a good sign that Japan is moving forward, although it is of course long overdue,” she told SCMP.
“There are other areas of life in Japan where women are not permitted to participate, such as the ban on women stepping into the ‘dohyo’ sumo ring, and I think that the Shinto religion is quite restrictive for women,” Kawakami observed, addingm “Buddhism, on the other hand, is more tolerant and there are female Buddhist priests as well as male priests,”.
“That sort of gender-friendly approach should be the way forward,” she said."

The development came after Arambai Tenggol issued “summons” to “all the ministers and MLA belonging to the valley districts at Kangla at 10 am”, according to a statement by the Superintendent of Police, Imphal West.
Thousands of volunteers from the group had gathered in Imphal on Wednesday, ahead of the meeting, and the elected representatives began arriving at Kangla by around 9:30 am. The meeting ended at around 11 am.
Here is a look at Arambai Tenggol and why the meeting was conducted.
According to sources, Arambai Tenggol started in 2020 as a cultural outfit, but soon transformed into a radical organisation. It is one of the two hardline Meitei organisations suspected to be involved in a large number of Meitei-Kuki clashes, which broke out in May 2023. The other group is Meitei Leepun.
Both the organisation had armed themselves and their membership grew rapidly during the conflict, sources had told The Indian Express. They have been accused by the Kuki groups and the security establishment of playing a leading role in the violence.
Arambai Tenggol has also been accused of targeting Naga community members. For instance, a 57-year-old Naga woman was allegedly shot dead by the group in June last year in Imphal East district.
The organisation was also suspected to be involved in a gunfight with a unit of Assam Rifles just before Home Minister Amit Shah visited Manipur in June 2023.
The Indian Express on Wednesday reported that the meeting was organised to discuss the demands of Arambai Tenggol. The demands included delisting of Kukis from the Scheduled Tribes list, deportation of refugees to camps in Mizoram, border fencing, replacement of Assam Rifles with other paramilitary force and revoking Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement between the Centre and Kuki militant groups.
It was reported that the meeting was concluded after the representatives at the spot took an oath. Subsequently, Arambai Tenggol leader Korounganba Khuman addressed a large gathering at Khwairamband Ima Market, where he claimed that the representatives, including Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh who was not present, were made to sign a set of demands and told to pressure the Central government to translate them into action.
While Arambai Tenggol maintained a shadowy presence at the beginning of the conflict, the developments on Wednesday showcased the strength and legitimacy for the group."

According to MLA Dilip Pandey, shobha yatras will be organised in seven assembly constituencies in the city, and each will see events such as Sundarkand recitations, aartis and prasaad distribution from community kitchens or bhandaras.
This comes after the Delhi government started a three-day Ramlila at Pearey Lal Bhawan on Saturday. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal attended the Ramlila on Sunday. “Tomorrow (Monday), the praan prathistha ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya is being held. Many people will not be able to attend it despite wanting to. I am happy that the Delhi government has organised this event,” he said, adding that everyone should seek inspiration from Lord Ram. “Lord Ram’s administration is considered ‘Ram Rajya’. We are inspired by ‘Ram Rajya’ and try to run the government taking inspiration from it,” he added.
Kejriwal has earlier said that he did not get a formal invitation to attend the ceremony but had got a letter which said that since many VVIPs will be attending, he would have to come alone. “I want to go with my wife, children and parents. I have not got the formal invitation yet but it does not matter. I will go with my family later,” he had told reporters last week.
AAP leaders have said in the past that only one party cannot become the flag-bearer of religion and the Hindu faith. It had also welcomed the 2019 Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute.
“The entire country is enthusiastically lining up to welcome Lord Shri Ram and Delhi is not lagging behind. On January 22, all AAP ministers, MLAs, councillors, leaders, and workers will participate in ‘bhandaras’, prasaad distribution, and shobha yatra programs… Under the ‘Mukyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana’ plan, additional trains will be operated from Delhi to Ayodhya for the pilgrims travelling for Ram Lalla darshan in Ayodhya. Bhagwan Shri Ram does not belong to any specific political party. He is the epitome of the highest standards of humanity for the entire country… CM Arvind Kejriwal will surely go to see him, and all party leaders will line up to visit with their families,” Pandey said.
Meanwhile, the Delhi Police put up a multi-level security cover and extensive CCTV surveillance across prominent temples and markets in the national capital on Sunday.
