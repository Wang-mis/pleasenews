6G6YFZQ8D6_04AOM5IUYWYIARN,US and UK strikes target Houthi rebels in Yemen,_,12 January,20240112,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67954161,"US and UK naval forces in the Red Sea have launched air strikes against Houthi rebel targets across Yemen.
US officials say warship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles and fighter jets hit 16 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold.
The strikes are in response to repeated attacks by the Iran-backed group on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The Houthis, who back Hamas, said at least five of their number were killed.
The group claims to be targeting ships linked to Israel - saying the attacks are in response to Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip - and have also launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel.
The Houthi targets in Yemen early on Friday included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots, US officials told the Associated Press news agency.
US President Joe Biden, quoted by Reuters news agency, said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes against Houthi targets with support from countries including Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" Mr Biden said.
He added that he ""will not hesitate"" to order further military action if necessary.
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in response that there was ""absolutely no justification"" for the attacks and that the group would continue to target Israeli ships.
Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - both Houthi allies - have also condemned the strikes.
These are the first such actions by the US military in the Red Sea since the Houthi drone and missile attacks on shipping began in November.
The Houthis, who control a large part of Yemen, have been targeting merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones - putting lives at risk, threatening the global economy and destabilising the region.
Four RAF Typhoon jets flying from Akrotiri in Cyprus also conducted air strikes on two Houthi targets in Yemen using Paveway bombs, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the strikes in a statement on Friday morning, calling them ""limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"".
Mr Sunak denounced the ""reckless actions"" of the Houthi militia, who he said had carried out a series of ""dangerous and destabilising attacks"" against commercial shipping in the Red Sea despite repeated warnings from the international community.
He added that the UK would ""always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade"".
On 9 January, HMS Diamond, along with US warships, successfully repelled the largest attack from the Houthis in the Red Sea to date. On the same day, the Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel - the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.

A6LEPTA5MN_SFH9XNHOWNBJ9FH,Boeing seeks Ryanair support with checks after mid-air blowout,By Katy Austin,4 days ago,20240116,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67994140,"Boeing has asked Ryanair to send extra engineers to oversee quality checks of its planes ""on the ground"" following the Alaska Airlines incident.
Ryanair's boss told the BBC that quality was improving but the incident had shown there was ""more to be done"".
It comes after an unused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by US-based Alaska Airlines.
Ryanair does not use Boeing's 737 Max 9 aircraft but operates the Max 8 variant and has Max 10s on order.
The airline is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the 737 Max family, with more than 100 in service and due to have some 400 more by 2034.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he expects delivery delays to affect its capacity.
Asked in an interview with the BBC if he had complete confidence in Boeing's quality control processes after the incident which saw an unused door fall off, the Ryanair boss said ""no"".
But he added that his airline did now have ""more confidence"" in plane maker Boeing.
Mr O'Leary also said that a delivery of 12 planes towards the end of last year had been ""in terms of defects the best deliveries we've had in three years"".
He acknowledged what happened with the Alaska Airlines flight had been serious but said the industry always learned from incidents.
Ryanair will deploy more engineers to oversee quality control at US factories in Seattle and Wichita building aircraft and fuselages for the airline.
Mr O'Leary said that Boeing made good planes, but compared the relationship to a marriage: ""I can be in love with you and still occasionally criticise some of your personal habits. I think that's the same with Boeing.""
He suggested that the management team at Boeing ""needs to be improved"" following the incident, although he gave his support for Boeing's current chief executive David Calhoun, stating that he is ""doing a stellar job in very tough circumstances"".
Mr O'Leary added: ""We don't need more senior management changes in Boeing.""
On Monday, Boeing announced that an outside party would also be brought in to assess its production practices.
It will also check the work of the firm that supplies and installs the parts involved in the accident.
Last week, the US regulator extended the grounding of 737 Max's with similar fuselage panels, while United and Alaska Airlines have said they were extending the cancellations of any flights involving the 737 Max 9 through until Wednesday.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line, adding it believed there were ""significant problems"" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as ""other manufacturing problems"".
Announcing the latest measures, Stan Deal, who heads up Boeing's commercial division, said the company was ""not where we need to be"".
Scrutiny of Boeing has been renewed after the blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries.
The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people.
Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role in those crashes, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Poor oversight by the FAA was also cited.
On Tuesday, Boeing also announced that it had appointed Kirkland H. Donald, a former Navy admiral, as the independent advisor responsible for overseeing a review of its quality control systems for its commercial aircraft.
He and a range of experts will provide Boeing bosses, including Mr Calhoun, with a series of recommendations.

BP3F1HBNVD_FOKDFQYMAE9JW2O,Two British brothers 'should be banned from Switzerland' for museum heist,By Thomas Mackintosh,5 days ago,20240116,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67988451,"Prosecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.
At a court in Geneva on Monday, Stewart and Louis Ahearne confessed to being part of a gang which burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
On top of the ban, prosecutor Marco Rossier said the court should jail the brothers for four years.
They will be sentenced on Tuesday.
Mr Rossier told the court the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
He said Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car out in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup, has never been recovered.
Around 3.5m Swiss francs (Â£3.2m) worth of damage was caused to the Museum of Far Eastern Art which is based in a listed townhouse in Geneva's old town.
On Monday, Louis Ahearne said he carried out the burglary in order to ""clear a debt"" and Stewart Ahearne said he took ""full responsibility"" explaining he wanted to ""protect"" his younger brother.
Mr Rossier said the prosecution doubted the brothers' version of events as the third person was not in the court and is currently the subject of extradition proceedings to Japan.
The court also heard from Loris Bertoliatti, representing the Museum of Far Eastern Art, who said damage caused by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar cost the institution millions.
""They are a professional gang,"" he said. ""They were determined to sell the items. The victim is the museum. Lots of people were shocked by what happened.""
Stewart Ahearne's partner Nicola Barry was called as a witness on Monday and described the father-of-five as a ""kind, loving and nice person"" - adding his employer has committed to giving him a job when he is freed.
The brothers' mother, Suzanne Ahearne, said Louis Ahearne is a ""compassionate and empathetic"" person who had an ""unhappy childhood"".
She told the court since his extradition from the UK, he has been writing to his nine-year-old son from prison in Switzerland trying to ""give the guidance he never got"" from his father.
The Ahearnes' defence barristers will also provide mitigation before the president of the court Patrick Monney delivers his judgement.
The hearing continues.

FL3EI1FVUL_CEHUW23BYMXKT9H,'Deep concern' for patients and staff at Gaza's al-Aqsa hospital,By Alys Davies,11 January,20240110,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67929397,"Doctors from the UK who have been working at what they say is the only functioning hospital in the central Gaza Strip have told the BBC of their ""deep concern"" for patients and staff remaining there - as fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas has reportedly intensified in nearby areas.
Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been ""a real decrease"" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks.
At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity.
""Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza,"" another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC.
When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there.""
Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.
On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"".
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"".
He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"".
""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned.
Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday.
""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave.""
Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves.
The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"".
Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days.
""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard.
Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details.
And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added.
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead.
The IDF said in a statement on Thursday that ""a review was conducted based on the details provided to the IDF which shows that no strike was carried out in the described area"". ""The IDF is committed to international law and takes all feasible measures in order to mitigate civilian harm,"" it added.
The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing.
Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital.
The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves.
Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone.
The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa.
Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed.
Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital.
""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday.""
He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital.
""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.""
Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital.
The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital.
""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating.""
""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean.
""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added.
Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold.
""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity.""
She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief.
""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said.
""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor.""
Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries.
""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged.""
The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas.
""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned.
Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group.
It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them.
The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.
More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

FZ3KFZZI8Y_27OE7RUFNBUCAPN,Comoros President Azali Assoumani wins fourth term in disputed poll,By Gloria Aradi,3 days ago,20240117,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68002934,"Comoros President Azali Assoumani has been re-elected for a fourth term in a poll disputed by the opposition as ""fraudulent"".
He secured the win with 63% of the vote, the electoral body Ceni said.
However, turnout was low amid an opposition boycott - just 16% of people voted in the presidential election.
After the results were announced, security forces clashed with protesters in several parts of the capital, Moroni.
The house of a former minister was set on fire, while demonstrators blocked roads, the AFP news agency reports.
Opposition candidates alleged instances of ballot stuffing in favour of Mr Assoumani and that polls had closed early, according to the Reuters news agency.
Mr Assoumani's campaign team has denied the opposition's claims.
Six candidates ran in the 14 January presidential election in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
""We cannot talk about results because there was no election,"" Mouigni Baraka Said Soilihi, one of Mr Assoumani's opponents, was quoted as saying by Reuters.
International poll observers have said that voting was largely free and fair despite the irregularities reported by the opposition.
According to the election commission, 189,000 voters went to the polls, but only 55,259 - just 16% of registered voters - took part in the presidential election.
The dismal turnout followed calls for a boycott by some opposition candidates, prompting some voters to only participate in the gubernatorial elections held at the same time.
More than 330,000 people were registered to vote, out of a population the World Bank estimates at 836,000.
Mr Assoumani is a former military officer who first came to power through a coup in 1999 and won his first election in 2002.
He exited politics in 2006, before making a comeback with a presidential win in 2016.
He was able to seek a fourth term after a controversial referendum removed presidential term limits in 2018, leading to widespread protests in the country.
Mr Assoumani's rule has been marred by controversy, with critics accusing him of jailing and exiling his opponents.
He is the current chairperson of the African Union.

FZBZ75W2ZS_1HR1QNNO9WERAXZ,Aptamil baby milk: Big supermarkets cut price of formula,By Sam Gruet,5 days ago,20240115,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67986236,"Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have joined Iceland in cutting the cost of Aptamil baby formula.
It comes after manufacturer Danone cut the price it charges retailers for the majority of its baby milk range by 7%.
Asda said from Monday its customers would also be able to pay for formula using rewards scheme vouchers for the first time.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices for baby formula milk had risen by a quarter in two years.
The regulator found competition was hampered because shoppers were reluctant to switch brands, either because they were recommended by friends and family or because their baby would only drink one.
There are rules banning retailers from advertising discounts on infant formula - for babies up to six months - because it might discourage breastfeeding.
In August Iceland called on the government to ""immediately"" update existing legislation so that retailers were allowed to tell the public when they reduce the price of formula.
The supermarket said at the time it still endorsed breastfeeding, yet rising costs were ""placing unbearable pressure on parents who choose to or have no alternative"" to using formula milk.
Iceland was the first supermarket to announce a price reduction, saying Danone's cuts would be reflected in its stores. Asda said it would continue to work with its manufacturing partners to make sure price reductions were passed on to customers.
Kris Comerford, Asda's chief commercial officer, said the supermarket understood that baby formula was a ""vital necessity"" for many.
He said: ""Whilst we respect the regulations in place regarding the sale of baby formula, we want to do everything we can to help families manage their budget and keep their family fed.""
A Sainsbury's spokesperson said the supermarket was passing on cost savings to customers.
In November, the CMA found just two suppliers accounted for 85% of infant formula sales and there was ""very limited availability"" of cheaper own-brand alternatives.
New parents could make significant savings of Â£500 in the first year of a baby's life on formula milk products by shopping around, the CMA added.
Danone told the BBC it would ""continue to engage"" with the CMA investigation.
The rise in costs has correlated with a spike in formula thefts as part of a surge of shoplifting during the cost of living crisis.
Only one UK retailer, Aldi, sells its own brand. Lidl did not immediately reply to a request to comment.

QJ316K2IQ9_G26P679O9PL32PE,Namibia criticises German support for Israel over ICJ genocide case,By Danai Nesta Kupemba,7 days ago,20240114,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67974067,"Namibia has condemned former colonial ruler Germany for rejecting a case at the UN's top court accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.
Germany has offered to intervene on Israel's behalf in the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
President Hage Geingob urged Germany to ""reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence"".
In 2021 Berlin acknowledged committing genocide in Namibia.
German colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908. Historians consider this to be the 20th Century's first genocide.
President Geingob said Germany could not ""morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia"" and at the same time support Israel.
""The German Government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil,"" he added.
On Friday the German government said the accusation of genocide against Israel was completely unfounded and amounted to a ""political instrumentalisation"" of the UN genocide convention.
""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the government sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention,"" it said.
It said Hamas - which attacked Israel on 7 October, triggering the current war - aimed to destroy Israel, which was acting in self defence.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage on 7 October.
Since then Israel has killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly children and women, in its retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN and humanitarian organisations have warned of the risk of famine in Gaza as well as the spread of disease among displaced people and have urged that more aid be allowed into the territory.
The scale of the Israeli response prompted South Africa to ask the ICJ to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Pretoria's case included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"" and its legal team was scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.

UWPBLHZ252_2VLNQ2R380V6WVX,Nauru cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China,By Kelly Ng,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67978185,"One of Taiwan's last diplomatic allies has cut ties with the island in favour of Beijing, just days after a new president was voted in in Taipei.
Nauru, a tiny Micronesian island, was just one of 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taipei.
But in recent years, Beijing - which insists Taiwan is part of China - has been poaching its diplomatic allies.
Taiwan suggests this latest loss is related to the weekend's election results, which angered China.
The election saw voters pick pro-sovereignty candidate William Lai as their next president, a man Beijing has labelled a ""troublemaker"" over remarks he made in the past supporting Taiwanese independence, which it sees as a red line.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order,"" Taiwanese officials said after Nauru's government announced it would ""no longer recognise [Taiwan] as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory"".
In a media conference on Monday, Taipei's deputy foreign minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of taking advantage of recent ""political fluctuations"" in Nauru to ""buy over"" the country with financial aid.
""China thinks it can suppress Taiwan with such methods, I think it is wrong. The world has noticed Taiwan's democratic development. If [Beijing] continues to use such despicable methods to seize Taiwan's diplomatic relations, democratic countries all over the world will not recognise it,"" Mr Tien said.
Still, his ministry remains ""on strong alert"" to combat further moves from China to isolate Taiwan on an international stage, he said.
China - which sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - welcomed Nauru's decision.
""The decision of the government of Nauru to resume diplomatic relations with China fully demonstrates once again that the one-China principle is the will of the people and the trend of the times,"" China's foreign ministry said.
This is not the first time Nauru has cut ties with Taiwan, which considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.
In 2002, Nauru made a similar diplomatic switch to China - it later restored relations with Taiwan in May 2005.
Analysts said the move by Nauru was not unexpected.
""The likelihood that Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China has been on the cards for a while,"" said Anna Powles, associate professor in security studies at New Zealand's Massey University.
The speed at which Australia pursued a treaty offering climate refuge to Tuvalu citizens late last year reflected concerns that Tuvalu, another Pacific nation, was ""under pressure to switch recognition to China"", Ms Powles said.
""These concerns extended to Nauru,"" she said.
""China is always looking to erode Taiwan's influence, especially in the Pacific, where many small nations are looking for development gains,"" said Mihai Sora, a research fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia.
""As Taiwan has fewer diplomatic allies around the world, each one becomes more important in its claim to sovereignty... And it is quite possible that China will continue to look for opportunities to erode that.""

W7VU6ANF0U_FNUY3VO94SQWM4Y,Japan Airlines appoints ex-flight attendant as first female president,By Oliver Slow,3 days ago,20240118,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68015617,"Japan Airlines has named a woman as its next president for the first time, a rare appointment for a major Japanese firm - and global airline.
Mitsuko Tottori joined the flag carrier as a flight attendant in 1985, before working her way up.
She said she hoped her promotion would give other women the courage to pursue the next step in their careers.
Despite some improvements, very few major airlines have women in senior leadership positions.
Ms Tottori will replace Yuji Akasaka as president on 1 April. Mr Akasaka will replace Yoshiharu Ueki as chairman, the airline's most senior position.
The appointments come weeks after a Japan Airlines plane crashed with a smaller coastguard aircraft at Tokyo's Haneda Airport.
A ""miraculous"" evacuation ensured all 379 passengers and crew on board the jet survived, but five of the six crew on the coastguard plane died.
Ms Tottori - who worked in frontline roles before becoming a director for cabin crew in 2015 - said she would prioritise safety.
""I have spent most of my career at the frontline of safety and customer services - that is the cabinet attendants' division,"" she told a press conference.
""Operational safety is the foundation of airlines. I will continue to demonstrate my firm commitment to this principle,"" she said.
She also said there were women struggling to progress in their career, and hoped her appointment ""can encourage them, or give them the courage to take the next step"".
A survey by the aviation specialist website FlightGlobal found that, at the end of 2022 there were 12 women leading the top 100 airlines, up from six a year earlier.
They include Marjan Rintel at Dutch carrier KLM, Annette Mann at Austrian Airlines and Aer Lingus's Lynne Embleton.
Earlier this month, Joanna Geraghty was appointed chief executive of JetBlue Airways, becoming the first female to head a major airline in the United States.
It is also rare for women to lead major companies in Japan.
The government wants a third of leadership positions at major businesses to go to women by 2030, after failing to achieve the goal by 2020.
It is also urging businesses to appoint at least one woman as an executive by 2025.
Women held 13.2% of management positions in Japan in 2021, the lowest among the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The trend suggested ""a serious misallocation of human resources,"" the OECD said.

WPGIATAFFS_FXGMFX4TIPX7EWM,Iran's sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become,By Lyse Doucet,1 day ago,20240120,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68017444,"These are shape-shifting times in the Middle East.
This week, out of the blue, Iran suddenly attacked targets in ""friendly"" Pakistan, sparking an unprecedented tit-for-tat across their volatile border and a sharp spike in tension on a far edge of the grievous Israel-Gaza war.
Iran wanted a message to be heard loud and clear - at home, and a long way beyond.
""It has showcased its missile arsenal and its willingness to use it,"" says Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.
""It was a message also likely intended for Israel and the US in the midst of the Gaza war, especially with the potential escalation in Lebanon and Yemen.""
Like most observers, he believes ""for now Iran is not looking to escalate"".
Ever since the Gaza war exploded after Hamas's murderous 7 October assault on southern Israel, it has been darkened by fears of an even more dangerous contagion. No-one, including Iran and its principal partner Hezbollah, as well as the United States, wants to see an even hotter conflagration.
Iran's war has been a web of shadow wars. It sits at the fulcrum of what it calls an ""axis of resistance"", the alliance of Tehran-backed groups dotting the region, from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in both Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states.
Their military prowess is rooted in Iran's accelerated arming and training; each actor also has agendas and ambitions of its own.
Fires have been burning on all these fronts, and sometimes blazing, with efforts to douse the flames lest they provoke crippling Israeli and American reprisals.
When Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out these first direct strikes since this crisis erupted, they trained their sights on Pakistan and two other friendly countries. They may have seen them as areas of least resistance beyond the highly combustible landscape of their ""axis of resistance"".
Iran's elite force unleashed a barrage of ballistic missiles and suicide drones against what it called an intelligence centre for Israel's Mossad spy agency in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and at ""anti-Iran terror groups"" including Islamic State in rebel-controlled swathes of Syria.
Each operation was said to have its own specific retaliatory rationale.
Iran says it had to aim fire at Iranian Baloch separatists operating in restive southwest Pakistan.
""An attack was imminent. They had gathered and were leaving the base,"" says Prof Seyed Mohammad Marandi at the University of Tehran. He also points to last month's killing of 11 Iranian police officers in its tense province of Sistan and Balochistan.
Pakistan also spoke of an ""impending attack"" when it then fired its own salvos two days later into southern Iran against what it said were bases of its own Baloch nationalists, which it called ""terrorist targets"". This cross-border tension has simmered for decades; this is its worst moment.
Northern Iraq and Syria, closer to the Gaza epicentre, were about settling separate scores.
""The attacks in Iraq and Syria were retaliation for the general as well as the atrocity in Kerman,"" explains Prof Marandi. He's referring to last month's assassination just outside Damascus of one of the IRGC's most senior men, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, which was widely reported as the work of an Israeli air strike.
Then, earlier this month, a double suicide bombing shattered a memorial service in Iran for Qasem Soleimani, the top commander assassinated by an American drone in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution.
""Iran has been under pressure to react, including to the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, but it doesn't want to get directly embroiled in any escalation by hitting Israel or the US,"" says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region.
""We are going to continue to see a slow boil,"" he says.
These are also tough times at home for Iran's ruling clerics. They've faced unprecedented women-led protests over social freedoms and more, as well as financial woes stemming from international sanctions, alleged corruption, and mismanagement.
And there has been blowback after these latest operations, with angry denunciations from Iraq, as well as the Arab League, and an even more forceful rebuke from Pakistan.
""They did not think through that striking in Pakistan territory could just have no repercussions,"" remarks former Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""Their action created a crater of distrust. It will take hard work and persistence to fill.""
There are wars within wars in every corner of this conflict. Pakistan also had to be seen to be setting its own red lines in a neighbourhood where age-old rival India, as well as Taliban-run Afghanistan, were watching closely. Accusations and more of harbouring hostile forces have long been hurled across those borders too.
This past week has been a reminder, if one was needed, of the unpredictability and peril in this moment of a widening and worsening Israel-Gaza war.
Any day can be a flare-up on one or multiple fronts - and there are the longer-term risks being shaped in a region where fault lines were deeply and darkly etched long before Hamas's 7 October attacks.
Israel's largest loss of life in a single day since the founding of its state, as well as the seizing of more than 250 hostages, sparked a military campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths and turning much of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland.
It has enraged and emboldened this Iran-backed military alliance of militant non-state actors. They've been drawing closer for years. Now they've forged a far more vocal and visible league.
For Iran's adversaries, the proverbial ""we need to do something about Iran"" may now be even riskier. It may also mean confronting Tehran's staunchest allies across the region.
""Tehran has achieved what the Pentagon calls military 'overmatch' - a level of capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely difficult to check or defeat,"" says Robin Wright, author of several books on Iran and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.
This current escalation has not been cost-free. US salvos against Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq are reported to have significantly damaged their infrastructure.
The Pentagon says its air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, in an effort to stop their attacks on vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lanes, have destroyed a quarter of the Houthi arsenal.
But on the balance sheets of some of Iran's allies, they believe they're winning far more than they're losing. Standing up for Gazans has galvanised their popularity on Arab streets. Yemen's Houthis in particular are relishing being catapulted into the centre of world attention.
Minds are already focused on the ""day after"", when this Israel-Gaza war ends, including in Tehran, which has long prided itself on its ""strategic patience"".
""Iran is playing a broader longer game,"" points out Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House. ""It perhaps anticipates that after Gaza winds down Israel is going to be more provocative towards Iran, so it is preparing for a longer fight.""
Iran's long-term goals include keeping the US out of its backyard, and avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel and America.
That means careful calculations on where and how it strikes in a hazardous region where the risks of miscalculation are always dangerously high.

X5KCFF9WH0_5DLG0TSF147TGP7,Ukraine war: Russian missiles wreck Kharkiv hotel - governor,By Laurence Peter,11 January,20240111,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67942020,"Two Russian missiles have struck a hotel in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, injuring 11 people, the Kharkiv governor says.
Photos from Ukraine's State Emergency Service showed the hotel heavily damaged and firefighters at the scene.
Governor Oleh Synehubov said the injured included Turkish journalists. Two S-300 missiles struck at about 22:30 (20:30 GMT), he said.
Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukrainian cities in the past two weeks.
Ukrainian officials say dozens of civilians have died in those attacks from drones and missiles.
Kharkiv, just 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border, has suffered extensive damage from Russian air strikes since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
In the latest strike, nine injured were taken to hospital, including a 35-year-old man in a serious condition, the governor said on the Telegram messaging service.
The city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, quoted by Ukraine's Unian news agency, said ""there were no military at all"" in the hotel at the time, but 30 civilians were there. It is in the city's central Kyiv district. He said several homes and cars nearby were also damaged.
The Russian city of Belgorod, 74km north of Kharkiv, was hit by Ukrainian missiles and drones on 30 December which Russian officials say killed 25 civilians.
Russia has started moving hundreds of Belgorod children to holiday camps further away from Ukraine for three-week stays. A camp in Voronezh region received 93 on Wednesday and later 280 arrived in Kaluga region, state TV reported, adding that teachers would join them there.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, on a visit to Lithuania on Wednesday, urged Western allies to provide more air defence weapons. The Baltic nation is among the staunchest allies of Ukraine in bolstering Kyiv's resistance to the Russian forces.
""Air defence systems are what we lack the most. The fight against drones. I am happy that we have agreements with Lithuania and many other partners,"" he said in Vilnius. Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Estonia, are ex-Soviet states now in the Nato alliance.
In terms of GDP, Lithuania is the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy reports. The US contribution to Ukraine's defence is, however, by far the largest.
Mr Zelensky, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine, said Vladimir Putin ""will not calm down until he destroys Ukraine"".
""He wants to fully occupy us. And sometimes our partners' doubts over financial and military assistance to Ukraine, quick reaction, gives courage and strength to the Russian Federation.""
He said the Russian leader ""won't finish this [war], until we all finish him together"" and warned that the Baltic states and Moldova ""may be next"".
In recent days, the Ukrainian leader has held intensive talks with Western allies aimed at maintaining vital arms deliveries. Kyiv's counter-offensive late last year made little progress, and some in the West have questioned Kyiv's strategy, fuelling concern about the cost of the war.
With Russia now committed to much higher military expenditure, Nato countries are struggling to boost production of artillery shells and other heavy weapons.
An EU aid package worth â¬50bn (Â£43bn; $55bn) for Ukraine is stuck because of a Hungarian veto, while the divided US Congress has stalled over a new tranche of military aid.
After a video conference with the Ukrainian government on Wednesday, Nato said it had plans to provide ""billions of euros of further capabilities"" to Ukraine this year.
""Nato strongly condemns Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, including with weapons from North Korea and Iran,"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.

ZQ9HNPSXCN_0B9S2W5YLC7MQO1,British brothers raided Swiss museum 'to clear a debt',By Thomas Mackintosh,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67950947,"Two British brothers have admitted raiding a museum in Switzerland and making off with iconic Chinese Ming dynasty era artefacts worth millions in order to ""clear a debt"", a court heard.
Prosecutors said the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva was burgled in June 2019 by a gang of three who used tools to break through the front door.
Two 14th Century vases and a bowl were taken in the heist.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted their involvement at a court in Geneva.
The pair, from south-east London, appeared before a panel of three judges at the Palais de Justice in Geneva on Monday facing charges of theft, trespass and damage to property.
They fought extradition from the UK, but it was approved by the Home Secretary in 2022.
Patrick Monney, the president of the court, rejected a last-minute application for the trial to be heard in private. He added that the court was aware of the facts of the case from reports by the Swiss Prosecutors Office and Geneva Police and explained the purpose of the hearing was to ""ask additional questions"".
The court heard that the two brothers travelled to Hong Kong shortly after the raid to sell one of the stolen items to an auction house for Â£80,000.
Father-of-one Louis Ahearne told the court he came to Geneva days before the raid to carry out reconnaissance.
The 34-year-old to confirmed he went to ""film the museum"" and ""took part in the burglary"".
He also admitted giving his passport to the auction house in Hong Kong.
""I was in debt,"" he told the court. ""I was paid to be a front man to clear a debt. In the [CCTV] video I am the third person [going into the museum] with no crowbar and no sledgehammer.""
Throughout the hearing, the brothers insisted they didn't want to name the third person involved.
Stewart Ahearne, 45, told the court he has five children and worked as a tradesman in England. He also admitted to using his name to hire the Renault Captur car, used in the heist, from Avis at Geneva Airport.
He told the court he ""took full responsibility"" for his actions, but denied being involved in any pre-planning of the heist in Geneva.
""I went into the museum. I stole some stuff. Any organisation, anything to do with the artwork I didn't know nothing,"" he said.
He added that he was ""used as a pawn like in a game of chess"" during the heist: ""I was asked to come to Switzerland to do some driving. The story, the scenario changed with the third person. He is not someone you can say no to. He is not a very nice person. My role was I was used.
""I got a phone call telling me my brother was in debt and that I was needed to bring back some stuff. Alarm bells started ringing. My instinct as an older brother was to protect my brother.""
The court heard the three came to Geneva in February 2019. Louis Ahearne said this was for ""tourist"" purposes, but Stewart Ahearne said he ""put two and two together"" after the burglary.
""It was so the third person could do some scouting,"" he added.
He broke down when answering questions about his life in Champ-Dollon prison, saying he spends his time in a cell by himself for 23 hours a day.
The hearing continues.
