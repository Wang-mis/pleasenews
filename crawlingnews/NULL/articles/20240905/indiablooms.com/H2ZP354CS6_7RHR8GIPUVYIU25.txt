The top court is hearing Kejriwal's bail plea in the CBI case linked to the alleged scam.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had granted bail to the Chief Minister in the case filed by the Enforcement Directorate linked to the same case.
On March 21, 2024, Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate over money laundering allegations while framing the Delhi liquor policy for 2021-22, which was later scrapped after the Lieutenant Governor raised red flags.
Kejriwal was arrested by the CBI on June 26.
The ED has alleged the money Kejriwal got from the liquor sellers was used to fund the party's campaign in Goa since he is the convenor of the AAP.
Kejriwal and the AAP have throughout maintained the Centre has been misusing its agencies to harass the Opposition with false cases.
Kejriwal was given an interim bail in May for a brief period until June 2, 2024 for campaigning in the Lok Sabha polls.
He went back to the jail on June 2, 2024 the day next to the last phase poll date.
