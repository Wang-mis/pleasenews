Warships of the Chinese and Singaporean navies have launched the harbor phase of a joint exercise ahead of the sea phase off the southern Chinese coast, a move experts said on Sunday displays how China and Southeast Asian countries can have military cooperation that contributes to peace and stability.
After the frigate Sanya and the minesweeper Hejian of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy as well as the frigate RSS Stalwart of the Singaporean navy assembled at a naval port in Zhanjiang, South China's Guangdong Province on Thursday for the China-Singapore Exercise Cooperation 2024 joint maritime exercise scheduled from Friday to September 5, these vessels, together with the PLA Navy's destroyer Zhanjiang, opened to the public as a part of the harbor phase of the exercise on Saturday, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Sunday.
The harbor phase will last until Tuesday, after which the participating vessels will embark on the sea phase in waters off Zhanjiang, CCTV reported.
The exercise aims to consolidate a mechanism that sees the two navies host joint drills alternately in their countries every year, expand the drills' the scale and influence, and build a good situation for China's military cooperation with countries in Southeast Asia, the PLA Navy said in a press release.
The two sides will organize training courses including joint anti-surface strike, replenishment-at-sea, joint search and rescue, as well as VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure), Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said at a regular press conference on Thursday. He noted that as it is the third edition of this exercise, this year's drill will further enhance mutual trust and friendship, and promote pragmatic exchanges and cooperation.
A Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday that the frigates and the minesweeper sent by the two sides could serve to maintain the openness of key international shipping lanes in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, demonstrating the two navies' capabilities in safeguarding peace and stability in the region.
It will set a good example for military exchanges and cooperation among Southeast Asian countries, especially the Philippines, against the background of tensions in the South China Sea, the expert said.
