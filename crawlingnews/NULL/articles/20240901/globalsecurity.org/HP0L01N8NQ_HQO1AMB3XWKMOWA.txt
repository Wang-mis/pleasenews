Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Russia will finalize a comprehensive interstate agreement with Iran "in the very near future."
Lavrov said the two countries "will conclude a new interstate comprehensive partnership agreement."
He made the remarks during a meeting with students and faculty of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) on Monday.
Lavrov said the conclusion of the agreement will be a "symbolic step" in Tehran-Moscow relations following the inauguration of the new Iranian administration in late July.
The top Russian diplomat expressed confidence that the statements of Iran's new president and foreign minister about the continuity in mutual relations "reflect the sincere intention and attitude" of the new administration in Iran.
Lavrov said Iran and Russia are developing ties rapidly and have already implemented "a large number of bilateral projects".
"I believe that the figures characterizing the growth of trade turnover and the volume of investments speak for themselves. These figures are constantly increasing, so we have a bright future."
Iran and Russia have signed a 10-year cooperation deal that was lengthened to 20 years through two five-year extensions. The major deal is expected to elevate relations between the two allies to a new level.
The two sides have sought to develop bilateral strategic cooperation, which may determine their relations for the next 20 years.
Back in June, Lavrov said Russia and Iran have reached full agreement on the text of a major cooperation deal that is expected to promote relations, adding that the two sides have yet to put their final signatures on the state treaty.
