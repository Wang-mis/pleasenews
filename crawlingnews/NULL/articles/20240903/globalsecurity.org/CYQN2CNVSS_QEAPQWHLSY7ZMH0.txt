The Australian Government is deeply concerned by a series of dangerous and aggressive actions by China against the Philippines, including on 19, 25 and 31 August near Sabina Shoal.
This included the repeated and intentional ramming of Philippine vessels, causing structural damage, and the use of water cannons.
Australia shares the Philippines' condemnation of this destabilising and unacceptable conduct. It poses serious risks of harm to crew, and undermines recent commitments to de-escalate tensions in the South China Sea.
The Australian Government urges China to cease these actions, resolve disputes peacefully and adhere to international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and conventions on the prevention of collisions at sea.
Australia calls for restraint and reiterates that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties.
