A barrage of missiles and rockets targeted the Ain al-Asad base on Saturday evening, U.S. Central Command said in a statement.
Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base's air defense systems, according to the military, but an untold number hit the base where Americans and Iraqis are stationed. A damage assessment is ongoing.
A ""number"" of U.S. personnel are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries, CENTCOM said, without specifying how many.
Last month, three U.S. service members were wounded, one critically, in a drone attack on their base in northern Iraq. The U.S. responded with airstrikes that it said destroyed facilities and likely killeda number of Kataib Hezbollah militants in Iraq.
It's the latest in a series of back-and-forth attacks between Iran-aligned groups and U.S. forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that led to the deadly war in Gaza. Since then, the U.S. has issued warnings of a wider war in the region. Hamas is part of a regional alliance supported by Iran and loosely united by their resistance to Western powers and Israel.

39PG67136C_MWTVOOU13S8741X,At least 27 people were killed in an attack on Donetsk in Russian-occupied Ukraine,By The Associated Press,"Published January 21, 2024 at 5:51 AM CST",20240121,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-21/at-least-27-people-were-killed-in-an-attack-on-donetsk-in-russian-occupied-ukraine,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 2:54 PM ET
KYIV, Ukraine — Moscow-installed officials said Ukrainian shelling killed at least 27 people and wounded 25 on Sunday at a market on the outskirts of Donetsk, a Russian-occupied city in the eastern part of the country.
Among the injured in the suburb of Tekstilshchik were two children, said Denis Pushilin, the local leader.
Ukrainian officials in Kyiv did not comment on the incident, and the claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press. Both sides have increasingly relied on longer-range attacks this winter amid largely unchanged positions on the 930-mile front line in the nearly 2-year-old war.
The artillery shells that hit the area had been fired from the area of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west, Pushilin said, adding that emergency services responded to the scene.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed illegally in 2022, months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
Russia's Foreign Ministry also blamed Ukraine and described the strike as a ""terrorist attack.""
Also on Sunday, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia's Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said. Local media said the Baltic Sea port, 165 kilometers (about 100 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek.
In a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company blamed the fire on an ""external influence,"" saying operations at the port were paused.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of the Kingisepp district on the Gulf of Finland where the port is located, said there were no casualties but the area was on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg on Sunday morning, but were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. AP could not independently verify the reports.
Russia's Defense Ministry did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia's Smolensk region, and that two more were shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
In fighting on the front line, Russia's Defense Ministry said Moscow's forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces confirmed the settlement had been occupied, but described its capture as temporary.
Ukrainian Ground Forces Command spokesman Volodymyr Fityo said Kyiv's troops had been pulled back to reserve positions from the village, which had a population of about 45 people before the start of the war.
""That's five houses, probably,"" he was quoted as saying by Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske. ""Our main goal is to save the lives of Ukraine's defenders.""
Recent Russian attacks have tried to find gaps in Ukraine's defenses by using large numbers of missiles and drones in an apparent effort to saturate air defense systems.
The massive barrages — more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, according to officials in Kyiv — are also using up Ukraine's weapons stockpiles.

C4EGUQHE2R_360P9FWE0XOXIYA,Billions of cicadas will buzz this spring as two broods emerge at the same time,By Clare Marie Schneider,"Published January 21, 2024 at 1:23 PM CST",20240121,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-21/billions-of-cicadas-will-buzz-this-spring-as-two-broods-emerge-at-the-same-time,"Much of the eastern United States can prepare for what one entomologist described as a ""spectacular, macabre Mardi Gras"" this spring.
The event Jonathan Larson, an extension entomologist at the University of Kentucky, is referring to is the simultaneous emergence of two cicada broods that will erupt in states from Virginia to Illinois come late April through June.
Periodical cicadas, which have the longest known insect life cycle, spend most of their life underground in an immature nymph form before surfacing from the ground every 13 or 17 years for a brief adult life. A brood constitutes multiple species of cicadas that merge on the same cycle.
""It's like a graduating class that has a reunion every 17 or 13 years,"" says Gene Kritsky, professor emeritus of biology at Mount St. Joseph University and author of A Tale of Two Broods: The 2024 Emergence of Periodical Cicada Broods XIII and XIX.
Although cicadas are a valuable food source for birds and small mammals, in large numbers their deafening calls can be annoying and their carcasses littering the ground can be a nuisance. The last time the Northern Illinois Brood emerged 17 years ago, ""they were out in such abundant numbers that Chicagoans were having to remove them with shovels, to clear sidewalks and roads,"" said Floyd Shockley, an entomologist and the collections manager for the Department of Entomology at the National Museum of Natural History.
The last time the two broods — Brood XIX and Brood XIII — emerged simultaneously was in 1803. Shockley says their surfacing makes for an ""extremely rare, once-in-a-lifetime event.""
Brood XIX, known as the Great Southern Brood, contains four species of cicadas and emerges only every 13 years. The Northern Illinois Brood, or Brood XIII, is on a 17-year cycle and contains three species of cicadas.
Shockley says the Great Southern Brood will start appearing in late April through the first or second week of May across 15 states, mostly in the South, running from Virginia and into Alabama and Mississippi.
As for the Northern Illinois Brood, Shockley says people will start to see these cicadas closer to mid-May through the first week of June. The brood will be highly concentrated across four states, including Illinois, parts of Wisconsin, Indiana, and a bit of Michigan.
Across the east, Kritsky says, ""we'll probably see billions of cicadas"" due to the dual emergence of the two broods. While you may hear or see cicadas in your area well into September, the periodical cicadas will die off by June, their song replaced by annually occurring cicadas for the rest of the summer.
Once the ground reaches the optimal temperature of 64 degrees Fahrenheit, the insects find their way to nearby trees and shed their skins, Kritsky said. It takes about four to five days for the adult males to start singing, but once they do, their songs can be louder than a jet engine.
The male cicadas ""produce this chorus that attracts the females to the trees,"" says Larson. ""Then they'll pair up and have courtship songs,"" singing individually to female cicadas in an attempt to persuade them to mate. After mating, the female cicada lays her eggs in a tree and then they die, littering the base of trees and leaving behind what Kritsky describes as a ""delicate, rotten Limburger cheese"" smell.
The cycle begins all over when the cicada eggs drop from the tree, returning to the ground for another 13 to 17 years. Although they spend years underground in an immature state, the adult lifespan of a cicada ranges only from four to six weeks.
""It's pretty much this big spectacular macabre Mardi Gras,"" says Larson. ""It's a lot of singing, lots of paramours pairing up, and then lots of dying.""
While the two broods this spring will mostly be separated by time and place, ""they will overlap for several weeks,"" in Illinois, says Shockley. This overlap could result in some Illinois residents hearing all seven species of the two broods singing their cacophonous mating calls together, he says. Additionally, Shockley says the overlap could result in ""an extremely rare opportunity for genetic crossing between 13-year cicadas and 17-year cicadas that could lead to the emergence of a new brood.""
All the experts NPR spoke with emphasized that the bugs' ephemeral emergence is not harmful to humans or pets. While the sheer amount of them may be shocking if you're in certain high density areas, they won't bite or sting you, says Larson. ""Your pets will probably try to eat them,"" he adds. ""And they're going to be OK.""
Shockley added not to spray pesticides on the bugs. The chemicals could impact birds and small mammals that might feed on the cicadas. ""Or it could hit non-target things like butterflies and bees that you actually want to have around your home,"" he says.
While Larson says people may be ""disgusted by the situation,"" he emphasized that it's a unique, beautiful spectacle of nature that you can't encounter elsewhere in the world.
Kritsky described the short-lived emergence of the cicadas as ""like having a David Attenborough special in your backyard,"" referring to the British naturalist and broadcaster. ""If you're lucky enough to live in an area where these things are going on, get your kids out there. Watch this.""

D2ZQV9DEY2_HRET07F3HMQ41QZ,NASA finds Ingenuity after losing contact with the Mars helicopter,By Emma Bowman,"Published January 20, 2024 at 2:03 PM CST",20240121,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-20/nasa-finds-ingenuity-after-losing-contact-with-the-mars-helicopter,"Updated January 20, 2024 at 9:40 PM ET
NASA is back in contact with its beloved helicopter on Mars, Ingenuity, two days after a communication blackout.
Communications broke down on Thursday, when the little autonomous rotorcraft was sent on a ""quick pop-up vertical flight,"" to test its systems after an unplanned early landing during its previous flight, the agency said in a status update on Friday night.
The Perseverance rover, which relays data between the helicopter and Earth during the flights, showed that Ingenuity climbed to its assigned maximum altitude of 40 feet, NASA said.
During its planned descent, the helicopter and rover stopped communicating with each other.
But good news came late on Saturday, when NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory tweeted that it had reestablished contact with the helicopter after instructing the rover ""to perform long-duration listening sessions for Ingenuity's signal.""
The Ingenuity team is reviewing the new data to understand the unexpected communications dropout that occurred during the helicopter's 72nd flight, it added.
Ingenuity has already exceeded its original mission, having proven that powered, controlled flight is possible in the thin and frigid Martian atmosphere, in what NASA describes as an otherworldly ""Wright brothers moment.""
It's since graduated to a new phase, setting the stagefor future drone exploration on Mars and other worlds.

DE9RI6TV2L_CLBEQUK4ODQSRAK,"Palestinian death toll passes 25,000 as Israel announces the death of another hostage",By The Associated Press,"Published January 21, 2024 at 3:32 AM CST",20240121,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-21/palestinian-death-toll-passes-25-000-as-israel-announces-the-death-of-another-hostage,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 9:32 PM ET
RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said Sunday, while Israel announced the death of another hostage and appeared far from achieving its goals of freeing more than 100 others and crushing the militant group.
The war's deaths, destruction and displacement are without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war has divided Israelis while the offensive threatens to ignite a wider conflict involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
Furious with the Israeli government and demanding the release of remaining hostages, relatives and others set up a tent camp outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem and vowed to stay until a deal is reached.
Netanyahu, in a defiant new statement, said he stressed in his conversation Friday with U.S. President Joe Biden that he rejects Hamas demands for a cease-fire, Israeli forces' withdrawal and the release of Palestinians held by Israel in exchange for the remaining hostages. He said that agreeing means another devastating Hamas attack ""would only be a matter of time.""
Netanyahu also rejects calls from U.S, its closest ally, for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the refusal to accept a two-state solution unacceptable.
""The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region,"" Guterres added. ""And that starts with an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to relieve the suffering in Gaza.""

The war began with Hamas' attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel's military announced the death of 19-year-old Sgt. Shay Levinson, who was among the hostages. His date of death was given as Oct. 7, but there were no further details. According to Israeli media, his body is still in Gaza.
Israel has responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a bombing campaign and ground invasion that laid waste to entire neighborhoods in northern Gaza and spread south, striking some areas where it told civilians to seek refuge. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.
""The plumes of smoke from tanks, artillery and the planes of the air force will continue to cover the sky over the Gaza Strip until we will achieve our goals,"" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said.
Since the war started, 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry said. The toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza's hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said.
The overall toll is thought to be higher because many casualties remain buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot reach, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says about two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods. The military released footage of a tunnel under a residential neighborhood in Khan Younis where the army believes at least 20 hostages were kept at different times.
Israel's military said the demolition last week of a key building at Israa University in Gaza was under review, and asserted that preliminary findings indicated Hamas had used the compound for military purposes. The university has said the ""attack"" came weeks after Israeli forces occupied the building.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza's residents, with hundreds of thousands packing U.N.-run shelters and camps in the south. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
Israel said 260 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday, the highest number since the war began. About 500 entered daily before that, according to the U.N.
""Bread does not suffice for one hour,"" said Ahmad Al-Nashawi, who accepted donated food at a tent camp in the southern city of Rafah. ""You can see how many children we have other than women and men. What matters most for a child is to eat.""

At the new protest camp outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence, hostages' families urged the government to act.
""It's not logical that you're telling us the war must continue, and you keep saying that because of military pressure we will release them, but we don't see a single one released because of this pressure,"" said Gilad Korengold, the father of hostage Tal Shoham.
Some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that Netanyahu's goals of ""complete victory"" over Hamas and returning the remaining hostages might be mutually exclusive.
A member of Israel's War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the hostages was through a cease-fire.
But Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners push him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the ""voluntary"" emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there.
Hamas is believed to be using the hostages as shields for its top leaders. Israel has rescued one hostage, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
Hostages' families want an exchange like the one during a weeklong November cease-fire. Other Israelis are frustrated by the security failures ahead of the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu's handling of the war.
Near the site of an Oct. 7 massacre during a music festival, families of Israeli victims planted trees.
""What happened after 109 days? Nothing. We're just still waiting,"" said one father, Idan Bahat.

M6JSQIS91F_31SOXP78Y4GAFAP,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis drops out of the presidential race, endorses Trump",By Jeongyoon Han,"Published January 21, 2024 at 2:18 PM CST",20240121,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-21/florida-gov-ron-desantis-drops-out-of-the-presidential-race-endorses-trump,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 3:38 PM ET
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose hardline right-wing policies in his state garnered much public attention and made him an early favorite for the 2024 presidential race, suspended his bid for the Republican nomination on Sunday in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
DeSantis also endorsed former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a more favorable outcome — more campaign stops, more interviews — I would do it,"" he said. ""But I can't ask our volunteers to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.""
DeSantis then proceeded to urge voters to support Trump, arguing that he is ""superior"" to President Biden.
""He [Trump] has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form or warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
DeSantis' exit from the Republican presidential nomination field creates a path for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the only conservative alternative to Trump's candidacy left in the race. Trump and Haley will square off in the New Hampshire GOP primary on Tuesday.
At an event of her own in New Hampshire on Sunday, Haley announced the news of DeSantis' decision to cheering supporters.
""He ran a great race,"" she said. ""He's been a good governor and we wish him well.""
But Haley quickly pivoted the focus back to the race on Tuesday. ""It's now one fella and one lady left,"" she said, referring to the race between herself and Trump for the GOP nomination. ""All the fellas are out except for this one, and this comes down to what do you want.""
DeSantis came in second place in the Iowa GOP caucuses, according to results from The Associated Press, garnering 21.2% of votes, behind Trump, who won 51.0% of the vote. Haley placed third, at 19.1%.
There have been real questions about DeSantis' campaign after his distant second-place finish in Iowa. He pledged to continue and focus on South Carolina, but his campaign and super PAC supporting him, which had spent tens of millions supporting him, has spent nothing on campaign ads since Iowa.

DeSantis' main campaign message was that he would be better at delivering the same kinds of policies that Trump would be in favor of, because he doesn't have the same baggage that Trump carries from his numerous indictments and federal charges. He vowed to rid the country of ""wokeism,"" a term he often used to criticize liberal policies, win the presidency by a wide margin, and deliver on issues that Republicans care about — much like how he says he has in Florida.
""Donald Trump is running for his issues, Nikki Haley is running for her donors' issues, I'm running for your issues, your family's issues, and solely to turn this country around,"" DeSantis said in a video posted shortly before the Iowa caucuses began on Jan. 15. ""I'm the only one that's beaten the left on issue, after issue, after issue.""
DeSantis was elected to Congress in 2012, to represent Florida's 6th Congressional District, and came to national focus in recent years — namely, for how he's governed Florida. He became a favorite among conservatives for his policies in the state, ranging from attacks on gender-affirming care, to banning diversity and equity initiatives in public colleges, resisting public health measures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sending migrants who had crossed the border illegally to progressive states.
While DeSantis tried to carry his conservative record as governor into his presidential campaign, there were two things standing in his way: Trump, whose broad support among conservatives across the country remains unmatched; and DeSantis himself.
From the start, the DeSantis campaign was plagued with complications and personnel issues. DeSantis announced his campaign on a livestream with Elon Musk on X, formerly known as Twitter, only for the event to be riddled with embarrassing technical malfunctions.
More recently, a watchdog group filed a legal complaint about the structure of the Florida governor's super PAC, which had already gone through a series of leadership resignations. A top strategist in the super PAC also resigned following a Washington Post piece that detailed the PAC's internal troubles.
DeSantis looked to establish strong momentum in the early contests in the nation, campaigning in all of Iowa's 99 counties. He picked up the endorsement of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and evangelical Christian leader Bob Vander Plaats, who had a record of endorsing past candidates who went on to win the Iowa GOP caucuses.
But after the caucuses in the Hawkeye state concluded, DeSantis split his focus between the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, and the upcoming contest in South Carolina.
Toward the end of his campaign, DeSantis began to throw harder jabs at Trump himself. During a visit to New Hampshire in December, DeSantis said he thought Trump wouldn't accept the results of the contests.
""If Trump loses, he will say it's stolen no matter what, absolutely,"" he told reporters. ""He will try to delegitimize the results.""
