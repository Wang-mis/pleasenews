Israeli forces delay people's access to care by obstructing access to health facilities, blocking traffic and targeting ambulances in the West Bank city of Jenin, amid the regime's deadly assault on the city that has entered its fifth day, says Doctors Without Borders.
The international organization, known by its French initials MSF, said in a statement on social media platform X that the regime's brutal assault on Jenin is "alarming."
The charity said that "in the MSF-supported Khalil Suleiman Hospital, which has been surrounded by Israeli Forces since the start of the incursion, electricity and water supplies are compromised."
"The medical team has been forced to halt dialysis operations, key for the treatment of kidney failure."
"Israel must adhere to its obligations as an occupying power in the West Bank, including access to medical care. Hospitals, ambulances and the medical humanitarian mission must be respected and protected," MSF said.
On Saturday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli troops fired at one of its ambulances in Jenin, despite its entry was coordinated ahead of time.
Israel's invasion of the West Bank, the largest seen in the city in decades, has killed at least 24 people since Wednesday.
The UN human rights office, (OHCHR) has warned that the regime's hostilities in the West Bank risked further enflaming an "already explosive situation," in the territory.
