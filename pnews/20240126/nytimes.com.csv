02WWHTGF8F_R5GXATCSOFXDPZN,YFN Lucci Pleads Guilty to Gang Charge Ahead of Trial,By Julia Jacobs,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/arts/music/yfn-lucci-guilty-plea.html,"Rayshawn Bennett, a rapper known as YFN Lucci, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one gang-related charge in Atlanta, his lawyers said, as part of a deal with prosecutors in a case interconnected with the racketeering charges against the Atlanta rap crew YSL.
Mr. Bennett was part of a wide-ranging 2021 indictment, brought by District Attorney Fani T. Willis of Fulton County, that accused him of murder, aggravated assault and violating the state’s criminal racketeering law. In 2022, Ms. Willis used the same racketeering law to charge Young Thug, the popular rapper, YSL leader and rival to Mr. Bennett.
The trial against Young Thug and five of his associates is proceeding in the same courthouse as the trial against Mr. Bennett, who reached the plea deal during jury selection.
Like in the YSL prosecution, the indictment against those accused of being part of YFN put forward social media posts and song lyrics as evidence of criminal activity.
As part of the plea deal with Mr. Bennett, prosecutors dismissed 12 out of the 13 charges against him, including the racketeering charge. He pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, said one of his lawyers, Drew Findling.
Mr. Bennett agreed to a 20-year sentence, including 10 years in custody and the rest on probation. But he could be considered for release in less than four months, Mr. Findling said, when factoring in parole eligibility rules and the time he has served in jail since his arrest in 2021. (If he had been convicted on the murder charge, which involved what prosecutors described as a gang-related shootout in 2020, Mr. Bennett could have faced life in prison.)
“He’s ready to put this behind him and get back to his four children, to his family and to his career,” Mr. Findling said.
The two other defendants who were scheduled to stand trial alongside Mr. Bennett also took plea deals, the lawyer said.
A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the plea deal.
Mr. Bennett is from Atlanta and gained prominence with his 2016 song “Key to the Streets,” which featured Quavo and Takeoff from the chart-topping rap group Migos. He has been a side character in the sprawling Young Thug prosecution, which claims that other YSL members attempted to kill Mr. Bennett by stabbing him at the Fulton County Jail.
Speaking to reporters outside the Atlanta courthouse on Tuesday, Mr. Findling denied that his client had any plans to cooperate with the YSL prosecution, saying, “He wants nothing to do with that case.”"
04VIWZSWAR_CYFNV2254MGGWQ9,"Biden Administration Faces Pushback on Another Gas Project, This Time Overseas",By Hiroko Tabuchi,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/climate/lng-terminals-financing-cp2.html,"Even as the Biden administration, under pressure from environmentalists, hits pause on its approval of a major natural gas export terminal in the United States, it faces another big gas decision overseas.
A $13 billion natural gas export project in Papua New Guinea led by TotalEnergies and Exxon Mobil is on a shortlist of projects set to receive financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, or Ex-Im, which supports American businesses around the world.
The Papua LNG gas project would join a portfolio of oil and gas projects the bank funds, including an oil refinery in Indonesia and an oil tank project in the Bahamas. The bank is also considering financing an offshore pipeline and natural gas plants in Guyana.
Some climate activists see a big contradiction between climate actions the government is taking in the United States versus around the world.
“He’s done so much at home,” said Kate DeAngelis, who works on international finance at Friends of the Earth, a network of environmental organizations that has called on the bank not to finance the project, referring to President Biden.
But he “can’t claim to be a climate champion when the U.S. is propping up this fossil fuel infrastructure all over the world,” she said.

0R44LA31RY_A7S7ZSP3ICCU06D,U.S. Is Watching North Korea for Signs of Lethal Military Action,By Edward Wong and Julian E. BarnesReporting from Washington,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/north-korea-war-kim.html,"North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, could take some form of lethal military action against South Korea in the coming months after having shifted to a policy of open hostility, U.S. officials say.
The officials have assessed that Mr. Kim’s recent harder line is part of a pattern of provocations, but that his declarations have been more aggressive than previous statements and should be taken seriously.
While the officials added that they did not see an imminent risk of a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Kim could carry out strikes in a way that he thinks would avoid rapid escalation.
They pointed to North Korea’s shelling of a South Korean island in 2010 as an example. The two sides exchanged artillery fire, resulting in the reported deaths of troops on both sides as well as civilians in the South, but both militaries soon stopped.
Jonathan Finer, the White House deputy national security adviser, said at an Asia Society forum in Washington on Thursday that North Korea had “chosen to continue going down a very negative path.”
Mr. Kim’s more aggressive posture has been evident through a series of actions this month. On Wednesday, the North fired several cruise missiles from its west coast into the sea, the South Korean military said. Mr. Kim’s government announced on Jan. 14 that it had tested a new solid-fuel intermediate-range missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. And on Jan. 5, his military fired hundreds of artillery shells into waters near South Korean islands, forcing some residents to seek shelter.

0X70MU4U1N_MMKLXSXK1CZ9V49,The Hot New Accessory From the Paris Runways: A Robot Baby,By Elizabeth Paton,"Published Jan. 22, 2024Updated Jan. 23, 2024",20230123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/style/robot-baby-schiaparelli-show.html,"It wouldn’t be the Monday morning of Paris couture week unless Schiaparelli used its runway show to produce a viral internet moment.
Last year, Kylie Jenner took her place in the front row wearing a giant hyper-realistic lion head attached to her chest. People went nuts because they thought it was real taxidermy and promoted trophy hunting. It wasn’t, obviously. It was made from sculpted foam, wool and faux fur.
This year, the spotlight didn’t belong to a celebrity, even though Zendaya did turn up with blunt bangs (gasp) and Jennifer Lopez, gearing up to promote her new film “This Is Me: Now … A Love Story,” arrived with a new hairdo of her own. It was a wet look bob, if you’re wondering, which she wore with Schiaparelli sunglasses that had sculpted gold eyebrows and lenses of opaque precious stone. (Fashion can’t always be fabulous and practical.)
No, this year social media was abuzz thanks to a runway cameo by a giant robot baby. The hot new accessory, worn on one hip by the model Maggie Maurer, was a bedazzled toddler-shaped figure made of silver and green electronic panels, pearl-encrusted circuit boards, broken cables, wires and thousands of shimmering Swarovski crystals. Ms. Maurer, wearing an adventurous all-white racer vest, billowing combat pants and cowboy boots, clutched its little encrusted hand to her heart as she sashayed down the catwalk.
So what did it all mean?
The Schiaparelli creative director Daniel Roseberry, a Texan, had threaded ideas of the Wild West and venturing into the unknown throughout the collection. Mr. Roseberry, always one to tap into the fashion house’s surrealist DNA, also explained in his show notes that Giovanni Schiaparelli — the uncle of the house’s founder Elsa Schiaparelli — was an astronomer who named many of the seas and continents on Mars and was also the inventor of the term “Martian.”

0XP0ANF2O3_AB1FT8Y5JEVV9Y1,Lover Boys,By Caitlin Lovinger,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2024-01-22.html,"Jump to: Tricky Clues | Today’s Theme
MONDAY PUZZLE — This grid will make you fancy Jake Halperin, who has constructed nine previous Times puzzles, all with themes. This is his first puzzle for Monday solvers, and it’s a hoot. There are a lot of entries that count as “crunchy” — challenging and thought-provoking, even from the perspective of an experienced solver. (That’s me! I’m visiting from the weekend Wordplay shift while Sam Corbin goes ice fishing in Canada. Keep her in your thoughts.) Also, the theme reminds me of a difficult category in “Connections”; I found all of the entries, but couldn’t place them together without a hint.
Well, honey, sometimes a crossword constructor notices a couple of two-word phrases with an enticing little feature in common. Maybe he or she is lucky enough to find a third example. Then one more comes along, the constructor falls a little bit in love and they make a beautiful puzzle together. It’s perfectly natural. If you still have questions, Sam will be back next week.
I’m kidding! There are four clues in this theme set, each marked with an asterisk, at 20- and 39-Across and at 11- and 29-Down. Three are trivia questions, none are particularly easy and all are clued straightforwardly enough that the whole shebang might have flown right over my head without an explanatory entry, or revealer, at 56-Across.
At 20-Across, the “*British publishing house founded in 1935” is PENGUIN BOOKS. I have a smattering of orange spines on my bookshelf, but I never realized that they’re all fiction — books from this publisher are color-coded, with hot pink for travel, bright red for drama and a variety of other hues for different categories. Pelicans and puffins grace other imprints of this company, and there was even a ptarmigan series of puzzle books in the 1940s.
At 39-Across, the solution to “*Certain ice cream or soap product” is short enough not to look quite like a theme entry: a DOVE BAR. It’s understandable why a sweet-tempered little bird might be chosen as a mascot for dessert: Dove Candies & Ice Cream started in Chicago in 1939, almost two decades before Dove soap was first marketed to women as gentle, moisturizing self-care.

10JHD8DJVM_XP4LJSQ3INUXPP2,What Happens After You Ask if Your Date Is Pro-Choice?,_,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/opinion/politics-religion-dating.html,"A few weeks ago, when I asked Times readers under 30 how politics influences their dating lives, I expected that the subject of reproductive choice would come up pretty frequently. After all, there are few political issues that affect dating and relationships quite as intimately or permanently, and since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, theirs is the first generation of young people since the 1970s who may be living in states where abortion isn’t legal.
Among the more than 200 people who sent email responses to my questionnaire, I got a lot of answers like this one from a 25-year-old New Yorker named Nicole, who described herself as very liberal: “Anti-abortion is my biggest political deal-breaker. If I’m having sex with someone, then I need to know they support my choice to terminate a pregnancy should one occur.” (Some respondents asked that I not use their full names, to maintain their privacy.)
I also talked to Nathan Miller, 23, of Dayton, Ohio, who described himself as very conservative. He told me that abortion is a deeply personal issue for him, because he’s Catholic. But additionally, he later told me over the phone, “I was born prematurely, and so I have pretty strong feelings about how abortion should not be practiced in the late stages of pregnancy.”
Many of those who said this was a line they couldn’t cross were like Nicole and Nathan: They defined themselves as staunchly liberal or conservative, and their abortion views lined up neatly with their political party’s platform on the issue. If they were using dating apps, they said, they would often filter for political beliefs so people from the opposing party wouldn’t even show up in their feeds.
But it wasn’t always that tidy. Quite a few people I spoke to said a shared outlook on abortion rights enabled them to date across the political aisle. There were a smaller number of people in relationships where one person was for abortion rights and the other was against. And I had a long conversation with one woman with anti-abortion views who said that in the past she wouldn’t have seen a future with someone who was an abortion rights proponent, but she is reconsidering that stance.
A woman who asked to go by her middle name, Grace, 24, who lives in a rural part of Virginia and describes herself as a liberal Democrat, said she started dating her libertarian boyfriend, who has voted for Donald Trump, right when Roe was overturned. “We had many, many conversations surrounding our views on abortion, as well as other political issues,” she said. The pair met on Bumble, and even though his profile didn’t list his political views, she suspected he could be a conservative because in one photo he was sporting a mullet. (When I asked if it was an earnest or an ironic mullet, she said, “It was pretty ironic, but he did rock it for a couple months there.”)

117E5GNAA1_VRB3NRYKUAF64FF,Shipping Costs Soar in Wake of Red Sea Attacks,By Stanley ReedReporting from London,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/business/red-sea-attacks-shipping-costs.html,"For about two months, a barrage of missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea by Houthi militants has posed a difficult choice to shipowners using the Suez Canal: risk an airborne strike and pay sharply higher insurance rates, or forgo the canal and take the longer route around Africa, snarling schedules and entailing higher fuel charges.
The attacks — at a choke point that handles 12 percent of global trade, including nearly one-third of the world’s container ship traffic — have already forced some shutdowns at European auto plants and raised fears of a surge in consumer prices.
For shipping companies, costs have already increased. A composite measure of global shipping costs, the Drewry World Container Index, has more than doubled since late last year. The rise is partly tied to a shortage of empty shipping containers, caused by the up to two weeks of additional time for trips going around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.
And using the Red Sea now requires expensive war risk insurance. It’s a specialty that a group of brokers and underwriters centered in London offer.
“We are not fair weather underwriters,” said Munro Anderson, head of operations at Vessel Protect, a marine war risk insurance firm. “We are there for our clients when things are at the most difficult,” he added.
War risk coverage is often required for vessels going into areas designated as high risk by a group of insurers called the Joint War Committee, which consists of underwriters at Lloyds and other organizations. War risk is “an area of business where generally if the underwriting community get it right, they make money out of it,” said Marcus Baker, global head of marine, cargo and logistics at Marsh, an insurance broker in London.

1CUR0T4I7W_9ZRAR1C478K0D18,"Poor Nikki, Poor Us",_,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/opinion/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-trump-biden.html,"Two possible ways of looking at New Hampshire’s vote:
A: Face it, Nikki Haley is toast. No reason for her to continue running.
B: … Except that she’s the only thing saving us from a full year of just Trump vs. Biden.
Of course, the general election in November is beyond critical. Joe Biden’s backers are happy to list his presidential achievements at every opportunity. (“Big infrastructure program” tends to work best.) And he’s a man of fine character. But face it, you’d rather not start reliving the 2020 campaign already.
Right now, we turn our attention to the South Carolina Republican primary — at least there’s going to be one. “New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation,” Haley told her supporters after she came in, well, second, in her one-on-one race against Donald Trump.
Obviously, she had to spin positive. “What a great night,” she said — um, claimed — as Trump beat her by about 11 percentage points in a state with one of the most moderate, independent Republican parties in the country. Haley was upbeat, but the members of the Republican elite who had supported her were grabbing onto life preservers and preparing to jump her sinking ship.
Haley’s even been ditched by Tim Scott — the guy she appointed to the Senate when she was governor of South Carolina. Scott did at least provide us with one interesting topic on primary night. He’d posted pictures that allowed the world to see him kneeling on a beach, proposing to his girlfriend, in the presence, apparently, of a supportive photographer.
The timing, at the very least, was awkward. Love or attention-grabbing? I don’t actually care, but I am happy to continue discussing. Anything but the inevitability of Trump vs. Biden.

1KU09SW2WY_WW4D1PT9H7E826W,"Review: The Philadelphia Orchestra Revels, and Struggles, in Jazz",By Anastasia Tsioulcas,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/music/review-the-philadelphia-orchestra-revels-and-struggles-in-jazz.html,"Much of 20th-century classical music owes a deep thanks to jazz. And while on paper, the Philadelphia Orchestra’s concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night was organized for a festival at the hall, Fall of the Weimar Republic: Dancing on the Precipice, the subtext was American jazz.
All three of the composers on the program (Stravinsky, Weill and Gershwin) loved and, to one extent or another, made references to the style in their music. Although Stravinsky was based in Europe when he premiered “Petrushka” in 1911, he was already a U.S. citizen when he revised this piece in 1947, and had long experimented with incorporating jazz into some of his pieces — and jazz musicians loved him right back. Weill, who left Europe for the United States after the fall of the Weimar Republic, was also steeped in jazz. And Gershwin, of course, wouldn’t be Gershwin without it.
The Philadelphians opened with a magical performance of “Petrushka,” led off by a piquant solo from Patrick Williams, the associate principal flutist. The orchestra staked out rhythmic details with crystalline precision and saw each phrase through with patience and a rich sound. Stravinsky relays the spirit of Petrushka, the folkloric Russian trickster puppet, and the ballet’s tale of a deeply twisted puppet love triangle, with equal parts humor and darkness; the conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the musicians captured the piece’s flickers of light and its swirls of despair.
Weill’s Symphony No. 2, from 1934, is an oddity: structurally and harmonically a mash-up of plush, Mahlerian harmonies, Weill’s acidic stage works, and jazz-inflected plain-spokenness. In its best moments, such as in the dreamy, lonely slow movement — with a trombone solo played gracefully by Nitzan Haroz — this music feels like being inside an Edward Hopper painting.
The giddiest part of the evening was a literally jazzed-up version of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue,” featuring the jazz pianist Marcus Roberts and the members of his trio: the bassist Martin Jaffe and the drummer Jason Marsalis.
Roberts has made a specialty of reworking Gershwin; along with the “Rhapsody,” which he recorded nearly three decades ago, he has toured his version of the Concerto in F. In Tuesday’s account of the “Rhapsody,” the orchestra played its traditional score, but Roberts used the piano solos to introduce extended improvisations for himself, sometimes in flights of Romantic, Rachmaninoff-esque fancy, and occasionally nodding instead to the blues and stride piano. By the jazz standards of 2024, Roberts is conservative, and while he didn’t cast any new light on a cherished standard, his performance was still charming.

1OPZHAJM05_M6Q8YLBFWQDFPL9,How ‘Days of Wine and Roses’ Became Their Passion Project,By Melena Ryzik,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/theater/kelli-ohara-days-of-wine-and-roses-broadway.html,"As origin stories go, the transformation of “Days of Wine and Roses” from a movie into a musical is a straight shot, with a twist. Kelli O’Hara and Adam Guettel had the inkling more than 20 years ago, when she was a Broadway ingénue, working on what became her breakthrough Tony-nominated role in “Light in the Piazza.” Guettel had written the music and lyrics for that musical, which went on to earn him a Tony Award for best score. They talked through their coordinating vision for evolving “Wine and Roses,” the midcentury classic of a romance ruined by addiction. “I think I used the words ‘a weird dark opera,’” O’Hara recalled.
She already had a co-star in mind: Brian d’Arcy James, debonair and wry, like Jack Lemmon was in the 1962 movie, opposite the O’Hara look-alike Lee Remick. The film memorably traced the stuttery arc of alcoholism and recovery, a trajectory now familiar — onscreen and off — but rarely put to song.
Guettel was not only game to try, he eventually brought in the playwright Craig Lucas, the Tony-nominated book writer for “Light in the Piazza.” Both had, separately, been facing their own addictions, in ways that informed, and sometimes overlapped with, the show’s development.
The twist, then, is that, two decades on, the musical about a whiskey-soaked couple has actually arrived on Broadway — it opens on Sunday — starring O’Hara and James, now in the prime of their careers, with gorgeously matched vocals. The production takes pains to show the love that propels their characters’ relationship — however misguided it turns out to be.
“The show sort of has ‘underdog’ written all over it,” Guettel said in a recent phone interview. Friends and associates wondered why he was pursuing it: the material was tragic, the characters weren’t likable, they said. “My response was, ‘Well, Sweeney Todd wasn’t exactly someone you had over for Sunday brunch.’”
“It’s an unlikely project, and everyone stuck with it,” he added. “The thing works, I think, in large part because of that loyalty.”

1TEAT9SSTS_TF7W31XEUCD4H8X,"N.S.A. Buys Americans’ Internet Data Without Warrants, Letter Says","By Charlie SavageCharlie Savage has been writing about national security law and policy, including surveillance and privacy issues, for more than two decades.","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/nsa-internet-privacy-warrant.html,"The National Security Agency buys certain logs related to Americans’ domestic internet activities from commercial data brokers, according to an unclassified letter by the agency.
The letter, addressed to a Democratic senator and obtained by The New York Times, offered few details about the nature of the data other than to stress that it did not include the content of internet communications.
Still, the revelation is the latest disclosure to bring to the fore a legal gray zone: Intelligence and law enforcement agencies sometimes purchase potentially sensitive and revealing domestic data from brokers that would require a court order to acquire directly.
It comes as the Federal Trade Commission has started cracking down on companies that trade in personal location data that was gathered from smartphone apps and sold without people’s knowledge and consent about where it would end up and for what purpose it would be used.
In a letter to the director of national intelligence dated Thursday, the senator, Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, argued that “internet metadata” — logs showing when two computers have communicated, but not the content of any message — “can be equally sensitive” as the location data the F.T.C. is targeting.
He urged intelligence agencies to stop buying internet data about Americans if it was not collected under the standard the F.T.C. has laid out for location records.

24U2XREA4P_C2ACAHT8CBTH4HU,Biden Wasn’t on the Ballot in New Hampshire. He Won Anyway.,By Katie Glueck,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/president-biden-has-won-the-democratic-primary-in-new-hampshire.html,"President Biden’s decisive victory in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary provided him with a dose of good political news amid a season of Democratic anxiety about his campaign.
The symbolic, if largely expected, win on the strength of a write-in campaign comes as Mr. Biden and his party now shift more fully into general-election mode after former President Donald J. Trump triumphed in the state’s Republican primary on Tuesday. He beat Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, though she has vowed to continue her uphill battle against him.
“It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee,” Mr. Biden said in a statement, in which he thanked voters who wrote in his name. “And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher.”
Mr. Biden is expected to campaign this weekend in South Carolina, which he and the Democratic National Committee selected to supplant New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary.
He declined to appear on the ballot in New Hampshire after the Granite State refused to accept its demotion. But his allies in the state eventually stepped in, and the write-in effort, supported by top Democrats there, generated the kind of grass-roots energy for Mr. Biden that has not yet materialized in other states — and that he did not enjoy in New Hampshire’s primary in 2020, when he came in fifth place.
Kathy Sullivan, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party who led a write-in Biden super PAC, said that a strong Biden showing in the state was important “to counteract the narrative that’s out there that he’s not popular” and to signal that he had the support of the Democratic base.

28A8NOT2EH_PQC5SLIJCE9A1UA,"In Winter, California Is for the Birds",By Soumya Karlamangla,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/california-bird-migration.html,"Blackbirds flit between reeds jutting out of the marshy waters. A bald eagle perches in a tree, far above clusters of bobbing ducks. In a mesmerizing display, hundreds of snowy white geese take flight in an undulating swarm that mottles the gray sky.
This is the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, one of a number of spots in California for birds traveling along the Pacific Flyway, a migratory path that stretches from Alaska to the tip of South America. Millions of migratory birds, representing more than 100 species, visit or pass through the Golden State each year.
“If you’re interested in migratory birds for any reason, California is the place to be,” John Eadie, who teaches conservation biology at the University of California, Davis, told me.
The Pacific Flyway is one of four major North American avian migration routes, and California has been a major destination on the Flyway for thousands of years.
Some experts estimate that at the start of the 20th century, 60 million birds were migrating to California’s wetlands each winter. The Central Valley was a hot spot. When the eminent ornithologist Frank Chapman visited Los Banos in 1903, he wrote, “I have never seen birds more abundant.”
But that was before California drained more than 90 percent of its wetlands for agriculture and development, eliminating much of the habitat that the birds relied on. For example, a longtime destination for birds was Tulare Lake, once the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi. By the middle of the 20th century, the lake was all but gone, transformed into an empire of farms (at least until an exceptionally rainy winter comes along.)

2LZ3N7WIR5_PGQEFLXB3I7O847,Jane Goodall Says 2024 is the ‘Most Consequential Voting Year’,By David Gelles,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/climate/jane-goodall-says-2024-is-the-most-consequential-voting-year.html,"When I caught up with Jane Goodall in 2019, she was calling on consumers and businesses to make responsible choices and protect the natural world.
Now she is telling people something much more simple: vote.
The celebrated primatologist thinks governments around the globe are not working hard enough to combat climate change. And in a year when more than 40 countries — including the United States, India and South Africa — will be electing their leaders, Goodall is telling anyone who will listen that the health of Earth itself is on the ballot.
“Half of the population of the planet is going to be voting,” she said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. “This year could be the most consequential voting year in terms of the fate of our planet.”
As my colleague Manuela Andreoni wrote last week, the leaders elected this year will face consequential choices on energy policy, deforestation and emissions reductions. In the United States, Republicans are planning to undo environmental regulations if former president Donald J. Trump wins re-election. In Mexico, the favorite to win the presidency in June is Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist who is now mayor of Mexico City and has vowed to take action to reduce emissions.
Goodall noted that the outcomes of national elections can have profound and immediate impacts. She pointed to Brazil, where two years ago, voters ousted the far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, and brought back President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Overnight, Lula abandoned Bolsonaro’s laissez-faire approach to environmental regulation and redoubled efforts to protect the Amazon rainforest.
Similar swings in policy will reverberate around the world as people go to the polls in the months to come, Goodall said: “Every vote matters, more this year than perhaps any time in history.”

2P5PWVJVY4_7GSCNF5W66U35UQ,"To Slash Carbon Emissions, Colleges Are Digging Really Deep",By Cara Buckley,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/climate/geoexchange-climate-colleges-heat.html,"When administrators at Princeton University decided to cut the carbon emissions that came from heating and cooling their campus, they opted for a method that is gaining popularity among colleges and universities.
They began drilling holes deep into the ground.
The university is using the earth beneath its campus to create a new system that will keep buildings at comfortable temperatures without burning fossil fuels. The multimillion dollar project, using a process known as geoexchange, marks a significant shift in how Princeton gets its energy, and is key to the university’s plan to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2046.
The drilling makes an almighty muddy mess, but when all is said and done, the more than 2,000 boreholes planned for the campus will be undetectable, despite performing an impressive sleight of hand. During hot months, heat drawn from Princeton’s buildings will be stored in thick pipes deep underground until winter, when heat will be drawn back up again.
The change is significant. Since its founding in 1746, Princeton has heated its buildings by burning carbon-based fuels, in the form of firewood, then coal, then fuel oil, then natural gas.
“This moment is singular,” said Ted Borer, director of energy plants at the school. “This is when we’re switching to something that doesn’t require combustion.”

2PKC45LT64_0BR6ZTBFMEUEMDI,"Review: The Composer Joseph Boulogne, a Polymath for All Seasons",By Anastasia Tsioulcas,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/arts/music/review-chevalier-joseph-boulogne.html,"Now, the composer Joseph Boulogne would be hailed as a Renaissance man: artist, athlete, intellectual, soldier. Born in Guadeloupe in 1745, the son of a white French plantation owner and an enslaved mother of Senegalese origin, Boulogne became a virtuoso violinist, prodigious composer, champion fencer, the general of Europe’s first Black regiment and an avid abolitionist.
But Boulogne, a.k.a. the Chevalier de Saint-Georges (and whose last name is sometimes spelled “Bologne”), was a biracial man in a time and place that held little space for him, which means his remarkable life has largely been erased from the historical narrative, though that is beginning to change.
“The Chevalier,” a trim hybrid of theater and music, seeks to revive his reputation. The show was written and directed by Bill Barclay, the artistic director of Music Before 1800. (Barclay also plays Choderlos de Laclos, a Boulogne collaborator and author of the novel “Les Liaisons Dangereuses.”) A single performance at the eye-poppingly opulent United Palace theater in Washington Heights on Sunday served as its New York City premiere; it will be available to stream next month.
“The Chevalier” starts rather unpromisingly. Barclay takes as his point of imaginative departure the few weeks that Boulogne and Mozart were housemates in Paris. Mozart, 11 years younger, grills Boulogne about his life story, and he responds with long, expository answers that hit on major biographical points — more school lecture than beguiling drama.
Soon, though, “The Chevalier” finds a witty, incisive groove. (It’s far more enjoyable than the soapy, forgettable biopic “Chevalier,” from 2022.) Barclay’s setup also dismantles the demeaning idea that Boulogne was “the Black Mozart” — at best, an also-ran in the white classical pantheon. Instead, Barclay frames him as a mentor to Mozart, guiding him through the politics of musical Paris.
The narrative elements of “The Chevalier,” interspersed with musical excerpts, illuminate and contextualize Boulogne’s music in a way that a listener’s chance encounter, on a playlist or in a live concert, might not. In one scene, Boulogne and the French queen Marie Antoinette — whom Boulogne tutored in music — discuss how in a piece for violin and piano, he gives both instruments equal weight, making them peers: the philosophy of a fervent abolitionist, summed up in a sonata.

2X6HZ350PG_AD5V1KBJC3VIZ1C,That Spotify Daylist That Really ‘Gets’ You? It Was Written by A.I.,By Frank Rojas,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/style/spotify-daylists.html,"Have your Sunday scaries ever given way to a “Nervous Ocean Monday Morning”? Does the weekend truly begin on Friday, or on a “Wild and Free Chaotic Thursday Afternoon”? How should one dress for a “Paranormal Dark Cabaret Evening”?
Those odd strings of words are titles of “daylists,” a newish offering from the music-streaming giant Spotify. The feature provides users three new algorithmically generated playlists a day, each with an ultra-specific title that practically begs to be screencapped and posted.
The often baffling titles have recently captured the attention of social media, propelling the service to fresh popularity about four months after its September debut. In post after post, users seem amused by the feature’s ability to see right through them.
“Spotify called me out a little bit with this daylist,” one X user wrote of her own playlist. Its title: “Midwest Emo Flannel Tuesday Early Morning.”
Another described feeling “personally bullied” by Spotify after being served a collection of songs titled “Tailspin Self-Sabotaging Monday Afternoon.”
So who is responsible for the peculiar titles? Spotify users who have been amused by these thrice-daily servings of word salad might be surprised — or, just as likely, not — to learn that the playlist names are ginned up by A.I.

Trump, who is closing in on his party’s presidential nomination at a critical time for the agreement.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, told Republicans privately on Wednesday that the politics of the issue had been complicated by Mr. Trump’s rise and his hostility to the agreement, putting the party “in a quandary,” according to lawmakers who participated in the meeting and described his comments on the condition of anonymity.
The remarks, reported earlier by Punchbowl News, were striking coming from a Republican who has toiled to distance himself and his party from the former president. Mr. McConnell has vociferously backed the proposed border compromise and has been a chief proponent of a stalled effort to send tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, which Republicans have said must be tied to the deal.
Mr. McConnell’s abrupt change in tone reflected the increasingly difficult challenge facing Senate negotiators as they race to finalize immigration legislation that the former president is already actively campaigning against.
Mr. Trump has encouraged Republicans to reject any border deal “unless we get EVERYTHING” the party has demanded, fueling the opposition of Republican lawmakers who have argued that the bipartisan proposal, which includes measures to increase deportations and make it more difficult to claim asylum, doesn’t go far enough.
His opposition has made it more difficult to secure the support of a majority of Senate Republicans for an eventual deal, the threshold that backers say they must meet in order to persuade the House to take it up. Even if it meets that bar in the Senate, Speaker Mike Johnson has cast doubt on the prospect that he would bring it to the floor in the House, where hard right lawmakers are vehemently against it.

39U2JHCVNN_H1IJBCYVE02TZWW,Why India’s New Ram Temple Is So Important,By Alex Travelli and Hari KumarReporting from New Delhi and Ayodhya in India,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/asia/india-ram-temple-ayodhya.html,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a gigantic new temple in the Indian city of Ayodhya on Monday, concluding a long campaign in which Hindu nationalists tore down a centuries-old mosque and replaced it with a structure devoted to the Hindu deity Ram.
Leading up to the temple’s consecration, public spaces around India were thrumming with excitement. Ram is one of the most revered gods among India’s Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of a total population of 1.4 billion. As the hero of the Ramayana epic, he is a king and a paragon of virtue, exiled from his native Ayodhya, who comes home for a jubilant coronation.
Islam does not appear in the Ramayana, having arrived in India only 1,000 years ago. But it is cast as the primary villain in the Hindu-nationalist telling of India’s history. Now, with a kind of spiritual and political homecoming for Mr. Modi, the Ram campaigners have the temple they had sought for decades.
First, the theological reason. Ayodhya is the original home of Ram. Its spot on the Sarayu River was where his just rule began. Diwali, India’s biggest holiday, marks the end of his 14-year ordeal of separation from the place.
Then there’s the more historical answer. In the area around Ayodhya, it was long believed that a Hindu temple had once stood on the land where the Babri Mosque was built in the 1500s. In 1949, soon after the British left and India became independent, Hindu activists smuggled idols representing Ram into the mosque, according to court documents.

3ASTA3BOD4_4IENAR3XV0X8G8T,The Emasculation of Ron DeSantis by the Bully Donald Trump,"By Michael C. Bender and Nicholas NehamasReporting from Manchester, N.H.","Published Jan. 22, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/desantis-trump-humiliation.html,"Donald J. Trump plumbed new depths of degradation in his savage takedown of Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a yearlong campaign of emasculation and humiliation that helped force one of the party’s rising stars out of the presidential race after just one contest and left him to pick up the pieces of his political future.
In front of enormous rally audiences, Mr. Trump painted Mr. DeSantis as a submissive sniveler, insisting that he had cried and begged “on his knees” for an endorsement in the 2018 Florida governor’s race.
In a series of sexually charged attacks, Mr. Trump suggested — without a shred of proof — that Mr. DeSantis wore high heels, that he might be gay and that perhaps he was a pedophile.
He promised that intense national scrutiny would leave Mr. DeSantis whining for “mommy.”
Mr. DeSantis shied from fighting back, which only inflicted more pain on his campaign. The governor had portrayed himself as one of the Republican Party’s fiercest political brawlers, but he pulled his punches in the most important race of his life.
Now he is both defeated and debased. His departure from the race on Sunday was a far fall from grace after opening his campaign as the heir apparent in a Trumpified Republican Party. Rehabilitating that reputation as he considers his next political move will require plenty of repair work with donors and Republican voters, thanks to Mr. Trump’s ruthless parade of insults over 242 days on the campaign trail.
“I don’t care if he’s a Republican,” Mr. Trump said of his belittlement of Mr. DeSantis at a November gathering of the Republican Party of Florida — the governor’s home turf. “We hit him hard, and now he’s like a wounded falling bird from the skies.”

3HLW6YX4SL_CO0K10U0QNX3EG4,"Trump Thanks DeSantis for Endorsement, Calling Him ‘Gracious’","By Michael GoldReporting from Rochester, N.H.","Jan. 21, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/trump-desantis-endorsement.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump on Sunday thanked Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida for endorsing him after suspending his campaign, calling Mr. DeSantis — once a top rival whom Mr. Trump spent significant time bashing in his speeches — “gracious.”
Speaking to a packed house at a historic theater in Rochester, N.H., Mr. Trump called Mr. DeSantis’s wife, Casey, a “really terrific person.” And he said that Mr. DeSantis “ran a really good campaign.”
“I will tell you, it’s not easy,” Mr. Trump said. “They think it’s easy to run this stuff, right? It’s not easy.”
He went on: “But as you know, he left the campaign trail today at 3 p.m.,” adding, “And in so doing, he was very gracious, and he endorsed me, so I appreciate that.”
For months, Mr. Trump made attacking Mr. DeSantis a focal point of his campaign speeches, particularly in Iowa. He bashed Mr. DeSantis as disloyal, called him a poor governor and suggested he was a political opportunist whose positions had shifted as he ran for president.
But after Mr. Trump’s dominant victory in the Iowa caucuses, in which Mr. DeSantis finished a distant second, Mr. Trump shifted his sights to Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who is his closest-polling competitor in the New Hampshire primary race.
In speeches this past week, Mr. Trump mostly swiped at Mr. DeSantis in casual asides that suggested he wasn’t worth the time.
“You notice I haven’t mentioned the name of Ron DeSanctimonious yet,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Manchester on Saturday, using a derisive moniker he bestowed on the Florida governor last year. “I think he’s gone.”
Sunday was perhaps the first day in months that Mr. Trump did not use that nickname. Earlier in the day, he told supporters at his campaign headquarters in Manchester that he would stop using that nickname after Mr. DeSantis left the race.
“Will I be using the name Ron DeSanctimonious?” Mr. Trump said. “I said that name is officially retired.”"
3UR5FXHJ68_NGCDX9P14V11SS6,2 Navy SEALs Declared Dead After Mission to Stop Iranian Weapons,By Yan Zhuang,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/middleeast/missing-us-navy-seals-dead-somalia.html,"The U.S. military said on Sunday that it had declared two Navy SEALs dead after they went missing 10 days ago during an operation at sea to intercept weapons from Iran headed to Houthi fighters.
They are among the first known U.S. fatalities in Washington’s campaign against the Houthis, who have launched dozens of attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November, roiling the global shipping industry.
In recent weeks, the United States and its allies have launched a barrage of strikes on the Houthis inside Yemen, in a bid to deter future attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. The episode involving the SEALs occurred in the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Somalia on Jan. 11. During that nighttime commando mission, according to the U.S. military, American troops boarded a small boat, called a dhow, and seized weapons including Iranian made ballistic-missile and cruise-missile components bound for Yemen.
As the commandos tried to board the dhow in rough seas, one member appeared to slip off the boarding ladder or was swept away by a high wave, one current and one former Pentagon official, who were briefed on the incident, said earlier this month. Another jumped into the water to try to save the first officer, but both disappeared below the waves.
The military conducted what it called was an “expansive” operation to find the two commandos, searching more than 21,000 square miles.
“The search and rescue operation for the two Navy SEALs reported missing during the boarding of an illicit dhow carrying Iranian advanced conventional weapons Jan. 11 concluded and we are now conducting recovery operations,” the U.S. Central Command said in a statement on Sunday. It did not release the names of the deceased.
The mission led to the first seizure by U.S. forces of Iran-supplied weapons since the Houthis started attacking ships in the Red Sea, the U.S. military said in a statement last week. Initial analysis indicated that the same weapons — including warheads for medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles — had been used by the Houthis to launch strikes on vessels in the Red Sea, according to the statement.
The Iran-backed Houthis have said they are protesting the killing of Gazans by Israel and that their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians."
3UULGEMETP_X8UVMAHIJ80YSCI,"Naomi Feil, Who Promoted Empathy as a Response to Dementia, Dies at 91",By Sam Roberts,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/health/naomi-feil-dead.html,"Naomi Feil was only 8 years old when she moved into what was then known as a home for the aged, where her parents worked. Living there until she left for college, she learned firsthand, by trial and error, how to comfort and communicate with older adults.
When she died at 91 on Dec. 24 at her home in Jasper, Ore., she had devoted her entire career to finding ways to comfort disoriented older people and their caregivers.
Her daughter Vicki de Klerk-Rubin said she died of cancer.
Mrs. Feil was a 24-year-old social worker, convening a group of patients diagnosed as “senile psychotic,” when a staff psychologist at the Montefiore Home for the Aged in Cleveland laid the foundation for what would become the method she called validation therapy.
“He taught us when feelings are ‘validated’ they are relieved,” Mrs. Feil explained on the website of her nonprofit Validation Training Institute in Pleasant Hill, Ore. “‘You are validating your residents, helping them release their pain.' When social work students asked me what I was doing, I answered: ‘Validation.’ And so a new way of relating was formed.”
Her method calls for caregivers to empathize with disoriented individuals in an effort to reduce their stress and support their dignity, rather than try to impose reality on them.
“If you validate someone, you accept them where they are and where they’re not,” Mrs. Feil (pronounced “feel”) often said. “If you accept them, then they can accept themselves.”

3Z3YT0OZP7_QDUX2XXKK4M8RED,The Looming Contest Between Two Presidents and Two Americas,"By Peter BakerPeter Baker has covered the past five presidents, including Donald J. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr.","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/two-presidents-two-americas.html,"Each of them has sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, signed bills into law, appointed judges, bartered with foreign leaders and ordered the armed forces into combat. They both know what it is like to be the most powerful person on the planet.
Yet the general election matchup that seems likely after this week’s New Hampshire primary represents more than the first-in-a-century contest between two men who have both lived in the White House. It represents the clash of two presidents of profoundly different countries, the president of Blue America versus the president of Red America.
The looming showdown between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, assuming Nikki Haley cannot pull off a hail-mary surprise, goes beyond the binary liberal-conservative split of two political parties familiar to generations of Americans. It is at least partly about ideology, yes, but also fundamentally about race and religion and culture and economics and democracy and retribution and most of all, perhaps, about identity.
It is about two vastly disparate visions of America led by two presidents who, other than their age and the most recent entry on their résumés, could hardly be more dissimilar. Mr. Biden leads an America that, as he sees it, embraces diversity, democratic institutions and traditional norms, that considers government at its best to be a force for good in society. Mr. Trump leads an America where, in his view, the system has been corrupted by dark conspiracies and the undeserving are favored over hard-working everyday people.
Deep divisions in the United States are not new; indeed, they can be traced back to the Constitutional Convention and the days of John Adams versus Thomas Jefferson. But according to some scholars, they have rarely reached the levels seen today, when Red and Blue Americas are moving farther and farther apart geographically, philosophically, financially, educationally and informationally.
Americans do not just disagree with each other, they live in different realities, each with its own self-reinforcing Internet-and-media ecosphere. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was either an outrageous insurrection in service of an unconstitutional power grab by a proto-fascist or a legitimate protest that may have gotten out of hand but has been exploited by the other side and turned patriots into hostages.

Meeting on Gaza’s Future Yields Division and Confusion,"By Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Hiba Yazbek, Adam Rasgon, Monika Pronczuk and Michael Levenson","Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-eu-postwar.html,"European foreign ministers pressed their Israeli counterpart on Monday to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state, in a meeting that left European diplomats bewildered about postwar Israeli plans for the Gaza Strip and reinforced the deep disconnect between Israel and much of the world.
The two sides appeared to be having two different conversations. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s top diplomat, said after the meeting in Brussels that European nations were resolute that “sustainable, lasting peace” must include Palestinian statehood, an option that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on opposing in recent days.
Israel’s foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, presented to the Europeans a plan involving an artificial island off Gaza’s coast — a plan that did not address the future governance of the territory, according to officials in the meeting.
While the diplomats talked past each other, heavy fighting intensified in southern Gaza on Monday, with medical personnel reporting major exchanges of gunfire and a surge of Israeli tanks and troops into areas around hospitals.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society and the Gazan Health Ministry said many people had been killed or wounded on Monday in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s largest city, without providing specific counts. Nahed Abu Taaema, the director of surgery at Nasser Hospital, the area’s largest hospital, told Al Jazeera in a televised interview that it had received 100 wounded people and 50 bodies.
“Khan Younis is very dangerous now,” Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Red Crescent, said in an interview. “The whole district of Khan Younis is essentially besieged.”

49O7WGG390_12HGTTMQ4H658LP,Gene Therapy Allows an 11-Year-Old Boy to Hear for the First Time,"By Gina KolataGina Kolata visited the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and met with Aissam Dam, his father and the researchers they worked with.","Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/health/deaf-gene-therapy.html,"Aissam Dam, an 11-year-old boy, grew up in a world of profound silence. He was born deaf and had never heard anything. While living in a poor community in Morocco, he expressed himself with a sign language he invented and had no schooling.
Last year, after moving to Spain, his family took him to a hearing specialist, who made a surprising suggestion: Aissam might be eligible for a clinical trial using gene therapy.
On Oct. 4, Aissam was treated at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, becoming the first person to get gene therapy in the United States for congenital deafness. The goal was to provide him with hearing, but the researchers had no idea if the treatment would work or, if it did, how much he would hear.
The treatment was a success, introducing a child who had known nothing of sound to a new world.
“There’s no sound I don’t like,” Aissam said, with the help of interpreters during an interview last week. “They’re all good.”
While hundreds of millions of people in the world live with hearing loss that is defined as disabling, Aissam is among those whose deafness is congenital. His is an extremely rare form, caused by a mutation in a single gene, otoferlin. Otoferlin deafness affects about 200,000 people worldwide.
The goal of the gene therapy is to replace the mutated otoferlin gene in patients’ ears with a functional gene.

49ZZ1UXYYW_1WZE83QAKUFLTWP,Man Found Guilty of Murder in Wrong-Driveway Shooting in Upstate N.Y.,"By Jesse McKinleyReporting from the Washington County Courthouse in Fort Edward, N.Y.","Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/wrong-driveway-shooting-ny.html,"A man from upstate New York was found guilty on Tuesday of second-degree murder for fatally shooting a young woman who was riding in a car that had mistakenly driven up his driveway.
On the night of April 15, 2023, the defendant, Kevin Monahan, fired two shots with a 20-gauge shotgun, one of which struck a car carrying Kaylin Gillis, 20, who was hit in the neck and died soon after. Ms. Gillis and a group of six friends had been trying to find a friend’s house for a Saturday night party when they drove up Mr. Monahan’s half-mile-long driveway in the rural town of Hebron, N.Y., about 55 miles north of Albany.
During the two-week trial, Mr. Monahan, 66, testified that the fatal shot was an accident, with the gun spontaneously firing after he tripped on his porch. He said he had initially fired a warning shot after seeing a caravan of two cars and a motorcycle arrive at his house at night.
He was described by his lawyers as “an old man” who had been asleep and had been terrified that “a group of marauders” had come to attack him and his wife, Jinx, who was hiding inside, also armed with a gun.
But the authorities had expressed doubts about the level of danger Mr. Monahan might have felt that night, noting that the vehicles were turning around to leave. And prosecutors had expressed deep skepticism about his argument, saying in a closing statement on Tuesday that Mr. Monahan had acted with animus and callous disregard for the people who had stumbled onto his property, “interrupting his night” and “not leaving fast enough.”
“Kevin Monahan did not act out of fear,” said Christian P. Morris, the first assistant district attorney for Washington County, speaking to the jury before a nearly full courtroom. “He acted out of a baser emotion than that: He acted out of anger.”

4HYELK3GM4_CLIKXY54M6HA9N1,Biden Administration Pauses Approvals of New Gas Export Terminals,By Lisa Friedman,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/climate/biden-lng-pause-climate.html,"President Biden on Friday paused the permitting process for new liquefied natural gas export facilities in order to analyze their impact on climate change, the economy and national security.
“In every corner of the country and the world, people are suffering the devastating toll of climate change,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “This pause on new L.N.G. approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time.”
The move could spell trouble for what would be the largest export terminal in the country, a $10 billion proposed project in Louisiana that has drawn scrutiny for its potential environmental impact.
Mr. Biden’s election-year decision is viewed as a win for climate activists who have pressed the administration to curb fossil fuels at a time when greenhouse gas emissions must fall rapidly to stave off climate catastrophe.
Gas, which is primarily composed of methane, is cleaner than coal when it is burned. But methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas in the short term, compared with carbon dioxide. And it can leak anywhere along the supply chain, from the production wellhead to processing plants to the stovetop. The process of liquefying gas to transport it is incredibly energy intensive as well, creating yet more emissions.

4IP3YIODRS_24SAUJIA16DVCVX,The Lost DeSantis Moment,By Nate Cohn,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/upshot/desantis-trump-republicans.html,"Ron DeSantis began the 2024 campaign as a formidable candidate, with early poll numbers that rivaled or even exceeded the likes of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama.
In the end, that early strength meant only that he had more room to fall.
There are countless reasons Mr. DeSantis fell apart and ultimately ended his campaign Sunday — including that his opponent proved once again to be a juggernaut. Perhaps Mr. DeSantis might have won the nomination in most other years, if he hadn’t been going against a former president.
But rather than dwell on his losing campaign, it’s worth returning to his apparent strength at the outset — that brief moment when Mr. DeSantis, or at least the idea of Mr. DeSantis, routinely led Mr. Trump in high-quality head-to-head polls.
In the eight years since Donald J. Trump won the Republican nomination, this was the only moment when Republican voters appeared willing to go a different direction. Mr. DeSantis didn’t capitalize on the moment, but nonetheless it’s the only glimpse we’ve had into the post-Trump Republican Party. We saw something that might bring it about, and we saw what it might look like.
Over the last eight years, Mr. Trump has said and done countless things that might have doomed any other politician. He’s been impeached twice. He encouraged what turned into the Jan. 6 riot. He’s been charged with multiple federal crimes. None of it really made any difference in his support.
That is, until November 2022. The disappointing Republican showing in the midterms damaged Mr. Trump in the polls, and Mr. DeSantis surged to take a clear lead in head-to-head polls that lasted for months.

4LVW31JNLV_8R9UNS63CIKIZ6Y,Mayor Adams’s Feud With City Council Takes Petty Turn Over Chairs,By Dana Rubinstein,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/eric-adams-feud-chairs.html,"Inside New York’s majestic City Hall, the first-floor rotunda has served as a Switzerland of sorts — neutral ground amid the perennial battles between the mayor’s office and the City Council, which share the building.
But on Tuesday, the office of Mayor Eric Adams made an incursion.
As the Council speaker was about to begin a news conference with faith leaders on a matter upsetting to the mayor, his deputy chief of staff suddenly appeared in the rotunda, along with an aide wheeling a hand truck.
Menashe Shapiro, the deputy chief of staff, ordered several reporters seated there for the news conference to stand. He was taking their chairs away.
To close observers of the administration, Mr. Shapiro’s actions seemed familiar, an outgrowth of how the mayor treats people or things he does not like. In this case, it was the subject of the news conference: the Council speaker, Adrienne Adams, announcing her intention to override the mayor’s veto of two criminal justice bills that he asserts would jeopardize public safety if they became law.
Earlier this week, the mayor’s schools chancellor, David C. Banks, did not invite certain major publications to an important speech of his on antisemitism and Islamophobia in schools, purportedly because of space constraints.
Earlier this month, the mayor’s Police Department ejected reporters from their own storied press room at Police Headquarters, relocating them to a trailer outside. Reporters from major media outlets covering City Hall have also been warned that some desks in Room 9, the communal press room, may be taken away.

It’s an old truism that Americans don’t care about foreign policy when it’s time to cast their ballots. But with the crisis in Gaza, a prolonged conflict in Ukraine and a trade war brewing with China, could 2024 be the year that American voters finally care about what’s going on beyond the water’s edge?
The “Matter of Opinion” hosts take a look at the importance (or lack thereof) of foreign affairs in American elections. Plus, Lydia Polgreen recommends a film Oscar nominations were wrong to skip.

4NMOJS86YW_SC84MAM13BF49Q0,Bounty Hunter Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison for Kidnapping Woman,By Jesus Jiménez,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/bounty-hunter-kidnapping-sentencing.html,"A bounty hunter convicted of kidnapping a woman from her home in Missouri and trying to take her to Louisiana was sentenced on Wednesday to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said.
Judge Ronnie L. White of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis sentenced the man, Wayne D. Lozier Jr., 45, of the New Orleans area, after a jury found Mr. Lozier guilty in September of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping.
According to an indictment in the case, on May 9, 2019, Mr. Lozier and his partner, Jody L. Sullivan, traveled to St. Peters, Mo., to illegally remove a woman, who was not publicly identified, from her home and take her to Louisiana. Mr. Lozier and Ms. Sullivan had been hired by a bail bond company in Louisiana to find the woman and apprehend her, but they were not licensed by the state of Missouri to work as surety recovery agents, prosecutors said.
The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana had an arrest warrant out for the woman for two misdemeanor offenses, according to prosecutors.
Bounty hunters, sometimes referred to as bail enforcement agents, can work in certain states as long as they are licensed within that state.
Mr. Lozier told the woman he did not need permission to enter her home, and he handcuffed the woman in her basement, according to the indictment. Mr. Lozier and Ms. Sullivan then kidnapped the woman and took her away in an S.U.V., prosecutors said.

4VFA6TM9E8_WBH1MO8BKENFT0H,"Naomi Watts, Demi Moore and Diane Lane Swan at the Plaza","By Melissa GuerreroMelissa Guerrero reported from the Museum of Modern Art and the Plaza Hotel for Out & About, a column that covers the events where notable, powerful and influential figures gather. Plus the outfits.","Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/fashion/feud-capote-swans-plaza.html,"On Tuesday night, actresses, producers and television executives, many draped in black and white feathered gowns, trickled into the Plaza Hotel to celebrate the premiere of FX’s “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans,” a limited series starting on Jan. 31.
The show focuses on the schism between the novelist Truman Capote, played by Tom Hollander, and the coterie of New York City socialites he befriended. The women severed ties with Capote after a fictionalized excerpt from his unfinished novel was published in Esquire magazine in 1975, which aired some of their closest-held secrets.
Some of the society fixtures, whom Capote referred to as his “swans,” are played by a distinguished cast: Barbara “Babe” Paley (Naomi Watts), Nancy “Slim” Keith (Diane Lane), C. Z. Guest (Chloë Sevigny), Lee Radziwill (Calista Flockhart), Joanne Carson (Molly Ringwald) and Ann Woodward (Demi Moore). The series is based on “Capote’s Women,” a 2021 book by Laurence Leamer.
Around 10 p.m., following a screening at the Museum of Modern Art, more than 400 guests filled the gold-trimmed Grand Ballroom of the Plaza for a party inspired by the lavish Black and White Ball, which Capote hosted in 1966 in the same room, and is fictionalized in the series. The Times’s Charlotte Curtis reported that “international Who’s Who of notables” attended including Frank Sinatra, Mia Farrow and the Maharani of Jaipur.
As was the case nearly 60 years ago, white and transparent balloons hung from the ceiling near the chandelier, and public figures filled the room. Bethenny Frankel, the reality star, swayed on the dance floor. Nearby, Mr. Hollander chatted with Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney. Ms. Moore posed for photos with Mr. Murphy. Zac Posen, who worked on the costumes for the Black and White Ball depicted on the show, sat next to the singer Debbie Harry. Emma Roberts, among the first to arrive, mingled with guests.

53YTVBACDK_A3V6HI9VFV86NHS,Ukraine Searches for Answers on Russian Plane Crash,"By Andrew E. Kramer and Maria VarenikovaReporting from Kyiv, Ukraine","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/europe/ukraine-russia-plane-crash.html,"Ukrainian officials pressed their efforts on Thursday to uncover the details of a deadly plane crash over the border in Russia, asking for patience from citizens while they investigated Moscow’s claims that Ukraine had shot down a Russian military aircraft carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for his country’s intelligence agency to determine what had happened and for an international investigation into the crash, while also accusing Russia of engaging in wartime propaganda over the episode.
The crash, and Russia’s claims that Ukraine had downed a plane with its own soldiers aboard, poses a vexing challenge for a government in Kyiv trying to brace its citizens for a third year of war. Ukraine is on the defensive on the battlefield and contemplating a new mobilization that would likely be domestically unpopular, while striving daily to shore up critically needed Western support.
The plane went down in the Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine, killing all onboard, the Russian Ministry of Defense and the regional governor said on Wednesday. The ministry said that the plane had been carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were to be released in a prisoner exchange. The Russian claims could not be independently verified.
The New York Times
The cause of the crash remains unknown, though Ukrainian officials have not denied shooting down the aircraft. They say they cannot confirm that Ukrainian soldiers on their way to a prisoner exchange were aboard the plane.

56D32IA5OK_EBZ0FUK2S6GU0TA,Wednesday Briefing,By Natasha Frost,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/briefing/buffer-zone-israel-nato-sweden.html,"The Israeli military suffered its deadliest day of the Gaza ground invasion on Monday, announcing that 24 soldiers had been killed, about 20 of them in an explosion inside the territory near the Israeli border.
The blast occurred after Gazan militants fired toward a tank guarding an Israeli unit that had been setting explosives inside Palestinian buildings on the border in central Gaza with the intention of demolishing them, the Israeli military said. In the firefight, the explosives went off, killing many of the soldiers inside, the military said.
Israel wants to demolish many Palestinian buildings close to the border to create what it describes as a border-long “security zone” of up to roughly six-tenths of a mile to make attacks by Hamas less likely, according to officials. That would effectively reduce the size of Gaza, a process the U.S. opposes.
Criticism: To Palestinians, the practice is cruel and would keep Gazans from being able to return to their homes. Critics say the practice is part of a wider disregard for civilian housing and property. The majority of Gaza’s buildings have been damaged during the war, according to U.N. estimates, and more than 25,000 Gazans have been killed, according to Gazan officials.
In other news from the war:
More than half a million people in Gaza face “catastrophic hunger,” a U.N. aid agency said, and it called for a critical increase in aid as the “risk of famine grows.”
A U.N. office said Israel’s treatment of thousands of Palestinian detainees, who were held in “horrific” conditions and in some cases freed wearing only diapers, might amount to torture.
A Lebanese Australian journalist at Australia’s public broadcaster shared a Human Rights Watch post that was critical of Israel. A day later, she was forced to leave her role.

5ABEKLYRDN_2V94OHC111P6B83,Friday Briefing,By Natasha Frost,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/briefing/gaza-future-north-korea-economy.html,"What could happen to Gaza in the aftermath of Israel’s war? A clear line between war and peace in Gaza is deeply implausible, with Israeli forces likely to come in and out of the territory for a long time, and the future is murky at best, Steven Erlanger, our chief diplomatic correspondent, writes in an analysis.
Any sustainable settlement would most likely require a regional deal involving countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar and led by the U.S., Israel’s most trusted ally. Such a settlement would require new leadership both in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as a deal to release Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees.
President Biden has said that he would like a “revitalized Palestinian Authority” eventually running Gaza as a stage toward an eventual “two-state solution” — an independent Palestine, largely demilitarized, alongside Israel and committed to a lasting peace. The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has expressed strong opposition to a Palestinian state.
Netanyahu: The Israeli leader’s vision is unclear. He continues to insist that Hamas will be “destroyed” and all the hostages released, but those goals seem more contradictory as casualties on both sides mount. He has also denied wanting to reoccupy Gaza for the long run, but insisted that Israel retain security control over both Gaza and the West Bank.
In other news from the war:
Families of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza protested yesterday at a border crossing in a bid to to block aid from entering the territory.
A strike hit a crowd of people who were waiting for humanitarian aid trucks in Gaza City, killing multiple people and injuring scores of others, the Gazan health authorities said.
William Burns, the C.I.A. director, will travel to Europe to meet with Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials for talks aimed at the release of hostages held in Gaza and a longer cease-fire.

5BU40S2ZA7_DF4E3ABO9W7PNK3,"Utility Must Pay $85 Million to People Affected by Oregon Wildfires, Jury Rules",By Johnny Diaz,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/oregon-wildfires-award.html,"A jury in Portland, Ore., awarded $85 million on Tuesday to nine people who had losses from wildfires that devastated communities and burned millions of acres in September 2020. The verdict is the latest development against the electric utility company PacifiCorp over its responsibility for the fires.
Last June, a jury found PacifiCorp liable for damages for not cutting power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from the then governor’s chief of staff and top fire officials, according to The Associated Press. The jury awarded about $90 million to 17 plaintiffs in the case, and found PacifiCorp also liable to a broader class of thousands of homeowners affected by the fires.
The verdict on Tuesday, which came after a six-day trial this month, was the first case focused “exclusively on individuals’ damages” after the class action verdict last year, according to lawyers for the nine plaintiffs. Additional trials were expected in February and April.
The utility company could face billions of dollars in liability to the homeowners.
PacifiCorp, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said in a statement that it expects post-verdict rulings and insurance payments to bring its share of the verdict to just under $79 million, and that it plans to appeal the case.
“The growing threat of wildfires to communities and businesses is bigger than any one company or industry,” PacifiCorp said in a statement.
Tuesday’s verdict included more than $6 million in economic and $56 million in noneconomic damages, plus additional punitive damages, Nick Rosinia, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in a statement.
The wildfires in September 2020 killed at least nine people and burned more than five million acres in three states. Exceptionally dry conditions, combined with unusually strong and hot east winds, caused the wildfires to spiral out of control.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that a Portland jury heard three days of testimony from the victims of the fires, which began on Sept. 7, 2020. One man described how he and his wife jumped into a river near their property while the flames enveloped their home. Another survivor, a 101-year-old World War II veteran, said he lost his home and decades of memories, according to Mr. Rosinia.
The next damages trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 26 and will seek compensation for another nine people affected by the fires as well as for Upward Bound Camp, a program for people with special needs that was also destroyed by the flames.
Last month, PacifiCorp agreed to pay $299 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 463 plaintiffs who were harmed by separate wildfires in southwest Oregon over Labor Day in 2020. That blaze, called the Archie Creek Fire, burned more than 125,500 acres of forest area, according to the Oregon Forest Resources Institute.
The company also announced last month that it had reached a $250 million settlement with 10 timber companies to resolve a lawsuit related to the Archie Creek Fire."
5CBCUP6UG7_H7H30GRRBE8CEMK,‘Barbie’ Is Adapted? ‘Maestro’ Original? Let’s Fix the Screenplay Categories.,By Alissa Wilkinson,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/movies/barbie-screenplay.html,"In the midst of the squabbles about actors and directors, there’s always at least one screenplay to debate when Oscar nominations are announced. Last year, in fact, there were two, and I regularly get collared by people wondering: What in the world were “Glass Onion” and “Top Gun: Maverick” doing in the best adapted screenplay bucket? Adapted from what? Was there some secret book about fighter pilots or tech mogul whodunits they’d missed?
Nope. There’s also no previous story about a Barbie who starts thinking about death and sets out on an existential journey. But that didn’t keep the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the industry organization that gives out the Oscars, from kicking “Barbie” into the adapted category.
Judd Apatow declared the reclassification of “Barbie,” the biggest movie of 2023 any way you slice it, “insulting” to its writers, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Moving “Barbie” from the best original screenplay category — where it was the probable winner over films like “The Holdovers” and “Past Lives” — to adapted changed its Oscar chances. Now, alongside a slate that includes the juggernaut “Oppenheimer,” it’s a horse race. I don’t know what’s going to win.
The academy posts some of its Oscar rules publicly, but not the ones that distinguish original screenplays from adapted ones. The Writers Guild of America, the union to which Hollywood’s scripters belong, does. And for the most part, judging from Oscar history, they’re in sync. Sequels, remakes and screenplays based on underlying material (including nonfiction, like a biography, that contains a narrative) are considered “nonoriginal,” and in awards contexts are usually classed as adaptations. Original screenplays either are not based on material (generally as stipulated in the writer’s contract), or they’re based on a nonfiction book that doesn’t have a narrative, like a study of sailing ships in the 19th century.
Here’s the thing: according to the guild, “Barbie” is an original screenplay, but the academy disagreed. The academy also reclassified “Origin,” which didn’t receive a nomination but is an interesting case in this argument. Ava DuVernay crafted a screenplay that’s sort of based on Isabel Wilkerson’s nonfiction book “Caste,” but is also a movie about Wilkerson (played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) researching and writing “Caste.” It’s a nesting doll of a screenplay, and the guild deemed it an original, presumably because the screenplay has a narrative the book lacks. The academy begged to differ. (An even more extreme example is Charlie Kaufman’s screenplay for “Adaptation,” a movie about a man named Charlie Kaufman adapting Susan Orlean’s book “The Orchid Thief,” and which was brain-twistingly categorized as adapted at the 2003 Oscars. It lost, to “The Pianist.”)

5DFG1EXEFE_ULVLQQ3N2NFUDBI,Ghostwriters Emerge From the Shadows,By Elizabeth A. Harris and Alexandra Alter,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/books/ghostwriters-conference.html,"Ghostwriting is a secretive profession. It’s long been maintained that a good ghost writer, like a well-behaved child in an extreme version of the old proverb, should be neither seen nor heard.
So it was unusual for a group of around 140 ghostwriters to gather, as they did in Manhattan on Monday, to schmooze and celebrate their work with awards, panel discussions and keynote speeches. The one-day conference, called the Gathering of the Ghosts, took place at a moment when ghostwriting is in high demand and gaining recognition as an art form of its own, after years of operating largely in the shadows.
“There’s great value in building this community because of the nature of what we do,” said Daniel Paisner, who hosts a podcast about ghostwriting called “As Told To” and has collaborated on 17 New York Times best-sellers. “We do it in a vacuum, sitting alone in our underwear in our offices. We don’t get out much. So I think it’s helpful to be able to compare notes.”
Held at the New York Academy of Medicine, in a room lined with old, leather-bound medical books overlooking a snowy Central Park, the event included panels about finding the right publisher for a project, whether A.I. might render ghostwriters irrelevant and conversations about how much a ghostwriter can charge (the consensus: more). The profession has a history of being undervalued, and one panelist advised everyone in the audience to double their rates and add 20 percent.
“Is it good to be a ghostwriter?” Madeleine Morel, an agent who specializes in matchmaking book projects with ghostwriters, said at the event. “I’ll paraphrase Dickens: It’s the best of times and the worst of times. It’s the best of times because there’s never been so much work out there. It’s the worst of times because it’s become so competitive.”

5HTHYQ91Q5_36OK65AJG8W0LXW,Jamie Dimon Reshuffles Management Team at JPMorgan Chase,By Rob Copeland,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-reshuffle.html,"JPMorgan Chase is reshuffling its leadership team, a move that many consider a succession plan even though its longtime chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has signaled he is staying put.
Mr. Dimon, 67, has been head of what is now the largest bank in the United States for nearly two decades, and repeatedly brushed off suggestions that he might step aside. The specter of his eventual departure, however, hangs over JPMorgan as outsiders question whether he might run for public office or serve in a presidential administration.
In a memo to employees Thursday, JPMorgan muddied the matter further. Daniel Pinto, the bank’s chief operating officer and Mr. Dimon’s deputy, is surrendering his title as head of the corporate and investment bank. Mr. Dimon said he and Mr. Pinto would “continue to jointly manage the company.”
Mr. Pinto’s former responsibilities will be split by Jennifer Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh, who will serve as co-chief executives of an expanded commercial and investment bank that brings several lines of the company into one unit. Other banks, including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, have also simplified their operations in an effort to focus on their highest-earning units, particularly after last spring’s regional banking crisis hammered lenders that had expanded too quickly.
JPMorgan is an enviable position compared with its peers. Its shares are up 23 percent over the past year, while the average bank stock has fallen. The bank continues to vacuum up customer deposits, and swooped in to acquire ailing First Republic shortly after Mr. Dimon coordinated a government-backed rescue of the teetering lender.
That stability has not just kept Mr. Dimon in his role for longer than his rivals — he’s the only chief executive of a major bank from the 2008 financial crisis still in his post — but has also helped quell potential disquiet among those hoping to succeed him.

5PWUWFCHV7_GUEM1UT45G5O5YP,Manhattan’s District Attorney Is Quietly Preparing for a Trump Trial,"By Ben Protess, Jonah E. Bromwich and William K. Rashbaum","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial-stormy-daniels.html,"Federal prosecutors have accused Donald J. Trump of plotting to subvert American democracy and mishandling nuclear secrets. But with those cases in limbo, state prosecutors in Manhattan are gearing up as though they will be the first to try the former president on criminal charges — for covering up a potential sex scandal.
The Manhattan district attorney’s office has begun to approach witnesses to prepare them for trial, including Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former fixer, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He and at least two others involved in buying a porn star’s silence about her story of a tryst with Mr. Trump are expected to meet with prosecutors in the coming weeks.
With the potential trial drawing near, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has also added one of his most experienced trial lawyers to the team assigned to prosecute Mr. Trump.
And in recent public appearances, Mr. Bragg has presented the loftiest possible conception of the case, casting it as a clear-cut instance of election interference, in which a candidate defrauded the American people to win the White House in 2016. Mr. Trump did so, the district attorney argues, by concealing an illegal payoff to the porn star, thus hiding damaging information from voters just days before they headed to the polls.
“The case — the core of it — is not money for sex,” Mr. Bragg said in a radio interview last month, objecting to news outlets’ longstanding characterization of it as a hush-money case. “We would say it’s about conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up. That’s the heart of the case.”
With this rebranding, Mr. Bragg is trying to amplify the importance of his charges and draw a parallel with the highly consequential federal case in Washington, D.C., in which Mr. Trump is accused of seeking to overturn the 2020 election. That trial is scheduled to begin on March 4, three weeks before Mr. Bragg’s case, but appeals could push it into late spring or summer.

On Monday, he took his penitence tour to a new level, declaring himself “aspirationally Jewish” after a visit to the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz in southern Poland, where he lit a candle in memory of the millions of Jews murdered in the Holocaust.
Mr. Musk, the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, stirred outrage — and an exodus of advertisers — in November when he endorsed an antisemitic post on X as “the actual truth.” The post accused Jewish communities of pushing “hatred against whites” and supporting the immigration of “hordes of minorities.”
The White House denounced Mr. Musk for “abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate.”
He quickly apologized for his intervention, saying “it might be literally the worst and dumbest post I’ve ever done.” He has been scrambling since to calm the outcry and halt the flight of advertisers.
But his atonement has come in fits and starts. After apologizing for giving a thumbs up to an antisemitic theory about Jews conspiring to dilute the white population, he used an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times to tell unhappy advertisers to get lost in vulgar terms and accused them of trying to blackmail him. He also threatened to take legal action against the Anti-Defamation League, a rights group that has complained about the rise in antisemitism on X.
He is now back to presenting his less pugnacious, more understanding side.
After a visit to Israel in late November, during which he toured a kibbutz where dozens of people were killed during the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, Mr. Musk on Monday toured the site of what once was the Auschwitz concentration camp with his 3-year-old son. He was escorted by Rabbi Menachem Margolin, the chairman and founder of the European Jewish Association.

650DQ2L8L3_C9VAU0S06IKZ4PI,Arsonist Sentenced to Death for Killing 36 People in 2019 Kyoto Studio Fire,By Claire Moses,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/japan-kyoto-animation-arson-death-penalty.html,"A Japanese judge sentenced to death a man who killed 36 people in an arson attack at an anime studio in Kyoto in 2019, one of the country’s deadliest attacks in decades, after he was found guilty of murder on Thursday.
Shinji Aoba, the defendant, was charged with murder in 2020, a year after setting fire to the studio of Kyoto Animation. He had been severely burned in the fire himself and was unconscious for weeks after, leading the authorities to wait to charge him until after he had sufficiently recovered.
Mr. Aoba had a history of mental illness. The Kyoto District Court said it found him mentally capable to face punishment for his crimes, The Associated Press reported.
In July 2019, Mr. Aoba barged into the studio with gasoline, sprayed it with force and set it on fire with a gas lighter, the judge said Thursday, according to local reports. Mr. Aoba did so, the judge added, because of a grudge — he was convinced that the studio had stolen a novel from him.
The arson shocked Japan, where violent attacks are rare. Mr. Aoba had purchased about 10 gallons of gasoline at a service station near the studio before the attack, according to police reports at the time, and screamed “Die!” as he set fire to the building, which was quickly engulfed in flames. Many of the victims, almost two-thirds of them women, died from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The judge, Keisuke Masuda, said on Thursday that Mr. Aoba had previously planned an attack on a train station, but had abandoned the idea. “In the midst of his poverty and isolation, he tried to commit a mass murder at Omiya Station in Saitama City one month before the incident,” Judge Masuda said, according to NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster.
The number of victims was the highest for any criminal trial in more than 30 years in the country, according to NHK.
Kyoto Animation, known by fans as KyoAni, has long been a fixture in the anime world. It’s known for “slice of life” stories and detailed scenery. Most of the studio’s production had taken place in the building that was ablaze.
“My heart aches as I think of my colleagues who were killed and damaged,” Hideaki Hatta, the president of the studio, said in a statement on Thursday. “We have many young creators who joined after the case,” he said. “We will keep producing great works as much as possible.”"
6GB3KYHYQO_T1XQSFVQPB7E66H,F.A.A. Tells Airlines to Check Panels on a Second Boeing Plane,By Mark WalkerReporting from Washington,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/business/faa-boeing-737-900er-door-plug.html,"The Federal Aviation Administration recommended late Sunday night that airlines begin visual inspections of door plugs installed on Boeing 737-900ER planes, the second Boeing model to come under scrutiny this month.
The F.A.A. said the plane had the same door plug design as the company’s newer 737 Max 9. The agency grounded about 170 Max 9 jets after a door panel blew off one of the planes shortly after an Alaska Airlines flight left Portland, Ore., on Jan. 5, forcing an emergency landing.
The door plugs are placed as a panel where an emergency door would otherwise be if a plane was configured with more seats.
After grounding the Max 9 planes, the F.A.A. subsequently announced it was investigating whether Boeing failed to ensure that the jet was safe and conformed to the design approved by the agency.
The F.A.A. said on Sunday that the door plug on the 737-900ER, an earlier-generation model that is not part of Boeing’s Max line, had not yet been a problem.
“As an added layer of safety, the Federal Aviation Administration is recommending that operators of Boeing 737-900ER aircraft visually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,” the agency said in a statement.
The F.A.A. is recommending that the airlines using the 737-900ER immediately inspect the four locations used to secure the door plug to the airframe. The 737-900ER has over 11 million hours of operation and about four million flight cycles, according to the F.A.A. Boeing delivered about 500 of the planes globally between 2007 and 2019, though not all of them have door plugs.
“We fully support the F.A.A. and our customers in this action,” Boeing said in a statement.
Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which both use the 737-900ER, said in statements that they had already started inspecting their planes of that model. Delta Air Lines, which also flies the aircraft, said it had “elected to take proactive measures to inspect our 737-900ER fleet.” None of the airlines expected any disruptions to their operations.
The episode involving the Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 flight this month did not result in any serious injuries, but it could have been far more serious if the plane had been at its cruising altitude. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the episode in hopes of learning what caused the door plug to blow off the plane.
In the meantime, the F.A.A. recently ordered an initial round of inspections of 40 of the grounded Max 9 planes as it works to finalize inspection instructions for the aircraft. The agency announced last week that those inspections had been completed and that it would review the data from them."

Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.
Former President Donald Trump won the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday, taking 54.3 percent of the vote to Nikki Haley’s 43.3 percent.
Jimmy Kimmel kicked off Wednesday night’s show by congratulating Trump on his win. “No applause?” he joked.
“He beat Nikki Haley by double digits. He’s also leading Nikki Haley by double digits in felony charges, 91 to zero.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“Trump defeated Nikki Haley 54 to 43. It’s the very first time he’s ever been happy to see a woman in her 40s.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
“Trump cruised to victory, and just like most cruises, half the people partied while the other half felt really sick.” — JIMMY FALLON
“Meanwhile, before the votes even came in, Nikki Haley made it clear she wasn’t dropping out. Yep, her campaign released a memo that said, ‘We aren’t going anywhere.’ I’m not sure that slogan is going to work: ‘Nikki Haley: We aren’t going anywhere.’” — JIMMY FALLON
“But Nikki Haley has no plans to stop; she will not drop out. Last night, she told supporters that the race is far from over, she still has literally dozens of states to lose.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“That’s right, Former President Trump won yesterday’s New Hampshire primary, while Nikki Haley finished second. Haley gave a concession speech, while Trump gave a concussion speech.” — SETH MEYERS
“Trump was visibly upset Nikki Haley gave a speech as if she won. He reportedly spent the night seething about it, and I don’t blame him. Pretending you won when you actually lost, it’s his thing; not cool, Nikki.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“[imitating Trump] How dare she act like she won when she lost? I mean, what kind of maniac pretends they won when they really lost?” — STEPHEN COLBERT
Stephen Colbert offered Gen Z a quick pep talk on the merits of giving blood amid a drop in donations.
Justin Timberlake will pop by to see Jimmy Fallon on Thursday’s “Tonight Show.”

6IKQCITWRS_TLV55SP1DDF7ZAI,Haley on DeSantis’s Withdrawal: ‘May the Best Woman Win’,"By Anjali Huynh and Chris CameronAnjali Huynh reported from Manchester, N.H. Chris Cameron reported from Seabrook, N.H.","Jan. 21, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/haley-desantis-reaction.html,"Nikki Haley entered a seafood shack in Seabrook, N.H., on Sunday afternoon with some news for the crowd: Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, was no longer running for president.
“We just heard that Ron DeSantis has dropped out of the race,” Ms. Haley, the former South Carolina governor, said to cheers from the several dozen attendees. “And I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race, he’s been a good governor and we wish him well.”
“Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” she continued, holding up two fingers, to more cheers. She added: “For now, I’ll leave you with this: May the best woman win.”
Ms. Haley and her allies have long sought to frame the presidential race as being between herself and former President Donald J. Trump, even as she finished third in the Iowa caucuses. With Mr. DeSantis now out of the race, that argument became much more salient — though recent polling averages put her 15 percentage points behind Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.
She furthered that argument in a statement issued by her campaign, in which she noted that “only one state has voted” and that “half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not.” (Mr. Trump received 51 percent of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.)
“Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road,” Ms. Haley said in the statement. “New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday.”
Ms. Haley also committed to staying in the race through the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday on March 5, regardless of what happens in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
Rather than deliver remarks in Seabrook, as she has at recent retail stops, Ms. Haley went straight to taking selfies and speaking one-on-one with supporters — a small victory lap, of sorts.
Speaking with CNN’s Dana Bash after the event, Ms. Haley escalated her attacks against Mr. Trump, whom she has hit harder in recent days, as well as President Biden. She said they were “equally bad” for the country.
“If either one of them was good, I wouldn’t be running,” she added.
Ms. Haley told CNN that Mr. DeSantis, who endorsed Mr. Trump in his announcement dropping out of the race, had not called to inform her of his departure.
She also said that Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina did not tell her that he would endorse Mr. Trump earlier this week — though Mr. Scott told CNN that he had texted her the day before endorsing Mr. Trump. “He didn’t tell me that he was going to do this,” Ms. Haley said."
6XV1XWAOG2_B4OV3KAKJQLG6MV,Airlines Hoping for More Boeing Jets Could Be Waiting Awhile,By Sydney Ember and Santul Nerkar,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/business/boeing-production-alaska-airlines.html,"Boeing hoped 2024 would be the year it would significantly increase production of its popular Max jets. But less than a month into the year, the company is struggling to reassure airline customers that it will still be able to deliver on its promises.
That’s because the Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that it would limit the plane maker’s output until it was confident in Boeing’s quality control practices. On Jan. 5, a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 body shortly after takeoff, terrifying passengers on an Alaska Airlines flight and forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at Portland International Airport in Oregon. Almost immediately, the F.A.A. grounded some Max 9s.
Since then, details have emerged about the jet’s production at Boeing’s facility in Renton, Wash., that have intensified scrutiny of the company’s quality control. Boeing workers opened and then reinstalled the panel about a month before the plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines.
The directive is another setback for Boeing, which had been planning to increase production of its Max plane series to more than 500 this year, from about 400 last year. It also planned to add another assembly line at a factory in Everett, Wash., a major Boeing production hub north of Seattle.
As part of the F.A.A.’s announcement on Wednesday, it also approved inspection and maintenance procedures for the Max 9. Airlines can return the jets to service once they have followed those instructions. United Airlines said on Thursday that it could resume flying some of those planes as soon as Friday.
The move is another potential blow to airlines. Even though demand for flights came roaring back after pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions eased, the airlines have not been able to take full advantage of that demand. The companies have not been able to buy enough planes or hire enough pilots, flight attendants and other workers they need to operate flights. A surge in the cost of jet fuel after Russia invaded Ukraine also hurt profits.

6ZNG0BWMZB_THZHLR7I4T0CD7P,Truman Capote Cashed In on His Friends’ Secrets. It Cost Him Everything.,"By Ginia BellafanteGinia Bellafante writes the Big City column, a weekly commentary on the politics, culture and life of New York City.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/nyregion/truman-capote-feud-swans-fx.html,"In 1979, five years before he died and four years after his exile from the Upper East Side’s social cockpit, Truman Capote appeared on a talk show as a friend of the common man. The host, David Susskind, remained unpersuaded. “You are always on people’s yachts” and in “great mansions on Long Island,” he pointed out. “The thing in Spain with the Pamplona bull runs.” Come on.
Capote gave up, reverting to a defense of his affection for the moneyed class. It had come to define him as much as his written work, the output of which had notoriously stalled after the publication of “In Cold Blood” in 1966. “I like rich people,” Capote said, “because they aren’t always trying to borrow something from me.”
The joke sprang from the underbrush, inadvertently poignant. If Capote was not on loan, he was there — at the most rarefied parties and dining halls, as the favored guest at Cap Ferrat — to be bartered. The terms of the exchange were relatively simple: his wit and company, his brocaded stories and dazzlingly foul mouth, traded for the devotion of the thin, beautiful, unhappily married women, up and down Fifth Avenue, who were still wearing white gloves past Stonewall and Woodstock, past Watergate and the fall of Saigon.
This world and the writer’s place in it has come up for re-evaluation with the arrival of “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans,” an eight-part television series on FX. The impressive cast includes Naomi Watts, Demi Moore and Diane Lane as women who contained their subversions to bed, sleeping with men who were not their husbands, and to lunch with Truman — “Tru” — Manhattan’s most celebrated gay confidant.
Whatever implicit contract existed among them was violated to very unhappy consequence in 1975, with the publication of Capote’s “La Côte Basque, 1965” in Esquire magazine. A short story that bears almost no adherence to the form, it was meant to exist as a chapter of “Answered Prayers,” the novel that famously went unfinished.
At just under 12,000 words, the story is all chatter, plotless and full of vulgar cruelties. Capote had betrayed his friends who, perhaps naïvely, did not think of themselves as material. And he had done it in service of a piece of literature that in language and sentiment reads like a set of story-meeting notes for an episode of “As the World Turns.”

70VRKHL4FZ_75UDJKZETCWKLVS,The Worst Masterpiece: ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ at 100,"By Ethan IversonEthan Iverson is a pianist, composer and writer.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/music/george-gershwin-rhapsody-in-blue.html,"The work is a guaranteed success. After it is over, audience members leap out of their seats for a standing ovation.
Such has been the response to “Rhapsody in Blue” ever since its premiere 100 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1924. George Gershwin had been asked by the conductor Paul Whiteman to supply a “jazz concerto” for the event An Experiment in Modern Music at Aeolian Hall in Manhattan, and the landscape of American music hasn’t been the same since.
Thanks to the centennial, you’re likely to come across a lot of “Rhapsody” performances this year — not that the anniversary makes much difference, because that’s always the case. Indeed, “Rhapsody” is one of the most frequently programmed pieces in the symphonic repertoire by an American composer.
Beyond the concert stage, the work’s themes are heard in movies and television, and are piped into the cabins of United Airlines flights. It has even functioned as propaganda: At the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, during the height of the Cold War, the American contingent brought out 84 pianists to perform excerpts from the “Rhapsody,” accompanied by a battalion of dancers.
As with many other classical hits, casual listeners might be surprised to learn that the familiar melodies are part of a much longer composition. First, George Gershwin wrote a substantial two-piano score. The composer Ferde Grofé orchestrated the premiere for Whiteman’s idiosyncratic jazz band, including banjo. Later on, Grofé did two more orchestrations, in 1926 and 1942; the last one was for full symphonic forces and is the version most often heard today. Gershwin himself never fussed with making an authoritative edition, going so far as to suggest four possible cuts in the score.

71V2DZBR85_5WHZQRLY1IPI3FK,U.S. Expands Attacks on Houthis With New Strikes in Yemen,By Eric SchmittReporting from Washington,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/houthi-yemen-strikes.html,"The United States and Britain carried out large-scale military strikes on Monday against eight sites in Yemen controlled by Houthi militants, according to the two countries. The strikes signaled that the Biden administration intends to wage a sustained and, at least for now, open-ended campaign against the Iran-backed group that has disrupted traffic in vital international sea lanes.
The strikes — the eighth in nearly two weeks — hit multiple targets at each site, and were bigger and broader than a recent series of more limited attacks against individual Houthi missiles that the Americans said popped up on short notice. Those missiles were hit before they could be fired at ships in the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden.
But the planned nighttime strikes on Monday, which hit radars, as well as drone and missile sites and underground weapons storage bunkers, were smaller than the first retaliatory salvos on Jan. 11. Those hit more than 60 targets in nearly 30 sites across Yemen in an expansion of the conflict in the Middle East that the Biden administration had sought to avoid.
This middle ground reflects the administration’s attempt to chip away at the Houthis’ ability to menace merchant ships and military vessels but not hit so hard as to kill large numbers of Houthi fighters and commanders, and potentially unleash even more mayhem into a region already teetering on the edge of a wider war.
“Let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threat,” the American and British governments said in a statement.
They were joined in the statement by the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Bahrain which, as they did in the Jan. 11 strikes, also participated, providing logistics, intelligence and other support, according to U.S. officials.

Trump has cast over the Republican Party.
Brushing aside Nikki Haley a little over a week after he steamrolled her and Ron DeSantis in Iowa, Mr. Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate who was not a White House incumbent to carry the nation’s first two contests. His winning margin of 11 percentage points in moderate New Hampshire demonstrated his ironclad control of the party’s hard-right base and set him on what could very well be a short march to the nomination.
For Ms. Haley, the former South Carolina governor, it was a disappointing finish in a state she had poured considerable resources into carrying. Her efforts to cobble together a coalition of independents and anti-Trump Republicans, with support from the state’s popular governor, were no match for Mr. Trump’s legions of loyalists.
Even though Ms. Haley is vowing to fight on, the difficult terrain ahead in South Carolina means that this first-in-the-nation primary could turn out to be the last.
Here are five takeaways.
In 2016, Mr. Trump’s win in New Hampshire put him on a path to the nomination and ultimately the presidency.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cited NATO’s eastward spread as one of his reasons for invading Ukraine. But instead of curbing it, Europe’s largest ground war since NATO was formed 74 years ago has revived and returned it to its Cold War roots as a war-fighting alliance.
Despite dwindling military supplies and competing crises, NATO members have vowed to sustain support for Ukraine. But military aid from the United States remains stalled in Congress and current and former European diplomats have expressed growing concern that a second Trump presidency could mean the abandonment of the government in Kyiv along with a gutting of the alliance.
Here’s a guide to NATO and how its role has shifted since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine:
The mutual-defense alliance was established in 1949, after World War II, by the United States, Canada and 10 European countries.
The treaty for which the alliance is named has 14 articles by which all NATO members must abide. The most important is Article 5, which declares that an attack against one member state is an attack against them all.

7GZN8JPXME_WVK1ZJHEH06BQ4J,A Shocking Confession Upends the Case of a Fatal Fire in South Africa,By Lynsey Chutel and John EligonReporting from Johannesburg,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/africa/south-africa-fire-johannesburg.html,"It was time, the witness said, to tell the whole truth about the awful things he had done.
Moments before testifying this week at an inquiry into one of South Africa’s deadliest residential fires, he pulled an investigator aside and said he needed to change his story. He was the one, he said, who had started the Aug. 31 blaze that engulfed a five-story building in downtown Johannesburg.
Sobbing as he spoke, Sithembiso Mdlalose, 30, told a room full of stunned listeners that he had strangled a man on the ground floor of the overcrowded, derelict dwelling and set the body alight.
After that confession at the inquiry, Mr. Mdlalose was arrested by the police, who are running a parallel criminal investigation into the fire, and charged with 76 counts of murder. But as he made his first criminal court appearance on Thursday, there remained plenty of confusion and mystery around this shocking twist in a tragedy that has attracted international attention to the awful living conditions of thousands of people in buildings across one of Africa’s wealthiest cities.
While Mr. Mdlalose’s confession at the inquiry is inadmissible, prosecutors said, his confession will bolster the criminal investigation.
Mr. Mdlalose, who said he lived in the building, seemed to appear out of the blue to the lawyers and activists working with some of the building’s former residents, many of whom largely said they did not know him. He was one of many witnesses set to speak at the inquiry, which began in October.
Before his appearance at the inquiry, he gave a handwritten statement to the police that stopped far short of what he ultimately admitted to. In his statement, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Mdlalose confessed that he was one of the many criminals who sold drugs in the building, but suggested that others had killed the initial victim and set him on fire.

7I7ZR2IO8B_UC4WBNHUNUJ7KSW,Israel Tries to Rebut Genocide Charge by Declassifying Cabinet Decisions,"By Patrick KingsleyTo report this article, Patrick Kingsley reviewed Israel and South Africa’s submissions to the International Court of Justice and spoke to legal experts.","Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-genocide-defense-declassified.html,"Israel has declassified more than 30 secret orders made by government and military leaders, which it says rebut the charge that it committed genocide in Gaza, and instead show Israeli efforts to diminish deaths among Palestinian civilians.
The release of the documents, copies of which were reviewed by The New York Times, follows a petition to the International Court of Justice by South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide. Much of South Africa’s case hinges on inflammatory public statements made by Israeli leaders that it says are proof of intent to commit genocide.
Part of Israel’s defense is to prove that whatever politicians may have said in public was overruled by executive decisions and official orders from Israel’s war cabinet and its military’s high command.
The court, the U.N.’s highest judicial body, began hearing arguments in the case this month, and is expected to provide an initial response to South Africa’s petition — in which it could call for a provisional cease-fire — as soon as Friday.
Since October, Israel has pounded Gaza in a campaign that has killed more than 25,000 Gazans, or roughly one in 100 residents of the territory, according to Gazan health officials; displaced nearly two million people; and damaged the majority of the buildings, according to the U.N. The campaign is a response to a Hamas-led assault that led to the deaths and abductions of roughly 1,400 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.

7IGLCTG4B5_3GGBEL4LNB49W8C,"Rep. Bowman Faulted in Capitol False Alarm, but Spared Inquiry",By Nicholas Fandos,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/nyregion/jamaal-bowman-fire-alarm-ethics.html,"The House Ethics Committee on Thursday dropped its investigation into Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York for pulling a House fire alarm, but released a report that found his explanations “less than credible and otherwise misleading.”
Mr. Bowman, a Democrat, has repeatedly said that he pulled the alarm last September because he was “rushing to make a vote” to avert a government shutdown and “mistakenly” believed it would open a locked door. The false alarm prompted an evacuation of one of the main House office buildings.
But the 16-page report included previously unreleased encrypted text messages between the congressman and his staff that appeared to show he was not, in fact, on his way to vote at the time, but to an emergency meeting of the Democratic caucus.
And ethics investigators said video showed Mr. Bowman “casually” walking away “without ever looking back to determine whether the alarm facilitated the opening of the emergency doors.” He did not alert anyone to the false alarm, despite passing several police officers.
“In addition to providing statements that have been viewed by the O.C.E. as being less than credible, Mr. Bowman failed to take appropriate steps to mitigate the risk of unnecessary harm,” the investigators wrote, referring to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which produced the report for the committee.
The sharply worded findings offered the fullest public account to date of an embarrassing episode that has dogged Mr. Bowman for months as he seeks re-election. But the report was unlikely to produce any new legal or congressional jeopardy.

He did not stay long.
Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.
The first reports of the Hamas attack were already fusing with rumors, sweeping into social media feeds and private chat groups in an emotionally charged and largely unverified mass. Mr. Schatz, one of the best-known disinformation researchers and fact checkers in Israel, rushed back home to his computer, knowing he had little time to stop the false claims from metastasizing.
In a way, he was already too late.
Since the initial attack, disinformation watchdogs in the region have been overwhelmed by unfounded narratives, manipulated media and conspiracy theories. The content has spread in enormous volumes at great speed: video game clips and old news reports masquerading as current footage, attempts to disavow authentic photos as artificially generated, inaccurate translations and false accusations distributed in multiple languages.
In the fog of war, rumors and lies are especially dangerous, capable of taking on the veneer of fact and affecting decisions. Fact checkers and misinformation analysts are meant to be part of the defense, offering a cleareyed examination of the available evidence.
The work, however, is hard even for seasoned professionals, who faced pushback while fighting false and misleading narratives across multiple elections and a pandemic. In the Mideast, where fact-checking websites and disinformation research are relatively nascent and often poorly funded, the challenges have been compounded.

7ML73G438M_SEVYCH25NEFOLKT,A New Concern on the Ukrainian Battlefield: North Korea’s Latest Missiles,"By David E. Sanger, Julian E. Barnes and Eric SchmittDavid E. Sanger reported from Berlin, and Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt from Washington.","Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/russia-ukraine-north-korea.html,"When Russia turned to Kim Jong-un of North Korea to help it through its war with Ukraine, it came with a big shopping list that included a million rounds of artillery to shoot at Ukrainian troops dug into trenches across the south and east, and dozens of North Korea’s newest, barely tested missiles.
Now those weapons are beginning to show up, deeply worrying U.S. and European officials who say they fear the North’s ammunition could prove important on the battlefield at a huge moment of vulnerability for Ukraine.
While many of the North Korean artillery rounds are proving to be duds — some appear to have been manufactured decades ago — they are giving the Russians something to fire at Ukrainian forces, who are rationing their own dwindling supply. European nations promised Ukraine a huge resupply, but for now seem to have been able to scrounge up only 300,000 or so artillery shells.
But it is the missiles that raise the most concern, from the Pentagon to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. In interviews, a range of officials said they fear the Russians hope to use missiles to overwhelm Western air defenses. While so far the number of missiles transferred is small, likely fewer than 50, U.S. and European officials believe there could be far more to come.
And unlike with the artillery rounds, North Korea is not shipping its older equipment. An analysis by Conflict Armament Research, an organization that has documented the arms used in Russia’s war in Ukraine, showed the missiles being provided to Russia are more recent in their design. And U.S. officials say the missiles are proving as accurate as Russia’s home-built equipment. Three barrages of North Korean-made missiles targeted Ukrainian positions around the new year, American officials say, and they believe more were used on the battlefield on Sunday.
In South Korea, officials and analysts say the Ukraine war is giving the North something it desperately needs: a testing ground to see how its new missile arsenal, designed for a conflict with South Korea and the United States, fares against Western-designed air defenses.

7MRPQ1MQ96_ANCE601NF0XW70D,Haley Declares Race ‘Far From Over’ After Losing to Trump in New Hampshire,"By Jazmine Ulloa and Chris CameronJazmine Ulloa reported from Concord, N.H., and Chris Cameron reported from Manchester, N.H.","Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-loss-speech.html,"Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, on Tuesday defied calls to drop out of the race for the Republican nomination, vowing to fight on after a second straight defeat at the hands of former President Donald J. Trump.
In rousing remarks, Ms. Haley painted a picture of a country and a world in disarray, casting herself as the choice for voters dissatisfied with both President Biden and Mr. Trump. She set up an epic showdown with Mr. Trump in South Carolina, where she is lagging far behind Mr. Trump in polls despite a home-state advantage.
“New Hampshire is first in the nation — it is not the last in the nation,” she said as a loud wave of cheers and applause broke out across the room. She added that the race was “far from over.”
She added, “We’re going home to South Carolina.”
Borrowing signature lines from her stump speeches, Ms. Haley, a United Nations ambassador under Mr. Trump, noted how far she had come since the race opened, when she was polling at just over 2 percent. She congratulated Mr. Trump on what she described as a well-earned victory and declared that politics was “not personal” to her, but she also called herself “a fighter.”
“And I’m scrappy — and now we’re the last ones standing next to Donald Trump,” she added. Painting herself as an outsider, despite her insider résumé, she pledged to take on Mr. Trump and the political class behind him. She also took shots at the media, who she said saw his glide to the nomination as a foregone conclusion.
With the new urgency she has been flashing on the trail in the past week, Ms. Haley turned up the heat on the former president, the dominant front-runner in the Republican race, who is fighting 91 felony charges. Another Trump presidency would be just as bad for the country as another four years of Mr. Biden, she said.

7V5YYVGOOI_UO5RCRPTGQAZVAQ,"Ewa Podles, a Rare Contralto With Sweeping Range, Dies at 71",By Zachary Woolfe,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/arts/music/ewa-podles-dead.html,"Ewa Podles, the Polish contralto whose darkly molten, three-octave-plus voice and commanding presence made her a favorite of opera connoisseurs, died on Friday in Warsaw. She was 71.
Her death, in a hospice center, was confirmed by her stepdaughter, Ania Marchwinska, who said the cause was lung cancer.
Aficionados embraced Ms. Podles (whose full name was pronounced AE-vuh PODE-lesh) not just for her exciting performances, but also for how unusual she was: True contraltos — the lowest-lying female voice type, deeper than a mezzo-soprano — are hardly common.
Developing the low chest register as much as the rest of the voice, a contralto is “like an alto in the lower range, like a soprano on top,” Ms. Podles told The New York Times in 1998. And she fit that bill: Though her tone was melancholically hooded and brooding, with a cavernous chest register, she also had the high notes and agility to excel at Handel and Rossini’s most demandingly florid roles.
“It’s a very rare voice,” Ms. Podles said of her instrument.
And she wielded it with utter authority. “Never, for even one moment of one recitative in any opera, was she anything but riveting in her conviction,” the conductor Will Crutchfield, who collaborated with her several times, said in a phone interview. “She had something to say.”

7WNYGOJYLD_ONHNAGP2CBER5FM,How Did New Hampshire Shift to Blue-ish?,_,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/opinion/new-hampshire-haley-trump.html,"Donald Trump won Iowa and wants to win New Hampshire and seal up the nomination. Nikki Haley wants to come from behind, win New Hampshire, and gain some momentum before heading to her home state of South Carolina.
What matters to people in New Hampshire? How has the state’s Republican Party, which gets a major say in the politics of the rest of the country, changed over the last decade with Mr. Trump in the mix? New Hampshire is a very different state from Iowa: In New England, they’re less interested in abortion, and more interested in the kinds of working-class populism once espoused by a figure like Pat Buchanan and now personified (if not exemplified) by Donald Trump. So I spoke with Dante Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire and an expert in presidential primaries and New Hampshire politics.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity and is part of an Opinion Q. and A. series exploring modern conservatism today, its influence in society and politics and how and why it differs (and doesn’t) from the conservative movement that most Americans thought they knew.
Jane Coaston: We spoke just before the Iowa caucus and you said that you believed that Nikki Haley was in a strong second place in New Hampshire after Chris Christie’s exit from the race. What did you make of the Iowa results?
Dante Scala: Haley will have to improve her performance markedly among New Hampshire conservatives in order to succeed here. The split between moderates and conservatives out in Iowa regarding Haley was eye-popping.
[Before the caucuses, Mr. Scala also mentioned that if Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also dropped out before the New Hampshire primary, as has since happened, it could be a problem for Ms. Haley in New Hampshire.]

84QDIOGCAS_OBYSSRUAS7AARCW,Barricaded Highways and a Deadly Incident as French Farmers Rise Up,By Roger CohenReporting from Paris,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 25, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/europe/france-farmers-barricades-protests.html,"A car plowed into a barrier set up by protesting French farmers early on Tuesday, killing a woman and her daughter and injuring her husband, as France faced growing rural fury at perceived overregulation and increased diesel fuel prices.
The new government headed by Gabriel Attal, the 34-year-old prime minister, faced its first crisis with barricades spreading across highways throughout the southwest of the country. The protests mirrored similar demonstrations in Germany, driven by a sense of marginalization among farmers that the extreme right has been quick to exploit.
“This is the France of the forgotten,” Jordan Bardella, the president of the anti-immigrant National Rally party, said during a visit to the Bordeaux region on Saturday. “The fight for agriculture is also the fight against rural effacement, the cry of a French people who do not want to die.”
Rural discontent has also contributed to a surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD, and the Dutch Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders. A political, economic and cultural abyss between the populations of major cities and what the French call “the periphery” has been a factor in the rise of anti-establishment, nationalist movements from the United States to Western Europe.
At one of the French barriers, in the southwestern Ariège region, a car carrying three foreigners hurtled through a wall of packed straw and into a family of cattle farmers from the village of Saint-Félix-de-Tournegat, according to local authorities. A woman died instantly, and her 12-year-old daughter passed away early Wednesday in hospital. Her husband is in critical condition, the Ariège prefecture said.

86E2TAR7AT_JBSR5QHZ9XHIVKK,When Master Photographers Spin the Color Wheel,By Arthur Lubow,"Published Jan. 24, 2024Updated Jan. 25, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/design/saul-leiter-garry-winogrand-photography.html,"When Saul Leiter began shooting Kodachrome slides in New York in the late 1940s, color was scorned by most serious photographers, who thought of it as a hobby for vacationing dads or the commercial domain of magazines and advertising agencies.
But Leiter, who died in 2013, was a lifelong painter as well as a photographer. As displayed in “Saul Leiter: Centennial,” an exhibition of photographs and paintings at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in Manhattan, closing on Feb. 10, and a new monograph, “Saul Leiter: The Centennial Retrospective,” he took advantage of everyday filters — a window smeared by raindrops or humidity, the flurries of snowflakes, reflections in glass — to fragment reality into compositions that recalled paintings by the Abstractionists who lived near his place on East 10th Street.
Although his pioneering color pictures are what he is best known for today, Leiter employed similar strategies in his masterly black-and-white photography. He might devote two-thirds or more of the frame to a monochromatic block, inviting you to look as closely at the shadowed street in the (black-and-white) “Walking” (c. 1955) or the eponymous black fabric in the (color) “Canopy, New York” (1958), as you would at the subtle gradations of tone in a painting by Robert Ryman or Ad Reinhardt.
He loved women, and he loved the color red. To judge from his photographs, you’d be sure to come across a woman toting a red umbrella, if you ventured out in a snowstorm in New York in the ’50s. Part of his fondness for red may derive from Kodachrome’s exceptional capacity to capture its vibrancy. But there was a severe drawback to color photography at the time. Because prints were unstable and expensive, the slides were typically viewed as projections on walls for friends and colleagues.

86G2KFA0BG_4X0TL2KP3NRY3T5,U.S. Strikes 3 Sites in Iraq Linked to Militias Blamed for Base Attack,By Eric Schmitt,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/middleeast/us-strikes-sites-iraq.html,"The United States on Tuesday carried out military strikes against three facilities in western Iraq associated with Iran-linked militias that American officials say attacked a major base in Iraq on Saturday, according to the Pentagon’s Central Command, injuring at least four U.S. service members.
The American strikes near Iraq’s border with Syria on Tuesday hit headquarters, training locations and storage areas for rockets, missiles and drones belonging to the Kataib Hezbollah militia and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq, according to Central Command.
“These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against U.S. and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said in a statement.
The attack against Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Saturday was the latest and the most serious of about 151 such rocket and missile strikes directed at U.S. troops based in Iraq and Syria since Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza started.
At least 10 rockets and seven short-range ballistic missiles were fired in a single barrage at the base, with two missiles making it through Patriot and air defense systems, in the most successful attack the militias had carried out so far. At least four U.S. service members have been treated for traumatic brain injuries, but all have since returned to duty, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
The attack on Saturday underscored how the region has been pulled into a broader conflict. In another spillover from the war in Gaza, the United States and Britain carried out large-scale military strikes on Monday against eight sites in Yemen controlled by Houthi militants.

87YCRBOZF0_V18PW7S3ABM4D9S,Trump’s Win Adds to Air of Inevitability as Haley Sharpens Edge,"By Shane GoldmacherReporting from Manchester, N.H.","Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/trump-win-new-hampshire-haley.html,"Donald J. Trump’s victory in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday provided him the second of an opening pair of wins in the Republican nomination fight that accelerated his push for the party to coalesce behind him and deepened questions about the path forward for Nikki Haley, his lone remaining rival.
The defeat of Ms. Haley in New Hampshire came eight days after the former president trounced Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida so thoroughly in Iowa that it drove Mr. DeSantis from the race. Mr. Trump and his allies have turned his twin early wins into a milestone — declaring, after just the first two contests, that the party needs to unite behind him now to prepare for a rematch in November between Mr. Trump and President Biden.
No Republican candidate has ever won the first two states and then not ultimately secured the presidential nomination, a fact that Mr. Trump himself noted in his victory speech in Nashua, N.H.
“When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they’ve never had a loss — there’s never been — so we’re not going to be the first, I can tell you,” Mr. Trump told the crowd.
Regardless of what comes next, the win on Tuesday sealed Mr. Trump’s status as the party’s standard-bearer in the history books: Before Mr. Trump, the only Republicans who have ever won both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary have been sitting presidents.
The race was called on Tuesday night by The Associated Press the moment the last polls closed, sapping any drama from the outcome. Minutes later, Ms. Haley raced to speak first at her own election party in Concord, N.H., forcefully pressing her case that nominating Mr. Trump would be tantamount to conceding the general election to Democrats.

8A3I4D4T06_WWD2TMPOKJ9JQW2,"Haley Super PAC Says It Raised $50.1 Million, Eclipsing Trump",By Rebecca Davis O’Brien and Jonathan Swan,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/haley-fundraising-trump.html,"The main super PAC backing Nikki Haley said Thursday that it had raised $50.1 million in the second half of 2023, a hefty sum that eclipses the amount brought in by the leading super PAC backing former President Donald J. Trump.
The group, SFA Fund Inc., provided the figure to The New York Times but did not offer additional details about its finances. Detailed filings are due with the Federal Election Commission on Jan. 31, and will lay out all of the fund-raising and spending the group did between July 1 and Dec. 31.
The Trump-aligned super PAC, MAGA Inc., said Thursday that it had raised more than $46 million in the second half of 2023, and that it had ended the year with just over $23 million cash on hand.
In all of 2023, SFA Fund Inc. — short for Stand for America Fund — raised $68.9 million. It is not clear how much the group has on hand, but records show the group has spent heavily: $61.7 million on independent expenditures — primarily advertising costs — in the second half of the year.
While the haul by Ms. Haley’s super PAC shows how donors flocked to her as the Republican field consolidated late last year, it is unclear if she can sustain that financial strength in a two-person race against Mr. Trump. He beat her handily in the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire this month, but she has vowed to continue her campaign for the nomination.
In a statement, Taylor Budowich, the chief executive of MAGA Inc., did not mention Ms. Haley’s continued efforts.
“The general election has already started,” he said. “President Trump has a clear path to win, but Democrats are spending more money and they are doing it earlier than ever before.”
One of the biggest donors to MAGA Inc. was Timothy Mellon, a transportation executive and an heir to the Mellon family banking fortune, who gave $10 million, a representative for MAGA Inc. said.
Mr. Mellon has supported Mr. Trump’s re-election efforts in the past, but last spring he gave $5 million to a super PAC backing Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was then running for president as a Democrat and is now pursuing an independent bid.

8NBZRHVAL7_3DNQTX1X233OBDZ,Federal Trade Commission Launches Inquiry Into A.I. Deals by Tech Giants,By David McCabeReporting from Washington,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/ftc-ai-microsoft-amazon-google.html,"The Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry on Thursday into the multibillion-dollar investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Google in the artificial intelligence start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic, broadening the regulator’s efforts to corral the power the tech giants can have over A.I.
These deals have allowed the big companies to form deep ties with their smaller rivals while dodging most government scrutiny. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, while Amazon and Google have each committed billions of dollars to Anthropic, another leading A.I. start-up.
Regulators have typically focused on bringing antitrust lawsuits against deals where the tech giants are buying rivals outright or using acquisitions to expand into new businesses, leading to increased prices for consumers and other harm, and have not regularly challenged stakes that the companies buy in start-ups. The F.T.C.’s inquiry will examine how these investment deals alter the competitive landscape and could inform any investigations by federal antitrust regulators into whether the deals have broken laws.
The F.T.C. said it would ask Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Anthropic to describe their influence over their partners and how they worked together to make decisions. The agency also said it would demand that they provide any internal documents that could shed light on the deals and their potential impact on competition.
“Our study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition,” Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, said in a statement.
The inquiry is the agency’s first major effort to understand the way the companies are using partnerships and investments to rapidly expand their influence in A.I. Ms. Khan, who was appointed in 2021, has long pushed to modernize the way the government deploys antitrust law. That has included her agency’s filing an antitrust suit against Amazon last year accusing it of artificially raising prices and asking courts to embrace more novel theories about how corporations can harm the economy.

8W8IUNP1JV_JDSE5TVJDMWSMZ3,Court Finds Trudeau Overreached by Using Emergency Law to End Blockade,"By Ian Austen and Vjosa IsaiIan Austen reported from Ottawa, Vjosa Isai from Toronto","Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/canada/trudeau-emergencies-act-trucker-convoy.html,"A Canadian court found that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s use of the country’s Emergencies Act to end a truck convoy protest that had paralyzed the capital, Ottawa, two years ago was an unjustified infringement of civil rights, including the protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and, in some instances, the freedom of expression as well.
The Federal Court of Canada decision also found that the freezing of bank accounts of people linked to the protest was similarly unjustified, but it dismissed arguments that the government had violated a variety of other rights, including those linked to peaceful assembly.
The decision, which will be appealed, was the first instance of a court delivering a rebuke to Mr. Trudeau over his handling of the protest, which began on Jan. 28, 2022, and continued for much of February, inspiring copycat protests in other provinces, including Alberta and British Columbia, as well as in France.
The protests in Ottawa, which were initially incited by a Covid vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers, rendered most of the city’s downtown streets impassable, clogging them with parked trucks. Six days after Mr. Trudeau’s government introduced the emergency powers, an enormous force of police officers from across the country finished clearing the streets. About 230 people were arrested during the protest.
In his decision, Judge Richard G. Mosley wrote that while the protests “reflected an unacceptable breakdown of public order,” the government did not meet various tests for using the emergency law, which expanded police powers to, among other things, compel tow truck drivers to help clear the streets.
Judge Mosley said that evidence from the two civil rights groups that brought the lawsuit against the government persuaded him that the “decision to issue the proclamation does not bear the hallmarks of reasonableness — justification, transparency and intelligibility — and was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints.”

9E763S56WJ_PDTCVD44LV59WKN,"‘Tired of Being Quiet,’ Sarah Jarosz Tests the Mainstream",By Jon Pareles,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/music/sarah-jarosz-polaroid-lovers.html,"In modern Nashville, songwriting is often a matter of professionalized co-writing: planned, mix-and-match collaborations by appointment, musicians sharing a room to come up with sturdy material.
It’s a method that Sarah Jarosz had largely shied away from until she made her seventh studio album, “Polaroid Lovers.” The LP, arriving Friday, includes songs she wrote with behind-the-scenes Nashville stalwarts including Jon Randall, Natalie Hemby and the album’s producer, Daniel Tashian, who worked on the country-psychedelia fusion of Kacey Musgraves’s “Golden Hour.”
On “Polaroid Lovers,” Jarosz reaches toward a broader audience while still maintaining her individuality. The songs are more plugged in, muscular and reverberant than her past albums, which were intimate and largely acoustic. But her particular perspective — at once clearheaded, thoughtful, vulnerable and open to desire — comes through.
The first song Jarosz wrote with Tashian was “Take the High Road,” with a chiming chorus that declares, “It won’t be the easy way/Saying what you want to say.” In a video interview from her home in Nashville, with string instruments hanging on the wall behind her, Jarosz said that the song’s lyrics “are almost a thesis for the whole album. You know, ‘I’m tired of being quiet — time to face up to the fear.’”
Jarosz, 32, is a luminary in acoustic Americana, where bluegrass, folk, jazz and chamber music mingle with pop and rock. Born in Austin, Texas, and raised in Wimberley, a small town nearby, Jarosz emerged as a teenage bluegrass prodigy, playing mandolin, guitar, banjo and the instrument she considers her “soul mate”: the octave mandolin, pitched an octave below the standard mandolin, which she often uses for solos or countermelodies. The instrument sounds a little darker and twangier than acoustic guitar in the same range — a hand-played lower voice that answers Jarosz’s own hovering mezzo-soprano.
She made her first four albums in Nashville, and she was urged to write songs with more seasoned musicians; she chose not to release any of them. “The quote-unquote ‘Nashville co-writing’ thing had been pushed on me when I was like 18, 17, making my first record,” she said. “I was really closed off to it back in that time, because I felt like I was still finding my voice. And I was worried that if I went into those co-writing rooms prematurely, that I would get lost at sea.”

9MLHRVC3Q2_SI0PDYC01HVD9NL,"For ‘Barbie’ Fans Online, a Bitterly Ironic Oscar Snub",By Joseph Bernstein,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/style/barbie-oscar-nominations-reactions.html,"When the 2024 Oscar nominations were announced this morning, the snubs of the two most prominent women involved in “Barbie” — the director, Greta Gerwig, and the lead actress, Margot Robbie — became the breakout story.
The top-grossing film of 2023, passing the $1 billion mark worldwide, is based on the imagined life and times of the iconic Mattel doll. A cultural phenomenon on its own terms, “Barbie,” along with “Oppenheimer,” became half of an unusually thoughtful summer blockbuster duo released on the same day in July (“Barbenheimer”): nothing to sneeze at.
As it turns out, the internet has strong opinions about today’s announcement.
“Let me see if I understand this: the Academy nominated ‘Barbie’ for Best Picture (eight nominations total) — a film about women being sidelined and rendered invisible in patriarchal structures — but not the woman who directed the film. Okay then,” read a viral X post by the writer Charlotte Clymer.
The film wasn’t completely shut out — it was nominated for best picture, while Ms. Gerwig picked up a nomination with Noah Baumbach for adapted screenplay, Ryan Gosling for supporting actor, and America Ferrera for supporting actress. But the fact that Mr. Gosling was tabbed for his towheaded Ken, who discovers the idea of patriarchy and then attempts to dominate Barbieland, before Ms. Robbie’s character destroys gender-based oppression, was too much for some to take. “We’re actually doing patriarchy very well,” the writer Jodi Lipper wrote in an Instagram story, quoting a line from the film.
(In a statement released yesterday, Mr. Gosling wrote, “To say that I’m disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement.” And in a statement to Variety, Ms. Ferrera said she was “incredibly disappointed that they weren’t nominated.”)
Indeed, because “Barbie” functions as a commentary on sexism and a metacommentary on its own place in feminist discourse, the movie itself was the first place some of its fans reached to express their outrage over the snubs.

The book, “Rain School,” is about children who live in a rural region of Chad, a country in central Africa. Every year, their school must be rebuilt because storms wash it away.

“And what’s causing all these rains and storms and floods?” asked Ms. Neumeister.
“Carbon,” said Aiden, a serious-looking 8-year-old.
Ms. Neumeister was one of 39 elementary school teachers from across the city who participated in a four-day training session in the summer called “Integrating Climate Education in N.Y.C. Public Schools.” Its goal was to make the teachers familiar with the topic, so they can work climate change into their lesson plans.

9T8XUPJU6B_AV1HWXWGW3ALV37,‘No Time to Go Wobbly’: Why Britain Is Lobbying U.S. Republicans on Ukraine,By Mark LandlerReporting from London,"Jan. 25, 2024",20231226,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/europe/ukraine-uk-us-republicans.html,"When David Cameron, Britain’s foreign secretary and onetime prime minister, visited Washington last month, he took time out to press the case for backing Ukraine with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right Georgia Republican who stridently opposes further American military aid to the country.
Last week, Boris Johnson, another former prime minister, argued that the re-election of Donald J. Trump to the White House would not be such a bad thing, so long as Mr. Trump comes around on helping Ukraine. “I simply cannot believe that Trump will ditch the Ukrainians,” Mr. Johnson wrote in a Daily Mail column that read like a personal appeal to the candidate.
If the “special relationship” between Britain and the United States has taken on an air of special pleading in recent weeks, it is because Britain, rock solid in its support for Ukraine, now views its role as bucking up an ally for whom aid to the embattled country has become a political obstacle course.
British diplomats said Mr. Cameron and other senior officials had made it a priority to reach out to Republicans who were hostile to further aid. For reasons of history and geography, Britain recognized that support is not as “instinctive” for Americans as it for the British, according to a senior diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the matter.
Unlike in the United States, where Ukraine has gotten tied up in a dispute with Republicans over President Biden’s border policy and come under the shadow of a dismissive Mr. Trump, support for Kyiv in Britain has stayed resolute, undiminished, and nonpartisan in the two years since Russia’s invasion.

9UTI058ILH_5OY0281VOUYNX8L,Why Iran Doesn’t Want a War,_,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/opinion/iran-war-middle-east.html,"The war in Gaza has now gone where many feared it would, expanding into conflict in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea. With America’s repeated strikes against the Houthis in Yemen this month, fears of a larger regional conflagration are steadily growing.
Present in each of those arenas is Iran — and the question of whether Tehran and its powerful military will enter a wider war.
For years, Iran has provided funding, arms or training to Hamas and Hezbollah, which are fighting Israel, and to the Houthis, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea. Iran has also launched its own strikes in recent days in retaliation for a deadly bombing earlier this month, claiming to target Israeli spy headquarters in Iraq and the Islamic State in Syria. It has also exchanged strikes with Pakistan across their shared border.
While Iran is clearly asserting its military strength amid the widening regional turmoil, that doesn’t mean its leaders want to be drawn into a wider war. They have said as much publicly, and perhaps more important, they have meticulously avoided taking direct military action against either Israel or the United States. The regime appears to be content for now to lean into its longtime strategy of proxy warfare: The groups they back are fighting Iran’s foes and so far, neither Israel nor the United States has signaled any interest in retaliating directly.
At the heart of Iran’s aversion to a major conflict are the domestic issues that have been preoccupying the regime. The elderly supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is seeking to secure his legacy — by overcoming political headwinds to install a like-minded successor, pursuing a nuclear weapon and ensuring the survival of the regime as an Islamist paladin dominating the Middle East — and that means not getting dragged into a wider war.
Ayatollah Khamenei’s government has been trying to keep his political opposition in check since 2022, when the Islamic Republic faced perhaps its most serious uprising since the revolution. The death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the morality police tapped into widespread frustration with the country’s leaders and triggered a national movement explicitly intent on toppling the theocracy. Using brutal methods, the mullahs’ security forces regained the streets and schools, well aware that even unorganized protests can become a threat to the regime. Iran is also facing an economic crisis because of corruption, chronic fiscal mismanagement and sanctions imposed because of its nuclear infractions.

Barnes, Hiba Yazbek, Aaron Boxerman and Roni Caryn Rabin","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-aid.html,"William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, plans to travel to Europe to meet with senior Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials, in a sign the United States is pushing to secure a deal to release the hostages being held in the Gaza Strip and broker a prolonged cease-fire, according to U.S. officials.
U.S. officials said Israel’s apparent willingness to agree to a cessation of hostilities in return for the release of more hostages being held in Gaza has created a new opening for negotiations.
Any new deal would likely include phased releases of hostages, though the White House is hoping that a more ambitious one, possibly leading to the release of all of the remaining hostages, might be possible. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy.
Mr. Burns and David Barnea, the chief of Israel’s Mossad spy agency, helped broker a deal in November that led to a weeklong pause in the fighting and the release of more than 100 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel. The talks were mediated by Qatar, which was negotiating with Hamas, as well as by Egypt.
Mr. Barnea and Mr. Burns are set to meet with Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, and Abbas Kamel, the head of Egypt’s intelligence service, for the renewed talks. American officials would not reveal the precise location of the meeting for security purposes, and requested that the precise timing of Mr. Burns’s trip not be disclosed.
At least some of the officials last met in Warsaw in December, but those discussions stalled over Hamas’s insistence that the remaining hostages be released in exchange for a permanent cease-fire and larger prisoner releases. Israel rejected any permanent cease-fire and was pushing for a shorter pause in fighting.

9WMHPA0JS2_L20ZDIVJ2K87QJ2,Powerful Waves Slam U.S. Army Base in the Marshall Islands,By Amanda Holpuch,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/asia/marshall-islands-flooding-evacuations.html,"A surge of unexpected waves swamped the island of Roi-Namur in the Marshall Islands on Saturday, forcing evacuations from a U.S. military base and causing damage that could take months to repair.
A video from inside a building at U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll that circulated widely on social media showed a surge of water crashing through a set of double doors, knocking them off their hinges and upending people who were standing nearby. Another burst of water rushed through the windows, forcing the people to wade through waist-high water as furniture and vegetation floated around them.
Roi-Namur is a small island about 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii and is the second-largest island of the Kwajalein Atoll, a loop of coral reefs in the Marshall Islands.
Whoahhh!!!! 🌊Roi-Namur Island was struck by several substantial waves on Saturday night. It was NOT a tsunami. The powerful waves, driven by cyclonic surges in the open sea, affected the island located in the northern part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.Video… pic.twitter.com/F1jcbmEx8k
U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll supports a missile range and testing facility. About 120 military personnel were living on Roi-Namur when the waves struck, and 80 were evacuated, Mike Brantley, a base spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday.

A2JZZ1CTMQ_LMCI0G6P8IVGEKN,"With Border Deal Near, Parole and Money Take Center Stage in Senate Talks",By Karoun DemirjianReporting from Washington,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/border-deal-parole-money-senate-talks.html,"A bipartisan group of senators has agreed on a compromise to crack down on the surge of migrants across the United States border with Mexico, including reducing the number who are allowed to live and work in the country temporarily, but a final deal depends on resolving critical funding disputes.
Much of the recent haggling over the emerging agreement — and a point of contention for its critics — has been about how to limit the number of people who are granted parole, a status that allows migrants without visas to live and work in the United States temporarily. Drawing broader support for the plan in the Senate would clear away the biggest obstacle to congressional approval of tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression, which Republicans have said they will block absent a deal to clamp down at the border.
The G.O.P. considers parole a dangerous loophole that fuels illegal immigration and must be tightly closed. To many Democrats, it is a crucial tool that allows the administration to treat desperate migrants humanely, which must be preserved, particularly for vulnerable populations fleeing failing states and war.
Bridging the gap will likely hinge on the two sides agreeing on how much federal money to spend to try to decrease net immigration numbers, and persuading Republicans that the deal’s measures will be effective. On Monday, Senate leaders warned that getting a final deal depended on resolving those remaining differences.
“It’s certainly not a done deal yet; there are a handful of issues that have not yet been agreed to,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said on the floor. “On something as complicated as the border, it’s not just what we do that matters. It’s how we do it.”
Here’s how parole works, and why it’s central to sealing any border deal in Congress.
Parole authority, which has existed since the 1950s, allows the government to extend migrants a special status to remain in the United States for a certain period of time. It was designed to be used only in cases of humanitarian need, or if there was a public benefit to allowing a migrant into the country.

A503W5EUPM_U4HQX14YUEB34EA,Whitney Biennial Names Its ‘Dissonant Chorus’ of Artists to Probe Turbulent Times,By Siddhartha Mitter,"Published Jan. 25, 2024Updated Jan. 26, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/arts/design/whitney-biennial-artists.html,"The last time the Whitney Biennial came around, in 2022, its production had been extended an extra year by the Covid pandemic, and the curators had to plan the exhibition and meet artists in virtual visits over Zoom.
To prepare for the 2024 Biennial — the latest iteration in the landmark exhibition of American contemporary art, which opens March 20 — this edition’s organizers, the Whitney Museum curators Chrissie Iles and Meg Onli, hit the road. They conducted some 200 studio visits around the country and well beyond. They visited scores of exhibitions and art events from the German mega-show Documenta 15 to the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.
So this cycle has been, in one sense, more normal. But normal stops here. The drastic phase of the pandemic, with its restrictions, may have receded. But the landscape left in its wake is a panorama of compounding crises — and for artists, like everyone else, a period of high uncertainty and anxiety with the U.S. election looming.
As they moved around, Iles and Onli said in a joint interview at the museum, they felt ambient pressure everywhere, whether they were smelling smoke from the wildfires wafting over the freeways in Los Angeles — a reflection of land overuse and climate change — or hearing firsthand from women and L.G.B.T.Q artists the effect of the reversal of Roe v. Wade and the spread of laws undermining bodily autonomy.
“We understand we’re in a turbulent period, leading into another turbulent period,” Onli said. To make an exhibition under these conditions, she said, “the show had to be politically charged.”

AC3PVLFRAS_KSHS014YXQA4O45,Ex-U.S. Soldier Who Killed Iraqi Civilian Charged with Attacking Police on Jan. 6,By Orlando Mayorquin,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/army-jan-6-iraq-manslaughter-kadir.html,"A former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the killing of an Iraqi civilian in 2004 was charged on Monday with assaulting police officers with a baton during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, the Justice Department announced.
The former soldier, Edward Richmond Jr., 40, of Geismar, La., who was arrested on Monday in Baton Rouge, faces several federal charges, including civil disorder; entering and remaining in a restricted area with a deadly or dangerous weapon; and assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, prosecutors said.
A spokesman for the U.S. Army, Bryce S. Dubee, confirmed that Mr. Richmond had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in 2004, the same year he was deployed to Iraq. Mr. Richmond, who was in the Army from 2002 to 2008, was sentenced in military court to a reduction in rank to private, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, three years’ confinement and a dishonorable discharge, Mr. Dubee said.
He was released from prison on parole in 2006 with almost a year remaining on his original sentence, according to The Associated Press.
According to The A.P., Mr. Richmond killed a cow herder who had been detained along with the other men in an Iraqi village near Taal Al Jai that the Army raided on Feb. 28, 2004. The herder, Muhamad Husain Kadir, was handcuffed when Mr. Richmond shot him in the back of the head from six feet away as the man stumbled, The A.P. reported.
In his defense, Mr. Richmond, then 20, said that although he had not seen Mr. Kadir with a weapon, he thought that Mr. Kadir had been lunging to attack another soldier, adding that he didn’t know Mr. Kadir’s hands had been bound, according to the wire service.

AGD80RUT3U_UN4NG870W54CUZP,Pentagon Names Two SEALs Lost in Raid in Arabian Sea,By Dave Philipps,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/navy-seals-ingram-chambers.html,"The Defense Department identified on Monday the two Navy SEALs who were lost at sea and died this month during a nighttime commando raid on a small ship carrying weapons components bound for Yemen.
Active-duty and veteran SEALs said it appeared that the men might have sunk quickly before they could be rescued, and that the circumstances of their deaths raised questions about the planning and conduct of the raid. An official investigation is pending.
Special Operator First Class Christopher J. Chambers, 37, and Special Operator Second Class Nathan Gage Ingram, 27, were lost on Jan. 11 when SEALs in two stealthy combat speedboats, shadowed by helicopters and drones, boarded a dhow, a type of small wooden cargo ship, in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Somalia.
As the two men tried to climb a rope boarding ladder in rough seas, one fell into the ocean and another jumped into the water to attempt a rescue, according to defense officials who were briefed on the incident. Both SEALs were quickly lost in the waves.
A joint search operation by naval forces from the United States, Spain and Japan spent over a week searching more than 21,000 square miles of ocean for the missing SEALs. The Defense Department declared on Sunday that the men were presumed dead.
They were assigned to SEAL Team 3, based in Coronado, Calif.
“We extend our condolences to Chris and Gage’s families, friends and teammates during this incredibly challenging time,” Capt. Blake L. Chaney, commander of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, said on Monday in a statement. “They were exceptional warriors, cherished teammates and dear friends to many within the Naval Special Warfare community.”

AJ7OP83FWR_EJK0VEFN76J12XO,What to Watch in the New Hampshire Primary,By Jonathan Weisman,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/new-hampshire-what-to-watch.html,"New Hampshire voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the first presidential primary of the 2024 nomination cycle, in a state that has been known to throw curveballs at overwhelming favorites.
The withdrawal of Gov. Ron DeSantis from the Republican race on Sunday effectively left what had recently been a crowded field of candidates down to two: former President Donald J. Trump, and former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina.
The national Democratic Party, pushed by President Biden, had wanted New Hampshire Democrats to break tradition and move their primary to the end of February. New Hampshire refused, leaving the president’s supporters to mount a write-in campaign for the absent Mr. Biden against Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, the self-help author Marianne Williamson and 19 other Democrats whose names are on the ballot.
After Mr. Trump trounced his opponents in the Iowa caucuses last Monday, here is what to watch on Tuesday:
After an early-January surge in the polls, Ms. Haley seemed be moving toward striking distance of Mr. Trump in New Hampshire, and when former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey dropped out on Jan. 10, it appeared that she briefly had a shot at consolidating the anti-Trump vote among Republicans, independents and about 4,000 Democrats who had re-registered as independent behind her.
New Hampshire polling in the last few days would indicate that any consolidation has fallen short of what she needs to win. If anything, Mr. Trump’s totals have inched upward. But New Hampshire has shocked the prognosticators before. Senator John McCain beat the overwhelming favorite of the establishment, George W. Bush, in 2000. Hillary Clinton bested a confident Barack Obama in 2008.

AJJSES20HV_N6G59536ESK4NQQ,Landslide in Southern China Buries Dozens and Sends Hundreds Fleeing,By Vivian WangReporting from Beijing,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/asia/china-landslide-buries-dozens.html,"A landslide in southwestern China’s Yunnan Province on Monday left at least 11 people dead and more than 30 others buried, according to the Chinese state media, as a cold wave blanketed much of the country.
State media said that more than 500 people had been evacuated. Aerial footage of the disaster site from the state broadcaster, China Central Television, showed a dark, gaping furrow gouged out of a snowy mountainside, which had carved through wide swaths of terraced fields and into a cluster of low houses.
The landslide occurred just before 6 a.m. on Monday, hitting two small villages in the northernmost part of the province, near the borders with Sichuan and Guizhou Provinces. The villages, Hexing and Heping, are sparsely populated, in a mountainous area that was once one of the poorest parts of China.
Hundreds of workers were climbing over snow-dusted rubble to rescue the missing residents, who came from at least 18 different households, state media reported. The temperature at the landslide site was below freezing on Monday morning, and snow was continuing to fall.
Eleven bodies had been found by Monday night, officials said at a news conference.
Temperatures had plunged across much of China over the weekend, with blizzards expected in much of southeastern China on Monday, according to China’s National Meteorological Center. Some trains traveling across the region were canceled due to the weather.
The cause of the landslide in Yunnan and whether it was related to the cold snap were not immediately clear. The climate in that part of Yunnan is typically subtropical, with an average temperature in January of about 36 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the national meteorological authorities.

AYHQE3OY0Q_NS3IDN6CQNU0Z61,Modi Opens a Giant Temple in a Triumph for India’s Hindu Nationalists,"By Mujib Mashal and Hari KumarPhotographs by Atul LokeReporting from Ayodhya, India","Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/asia/modi-india-ram-temple.html,"They fanned out across the vast country, knocking on doors in the name of a cause that would redefine India.
These foot soldiers and organizers, including a young Narendra Modi, collected millions of dollars to be socked away for a long fight to build a grand Hindu temple in Ayodhya, in northern India. Across 200,000 villages, ceremonies were arranged to bless individual bricks that would be sent to that sacred city, believed by Hindus to be the birthplace of the deity Ram.
The bricks, the campaign’s leaders declared, would not just be used for the temple’s construction on land occupied for centuries by a mosque. They would be the foundation for a Hindu rashtra, or Hindu nation, that would correct what right-wing Hindus saw as the injustice of India’s birth as a secular republic.
Nearly four decades later, the cornerstone of that sweeping vision has been laid.
Mr. Modi, now the country’s prime minister, inaugurated the Ram temple in Ayodhya on Monday — the crowning achievement of a national movement aimed at establishing Hindu supremacy in India by rallying the country’s Hindu majority across castes and tribes.
“Today, our Ram has come. After centuries of patience and sacrifice, our Lord Ram has come,” Mr. Modi said during the ceremony. “It is the beginning of a new era.”
The moment is both one of triumph for Hindu nationalists and one of jubilation for many others who care little for politics. Ram has a wide following in India; excitement around the temple’s consecration had been building for weeks, with saffron-colored pennants strung across a million streets and markets, and posters of Ram advertising the event everywhere.

B5H4ZZ8E0B_WA830J0LXV5NS51,"After a Botched Execution, Alabama Is Trying an Untested Method",By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/nitrogen-execution-alabama-kenneth-smith.html,"It was Nov. 17, 2022, and Kenneth Smith was lying on a gurney inside Alabama’s execution chamber, his arms and legs strapped down as he waited to be put to death. Mr. Smith, who had been on death row for more than a quarter-century after being convicted of murdering a woman, recalled thanking God for his final week alive and thinking of his family.
At the time, the state was using the same method of execution that has been used in the vast majority of modern U.S. executions: lethal injection. And like many other states, Alabama had problems. That night, a team of people tried and repeatedly failed to insert an intravenous line into Mr. Smith’s arms and hands and, eventually, a vein near his heart. The jabbing stopped — according to his lawyers, who recounted in court documents Mr. Smith’s experiences that night — when prison officials decided that they might not have time to carry out the execution before the death warrant expired at midnight.
Now, more than a year later, Alabama is preparing once again this week to execute Mr. Smith, this time employing a method that has never been used in a U.S. execution: nitrogen hypoxia. Under this method, which has been used in assisted suicides in Europe, Mr. Smith will be fitted with a mask and administered a flow of nitrogen gas, effectively depriving him of oxygen until he dies.
The execution, scheduled for Thursday evening, is the latest turn in the fraught battle over executions in the U.S., where a growing number of states are banning the death penalty; those that retain the punishment are finding it difficult to carry out. Pressure from activist and medical groups has made it challenging for prison officials to procure lethal drugs, and a series of executions in the last two years were plagued by trouble finding veins. Alabama is one of several states that are looking at alternatives, including nitrogen hypoxia, and some states have recently authorized the use of a firing squad.
This week’s planned execution has galvanized death penalty critics who say that Alabama prison officials are making Mr. Smith a test subject for an unproven and potentially macabre experiment. State officials argue that death by nitrogen hypoxia is painless because it quickly causes a person to lose consciousness. They note that Mr. Smith’s lawyers have themselves identified nitrogen hypoxia as preferable to Alabama’s troubled administration of lethal injection drugs.
Last week, a federal judge in Alabama rejected a request by Mr. Smith’s lawyers to halt the execution. Mr. Smith has appealed, and the case will most likely be appealed further to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in recent years has been reluctant to halt executions at the last minute.

B7XNERI56F_IEY24OLY2UD5Q88,"On a Budget, a Travel Reporter Learns Invaluable Lessons",By Elaine GlusacElaine Glusac has reported on travel for more than 25 years and began writing for the Frugal Traveler column in 2019.,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/insider/frugal-traveler-lessons.html,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
“Do you need someone to carry your bags?”
That’s the party joke people often ask me when they hear I’m a travel journalist. I laughingly say a porter isn’t required as, “I’m mostly the carry-on kind.” But really, I’m thinking, my job only looks like a vacation.
Vacation days are precious and many Americans get few of them. My job as the Frugal Traveler columnist for The New York Times is to help readers make the most of their time off without spending a fortune.
My love of travel started early. I come from a close-knit family of modest means that spent every discretionary penny on travel. When we weren’t debating politics at the dinner table, we were planning our next big adventure, usually an ambitious road trip; we once drove from Detroit, our hometown, to Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia — a nearly 1,500-mile trek. The cars we took were beaters, but the memories are priceless.
Travel continues to teach me things every day, and I want readers to experience travel too — without breaking the bank. Accordingly, careful, painstaking planning is a must.
Before I set off on any reporting trip, I conduct weeks of research on where to stay, eat and what to do. I schedule dozens of activities, tours and interviews. My limited budget — this column is, after all, called Frugal Traveler — means I sometimes must move fast and with flexibility.
When people learn that I travel for a living, there are a few things they most often ask me. Here are a few of those questions, answered:
Alas, no. I follow the news in budget travel, reading travel blogs and talking to industry experts for inspiration. I look for destinations that offer travelers one-of-a-kind experiences they won’t regret after seeing their credit card statement. In October, I visited Key West, Fla., where I split a room at a hostel with three strangers, all in the name of cost-effectiveness. Last spring, I traveled to Aspen, Colo., a city known for its luxurious amenities. I stayed at a relatively affordable, family-run lodge and visited art museums for free.

BB95VM1PQA_RQ6I6WM1ONBRPFA,11 Vintage Interiors Books to Fuel Your Home Design Fantasies,By Catherine Hong,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/t-magazine/vintage-design-books.html,"In our very online era, design trends seem to bloom and wither faster than ever. Concepts that might at first strike us as unexpected can quickly be turned into clichés by algorithms. See: Zellige tiles or banana leaf wallpaper. One antidote to this rapid churn is, of course, more analog sources of inspiration, in particular books — the older and harder to find the better. So, we asked a handful of designers to each recommend a title, ideally a vintage one, that continues to offer up exciting ideas.
Brigette Romanek, 48, interior designer: “The Decoration of Houses” by Edith Wharton and Ogden Codman Jr. (1897)
In an era when women didn’t have full control over their lives, Edith Wharton found her voice through writing but also through decorating her home. I first encountered this book — which is hailed as the first modern design book — at the very beginning of my career, when I was still learning the craft. In it, Wharton outlines both the major historical design traditions and the then-new approaches to walls, doors, windows, ceilings, floors, fireplaces and open spaces, documenting a level of ornamentation that’s unfortunately been somewhat lost to history. The book is illustrated with mostly black-and-white photographs of European design from the 16th through 18th centuries; some much later printings include color photos. But what resonated with me are Wharton’s words. “The supreme excellence is simplicity,” she wrote. Her advice holds true to this day.

BDI5LOO83C_6PT6ET10XTBDFBV,Trump Plays Up His Former Rivals’ Endorsements. Haley Has Judge Judy.,By Neil Vigdor,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/nikki-haley-judge-judy.html,"While former President Donald J. Trump enlists several former rivals to help him deliver a closing argument to New Hampshire primary voters, Nikki Haley, his last remaining Republican opponent, has approached a different kind of bench: Judge Judy.
Television’s best known judge, whose real name is Judith Sheindlin, waded into the race on Sunday when she campaigned for Ms. Haley at rally in Exeter, N.H., albeit minus her trademark gavel and robe.
It was a rare foray into presidential politics for Ms. Sheindlin, who told CNN on Sunday that Ms. Haley had made a strong impression on her.
She pointed out that she was not supporting Ms. Haley, the former South Carolina governor and Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, simply because she was a woman.
“I would support her if she were a frog,” said Ms. Sheindlin, who supported Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, in his unsuccessful run in the 2020 Democratic primary.
Ms. Sheindlin avoided attacking Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner, but she said he had too many distractions with his criminal and civil cases to focus on governing.
The television star argued that Mr. Trump and President Biden’s ages were catching up with them and that “they wouldn’t know a Houthi from a salami,” referring to the Iranian-backed militia in power in Yemen and a deli meat.
She said that even she — at 81, the same age as Mr. Biden — hasn’t been able to turn back time.
“I need a nap in the afternoon,” said Ms. Sheindlin. “So does Joe Biden, probably two.”"
BP85RWW5RB_26ZDBVS7YH7VOTI,‘Mambar Pierrette’ Review: Cosmic Misfortunes,By Beatrice Loayza,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/movies/mambar-pierrette-review.html,"Pierrette, a gifted seamstress and a mother of three, can’t seem to catch a break. After a hard day’s work at her humble shop in Douala, a busy city in Cameroon, she’s mugged by a motorcycle taxi driver. It’s also the rainy season and her home — and later her shop — is flooded overnight. It’s a foul time to be broke: The kids are heading back to school and their supplies aren’t cheap.
The events of “Mambar Pierrette” are fictional, but the film’s nonprofesssional actors play versions of themselves. The drama is the first narrative feature by Rosine Mbakam, a Cameroonian filmmaker based in Belgium. Over the past decade, Mbakam has distinguished herself as a formidable verité-style documentarian; her subjects, Cameroonian women at home and overseas.
Pierrette Aboheu Njeuthat, cast in the title role, is Mbakam’s cousin, and many of the figures who orbit Pierrette’s life are the actress’s neighbors and relatives.
A rich community portrait unfolds as Pierrette prepares her clients’ orders and flits around town putting out fires. We get a sense of the patriarchal customs that dictate village life; the frictions between modern, enterprising women like Pierrette and tradition-bound ones like her mother. These and other realities are made apparent in a beautifully organic manner, through the kind of intimate chatter that happens between people who’ve known each other for decades.
Pierrette’s rotten luck is no joke. We see, with startling clarity, how a stolen wallet turns into a missed payment, and an electricity shut-off means a sewing machine that can’t sew. Yet the film’s gentle naturalism (at times edging on the uncanny, courtesy of cheeky editing rhythms and an unsettling-looking mannequin) gives her tribulations a cosmic undertone.
Mbakam hits a remarkable balance. The sociopolitical truths that make up Pierrette’s losing streak are evident, without the miserable patronizing so common in films about struggle in Africa. Also palpable is a more universal gut feeling: the half-serious suspicion that one has been cursed.
Mambar PierretteNot rated. In French, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes. In theaters."
BRUKK60YA0_8NRRG504O5G8CZ4,Biden Wasn’t on the Ballot in New Hampshire. He Won Anyway.,By Katie Glueck,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/biden-wins-democratic-primary-new-hampshire.html,"President Biden’s decisive victory in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary provided him with a dose of good political news amid a season of Democratic anxiety about his campaign.
The symbolic, if largely expected, win on the strength of a write-in campaign comes as Mr. Biden and his party now shift more fully into general-election mode after former President Donald J. Trump triumphed in the state’s Republican primary on Tuesday. He beat Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, though she has vowed to continue her uphill battle against him.
“It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee,” Mr. Biden said in a statement, in which he thanked voters who wrote in his name. “And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher.”
Mr. Biden is expected to campaign this weekend in South Carolina, which he and the Democratic National Committee selected to supplant New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary.
He declined to appear on the ballot in New Hampshire after the Granite State refused to accept its demotion. But his allies in the state eventually stepped in, and the write-in effort, supported by top Democrats there, generated the kind of grass-roots energy for Mr. Biden that has not yet materialized in other states — and that he did not enjoy in New Hampshire’s primary in 2020, when he came in fifth place.
Kathy Sullivan, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party who led a write-in Biden super PAC, said that a strong Biden showing in the state was important “to counteract the narrative that’s out there that he’s not popular” and to signal that he had the support of the Democratic base.

BRWRCSK0YY_47W8J82P6VSO40J,"Honed at Home in Yemen, Houthi Propaganda Is Going Global",By Vivian Nereim,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/middleeast/yemen-houthis-propaganda.html,"Soon after Yemen’s Houthi militia hijacked a commercial ship in the Red Sea, taking it and its 25-member crew hostage, the armed group used the vessel to record a music video.
In the slick production, called “Axis of Jihad,” a drone camera pans over the hulking ship. Then a famous Houthi poet appears on the deck — accompanied by what appears to be a cardboard cutout of Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian commander assassinated in 2020 — and begins to sing.
“Death to America and hostile Zion,” the poet, Issa al-Laith, calls out, backed by a relentless beat. “By God, we shall not be defeated!”
The Houthis — an Iran-backed militia that controls northwestern Yemen — have long been skilled producers of propaganda, crafting poetry, television shows and catchy music videos to spread their messages. But they have never had as large an audience as they do now, as the war in the Gaza Strip propels them to the center of a global battle of accounts and attracts new admirers around the world.
Over the past few months, the Houthis have vaulted to worldwide prominence by shooting missiles toward Israel and attacking ships in the Red Sea, causing limited damage but disrupting the flow of global trade. The United States and its allies have targeted the group with repeated airstrikes this month, further raising its profile, but the assaults on shipping have continued.
The Houthis have declared that a direct battle with the United States is their goal, and at recent demonstrations, their supporters have chanted a line from a famous Houthi poem: “We don’t care, we don’t care: Make it a great World War.”

C04QSVCEDR_48ZF7APT8UT8KZN,Nikki Haley Was an Illusion. It Just Shattered.,_,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/opinion/nikki-haley-trump-new-hampshire.html,"Nikki Haley was made for New Hampshire. New Hampshire was made for her.
I kept hearing that, kept reading that, as various political observers turned a myth into a mantra, persuading themselves of her potency and Donald Trump’s vulnerability not only in the Granite State but also beyond it. They wanted so much to believe that Trump’s grip on the Republican Party might be loosening. They were desperate for assurance that he wouldn’t return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
So a wishful narrative took shape: New Hampshire’s quirky voters would buck Iowans and back Haley. Independents would overwhelm the MAGA minions. She’d notch an upset victory and then, all across a Trump-pummeled land, voters would suddenly realize that they had an alternative, suddenly recognize polls that showed Haley with a better chance in a one-on-one contest against President Biden than Trump had. They would come to their senses. And on the far side of that epiphany gleamed Haley, her youth, ethnic background and gender giving the Republican Party a new vitality. A new image. A fresh start.
What a lovely illusion. It just shattered. The results on Tuesday night, when Trump followed his commanding victory in the Iowa caucuses with a compelling one in the New Hampshire primary, leave Haley with no plausible path to the Republican nomination, not unless something extraordinary happens. The scenario in which she was supposed to topple Trump can now be seen for what it always was: the latest of many fictions in which those of us who rightly fear American democracy’s ability to survive Trump sought consolation.
We told ourselves that Robert Mueller’s investigation or Trump’s first impeachment or his second impeachment would stop him. We told ourselves that the methodical work of the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol would seal his political doom. We told ourselves that he couldn’t survive four indictments encompassing 91 felony counts. We told ourselves that his outbursts were finally growing too vicious, his temper too volcanic, his lies too outrageous and ornate.
Haley flourished in the context of those calming tales. She was a vessel for our hopes. As a result, we upgraded her debate performances from decent to dazzling. We sometimes put as much emphasis on her rise in the polls as on how fatally far behind Trump she remained. The difficulty of accepting Trump’s continued hold on Republican voters became a readiness to accept that voters secretly hankered for the likes of her.
But the evidence never held up. Sure, she raised buckets of money. So did Ron DeSantis — from the same sorts of Republicans, the ones who lost control of the party back in 2016. Yes, she outperformed expectations in the past, becoming governor of a deep red state that didn’t seem to be fertile ground for a trailblazer like her. But she wasn’t running against anyone like Trump back then. She wasn’t dealing with anything like the MAGA movement.

C7PKX6MHMW_6PBFSD3KMG9BU9T,"Wayne LaPierre, Longtime N.R.A. Chief, Testifies at Manhattan Trial","By Danny Hakim, Liset Cruz and Kate Christobek","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/nyregion/wayne-lapierre-nra-chief-testimony.html,"With less than a week left as chief of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre got to look back at his 33-year tenure in a Manhattan courtroom on Friday, when he began testifying in a civil corruption case that the New York attorney general brought against him.
Mr. LaPierre has been accused of using the nonprofit organization’s resources to bankroll an extravagant lifestyle and of presiding over a scheme to hide what he was doing.
On Friday, the attorney general’s office presented evidence showing that on one occasion, chartered flights Mr. LaPierre and his family took to a large luxury yacht, Illusions, cost the gun rights organization nearly $38,000. The yacht’s owners were David and Laura McKenzie, N.R.A. vendors with lucrative contracts who hosted the LaPierres during many summer excursions to the Bahamas and on travel around the world.
Asked whether he got approval from the N.R.A. board for the Bahamas trip, Mr. LaPierre said, “No, I didn’t.”
Another N.R.A. contractor, Ackerman McQueen, bought Mr. LaPierre’s wife, Susan, a MacBook Pro, an iPad Pro and an iPod, evidence showed. Mr. LaPierre also billed the organization for a number of pricey gifts, including a $1,260 handbag and $860 in candlesticks for the McKenzies. He charged more than $250,000 to a clothing boutique in Beverly Hills, Calif., over several years, and even billed the N.R.A. $800 a year for mosquito treatment in his backyard.
Mr. LaPierre is being tried along with the N.R.A. itself and two other co-defendants: John Frazer, the organization’s general counsel, and Wilson Phillips, a former finance chief. The case stems from a 2020 lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who has jurisdiction over the N.R.A. because it is a nonprofit organization that was founded in New York in 1871.

CCCMCS1XLW_Q7CHHO622IXA69B,National Association of Realtors Faces Competition From New Group,By Debra Kamin,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 26, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/realestate/american-real-estate-association-nar.html,"Two prominent real estate agents have started a new trade association in a direct swipe at the embattled National Association of Realtors.
Founded more than 100 years ago, the group known as N.A.R. has long held sway over the American real estate industry, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in annual dues from its 1.5 million members. It owns the trademark to the word “Realtor.” But in recent years, the organization has been saddled with a barrage of antitrust lawsuits and sexual harassment allegations. Over the past several months, multiple top leaders have stepped down, stoking concerns in the industry that the organization is on the edge of implosion.
Jason Haber, a New York agent with Compass, and Mauricio Umansky, the Los Angeles-based celebrity agent and founder of the luxury brokerage the Agency, told The New York Times that their new group, the American Real Estate Association, could be an alternative.
They are expected to announce their plan for AREA on Wednesday at Inman Connect New York, a real estate conference sponsored by Inman, the real estate news site. N.A.R. did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Haber, 46 and a native New Yorker, is a broker and entrepreneur who has also worked in local, state and federal government. He has been one of the most outspoken critics of N.A.R. since August, when The New York Times revealed widespread allegations of sexual harassment against its then-president, Kenny Parcell. He started the N.A.R. Accountability Project, a grass-roots organization that made several demands, including the immediate resignation of Mr. Parcell and its chief executive, Bob Goldberg. Both men have since stepped down.
Mr. Umansky, 53, is a reality TV regular and co-founder of the Hollywood brokerage the Agency. He is quickly recognizable to fans of “Buying Beverly Hills,” “Dancing With The Stars” and “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” where his wife, Kyle Richards, is a series regular (the pair is currently separated). He has also been at loggerheads with N.A.R.; in 2020, he sued the organization over its policies on databases for real estate listings, arguing that they were anti-competitive and damaged a private database of off-market listings that he had created in Los Angeles. N.A.R., on appeal, asked the Supreme Court to throw that suit out and was denied. It was remanded to district court and lawyers for Mr. Umansky came to a settlement agreement with three of the other named defendants in the case on Thursday. With N.A.R., they agreed to a pause litigation, with the understanding that the case can be reopened.

CCLPVECDX3_P6BL60J3TBZ6NID,The 25 Essential Dishes to Eat in Paris,"By Kurt Soller, Sara Lieberman, Katherine McGrath, Zoey Poll and Lindsey TramutaPhotographs by Thibault Montamat","Published Feb. 13, 2023Updated Feb. 15, 2023",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/13/t-magazine/paris-best-restaurants-food.html,"There is perhaps no Zoom meeting less satisfying than one scheduled on a cold weekday morning to talk about food — specifically, the food that one ought to eat in Paris. We couldn’t gather in a great restaurant, for the people assembled were chefs and writers spread across continents, some racing from their kitchens, others dialing in after dropping off their children. The frenetic life we’d all once known was, in many senses, back. And so was the Paris culinary scene, driven by that thrilling hunt for places both new and old, French and not, an obsession among natives and tourists alike.
As with a similar list we made for New York — and as part of our ongoing T 25 series, which has surfaced significant and memorable travel destinations, buildings, interiors, art, fashion and books — we wanted to name the essential Parisian dishes to eat right now. With both visitors and residents in mind, I’d assembled a panel of experts who either work in the city, are from there or spend lots of time in town, including the pastry chef Dominique Ansel; the cookbook author Dorie Greenspan; Moko Hirayama and Omar Koreitem, the couple who run the restaurants Mokonuts and Mokoloco in the 11th Arrondissement; and Marie-Aude Rose, the French chef of New York’s La Mercerie (who is also, as might be expected, involved in several businesses throughout America and France overseen by her husband, the chef Daniel Rose). I’d asked each of them to nominate 10 or so candidates ahead of time, which ranged from entire meals at gastronomic temples to pastries and street-food staples they’d happened upon on their blocks; the goal was to include classically rich options as well as newer, more internationally inflected choices. And nothing could be nominated from any of our panelists’ establishments (although there would have been many worthy contenders).
Surprisingly, or perhaps not, no one chose a baguette or a croissant. On these longer lists, there were just two overlaps: ice cream by Jessica Yang, a rising chef who co-owns a cave à vin called Folderol, and Ispahan macarons by Pierre Hermé, the grand-père of contemporary French desserts. We quickly advanced those — and some other sweets — to the next round, then spent hours that day, and in a few follow-up calls, discussing everything else we felt merited inclusion: bistro fare, as well as its 21st-century permutations; genteel seafood; haute patisserie; European favorites, particularly from Italy, that have recently crossed borders; and other items influenced and made by the immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who make Paris what it is today.
The final list, which appears in unranked alphabetical order below and covers most arrondissements, isn’t what we expected, nor is it like the myriad Parisian food rankings we’ve all encountered before. There’s nothing from impossible to reserve (and impossibly expensive) prix fixe stalwarts, but there is the best fried chicken you’ll find outside of the Philippines. Naturally, a few popular wine bars and bistronomy spots made the cut, although mostly for modernizing things like chou farci and steak au poivre. But this list, like all lists, is subjective: It reflects the palates and sensibilities of our panelists on a few gray January mornings. Above all, it speaks to the fact that great food — particularly in Paris, particularly right now — looks forward and backward at once: That’s what makes eating there (and debating where to eat there) so deliciously freewheeling. — Kurt Soller
This conversation has been edited and condensed.
Situated on a quiet street below Montparnasse is the chef David Rathgeber’s L’Assiette, a gilded example of fine French bistro fare. The brief menu includes market-driven specialties like escargot and pâté, but it would be a mistake not to order the cassoulet, the slow-simmering, stick-to-your-ribs stew served in generous portions in the wide-lipped cauldron, the cassole d’Issel, that gives the Languedocian dish its name. While it’s considered rustic as French cuisine goes — and is rarely found on bistro menus these days — Rathgeber’s version honors each individual ingredient: thin-skinned white mogette beans from the Vendée region; the harmoniously meaty trio of duck confit, succulent pork belly and a hunk of lamb’s neck that melts from the bone; and garlic sausage on top. It’s made twice weekly, giving the beans and broth time to mingle and deepen their flavor. — Katherine McGrath

CKTJ56TNV6_U7F89BLEQKA3BQF,‘Tótem’ Review: The Girl Who Sees Too Much,By Manohla Dargis,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/movies/totem-review-lila-aviles.html,"There are worlds inside worlds in “Tótem,” a soulful drama populated by an array of creatures, some with two legs and sad smiles, others with feathers, fur and shells. Set largely in a rambling house on a single momentous day, it focuses on a serious-eyed girl, Sol, who serves as the story’s luminous celestial body. You see much of what she sees, the warmth and disorder. Yet because Sol is just 7, you also see what it means to be a child in that messy reality known as adulthood.
The Mexican writer-director Lila Avilés plunges into the mess the minute Sol (Naíma Sentíes), wearing a red clown nose and a floppy rainbow-colored wig, arrives at her grandfather’s house. There, amid the homey clutter of a house that actually looks lived in rather than art directed, two of her aunts are busily, and none too efficiently, prepping an evening birthday party for Sol’s gravely ill father, Tona (Mateo García Elizondo). As people and animals exit and enter the story — a raptor portentously flies overhead early on, part of a menagerie that includes bugs, dogs and a goldfish in a plastic bag — one aunt bakes a cake as the other dyes her hair.
Avilés soon maps the house’s labyrinthine sprawl, swiftly building a tangible sense of place with precise, well-worn details and quick-sketch character portraits. “Totem” is a coming into consciousness story about a child navigating realms — human and animal, spiritual and material — that exist around her like overlapping concentric circles. Yet even as the story’s focus sharpens, what matters here are the characters: their emotions and worried words, how they hold it together and fall apart, their individual habits and shared habitat. (Avilés’s 2019 feature debut “The Chambermaid,” set in a hotel, is about another ecosystem.)
Sol serves as a narrative through line in the movie, which opens with a kind of prelude set in a single-room public bathroom. She’s parked on the toilet, and she and her mother, Lucia (Iazua Larios), are chatting and laughing. Lucia tells Sol to finish (“push it out”), encouragement that amusingly evokes Freud’s theory about the anal-retentive stage. Whether Avilés herself is pushing, as it were, a Freudian take or not, the scene works as a run-up to what follows. Sol’s childhood reality is expectedly circumscribed, its limits expressed by the boxy aspect ratio and the closely attentive, hovering camerawork. Her reality is also changing, as becomes painfully clear by the contrast between her mother and her fast-fading father.
Freud aside, the bathroom scene exemplifies Avilés’s oblique approach to storytelling. After Sol’s mother drops her off, the girl wanders through the house, the camera often at her side. In the kitchen, she watches the aunt (Montserrat Marañon) who’s making the cake (smoke soon starts billowing from the oven) while keeping an eye on her young daughter. Sol continues her drifting as she peeps into rooms and listens in on adult conversations, a child explorer in a strange land. She can seem very alone, never more so than when the movie leaves her to focus on the intimate parent-child dynamic between Tona, a painter, and his lovingly attentive nurse, Cruz (Teresita Sánchez).
It’s never fully clear how much Sol understands about her father’s condition, though in one scene her relatives argue about Tona’s treatment as she stands quietly near them, seen (at least by you) and not heard. All that matters to Sol, who hasn’t been allowed to see Tona as often as she wants, is that she loves him. He loves her, in turn, but his suffering bears down on him like a massive weight, and he has very little left to give his daughter other than a delicate embrace and one of his canvases. Pain radiates off his wasting body, clouds everyone’s faces, dictates the urgency in their voices, threatens the household’s brittle normalcy.

CLLSGP7CSR_DH4YVHLGMWAE94B,A Border Wall to the North? Republicans Want to Discuss.,"By Jazmine UlloaReporting from Pittsburg, N.H., just south of the U.S.-Canada border.","Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/nikki-haley-border-canada.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump paved a path to the presidency in 2016 by calling for a “big, beautiful wall” along the United States border with Mexico.
His 2024 rivals in the Republican primary election, scrapping for every advantage against him, looked north.
Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, has frequently told voters that it’s not just the southern border that needs stepped-up enforcement — “it’s the northern border, too.”
“I think we do whatever it takes to keep people out,” she told reporters on Saturday when asked if her comments meant she supported building a wall. “If that’s what it takes to keep them out, we will do a wall, we will do any sort of border patrol that we need to have.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who ended his bid and endorsed Mr. Trump on Sunday after battling with Ms. Haley for second place behind the former president, had recently suggested building a wall along some trouble spots of the U.S.-Canada frontier. Vivek Ramaswamy, a tech entrepreneur, dropped out of the race last week, but not before trekking up to Pittsburg, N.H., a tiny town that sits just below the jagged, 5,500-mile line that divides the United States and Canada, with a camera crew in tow. He later drew criticism from Canadian journalists and pundits when he proclaimed that the United States should not just build one wall, but two.
In Pittsburg, where residents like Beverly Martin, 79, and Chip Jones, 74, sat at the bar in an eclectic, barnlike restaurant on a recent snowy afternoon, the idea of a border wall along New Hampshire’s northernmost boundary, an isolated, forested region, was anathema.

DBHXO0MHV7_77A3IVZ8XGHJLJV,"As China’s Markets Stumble, Japan Rises Toward Record","By Joe Rennison and Alexandra StevensonJoe Rennison, who covers markets, reported from New York. Alexandra Stevenson, who writes about China, reported from Hong Kong.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/japan-nikkei-china-hang-seng.html,"There’s a shift underway in Asia that’s reverberating through global financial markets.
Japan’s stock market, overlooked by investors for decades, is making a furious comeback. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index is edging closer to the record it set on Dec. 29, 1989, which effectively marked the peak of Japan’s economic ascendancy before a collapse that led to decades of low growth.
China, long an impossible-to-ignore market, has been spiraling downward. Stocks in China recently touched lows not seen since a rout in 2015, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was the worst-performing major market in the world last year. Stocks stemmed their slide only when Beijing recently signaled its intention to intervene but remain far below previous highs.
This year was set to be a tumultuous one for global markets, with unpredictable swings as economic fortunes diverge and voters in more than 50 countries go to the polls. But there’s one unforeseen reversal already underway: a change in perception among investors about China and Japan.
Seizing on this shift, Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, addressed more than 3,000 global financiers gathered in Hong Kong this week for a conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs. It was the first time a Japanese prime minister had given a keynote address at the event.
“Now Japan has a golden opportunity to completely overcome low economic growth and a deflationary environment that have persisted for a quarter of a century,” Mr. Kishida said in a video recording. His government, he said, would “demonstrate to all of you Japan’s transition to a new economic stage by mobilizing all the policy tools.”
It’s the kind of message that Japan has been honing for a decade, and now investors want to hear more of it. Foreign investors pumped $2.6 billion into the Japanese stock market last week, adding to $6.5 billion the week before, according to data from Japan Exchange Group. That is a stark shift from the roughly $3.6 billion that was yanked out in December.

DENSCO1N2V_53UJX8QVVKIX1XL,This ‘Expats’ Star Can’t Believe She’s Actually in It,By Robert ItoReporting from Los Angeles,"Published Jan. 24, 2024Updated Jan. 25, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/television/expats-ji-young-yoo-profile.html,"In “Expats,” the actress Ji-young Yoo, a relative newcomer to Hollywood, shares the screen with Nicole Kidman, the Oscar- and Emmy-winning actress and producer. Yoo plays Mercy, a Columbia grad and would-be babysitter for the young son of Kidman’s Margaret, a former landscape architect and a mother of three living, none too happily, in Hong Kong. When Mercy loses her charge in a moment of distraction (yes, she was texting), it sends Margaret into — well, just imagine how Nicole Kidman might react if, say, you were texting and you lost her child.
Yoo, 24, and a film student only a few years ago — “I used to watch ‘Moulin Rouge’ with my mom constantly,” she said — finds all of it difficult to believe even now, two years after shooting wrapped on the six-episode miniseries.
“When I watch the scenes with me and Nicole, it still feels like I was Photoshopped in,” she said in an interview last month.
Premiering on Friday, the Amazon series tells the story of three women, all of them expatriates, living in Hong Kong amid the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. It is Yoo’s first starring role in a series — she is one of three leads, with Kidman and Sarayu Blue (“To All the Boys”) — and also the director Lulu Wang’s first project since her critically acclaimed 2019 sleeper hit “The Farewell.”
“Lulu was really particular about who she wanted,” Kidman wrote in an email. “The minute we saw Ji-young’s audition, it was just, ‘Well, here she is.’ It was effortless.”
“In many ways, I think Ji-young is Mercy,” Wang said.
“She’s got the wit and the sarcasm of Mercy,” Wang continued. “And she’s got that Mona Lisa smile, where you’re not quite sure if she’s smiling or frowning.”

DH00WXJAW0_GR202CQ6G4OHU6E,The Sleepy Copyright Office in the Middle of a High-Stakes Clash Over A.I.,By Cecilia KangReporting on A.I and public policy from Washington,"Published Jan. 25, 2024Updated Jan. 26, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/ai-copyright-office-law.html,"For decades, the Copyright Office has been a small and sleepy office within the Library of Congress. Each year, the agency’s 450 employees register roughly half a million copyrights, the ownership rights for creative works, based on a two-centuries-old law.
Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.
In recent months, however, the office has suddenly found itself in the spotlight. Lobbyists for Microsoft, Google, and the music and news industries have asked to meet with Shira Perlmutter, the register of copyrights, and her staff. Thousands of artists, musicians and tech executives have written to the agency, and hundreds have asked to speak at listening sessions hosted by the office.
The attention stems from a first-of-its-kind review of copyright law that the Copyright Office is conducting in the age of artificial intelligence. The technology — which feeds off creative content — has upended traditional norms around copyright, which gives owners of books, movies and music the exclusive ability to distribute and copy their works.
The agency plans to put out three reports this year revealing its position on copyright law in relation to A.I. The reports are set to be hugely consequential, weighing heavily in courts as well as with lawmakers and regulators.
“We are now finding ourselves the subject of a lot of attention from the broader general public, so it is a very exciting and challenging time,” Ms. Perlmutter said.

DK7158D80V_U8P7FTX37PEE8G3,Trump’s Defamation Trial Delayed Until Thursday,By Benjamin Weiser,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/trumps-defamation-e-jean-carroll.html,"The trial of E. Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit against Donald J. Trump has been postponed for another day and will resume Thursday, a federal court announced on Tuesday.
The court did not offer a reason for the additional delay, but the trial was originally postponed for a day after Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said in court Monday that a juror had reported flulike symptoms and would be getting a Covid test.
Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, who said on Monday that her client wanted to testify but needed to be in New Hampshire for that state’s primary the next day, had asked that Mr. Trump be allowed to testify on Wednesday.
The former president, who is running for a return to the White House, has been alternating campaign stops with court appearances, using his time in the courtroom as an opportunity to reach voters and complain that he is being mistreated.
If Mr. Trump testifies, that would be likely to occur on Thursday or perhaps Friday if the court holds trial that day.
The condition of the juror who said he was ill is unknown. He had reported feeling hot and nauseated, the judge said in court on Monday.
Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, said in court that she wants the trial to move along as quickly as possible."
DQ7PJFYXV6_PV2E55E08XPIDCN,Trump Rakes In Endorsements in Final Hours Before New Hampshire Votes,By Anjali Huynh,"Published Jan. 22, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/trump-2024-endorsements-desantis.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump has received a flood of endorsements in the final countdown to New Hampshire’s primary, as his allies argue that the 2024 Republican nominating contest is all but over.
After Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida backed Mr. Trump in his announcement Sunday that he was quitting the race, a number of his former supporters, including Representative Bob Good of Virginia and Ashley Moody, the Florida attorney general, followed suit.
Representative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, the only member of its congressional delegation who had not yet endorsed, also backed Mr. Trump — making him the seventh of the state’s eight Republican members of Congress to do so. Only one, Representative Ralph Norman, has backed Nikki Haley, the state’s former governor and Mr. Trump’s last remaining rival.
Additional endorsements for Mr. Trump poured in on Monday from Republicans from statehouses to Congress. In Georgia, the agriculture commissioner and almost half of its Republican State Senate delegation announced their endorsements of Mr. Trump on Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Mr. Trump’s earlier supporters have seized on Mr. DeSantis’s departure from the race to declare Mr. Trump the “presumptive nominee,” though only Iowa has voted so far. Mr. Trump already has the support of Speaker Mike Johnson and a majority of congressional Republicans. After Mr. Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas joined the list of backers.
Three of Mr. Trump’s former 2024 rivals for president — Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina; Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota; and Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur — have also lined up behind him. In a closing show of unity among the rest of the G.O.P. field, all three of those men will appear alongside Mr. Trump on Monday night at a rally in Laconia, N.H., according to officials with the Trump campaign.

DRFY1EIA0I_DCCMLZ3519HHYNU,Boeing Faces Backlash From Airline Chiefs,By Santul Nerkar and Bernhard Warner,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/business/dealbook/boeing-max-9-airlines.html,"Airline bosses have lashed out at Boeing over a streak of safety and production problems — loose bolts, a discarded wrench found under the floorboards, delayed shipments — as scrutiny over the company’s manufacturing processes intensifies.
“I am angry,” Ben Minicucci, the chief executive of Alaska Airlines, told NBC News on Tuesday after the carrier found “many” loose bolts while checking its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners after a door plug flew off one of the planes in midair on Jan. 5. “My demand on Boeing is, What are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house?”
After the incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded around 170 Max 9 jets until they are inspected and said it would investigate whether Boeing failed to ensure that the plane was safe.
Scott Kirby, the United Airlines chief executive, told CNBC on Tuesday that the Max 9 grounding was “probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us.” He also criticized production delays of another Boeing aircraft the airline had ordered, the Max 10, saying he doubted the planes would be delivered anytime soon.
“We’re going to at least build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it,” Mr. Kirby said.
It’s an uncommon escalation: Airlines and their manufacturers typically enjoy a symbiotic relationship, with carriers often competing with one another to place orders for new jets, which can have yearslong wait lists. Along with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, Boeing makes the majority of the world’s commercial jets, limiting options for airlines that are seeking new planes.
“Boeing’s maintenance and production faults over the last few months are unprecedented, so it’s not surprising that airlines are beyond frustrated and taking unprecedented behavior themselves,” said Xavier Smith, director of energy and industrials research at AlphaSense.

DSUNB9APQB_QZ36VLVJ3YUDFDQ,Are His Parents Responsible? A Mass Shooter’s Mother Goes on Trial.,By Campbell Robertson,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/oxford-michigan-shooting-crumbley-parents.html,"The trial of Jennifer Crumbley, whose son carried out the worst school shooting in Michigan history, began on Thursday with dueling portraits: one of a mother whose negligence was so extreme that it caused a tragedy, and another of a good, even “hypervigilant” mother who was in the dark about her son’s troubles until that tragedy unfolded.
These starkly different images were presented to jurors in a courtroom in Pontiac, Mich., about 20 miles south of Oxford High School, where the mass shooting took place on Nov. 30, 2021.
While the case centered on a momentous legal question — whether parents should be held criminally liable for violent crimes committed by their children — the horror of that day in Oxford hung over the first day of testimony in the trial. School employees, including one who was shot in the arm, testified of the terror they experienced, and surveillance videos of the shooting were played, showing some of the victims.
The shooter, Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 at the time, killed four students and injured seven others. He pleaded guilty to 24 charges, including first-degree murder, and was sentenced last month to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The cases against Ms. Crumbley and her husband, James Crumbley, are at the leading edge of a push by some prosecutors to hold parents accountable when they are suspected of enabling deadly violence by their children. Just in the last few months, parents whose children carried out gun violence in other states have pleaded guilty to charges of reckless conduct or neglect.
In the Michigan trial, Ms. Crumbley, 45, faces more serious charges: four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors say that despite glaring signals of Ethan’s violent intentions, his mother’s failures to take “just ordinary care” to act on what she knew made her criminally liable for the carnage at Oxford High School. In charging her with manslaughter, they are arguing that her behavior was “a cause” of the killings.

DTOIUG4GYE_S9TG7TLI847HHKP,The Early Race for 2028,By Adam Nagourney,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/us/politics/desantis-haley-2028.html,"The race for the Republican presidential nomination is not quite over — notwithstanding what Donald Trump and many Republican leaders have asserted since Trump’s victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Nikki Haley is still running and attacking the former president as she moves around South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary on Feb. 24.
But for all that, it’s never too early to cast an eye on another competition playing out in the background: the early race for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination, in particular the contest between Trump’s two strongest rivals, Haley and Ron DeSantis.
How Haley, the former United Nations ambassador, and DeSantis, the governor of Florida, emerge from this contest, and particularly how they manage their relations with Trump, could have significant bearing on how they are positioned to run in 2028, should they decide to jump into the presidential pool again, as they are widely expected to do.
If Trump secures the nomination and wins in November, the 22nd Amendment says he will have to leave the White House after the 2028 election. If he loses in 2024, he could run again in 2028; at that point, though, he would be a two-time loser.
For DeSantis, who made an early departure from the race for president, the verdict is mostly set. For Haley, who is soldiering along in South Carolina, it is still being decided.
DeSantis stepped out of the race early in the hopes of not antagonizing Trump and his supporters. Throughout the primary, he ran as a Trump-like candidate, and depending what happens over the next four years, he could present himself the same way in 2028.

Almost 4,000 paintings belonging to the National Gallery of Abkhazia were destroyed when a fire swept through an exhibition hall in central Sukhumi, the region’s capital, Abkhazia’s acting culture minister said in a statement.
The minister, Dinara Smyr, said that those included 300 works by Aleksandr Chachba-Sharvashidze, a celebrated Abkhazian artist and stage designer, who worked with renowned artists and theaters in Russia and France. “This is an irreparable loss for Abkhazia’s national culture,” she said. The National Gallery is more of a storage space than a museum, however.
Residents rushed to the scene on Sunday to rescue paintings, but only 200 artworks were removed from the burning building. Photos from the scene, released by Apsnypress, a local news agency, showed people carrying framed canvases, some charred and burned.
Local law enforcement officials said they were investigating all possible causes, including arson. The director of the gallery, Suram Sakaniya, blamed a short circuit for the fire, according to the news agency.

DXXNBSPD2P_OAPK8NCE2M0X05P,Orban Uses Sweden’s NATO Bid to Take Center Stage in Europe,By Andrew Higgins,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/europe/hungary-sweden-nato-orban.html,"Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary pledged on Wednesday to push legislators to vote for Sweden’s admittance into NATO, as he faced mounting pressure as the last holdout blocking its entry to the military alliance.
But Mr. Orban’s intervention, which offered no timeline for a vote and repeated a longstanding assertion that a final decision is not his to make, even though he essentially controls Parliament, left unanswered a question that has shadowed Hungary’s long foot-dragging over NATO’s expansion.
Why “are we messing with the Swedes?” an opposition legislator, Tamas Harangozo, asked nearly a year ago when Mr. Orban’s party, whose large majority in Parliament invariably follows his instructions, abruptly dropped plans to vote on Sweden’s NATO membership.
That question took on urgent relevance this week when Turkey’s Parliament voted to accept Sweden into NATO. That left Hungary as the last big obstacle impeding efforts to boost Europe’s security in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Mr. Orban has often said he wanted Sweden to join NATO, but that his legislators were “not enthusiastic,” blaming Hungary’s repeated delays in accepting Sweden on lawmakers’ right to make their own decisions.
It was unclear whether Mr. Orban’s remarks Wednesday, posted on social media, meant that the Parliament — which is in recess and not scheduled to return until Feb. 15 — would swiftly vote on Sweden’s membership.

DY22DL4S8O_KYSKRTXUJMTAI0M,How Donald Trump Divided Republicans on Immigration,By Annie Karni,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/briefing/trump-immigration.html,"Just as senators were closing in on a deal that Republican negotiators said would constitute the most conservative border security bill in decades, Donald Trump was closing in on the G.O.P. presidential nomination.
And his vocal opposition to the compromise, which would also send tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, now threatens the chances of the entire package in a divided Congress.
Trump’s twin primary victories have forced Republicans to once again fall in line. Now, he is wielding a heavier hand over his party’s agenda in Congress than at any other time since leaving office.
Republicans are “in a quandary,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, told his conference in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, according to lawmakers who attended. What was supposed to be the sweetener for conservatives opposed to sending tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine had become as politically treacherous as the foreign aid itself, he said. Trump’s growing influence was dividing Republicans on an issue that once united the party.
Trump burst onto the national political scene in 2015 with a dark warning about dangerous immigrants invading the country’s Southern border and with a slogan that outlasted them all, “Build the Wall.” More than eight years later, he is agitating against compromise: “We need a Strong, Powerful, and essentially ‘PERFECT’ Border and, unless we get that, we are better off not making a Deal,” he wrote on social media.
With more than half of Senate Republicans now officially backing Trump’s candidacy, those entreaties are becoming harder to ignore as mere prattle from Palm Beach.

DZ7QYRB85N_PVLQ3EV6UFKPS6U,Russian Missiles Hit Ukrainian Cities Amid Fears Over Air Defenses,"By Maria VarenikovaReporting from Kyiv, Ukraine","Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/europe/russia-ukraine-missile-strikes.html,"Russia launched a combination of cruise and ballistic missiles at Ukrainian cities on Tuesday in a large volley that killed at least 19 people and injured another 120, according to local authorities. The assault added to concerns about the state of Ukraine’s air defenses as Russian barrages continue on its largest cities.
Ukraine’s air force said that 41 missiles had entered the country’s airspace early Tuesday. The Ukrainian authorities provide details of cruise missiles in flight, and residents can track them for about an hour as they fly from Russia. The ballistic missiles, which travel much faster, struck in Kyiv on Tuesday just as the cruise missiles arrived.
Yuriy Ihnat, an air force spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the military had intercepted only about half of the total barrage, and just five of the 24 ballistic missiles. That was a lower success rate for Ukraine than achieved against earlier bombardments, because ballistic missiles, which are harder to intercept, made up a higher proportion of Tuesday’s volley, he said.
“Most of missiles were ballistic, and our air force can’t down them all,” Mr. Ihnat said.
In Kyiv, the capital, at least one missile appeared to detonate at ground level, residents said, although it was unclear whether it had evaded Ukraine’s air defenses or whether the warhead fell and blew up after the missile was destroyed in the air.
Concern has grown in Ukraine that air defense ammunition will run low as further military aid from the United States remains stalled in Congress. Mr. Ihnat said that the air force had not run out of ammunition in Tuesday’s assault, but that Ukraine did require a regular resupply.
He also said that not all of the missiles that evaded Ukraine’s defenses had hit their targets. “Many of them just fell in the fields, as Russian missiles’ quality has decreased,” he said.

E24WTR15GN_W5RMLOSIW0XDWPC,Israel and Hamas’s Cease-Fire and Hostage Deal Proposals: What to Know,"By Aaron Boxerman, Patrick Kingsley and Adam Rasgonreporting from Jerusalem","Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-ceasefire-talks.html,"The director of the C.I.A. is set to make a renewed push for negotiations over the release of hostages held in Gaza and an extended cease-fire, according to U.S. officials, who said he would meet with senior Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials in Europe.
The officials hope to close a wide gap between Israel and Hamas, especially on two issues: the length of any pause in fighting and the fate of Hamas leaders in Gaza, according to officials briefed on the talks.
Here is a look at where the talks stand.
A weeklong truce in November allowed the release of more than 100 of the hostages abducted in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel; 240 Palestinian prisoners were released as part of that deal. Since then, both sides have staked out seemingly intractable positions for another such agreement.
The talks have advanced in fits and starts, with the leader of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency meeting with Qatari officials in both Qatar and Europe. Many of Hamas’s political leaders are based in Qatar. Egypt, which borders the Gaza Strip, has also played a key role.
William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, is going to meet with senior Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari officials, according to U.S. officials. They said Israel’s apparent willingness to agree to a longer cessation of hostilities as part of any further hostage releases has created a new opening for negotiations.
Any new deal would likely include phased releases of hostages, though the White House is hoping that a bigger deal, leading to the release of the remaining hostages, might be possible. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy.

E42XR6N6DX_8XEY767LNDAE2KL,"After Freeze Grips Much of U.S., a Warm Respite Beckons",By Jesus Jiménez and Judson JonesJudson Jones is a meteorologist and reporter for The Times.,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/cold-weather-temperatures-forecast.html,"In Dallas, where temperatures dropped as low as 10 degrees last week, highs were forecast to reach the 60s on Wednesday. In New York City, where the low dropped to 17 on Wednesday, unseasonably high temperatures in the 50s were expected by Thursday. And in St. Louis, which was covered in ice on Monday, a high of 50 was expected on Wednesday.
Forget climate change. That’s climate whiplash.
It may be disorienting, but for many it is not unwelcome. Sitting in a frigid Bryant Park in New York City on Monday, Adia Rafio, 26, of Queens said she was considering making outdoor plans later this week.
“I’m definitely going to take advantage,” she said as workers shoveled snow and ice nearby. “Winter is really wintering right now.”
After a mass of Arctic air gripped much of the country last week, a large swath of the United States was expecting significantly warmer weather in the next few days, according to forecasters.
Some cities could see temperature swings of more than 50 degrees. In Little Rock, Ark., which dropped to 1 degree on Wednesday, temperatures were expected to rise into to the 50s by Tuesday and into the 60s by Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Cities in the Northeast, including New York and Washington, were expected to have highs about 10 to 15 degrees above normal, according to the Weather Service.
With that warmer weather, many outdoor spaces were preparing for more visitors, who might be tired of huddling indoors to stay out of the cold. Jim Breheny, director of the Bronx Zoo, said that more visitors were expected later this week when temperatures rise.

E5BN27CZNE_B0HRDXXG1JXA84R,Israel Says Its Military Has Encircled Khan Younis in Gaza,By Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Ameera Harouda,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/middleeast/israel-khan-younis-gaza.html,"Israel’s military said on Tuesday that it had encircled the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, part of a push that has resulted in intense fighting and bombardments in an area packed with civilians who have fled their homes in other parts of the territory.
The Israeli military described the area as a “significant stronghold” of Hamas’s Khan Younis brigade and said that it had killed dozens of Hamas fighters over the previous 24 hours. The military’s claims could not be independently verified.
Israeli forces “targeted terrorist cells carrying R.P.G.s near the troops, those launching anti-tank missiles, and terror operatives who had rigged compounds with explosives,” the military said in a statement, referring to rocket-propelled grenade launchers. “Ready-to-launch rockets, military compounds, shafts, and numerous weapons were located during the activity,” the military added.
The fighting has involved heavy exchanges of gunfire and a surge of Israeli tanks and troops into areas around the city’s hospitals. Displaced civilians in the area say they have no safe place to go.
Eman Jawad, who is sheltering in an industrial zone in Khan Younis, said that Israeli forces surrounded her shelter on Sunday night and heavy clashes broke out with Hamas fighters. She said the fighting was so close that several tents housing displaced people went up in flames.
“We are trapped,” Ms. Jawad said in a voice message on Monday. “There are snipers on the streets and we are not allowed to leave the industrial zone.”

E66FOQ168N_K00CLBIJ1L071TJ,Bettina Was Much More Than an Eccentric of the Chelsea Hotel,By Alex Vadukul,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/style/bettina-chelsea-hotel-ulrik-exhibit.html,"One night in November, a procession of young artists, critics and curators climbed the creaky stairs of a building in Chinatown in Lower Manhattan to attend an opening at a buzzy little gallery, Ulrik. The show, “Bettina: New York 1965–86,” was made up of rarely seen photographs and sculptures by an enigmatic artist who lived for five decades at the fabled Chelsea Hotel, where she created her works in a cluttered fifth-floor apartment until her death in 2021.
Writers for Artforum and Frieze pushed through the crowd to get glimpses of the black-and-white street photography. Students from Pratt Institute drank cans of Budweiser as they studied the wavelike wood sculptures. A Museum of Modern Art curator watched grainy footage of the artist in 1976 while she filmed herself taking the very photos of Manhattan skyscrapers now displayed in the exhibit.
The show’s gallerists, Anya Komar, 37, and Alex Fleming, 39, sold three pieces right out of the gate. A few of Bettina’s old Chelsea Hotel neighbors showed up, including her longtime caretaker, Rachel Cohen, a jewelry and eyewear designer who has lived in the building since the 1970s.
“Everyone at the Chelsea Hotel knew Bettina’s art needed to be appreciated, but for some reason, it didn’t happen for her,” Ms. Cohen, 74, said after the opening. “So that night at the gallery seemed impossible to me. Everyone was so young and different. I was happy to see her art appreciated. Bettina wasn’t an easy person. She was rarely delighted by anything, but I think she would have loved it.”
“I think most who came that night didn’t know much about her life,” she continued, “so they were just seeing her art itself, and they couldn’t judge it by her life at the Chelsea Hotel.”

E72FIZRGJ3_POR4CKEM9Z5RHBT,G.O.P. Infighting and Democratic Mischief Animate Montana Senate Race,By Michael C. BenderReporting from Washington,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/montana-senate-race-matt-rosendale-ads.html,"In one of the nation’s top Senate races, the most important candidate might be one who hasn’t actually entered the contest.
The scramble to challenge Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana — already a heated battle with profound national implications and the acute intensity of a family drama — has increasingly focused on Representative Matt Rosendale, an anti-abortion, election-denying Republican agitator.
Both parties are using him as a pawn in their electoral chess match: Establishment Republicans, who have aligned behind Tim Sheehy, a wealthy businessman, are trying to keep Mr. Rosendale out of the race, while Democrats appear to be helping clear a path for his arrival.
Mr. Rosendale’s entry appears imminent. On Thursday, he said on a podcast that he had told Senator Steve Daines, a fellow Montanan who oversees the Republican Senate campaign arm, that he was going to run for Mr. Tester’s seat.
Such a move would complicate plans from Mr. Daines, who has been trying to avoid divisive primaries and the elevation of polarizing far-right candidates. Often endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump, such candidates have won Republican primaries in recent cycles only to fall short in general elections decided by moderate swing voters.
This year, Republicans have an advantageous map as they look to retake control of the Senate, where the races seen as most competitive are in two states — Montana and Ohio — that Mr. Trump won easily in 2016 and 2020. But the Democrats who hold those seats, Mr. Tester and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, are both popular and have experience navigating rugged political terrain.

EGI75EH7OG_9RRUQDBV0LM32R9,"‘True Detective’ Season 4, Episode 2 Recap: ‘Corpsicle’",By Scott Tobias,"Published Jan. 21, 2024Updated Jan. 26, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/arts/television/true-detective-recap-episode-2.html,"During last week’s episode, as Liz and her team were puzzling over the sudden disappearance of eight scientists at the Tsalal Research Station, Hank mused, “Just the third day of darkness and it’s already getting weird.” Based on some of the mysterious events we witnessed that episode, like the gyrating spirit that leads Rose to a grisly tableaux of frozen bodies, a word like “weird” seems woefully insufficient. One question we might have asked ourselves was whether “Night Country” would become a genuine ghost story or a hybrid, blending the noir sleuthing of previous “True Detective” seasons with mere intimations of the supernatural.
This second hour throws a little bit of ice-cold water on the weird stuff, at least insofar as it pertains to the deaths of these scientists and the unsolved murder of Annie, a young Inupiaq activist. That’s not to say that the uncanny won’t be an important part of the show, but it seems more folded into the ambience of this sunless locale than a literal explanation for the violence happening within it. When Navarro asks Rose about Travis, an ex-lover who turns up to her as a spirit, it is blithely accepted that such ghosts can appear in the darkness from time to time.
“I think the world is getting old,” explains Rose, “and Ennis is where the fabric of all things is coming apart at the seams.” In other words, “Night Country” seems to be a waxing philosophical in the “True Detective” tradition, but the end-of-the-earth environs inspire thoughts that are tied more to Indigenous myths and frostbit hallucinations.
As for the case itself, there’s a lot of strong, meat-and-potatoes procedural work in this episode that suggests it can be solved. And in the process of solving it, we can learn more about Danvers and Navarro, who remain inextricably at odds but have similar appetites for pursuing justice under terrible circumstances and blowing off steam with lovers they keep at arm’s length. The show no longer seems in danger of drifting into the inexplicable.
The episode begins with the folly of small-town cops working a big-time crime scene, which requires both the delicacy of an archaeological dig and the inelegant prying of a chain saw that can carve through ice. Frozen limbs can snap off like brittle twigs, and Danvers’s dimmer underlings, who have never imagined such a spectacle, have to be told not to snap selfies. (“This is a crime scene,” she tells them. “Why don’t you pretend like you know what you’re doing?”)
If Danvers had any sense of self-preservation, she would punt the case to Anchorage, not only because it has a forensics team but also because she won’t have to endure the intense scrutiny of sorting through such a vexing mystery. But it’s an itch that she absolutely needs to scratch, just as Navarro cannot let go of her responsibility to Annie.

EGS90ZNT32_0HMV5BNAP6RDKE5,Is Cryptocurrency Like Stocks and Bonds? Courts Move Closer to an Answer.,"By Matthew Goldstein and David Yaffe-BellanyMatthew Goldstein covers finance, and David Yaffe-Bellany covers the crypto industry.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/technology/cryptocurrency-stocks-bonds-courts-move-closer-to-an-answer.html,"For more than a decade, the pioneers of the cryptocurrency industry envisioned digital coins as an alternate branch of finance, a renegade sector that would operate outside the reach of big banks and government regulators.
But as digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ether became more mainstream, the crypto industry collided with a 1946 Supreme Court decision that created what is known as the Howey Test, a legal analysis that determines when a financial product becomes subject to the same strict rules as stocks and bonds.
In recent years, regulators have seized on that legal precedent to argue that cryptocurrencies are just another security, like shares of Apple or General Motors. The crypto industry has fought back, leaving it in a legal gray zone with an uncertain future in the United States.
Now the long-running dispute is edging closer to a resolution, as federal judges begin weighing in on a series of lawsuits by the nation’s top securities regulator against some of the largest crypto firms. This month, judges held hearings in two of the most consequential cases, which could dictate whether the multitrillion-dollar crypto industry can continue growing in the United States.
The legal battles are “an existential issue for crypto,” said Hilary Allen, a professor at American University who specializes in financial regulation.
The court fights intensified over the last 18 months, as the Securities and Exchange Commission brought enforcement lawsuits claiming that crypto companies were operating as unregulated securities businesses. In response, the industry argued that laws governing Wall Street trading shouldn’t apply to digital currencies. Both sides scored early court victories that left the matter unsettled.

EQV7S6Y929_8YG030NIGTQ7592,Worries in Europe Over the White House Move to Delay Gas Terminals,By Stanley Reed,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/europe-biden-lng-pause.html,"The Biden administration’s decision to delay approval of new liquefied natural gas terminals in the United States has been hailed as a major victory for environmental advocacy groups, but it is creating unease outside the United States about future energy supplies.
“I think U.S. allies and trade partners will have some concerns about this, because in the past two years U.S. L.N.G. exports have been a real boon to global energy security,” said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow in the energy security and climate change program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research institution in Washington.
The Biden administration’s move on Friday to pause the permitting process for new liquefied natural gas export facilities is not expected to have an impact on global gas supplies soon. But it could create uncertainty, especially in Europe, which has only recently weathered a major energy shock after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago.
Interruptions of gas supplies from Russia in 2022 contributed to soaring energy prices in Europe, especially for electric power, that hurt businesses and consumers and pushed governments to spend heavily to ease energy bills. Tankers full of liquefied gas from the United States helped mitigate what could have been a dire situation.
Given this history, potential restrictions on gas supplies from the United States would be “a huge concern,” said Fredrik Persson, the president of BusinessEurope, the continent’s largest business group.
Over the last two years, an enormous surge in liquefied gas exports from the United States helped Europe largely replace flows of natural gas from Russia, which had been Europe’s mainstay supplier of the fuel. According to Kpler, a research firm, U.S. gas exports to Europe more than doubled from 2021 to 2022, to about 52 million metric tons, and then increased modestly in 2023. These shipments have “been key in stopping Russia from forcing Europe down on its knees with using energy as a geopolitical weapon,” Mr. Persson said.

EXX4O7AV02_HFGF7AYS3HFIWBP,Why Nikki Haley Has So Few Friends Left in South Carolina Politics,"By Jonathan Weisman and Sharon LaFraniereJonathan Weisman reported from Charleston. Sharon LaFraniere reported from Charleston and Columbia, S.C.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/us/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump-south-carolina-campaign.html,"The stories pile up one after another, of thanks not offered, allies antagonized, opponents not forgiven — a portrait of a politician who climbed the ladder with speed and skill but failed to ensure that the people who helped her would have her back if she needed them.
Now that politician, Nikki Haley, has returned to her home state of South Carolina in desperate need of support in high places to revive her flagging quest for the presidency.
She is finding little of it.
The man who had been her lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, signed on with Donald J. Trump long ago. The backbench House member she plucked from a crowded field of South Carolina contenders to put into the United States Senate, Tim Scott, endorsed Mr. Trump just days before the crucial New Hampshire primary, and stood behind him Tuesday night as the former president mocked Ms. Haley’s dress.
The congresswoman whose career was rescued from a Trump-backed challenger in 2022 by a timely Haley endorsement, Nancy Mace, has also sided with Mr. Trump, a man she once said needed to be held to account for the riot of Jan. 6, 2021.
“She was good on economic development but not great on cultivating relationships,” Chip Felkel, a longtime Republican political consultant and Trump critic, said of Ms. Haley. “She forgot who helped her get here.”
In the rough-and-tumble politics of South Carolina, the 12 years that Ms. Haley spent as a state representative, then as the youngest governor in the country, were remarkable. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Ms. Haley repeatedly defied expectations as she took on an entrenched old guard in the Deep South. She edged out much better known Republican politicians running first for the legislature, then for governor, and was resoundingly elected to her second term — a rise so meteoric that her campaign sells T-shirts that read “Underestimate Me, That’ll Be Fun.”

EZL09SDWS5_KKH0H68E1TFNXE6,Cruise Says Hostility to Regulators Led to Grounding of Its Autonomous Cars,By Tripp Mickle and Cade MetzReporting from San Francisco,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/cruise-crash-report-san-francisco.html,"Cruise, the driverless car subsidiary of General Motors, said in a report on Thursday that an adversarial approach taken by its top executives toward regulators had led to a cascade of events that ended with a nationwide suspension of Cruise’s fleet and investigations by California and federal authorities, including the Justice Department.
The roughly 100-page report was compiled by a law firm that Cruise and G.M. hired to look into whether Cruise’s executives had misled California regulators about an October crash in San Francisco in which one of its vehicles dragged a woman 20 feet. The review found that while the executives had not intentionally misled state officials, they had failed to explain key details about the incident.
In meetings with regulators, the executives let a video of the crash “speak for itself” rather than fully explain how one of its vehicles — part of Cruise’s autonomous taxi service in the city — severely injured the pedestrian. The executives later fixated on protecting Cruise’s reputation rather than giving a full account of the incident to the public and media, according to the report, which was written by the Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan law firm.
Cruise also said the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as state agencies and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, were investigating how it had handled the incident.
The report is central to Cruise’s efforts to regain the public’s trust and eventually restart its business. Cruise has been largely shut down since October, when the California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended its license to operate because its vehicles were unsafe and the company misrepresented the incident. It responded by pulling its driverless cars off the road across the country, laying off a quarter of its staff and replacing Kyle Vogt, its co-founder and chief executive, who resigned in November, with new leaders.
Cruise didn’t name Mr. Vogt in a blog post summarizing the law firm’s review, but he was named throughout the report. Mr. Vogt declined to comment.

F0598573NY_62OEW8IQWAFQ609,"In Paris, Stars Going Shopping",By Vanessa FriedmanReporting from Paris,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/style/schiaparelli-dior-chanel-couture.html,"The fact that the big Oscar nominations reveal fell right in the middle of the Paris couture shows was a coincidence, but a fortuitous one. After all, ever since the end of the actors’ strike, the red carpet has been a veritable explosion of pent-up fashion fantasy. What better place to shop for that than at the couture?
Little wonder then that the celebrities (and their stylists) are back in town, swanning onto the front rows of the brands where they have relationships or want to have relationships or that are trying to lure them into relationships.
Here was Zendaya, scoping out the interplanetary Western-wear at Schiaparelli in a gown straight from the runway complete with train swishing like a horse’s tail, along with her creative director, Law Roach; there was Jennifer Lopez, ogling the brand’s curvy crystal gown with a face-framing paparazzi shield on one side.
Here was Rihanna, making an entrance at Dior, swarmed by so many paparazzi that she was impossible to see — at least until she halted in front of Vogue’s Anna Wintour to pay her respects before taking in the mid-century-inspired moirés. And there was Gwyneth Paltrow at Armani Privé, where the previous couture collection, a celebration of roses, already supplied many an awards entrance moment. How to top that? With evermore glittering wisps of lace, organza and crystalline net fit for a dance of the sugarcoated-chinoiserie-plum mermaids (and the mothers of their brides) apparently.
Little wonder that Chanel’s Virginie Viard enlisted one of the brand’s ambassadors, Margaret Qualley, to open her ballerinas-in-the-1980s show, held beneath a giant monogrammed button and rife with bouclé in Jordan almond tones, leotards, white tights and tulle. Ms. Qualley has the Grammys, with her musician-husband Jack Antonoff, looming on her calendar next month. Now she has something to wear!

The Palestinian Red Crescent Society and the Gazan health ministry said many people had been killed and wounded in the city of Khan Younis on Monday, without providing specific counts. Nahed Abu Taaema, the director of surgery at Nasser Hospital, the largest hospital in southern Gaza, told Al Jazeera in a televised interview that it had received 100 wounded people and 50 bodies.
Naseem Hasan, an ambulance officer at Nasser, said in an interview that tanks were about 100 meters south of the hospital and “can target anyone.” He said one ambulance carrying a person who had been shot in the head was not able to reach Nasser this morning and had to go to a hospital in Rafah — a journey that took three hours.
In a statement, the Red Crescent said the presence of Israeli troops near Al-Amal Hospital, which it operates, meant that its ambulances could not reach the injured in Khan Younis. It said that anyone attempting to move around the area was coming under fire.
“Khan Younis is very dangerous now,” Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Red Crescent, said in an interview. “The whole district of Khan Younis is essentially besieged.”

F6ZZUQ0W5R_NUQ7TMUEQKHUUOA,"Our Rodent Selfies, Ourselves",By Emily Anthes,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/photography-rats-selfies.html,"When Augustin Lignier, a professional photographer in Paris, was in graduate school, he began to ponder the point of picture-taking in the modern world: Why did so many of us feel compelled to photograph our lives and share those images online?
It was not a novel question, but it led Mr. Lignier to a surprising place, and before long he found himself building what was, in essence, a photo booth for rats.
He took inspiration from B.F. Skinner, the famous behaviorist who had devised a test chamber to study learning in rats. The Skinner box, as it became known, dispensed food pellets when rats pushed a designated lever.
It became one of the most well-known experimental paradigms in psychology. Scientists found that reward-seeking rats became lever-pressing pros, pushing the bar down over and over again in exchange for food, drugs or even a gentle electric zap directly to the pleasure center of the brain.
Mr. Lignier built his own version of a Skinner box — a tall, transparent tower with an attached camera — and released two pet-store rats inside. Whenever the rats pressed the button inside the box, they got a small dose of sugar and the camera snapped their photo. The resulting images were immediately displayed on a screen, where the rats could see them. (“But honestly I don’t think they understood it,” Mr. Lignier said.)

FB6KSM7QL4_ZU573OSCNVPQDRR,‘Out of an Apocalyptic Movie’: San Diego Residents Describe Flood Escape,"By Vik Jolly, Corina Knoll and Tim ArangoVik Jolly reported from San Diego, and Corina Knoll and Tim Arango from Los Angeles.","Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/san-diego-flood-damage.html,"They fled to rooftops. Deserted cars in the middle of raging waters. Grabbed kayaks to traverse flooded streets. Searched for neighbors and cried out to strangers.
The rare torrent of rain that slammed the San Diego area on Monday forced numerous residents to navigate life-threatening scenes that they had trouble believing even as they recounted them.
The authorities would later call it a miracle that no one died and very few people were injured in a suddenly calamitous storm that prompted state and local leaders to declare a state of emergency.
“What happened yesterday was extraordinary,” said Todd Gloria, the mayor of San Diego.
On Tuesday, officials assessed the devastation in a region where very few residents have flood insurance. The record pace of the rainfall — a deluge of nearly three inches in three hours — had quickly overwhelmed drainage systems. According to the National Weather Service, it was the fourth greatest total for any day in recorded San Diego history, going back to 1850.
Many residents face losses that feel more impossible than their harrowing escapes. Some wondered why government officials had not done more to warn residents or call on them to evacuate before they were surrounded by floodwaters. Others were still in disbelief that their belongings were destroyed in an instant.
“Electronics, clothes, pictures, memories, everything’s gone. I lost everything in that flood,” Luis Reyes said of the apartment that he shares with his family. “All my memories are gone.”

FDYG3CN9ZG_DTOXZMSC4HFXA9A,"Lawyer and Son Ensnared Hundreds of Immigrants in Fraud Scheme, U.S. Says",By Claire Fahy,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/nyregion/bronx-immigration-lawyer-fraud.html,"A Bronx lawyer and his son were arrested on Monday and charged with orchestrating a seven-year immigration scheme that defrauded hundreds of immigrants and caused some of them to be deported, federal prosecutors said.
The lawyer, Kofi Amankwaa, 69, and his son, Kofi Amankwaa Jr., 37, advised clients seeking green cards to sign petitions under the Violence Against Women Act, which enables undocumented immigrants who are victims of abuse to gain lawful permanent residence in the United States, prosecutors said.
The petitions falsely claimed that the clients were being abused by their children, who were American citizens. The abuse claims were then used as reason for requesting permission for the clients to travel abroad, which, when granted, was used to help them apply for green cards, according to a complaint filed by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, who brought the charges.
The Amankwaas either knew the clients had not been abused or never asked whether they had been, the U.S. attorney, Damian Williams, said in a news release. The applications for legal residency were often found to be fraudulent and denied, and some of the Amankwaas’ clients were deported. Their services cost as much as $6,000, plus administrative fees, the complaint said.
Each of the two men was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of immigration fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. Both pleaded not guilty and were otherwise silent at their arraignment on Monday, where at least two other family members were present. A lawyer for the elder Mr. Amankwaa, Lauren Di Chiara, declined to comment on Monday night.
The men “sought to make a mockery of the U.S. immigration system,” said Mr. Williams, whose office conducted the investigation with the Department of Homeland Security.

FFJSOB9SRT_O68W80O1XH8C2LA,"How to Save a Sad, Lonely, Angry and Mean Society",_,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/art-culture-politics.html,"Recently, while browsing in the Museum of Modern Art store in New York, I came across a tote bag with the inscription, “You are no longer the same after experiencing art.” It’s a nice sentiment, I thought, but is it true? Or to be more specific: Does consuming art, music, literature and the rest of what we call culture make you a better person?
Ages ago, Aristotle thought it did, but these days a lot of people seem to doubt it. Surveys show that Americans are abandoning cultural institutions. Since the early 2000s, fewer and fewer people say that they visit art museums and galleries, go to see plays or attend classical music concerts, opera or ballet. College students are fleeing the humanities for the computer sciences, having apparently decided that a professional leg up is more important than the state of their souls. Many professors seem to have lost faith too. They’ve become race, class and gender political activists. The ensuing curriculum is less “How does George Eliot portray marriage?” and more “Workers of the world, unite!”
And yet I don’t buy it. I confess I still cling to the old faith that culture is vastly more important than politics or some pre-professional training in algorithms and software systems. I’m convinced that consuming culture furnishes your mind with emotional knowledge and wisdom; it helps you take a richer and more meaningful view of your own experiences; it helps you understand, at least a bit, the depths of what’s going on in the people right around you.
The novelist Alice Walker lamented that she lacked models. She wasn’t aware of enough Black female writers who could serve as exemplars and inspirations as she tried to perceive her world and tell her stories. Then she found the novelist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston, who, decades before, had pointed the way, shown her how to see and express, enabled her to write about her mother’s life, about voodoo, the structures of authentic Black folklore. Thanks to Hurston she had a new way to see, a deeper way to connect to her own heritage.
I’d argue that we have become so sad, lonely, angry and mean as a society in part because so many people have not been taught or don’t bother practicing to enter sympathetically into the minds of their fellow human beings. We’re overpoliticized while growing increasingly undermoralized, underspiritualized, undercultured.
The alternative is to rediscover the humanist code. It is based on the idea that unless you immerse yourself in the humanities, you may never confront the most important question: How should I live my life?

FOJU5GN0CJ_80WGLATK13LNKYC,"For Second Time This Month, a Politician Is Attacked in South Korea",By John Yoon and Victoria KimReporting from Seoul,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/asia/south-korea-attack-bae-hyunjin.html,"A person struck a South Korean lawmaker in the head with a blunt object in Seoul on Thursday, causing injuries that were not life-threatening, according to her staff and physicians.
Bae Hyunjin, of the ruling People Power Party, is the second South Korean politician to be physically assaulted while in public in less than a month. A suspect was detained at the scene and was being investigated by police, according to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency.
Yang Jaeyu, her chief of staff, said that the attacker approached her asking, “Are you the People Power Party lawmaker Bae Hyunjin?” twice before striking her with what he called a “rocklike object.”
Security camera footage shared by her office showed the assailant walking through a doorway closely behind her before repeatedly hitting the lawmaker as she fell over backward onto the floor and tried to resist the attack.
She was being treated at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital, Han Dong-hoon, the leader of her party, told reporters Thursday night.
“This is something that should never have happened,” he said, “and the truth needs to come out, and the culprit needs to be brought to justice.”
Ms. Bae, 40, a former anchorwoman for South Korean broadcaster MBC, is in her first term as a lawmaker. She was elected in 2020. She briefly served as a spokeswoman for then-president-elect Yoon Suk Yeol after his election in 2022.
Physicians at the hospital where she was being treated told reporters that she was conscious when she arrived at the emergency room, and that she had suffered a laceration of about a centimeter on her head, with no significant bleeding or fractures.
The chief detective of the police station in Gangnam district, where the attack happened, could not be immediately reached.
On Jan. 2, a man stabbed Lee Jae-myung, the leader of South Korea’s main opposition party, in the neck as the politician made his way through a crowd. Mr. Lee was taken to the hospital and released about eight days later. The suspect, who said he was politically motivated, was arrested and expected to be charged with attempted murder.
In a statement on social media, Mr. Lee called Thursday’s episode “unbelievable” and said, “No political terrorism of any kind is acceptable.”
Park Jung-ha, the People Power Party’s spokesman, said in a statement: “In these turbulent times of extreme politics and the politics of hate, we are deeply concerned by yet another act of violence and political terrorism.”
The attacks, just a few weeks apart against politicians on both sides of the political spectrum, could be an indication of the increasing divisions and rancor that have colored South Korean politics.
Physical attacks on politicians have been a rare occurrence in South Korea. The highest-profile incident was a 2006 attack on then-opposition leader Park Geun-hye, a conservative politician who later went on to win the presidency. She was slashed in the face by a man who was a fervent critic.

FPQ3SJHRVW_5X3LYEMYD4QXAOH,The Secretive Court Fight Roiling New York’s Democratic Socialists,By Nicholas Fandos,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/nyregion/dsa-fines-election-ny.html,"As New York socialists looked to expand an electoral beachhead in 2022, they tried something ambitious. They steered supporters to a special campaign committee set up to advance not just a single candidate, but a whole socialist slate.
The group, D.S.A. for the Many, allowed the fledgling socialist movement to act something like a major political party, pooling resources and coordinating directly with a dozen candidates. A record eight socialists ultimately won seats in the State Legislature.
But two years later, that Election Day achievement is now threatening to destabilize the movement’s financial stability, after a state elections watchdog found that the group never filed the authorizations needed to raise and spend candidate funds.
The watchdog, Michael L. Johnson of the State Board of Elections, laid out a case against D.S.A. for the Many in a previously unreported complaint last year. Now, he has asked a court in Albany to help enforce more than $300,000 in penalties, tipping the fight into public view.
At its center is a decidedly technical dispute over New York campaign finance law. But the real-world consequences could be far-reaching: The potential damages equal roughly what D.S.A. for the Many spent on the 2022 elections, and seven times its cash reserves.
Democratic socialist leaders have spent months trying to plead their innocence. They said they were still hopeful they could convince the judge, Roger D. McDonough, that they had acted in good faith when setting up the committee and followed the advice of the Board of Elections’ own representatives.

FQNF6GAX7B_XKYIU1BBJ91XAYD,Venezuela’s Highest Court Bars Opposition Leader From Running for President,By Genevieve Glatsky and Isayen Herrera,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-opposition.html,"Venezuela’s highest court ruled on Friday that a top opposition leader cannot run for president, dealing a crippling blow to prospects for credible elections that the government had agreed to hold this year in exchange for the lifting of crippling U.S. economic sanctions.
The court’s decision bars the opposition figure, María Corina Machado, from taking part in an election for 15 years, upholding the Venezuelan government’s decision to exclude Ms. Machado over what it claimed were financial irregularities that occurred when she was a national legislator.
The move comes after Ms. Machado overwhelmingly won an opposition primary election for president that was held in October without official government support and in which more than 2.4 million Venezuelans voted. Analysts say Ms. Machado poses the biggest electoral threat to President Nicolás Maduro.
In a post on the social media platform X, Ms. Machado said on Friday that Mr. Maduro and “his criminal system chose the worst path for them: fraudulent elections.” She added, “What is NOT ending is our fight to conquer democracy through free and fair elections.”
The Biden administration has tried to coax Venezuela’s authoritarian government into holding elections by relaxing some of the sanctions that have decimated the country’s oil industry, a vital source of income.
In October, the Maduro government reached an agreement with the opposition on steps toward a presidential vote, including allowing opponents to choose a candidate to run in elections that are supposed to be held this year, though a date has yet to be set.

FR0UDHTK6Z_DFI2XPJ61L9RLBX,Gen Z Is Listening to What Netanyahu Is Saying. Is Biden?,_,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/opinion/netanyahu-biden-israel-gaza.html,"“My insistence is what has prevented — over the years — the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,” Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday. “As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.”
There is politics here, as everywhere. A two-state solution is dismally unpopular in Israel. A Gallup poll found backing for it among 25 percent of Israelis. The Israel Democracy Institute posed the question to Jewish Israelis with even more torque: Would you support a two-state solution if it were the only way to continue receiving American assistance? A majority said no.
Perhaps the only thing as unpopular in Israel right now as a two-state solution is Netanyahu himself. A recent Maariv poll found 28 percent of Israelis believe Netanyahu is still suited to be prime minister. If elections were held today, his party would be crushed. There are few paths to victory, much less absolution, for him, but this is one of the few that might work: persuade Jewish Israelis he’s the only leader tough enough to beat back American and European pressure to form a Palestinian state.
But consider Netanyahu’s boast. He is not just saying he opposes a Palestinian state now. He is saying he has opposed it for years. That he has worked to make it impossible. That he has succeeded.
The record backs him up. He allowed Hamas to hold Gaza, and Qatar to finance the group, because its presence kept the Palestinian leadership divided. No one could demand that Netanyahu accept a Palestinian state so long as that state would be governed by Hamas. This was his strategy, and he and his advisers said so.
In the West Bank, Netanyahu allowed settlers to run wild and rendered Hamas’s rival, Al Fatah, feckless. The Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority cooperated on security with Israel, day after day, but rather than raise Al Fatah up as a negotiating partner, he humiliated it. Netanyahu made Al Fatah into a subcontractor of Israeli control and gave Palestinians nothing for it. Instead, he allowed settlers to continue to take the little they had. It is no accident that the Palestinian Authority’s legitimacy had collapsed even before the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7.

FZANJ6Q8F0_UNFWKS794TK8IC8,Supreme Court to Hear Case of Oklahoma Death Row Inmate,By Adam LiptakReporting from Washington,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/supreme-court-richard-glossip-oklahoma.html,"The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether Richard Glossip, a death row inmate in Oklahoma, deserves a new trial in light of newly disclosed evidence and an extraordinary concession from the state’s Republican attorney general.
Mr. Glossip was convicted in 1998 of arranging the death of his employer, the owner of a motel in Oklahoma City. Two independent investigations have cast doubt on his guilt, and he has attracted support from celebrities like Kim Kardashian and state lawmakers from both political parties.
The state’s attorney general, Gentner F. Drummond, told the justices that the state had “come to the difficult but essential conclusion that Glossip’s capital conviction is unsustainable and a new trial imperative.”
He added, “The injustice of allowing a capital sentence to be carried out where the conviction was occasioned by the government’s own admitted failings would be nigh unfathomable.”
Lawyers call such statements “confessions of error,” and courts ordinarily give them great weight. In May, after hearing from Mr. Drummond, the Supreme Court halted Mr. Glossip’s execution while the justices considered whether to hear his appeal.
Mr. Drummond’s briefs were notable for a second reason: The lead lawyer representing the state was Paul D. Clement, who was solicitor general in the administration of George W. Bush and is a star of the Supreme Court bar, having argued more than 100 cases before the justices.

FZWXNMH9G7_D6GQGWBEGWJVH89,A Huge Win for Activists Puts Climate on the 2024 Agenda,By David Gelles,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/climate/a-huge-win-for-activists-puts-climate-on-the-2024-agenda.html,"This is just what the climate activists wanted.
The White House is delaying a decision about approving a new natural gas megaproject, as my colleague Coral Davenport exclusively reported yesterday, in order to more fully consider its impact on the climate.
The contentious Calcasieu Pass 2 project, known as CP2, would allow the United States — already the worlds’ biggest natural gas exporter — to ship much more liquefied natural gas overseas. Climate activists have rallied for months to block the project on the Louisiana coast, arguing that it would lock in dependence on fossil fuels beyond what the climate can bear.
“I’m super excited and ecstatic,” said Roishetta Ozane, an activist based in Louisiana, where the project would be located. “CP2 is a carbon time bomb.”
Natural gas is mostly methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. While it burns more cleanly than coal, it can leak anywhere along the supply chain, making it just as harmful, according to recent research.
In delaying the approval process for CP2, the White House is directing the Energy Department to consider all greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project — not just its construction. That could include emissions associated with drilling for and transporting the fuel, a change would also affect other pending natural gas terminals.
But that can only happen if President Biden is re-elected.
The politics of climate change are a big factor in the White House making this move. Coral broke the news on the same day that Biden declared: “It is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee. And my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher.”

G0GMTTLIXL_NUYU7RE2FS7FUL1,Britain’s Foreign Secretary Pressures Netanyahu on More Aid for Gaza,By Mark Landlerreporting from London,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/cameron-israel-gaza-netanyahu.html,"Britain’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, raised the pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday to allow more channels for humanitarian relief to enter Gaza.
Mr. Cameron made the case during a private meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem. In a statement Thursday morning, he said he had told Mr. Netanyahu that more crossings into Gaza needed to be opened to allow more trucks to enter.
“The scale of suffering in Gaza is unimaginable,” Mr. Cameron said. “We need an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostages out, followed by a sustainable cease-fire, without a return to hostilities.”
After the meeting in Jerusalem, Mr. Cameron traveled to the West Bank to meet the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. On Thursday he was in Qatar, where he spoke with the prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and said the two countries were jointly sending tents to Gaza to shelter displaced people.
The mounting civilian death toll in Gaza has become an acute source of concern in London. But Mr. Cameron’s pleas to the Israelis, like those of President Biden and his aides, have not borne much fruit, and on Wednesday, he found a defiant Israeli leader, who along with much of the country was mourning the deaths of 24 Israel Defense Force soldiers in the Gazan city of Khan Younis.
“We will continue to fight determinedly to vanquish the brutal enemy we face,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech on Wednesday marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Israeli Knesset. “We will continue to safeguard our national revival.”
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Netanyahu have a history of diplomatic relations going back more than a decade. When Mr. Cameron was prime minister, the Israeli leader referred to him as a “true friend of Israel,” though the two diverged in the past over Gaza and Israel’s settlement policy."
G8KAVA59CI_E5XYF9AMFBCSXRE,"When Chaos Erupted in Ecuador, Disinformation Followed",_,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/ecuador-violence.html,"One of the most terrifying spates of violence in Ecuador’s modern history began on Jan. 7. In quick succession, two jailed gang leaders escaped, riots broke out in the country’s main prisons and bombs exploded in several cities. A national television network was stormed by masked gunmen during a live broadcast. A little over a week later, the prosecutor investigating that attack was shot and killed. More than 20 people have been killed in the turmoil.
Watching the chaos unfold on their phones and televisions, Ecuadoreans were gripped by an unfamiliar fear. The streets of Guayaquil, the largest city, and Quito, the capital, were nearly empty as citizens were advised to stay home. The new president, Daniel Noboa, declared a 60-day state of emergency, and then quickly declared the country to be in an “internal armed conflict,” a move that allowed the army to patrol the streets and take control of prisons.
But there was another disturbing dimension to the crisis. As all of these frightening and very real events occurred, an overwhelming flood of disinformation on social media further disoriented the nation. The wave of fake news, along with the explosion of gang violence and the government’s extensive security measures, have raised troubling questions about the future of a country that was, until a few years ago, widely considered peaceful.
This month’s violence has not come out of nowhere. Ecuador has been grappling with a surge in organized crime. Since 2021, deadly clashes between gangs in prison have become commonplace, as have accusations that government officials, military officers and politicians are involved in drug trafficking. My country now holds the unfortunate distinction of being the deadliest nation in the region, with an average of some 40 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants — a grim statistic that includes the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, who was assassinated shortly before elections last year.
This spasm of violence began on a Monday morning with news of the prison escape of Adolfo Macías, better known as Fito, the leader of one of the many powerful criminal gangs in Ecuador. That night, attacks by gangs were reported in several cities, along with the kidnappings of dozens of prison guards. By Tuesday morning, news had spread that Colón Pico, a leader of another gang, had also escaped from prison.
It was an alarming series of events, but the onslaught of fake news stories that followed depicted an exaggerated situation of almost total chaos, inflaming panic. Disinformation isn’t new to Ecuador; like every other country we have to sift through our fair share of false information online. But this was different, as the flood made it hard to tell the difference between legitimate reporting and pure rumor in a moment of crisis. Though it remains unclear who, if anyone in particular, was behind the fake reports, for a few hours, it felt impossible to distinguish between fact and fiction — or to objectively discern the gravity of the situation.

G95VG9LMC5_ZI67BVCVLMMTFW8,"Apple Overhauls App Store in Europe, in Response to New Digital Law","By Adam Satariano and Tripp MickleAdam Satariano reported from London, and Tripp Mickle from San Francisco.","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/apple-app-store-europe.html,"Since Apple introduced the App Store in 2008, it has tightly controlled the apps and services allowed on iPhones and iPads, giving the company an iron grip on one of the digital economy’s most valuable storefronts.
Now Apple is weakening its hold on the store, in one of the most consequential signs to date of how new European regulations are changing consumer technology.
To comply with a European Union competition law taking effect on March 7, Apple on Thursday announced major changes to the App Store and other services for consumers in Europe. Users of iPhones and iPads in the 27-nation bloc will for the first time be able to use alternative app stores to download games, productivity tools and other apps. Banks and shopping services can offer competing payment methods inside their apps. People who buy new iPhones in the future will also see a new menu for downloading alternative browsers to Apple’s Safari, such as Chrome and Firefox.
The changes are some of the most tangible examples of how a checkerboard of laws and regulations is now fracturing people’s technology experiences, depending on where they live. In China, government rules force Apple to block apps like virtual-private networks, known as VPNs, which would give users access to the unfiltered internet. In Europe, customers will now have access to competing app stores and other services. In the United States, where there are fewer laws and regulations, Apple and other tech giants have more flexibility to operate as they please.
The shifts in the App Store stem from a 2022 law called the Digital Markets Act. The far-reaching law was aimed at loosening the power of the world’s largest tech companies in areas like e-commerce, social media and messaging. Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft have also announced changes to comply with the new rules.
“The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect E.U. users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings,” Phil Schiller, who leads the App Store, said in a statement.

G9VSDTUD5A_XGKB4FVZ5YL25EL,"F.B.I. ‘Ransacked’ My Home and Broke Down Doors, Menendez Says",By Tracey Tully and Benjamin Weiser,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/robert-menendez-bribery-home-searches.html,"The initial search of Senator Robert Menendez’s home occurred on a Thursday morning in June 2022 while the U.S. Senate was in session.
It was among five searches of Mr. Menendez’s property and electronic devices that judges approved between January 2022 and September 2023 during a federal investigation into the senator, a Democrat from New Jersey, who at the time was chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to a new legal filing.
Information and items collected during the searches later factored heavily in a September indictment in which federal prosecutors charged Mr. Menendez with accepting cash, gold and a luxury car in exchange for political favors.
But late Monday, Mr. Menendez’s lawyers argued that much of what was seized during what they called “exploratory rummaging” should be tossed out. The warrants, they said, were issued by magistrate judges duped by prosecutors who “actively distorted the evidence.”
During the June 16, 2022, search, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation “ransacked” the home, Mr. Menendez’s lawyers wrote. The legal brief does not specify whether it was Menendez’s home in New Jersey or Washington that was raided, but the indictment indicated that a split-level house in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., where Mr. Menendez lives with his wife, Nadine Menendez, was searched that day.
Neither Mr. Menendez nor his wife was home, he said in a court declaration. Records show the Senate was in session that day, but it was unclear if Mr. Menendez was in Washington.

GBMK5GHTLL_AGXPAUBAOF0IYTQ,Israel’s foreign minister speaks in Brussels amid discord at home over the war.,By Peter Baker and Adam Rasgon,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/middleeast/israels-foreign-minister-heads-to-brussels-amid-discord-at-home-over-war.html,"Israel’s foreign minister was in Brussels on Monday to address his counterparts from the European Union, as part of a “diplomatic battle” to win support from the bloc amid deepening criticism over the human toll of the war and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to consider Palestinian statehood.
The foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, was scheduled to meet in a private session with E.U. foreign ministers to discuss defeating Hamas and the return of hostages from Gaza, his office said. In brief remarks to reporters before the meeting, Mr. Katz said he would speak about Israel’s need for international support to succeed in both those objectives.
“I’m here to meet my colleagues, the foreign ministers for the E.U., and to discuss with them about two main issues. First of all, bring back our hostages,” Mr. Katz said, holding up photos of the youngest hostage, 1-year-old Kfir Bibas, and several others. He added that Israel needed E.U. support to ensure its security, adding: “Our brave soldiers are fighting in very hard conditions.”
The Palestinian foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, was also scheduled to address the E.U. officials in a separate appearance.
Gazan health officials said on Sunday that the death toll from Israel’s attacks since Oct. 7 had surpassed 25,000. Even the United States, Israel’s biggest ally, has been pressuring it to reduce civilian casualties. And anger is growing among the Israeli public over the government’s failure to secure the release of the more than 100 hostages believed to be still held in Gaza after nearly four months of war.
Senior leaders of the Israeli military have expressed frustrations over the feasibility of both freeing the hostages and eradicating Hamas, which Mr. Netanyahu has insisted upon, and over his equivocation about a postwar plan for Gaza.

GDLVCMIN6H_4G9J5PUKR87WMXD,"Jury to Decide if Mother of Michigan School Shooter Is Guilty, Too",By Stephanie Saul,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/crumbley-parents-trial-ethan-school-shootings.html,"Frequently left home alone, Ethan Crumbley texted his mother in March 2021 that he had seen a demon in their house, one that hurled dishes across the kitchen. Days later, his parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, discussed how their teenage son was “worked up and agitated,” weighing whether to give him Xanax.
The next November, James Crumbley, ignoring what seemed like warning signs that Ethan had mental health issues, bought his son a semiautomatic handgun. Ethan, then 15, used the gun to kill four students at Oxford High School, the worst school shooting in Michigan history.
On Tuesday, jury selection began in the trial of Jennifer Crumbley, 45, charged with involuntary manslaughter for the deaths — new territory when it comes to prosecuting school shootings. James Crumbley, 47, faces a separate trial, scheduled for March, also on involuntary manslaughter charges related to the killings.
As jury selection was getting underway, lawyers for Jennifer Crumbley and her son sparred over whether he should testify at her trial. The attorneys for Ethan, now 17, emailed a letter stating that they had advised him to not waive his privilege or confidentiality for the trial. That means his testimony and “confidential communication,” like conversations with his psychiatrists, would be prohibited.
Jennifer’s lawyers then asked the judge to order her son and three doctors whom he spoke with to testify in the trial, according to a court filing on Tuesday.
Although adults have been prosecuted before when children commit violent crimes, the Oxford High School case goes a step further by trying to hold parents criminally liable for an intentional mass shooting. The Oakland County prosecutor, Karen D. McDonald, has said that the Crumbleys are culpable because they allowed their son access to a handgun while ignoring warnings that he was troubled.

GL7MHR521W_ZBNK2QU2OVZG7K8,Navarro Is Sentenced to 4 Months in Prison for Stonewalling Congress,By Zach MontagueReporting from Washington,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/peter-navarro-sentence-contempt-congress.html,"Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to former President Donald J. Trump who helped lay plans to keep Mr. Trump in office after the 2020 election, was sentenced on Thursday to four months in prison for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Mr. Navarro, 74, was found guilty in September of two misdemeanor counts of criminal contempt of Congress, making him the second Trump aide to face penalties related to one of the chief investigations into the Capitol riot. The judge overseeing the case, Amit P. Mehta, had rejected Mr. Navarro’s primary defense: that Mr. Trump had personally directed him not to cooperate with the subpoena, and that he believed he was shielded by executive privilege.
“The words ‘executive privilege’ are not magical incantations,” Judge Mehta said in handing down the sentence after a tense two-and-a-half-hour hearing in which he repeatedly took issue with Mr. Navarro’s claim of executive privilege.
“It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card,” he said.
Mr. Navarro was also ordered to pay a $9,500 fine. He will stay out of jail for now, at least until Judge Mehta decides whether he can remain free while he appeals his conviction.
In a testy exchange with Mr. Navarro’s lawyers beforehand, the judge singled out Mr. Navarro’s decision to flout the subpoena even as other aides to Mr. Trump negotiated whether to comply. “I have a great deal of respect for your client and what he’s achieved professionally, I do,” he said. “Which makes it all the more disappointing the way he behaved.”
Appearing taken aback by Judge Mehta’s responses to one of his lawyers Mr. Navarro at one point stood up to speak for himself, against what he said was his lawyers’ advice.

Shelter in Besieged Khan Younis Is Struck, and at Least 9 Die","By Hiba Yazbek, Ameera Harouda and Michael Levenson","Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-shelter-strike.html,"Israeli forces pushed deeper into southern Gaza’s largest city on Wednesday, surrounding two major hospitals where thousands of people were seeking safety as a strike on a United Nations shelter killed at least nine people, according to U.N. officials and local health officials.
The Israeli military said it had “currently ruled out” that its aerial or artillery fire had been responsible for the strike on the shelter in Khan Younis, where the U.N. was housing about 800 people. In addition to the nine dead, 75 other people were injured, according to Thomas White, who helps oversee U.N. aid operations in Gaza.
U.N. officials did not directly blame Israel, but said the shelter, in a vocational training center, had been hit by two tank rounds. Israel is the only combatant in Gaza with tanks.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, said that the shelter was “clearly marked” as a U.N. facility and that its coordinates had been shared with the Israeli authorities. “Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,” Mr. Lazzarini wrote on social media.
At a news conference in Washington, Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesman, called the strike “incredibly concerning” and added: “Civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected.” He declined to say whether U.S. officials had spoken to the Israelis about the shelter strike.
The Israeli military said that it was conducting a review of its operations in the area of the shelter.

HOL940EX9N_15KDRBBRO65IUVR,Bettina Was Much More Than an Eccentric of the Chelsea Hotel,By Alex Vadukul,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/style/bettina-was-much-more-than-an-eccentric-of-the-chelsea-hotel.html,"One night in November, a procession of young artists, critics and curators climbed the creaky stairs of a building in Chinatown in Lower Manhattan to attend an opening at a buzzy little gallery, Ulrik. The show, “Bettina: New York 1965–86,” was made up of rarely seen photographs and sculptures by an enigmatic artist who lived for five decades at the fabled Chelsea Hotel, where she created her works in a cluttered fifth-floor apartment until her death in 2021.
Writers for Artforum and Frieze pushed through the crowd to get glimpses of the black-and-white street photography. Students from Pratt Institute drank cans of Budweiser as they studied the wavelike wood sculptures. A Museum of Modern Art curator watched grainy footage of the artist in 1976 while she filmed herself taking the very photos of Manhattan skyscrapers now displayed in the exhibit.
The show’s gallerists, Anya Komar, 37, and Alex Fleming, 39, sold three pieces right out of the gate. A few of Bettina’s old Chelsea Hotel neighbors showed up, including her longtime caretaker, Rachel Cohen, a jewelry and eyewear designer who has lived in the building since the 1970s.
“Everyone at the Chelsea Hotel knew Bettina’s art needed to be appreciated, but for some reason, it didn’t happen for her,” Ms. Cohen, 74, said after the opening. “So that night at the gallery seemed impossible to me. Everyone was so young and different. I was happy to see her art appreciated. Bettina wasn’t an easy person. She was rarely delighted by anything, but I think she would have loved it.”
“I think most who came that night didn’t know much about her life,” she continued, “so they were just seeing her art itself, and they couldn’t judge it by her life at the Chelsea Hotel.”

HVHVP3ZGYI_BOZBVBH67OZVKZS,What to Know About the U.N. Court’s Initial Ruling in the Genocide Case Against Israel,By Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Gaya Gupta,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/icj-israel-genocide-ruling.html,"The International Court of Justice issued an interim ruling on Friday in a wider case about whether Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in the enclave.
Decisions by the court, the United Nations’ top judicial body, are binding, but the court has few means of enforcement. Still, the ruling added to international pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government over the war. Israel has strongly rejected the genocide charge.
Here’s what to know about the ruling.
The interim ruling came in response to South Africa’s request for “provisional measures” to stop Israel’s military campaign in Gaza while the court considered the broader genocide charge.
On Friday, the court ruled on Friday that Israel must take actions to prevent acts by its forces in Gaza that are banned under the 1948 Genocide Convention, including indiscriminate killing of Palestinians and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”
The judges also ordered Israel to prevent and punish public statements that constitute incitements to genocide and to ensure basic services and humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. They also directed Israel to preserve evidence related to allegations of genocide. Finally, the judges ordered Israel to report back to the court within a month to show how it is complying with the order.
Still, the court stopped short of calling for Israel to suspend its military campaign, in line with what many legal experts had predicted.

I45KP2P6LE_TK4N7U38H61NVV0,The What-Ifs of Trump’s New Hampshire Win,_,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240117,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/opinion/trump-haley-new-hampshire.html,"Like his victory in Iowa last week, Donald Trump’s defeat of Nikki Haley in New Hampshire was substantial enough to remove any real doubt about the outcome of the primary campaign yet also somewhat underwhelming as a statement of voter enthusiasm for a former president and de facto incumbent candidate.
It proved that Trump is basically unbeatable in this timeline while hinting that it could have been otherwise, that we were only a few what-ifs away from a more competitive campaign.
You can see some of those what-ifs hovering around an interesting Politico profile of a New Hampshire Republican voter who considered Haley, even donated to her, before returning to Trump when the primary arrived. The profile, by Michael Kruse, introduces us to Ted Johnson, a retired military man turned project manager for an IT security company: He’s divorced and remarried, the father of three adult sons, working from home in Bedford, N.H., and a Barack Obama voter twice over and then a Trump voter in 2016 and 2020.
When Kruse first meets him, Johnson says that Trump feels to him like a “rebel without a cause” and that he’s looking for a candidate who can help reunite the country — which draws him to Haley as her star rises in New Hampshire. Flash forward to the days just before the election, though, and Johnson has swung back to Trump, even though — or because — the former president is a “wrecking ball” who Johnson thinks will “break the system.”
You can tell it’s a good profile because the details cut in different analytical directions. If you think that Trump’s victory was always assured because Republican voters exist in a bubble of delusion and unshakable loyalty, you’ll find evidence for that assumption in Johnson’s belief that Jan. 6 was a setup organized by Trump’s enemies and in the familiar script he uses to make a populist case for Trump — that he’ll fight the self-dealing insiders, “go in and lead” and “take care of the average guy.”
But if you’re struck by Johnson’s professed (if temporary) Trump fatigue and his willingness to seriously consider Haley despite his obviously Trumpy politics, then Kruse’s piece suggests a few interesting might-have-beens. For instance:
What if Trump had been indicted only in the classified documents case? The pileup of indictments was clearly an inflection point in the primary campaign, sending Trump surging toward a secure front-running position. In Johnson’s narrative, you get a concise summary of the mentality that helped drive that surge of support: “For a guy like me, I am looking, and I’m saying, ‘Why is everybody so hellbent on getting Trump in jail or getting him not to win?’” His answer is that institutional Washington, the intelligence and law enforcement agencies especially, must be “afraid as hell” of Trump coming back, because he doesn’t tolerate their uselessness or play by their bureaucratic rules. They’re “throwing so much stuff at this guy, and it’s almost like I’m rooting for him,” Johnson tells Kruse. “This is a whole system of government going after one man who, probably, I bet, right now, 85 million people want to be president.”

I8R2WM4BI9_WW2765Y7C19IVOM,Ohio to Ban Transition Care After Lawmakers Override Governor’s Veto,By Anna Betts and Amy Harmon,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/ohio-transgender-ban-veto-override.html,"Ohio lawmakers on Wednesday overrode Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a bill that would bar transgender minors from receiving puberty blockers, hormone therapy or gender transition surgery.
The move by the Republican-controlled state legislature comes less than four weeks after the Republican governor’s veto. The state House voted on Jan. 10 to override Mr. DeWine’s veto, and the Senate has now cleared the way for the law to go into effect, in 90 days.
For Ohio residents, that means that only transgender minors who have already begun transition care treatments will be able to receive them. According to a report published in 2022 by the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. law school, there were about 8,500 children in the state from ages 13 to 17 who identified as transgender, while about 46,500 adults identified as such.
Ohio’s legislation is part of a national wave of laws that aim to restrict the rights of transgender minors. Last year, at least 20 states, all with Republican-controlled legislatures, passed bans or restrictions on gender transition care for young people. Before 2023, only three states had passed restrictions on gender transition medical care for minors, according to a New York Times analysis.
The Ohio law, which originally passed the legislature in early December, says that medical professionals who provide transition care to minors in violation of the measure could lose their licenses and face legal action.
Those in favor of the legislation argued that parents are often pressured by doctors to sign off on transition care treatments for their children. But leading medical groups in the United States, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, say such care should be available to minors and oppose legislative bans.

IIYT74GL3T_GNMFU631XPU94WO,Review: A Japanese ‘Boléro’? It’s a Spooky Ride of Revenge.,By Gia Kourlas,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/arts/dance/review-nihon-buyo-japan-society.html,"For better or worse, Ravel’s “Boléro,” with its churning swell of sound, has stirred the imagination of artists over time, among them the choreographer Maurice Béjart and the ice dancing team of Torvill and Dean. It even found a seductive partner, Bo Derek — along with her cornrows — in the Blake Edwards movie “10.”
With “Nihon Buyo in the 21st Century: From Kabuki Dance to Boléro,” performed at the Japan Society on Wednesday, it has a new rendering. In “Boléro — The Legend of Anchin and Kiyohime,” the director and choreographer Hanayagi Genkuro uses Ravel’s score to retell the folk tale “The Legend of Dojoji.”
In the tale, Kiyohime (the striking Azuma Tokuyo, well known in Kabuki theater as Nakamura Kazutaro), an innkeeper’s daughter, falls in love with Anchin, a monk who promises to return to her but never does. She takes revenge by transforming into a snake and chasing him until he perishes, burning to death as he tries to escape to the bell of the Dojoji temple.
Genkuro coaxes out the sinister notes of the score in a deranged but good way. If you have to watch another dance to “Boléro,” this one, at least, is full of drama, danger and brittle, seething anger. As the music builds so does Kiyohime’s rage, which Tokuyo illuminates with icy solemnity as the fire of passion is turned into despair and, ultimately, revenge.
“Boléro” closes the program, which highlights the art of nihon buyo, a style that translates literally as “Japanese dance.” The training and technique of nihon buyo derives from Kabuki dance; its repertoire can be original or inspired by plays, folklore and stories. Presenting nihon buyo comes with challenges: dancers are in demand; live music is a must; and wigs and costumes can get pricey. In a program note, Yoko Shioya, Japan Society’s artistic director, says that this is only her third time presenting nihon buyo in her two decades in the job.
Along with “Boléro” (2021) was the comical “Toba-e” (1819); in showcasing a pair of dances more than 200 years apart, the program demonstrates the range of Kabuki technique. And because live music is essential in nihon buyo, rounding out the evening were three musical selections: “Matsuri (Festival), “Yugiri, the Courtesan” and “Hana (Flower),” brought to fragrant life by Tosha Suiho’s delicate flute.

IJOZJ2ZGGA_59CS1ZJV9HGBHFO,Danielle Brooks on Her Oscar Nomination: ‘Look What God Has Done’,By Alexis Soloski,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/movies/danielle-brooks-oscar-nomination.html,"It was 3:30 a.m. in New Zealand, where the actress Danielle Brooks was filming a Minecraft movie. But she was wide awake.
“I’m alive and I am an Oscar nominee today,” she said on a video call minutes after the nominations were announced. “I don’t think I’ll be able to go back to sleep.”
Brooks, a past Emmy nominee, Tony nominee and Grammy winner who broke out in “Orange Is the New Black,” is nominated for her supporting actress work in the movie musical “The Color Purple.” Hers is the film’s sole nomination. She plays Sofia, an outspoken woman who knows her own worth and insists on her own autonomy, qualities that make her a target of racialized violence. She first played the part on Broadway in 2015, in a defiant, exuberant turn that The New York Times likened to a “homemade steamroller.” Her film work is perhaps even more irresistible.
Swathed in zebra-print sleepwear, Brooks, 34, discussed, with occasional tears, the joy of the nomination, the differences between theater and film and how she learned to say “Hell, No,” in her own life. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How does it feel to be an Oscar nominee?
It’s like getting the M.V.P. at the Super Bowl. Crazy. It’s what I always just hoped and dreamed would happen, but for it to actually happen, I’m in shock! It’s like what it says in “The Color Purple”: “Look what God has done.”
What did you learn from playing Sofia on Broadway?
There was such an electricity in the theater, people just had to come see the show. I felt so much pressure. It was playing Sofia, this strong woman who was so sure of herself, that gave me the confidence, every night when I sang “Hell, No,” to say hell, no to my fears. She taught me how to live in my power. Getting to do it on the screen, that’s when I learned how to own my power. People assume that actors have all this confidence and are just brave people, which we are, but we get to hide behind characters. Now I can stand 10 toes down and believe in my heart that I’m worthy of moments like this.

IPRFDI1X2S_8VZDH8LTKXO0QJA,Netflix Is Said to License ‘Sex and the City’ From HBO,By John Koblin,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/business/media/netflix-sex-and-the-city.html,"HBO is renting out one of its most valuable series to Netflix.
Every season of “Sex and the City,” the HBO comedy that aired from 1998 to 2004, will begin streaming on Netflix for the first time in early April, according to three people familiar with the deal.
HBO had a longstanding policy of not licensing its shows to Netflix until last year, when it sent over titles including “Six Feet Under,” “Insecure,” “Band of Brothers,” “The Pacific” and “Ballers.” Several of these older series quickly leaped into Top 10 most-watched streaming lists after they began appearing on Netflix.
Now “Sex and the City,” which had been licensed to cable networks, will be offered on Netflix as well. It was not clear how much Netflix will pay to license the series, one of the most illustrious titles in HBO’s library.
Unlike the other series that HBO has licensed to Netflix, “Sex and the City” is part of an ongoing franchise for the company. The “Sex and the City” spinoff series, “And Just Like That,” streams on HBO’s streaming service and is preparing production for a third season. Executives said last year that “And Just Like That” ranked as one of the most watched original shows on its Max streaming service. The spinoff will remain available only on Max, two of the people said.
The development is further evidence that Netflix is benefiting from the tight financial situation that many of its rivals are confronting. HBO’s parent company, the debt-ridden Warner Bros. Discovery, will get an infusion of cash from the deal, while Netflix accumulates more beloved TV series and movies, a move that keeps people subscribing.
“I am thrilled that the studios are more open to licensing again, and I am thrilled to tell them we are open for business,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-chief executive, said in a quarterly earnings call on Tuesday.

IVXG3WVQPS_0F80OFCGKJCLFSJ,Bali Bombers May Return to Malaysia After Sentencing,"By Carol RosenbergReporting from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba","Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/bali-bombers-plea-agreement.html,"When a jury of military officers is assembled this week at Guantánamo Bay, it will be asked to choose a sentence in the 20- to 25-year range for two Malaysian prisoners who admitted to conspiring with an affiliate of Al Qaeda that carried out a deadly bombing in Indonesia two decades ago.
But behind the scenes, through a secret agreement that was negotiated with a senior Trump-era official, the men could be returned to Malaysia before the end of the year.
The sentencing proceedings for Mohammed Farik Bin Amin, 48, and Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep, 47, are part of a U.S. government strategy of trying to resolve Guantánamo’s national security cases through plea negotiations. The men spent years in secret C.I.A. prisons following their capture in 2003. In reaching the agreement, prosecutors averted lengthy litigation over torture that has stymied two capital cases, one for the Sept. 11 attacks and the the other for the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole.
The two men were captured along with a onetime member of the Qaeda affiliate, an Indonesian known as Hambali.
Last week they pleaded guilty to conspiring in a pair of suicide bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people on Oct. 12, 2002. As part of the plea agreement, they were questioned by prosecutors on Sunday and Monday, potentially for use in the trial of Mr. Hambali, which prosecutors want to hold next year.
The testimony is secret for now. But in their plea they said they had no firsthand knowledge that Mr. Hambali was responsible for the attack. They said they learned afterward from news reports on the internet that Mr. Hambali was wanted for a string of attacks carried out by the Jemaah Islamiyah movement and that they helped him elude capture.

JH5FMV9PDI_WD7DMSOIT3PJSOM,"Stripped, Beaten or Vanished: Israel’s Treatment of Gaza Detainees Raises Alarm",By Raja Abdulrahim,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-palestinian-detainees.html,"Cold, almost naked and surrounded by Israeli soldiers with M16 assault rifles, Ayman Lubbad knelt among dozens of Palestinian men and boys who had just been forced from their homes in northern Gaza.
It was early December and photographs and videos taken at the time showed him and other detainees in the street, wearing only underwear and lined up in rows, surrounded by Israeli forces. In one video, a soldier yelled at them over a megaphone: “We’re occupying all of Gaza. Is that what you wanted? You want Hamas with you? Don’t tell me you’re not Hamas.”
The detainees, some barefoot with their hands on their heads, shouted objections. “I’m a day laborer,” one man shouted.
“Shut up,” the soldier yelled back.
Palestinian detainees from Gaza have been stripped, beaten, interrogated and held incommunicado over the past three months, according to accounts by nearly a dozen of the detainees or their relatives interviewed by The New York Times. Organizations representing Palestinian prisoners and detainees gave similar accounts in a report, accusing Israel of both indiscriminate detention of civilians and demeaning treatment of detainees.
Israeli forces who invaded Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack have detained men, women and children by the thousands.
Some were ordered out of their houses and seized while others were taken as they fled their neighborhoods on foot with their families, trying to reach safer areas after the Israeli authorities ordered them to leave.

JHMCFFBHF9_EYEP5PFE2IGOEKZ,Pastor Charged With Cryptocurrency Fraud Said God Told Him to Do It,By Jesus Jiménez,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/colorado-pastor-crypto-fraud-eli-regalado.html,"A pastor in Denver who said that God told him to sell cryptocurrency that could not be cashed is facing civil charges, along with his wife, for marketing a digital coin that prosecutors said was “practically worthless” and using the proceeds to support a “lavish lifestyle.”
The pastor, Eligio Regalado, and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, were charged on Thursday in a civil complaint filed in Denver District Court by the Colorado Attorney General’s Office, the Colorado Division of Securities said in a statement. The agency said that the couple created, marketed and sold a cryptocurrency that they called INDXcoin through a cryptocurrency exchange, which they also ran.
Prosecutors said that the couple, who had no experience in cryptocurrency exchanges, marketed the INDXcoin to Christians in Denver, and raised nearly $3.2 million from more than 300 people who bought it from June 2022 to April 2023. Mr. Regalado and his wife then used the money for themselves, the Colorado Division of Securities said.
Mr. Regalado and Ms. Regalado did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. It was unclear whether they had a lawyer.
In a video addressing the complaint last week, Mr. Regalado said that he did not want investors to be “mad” at the prosecutors.
“They have to do this,” he said. “I mean, if you think about this: We sold a cryptocurrency with no clear exit. We did. We took God at his word and sold a cryptocurrency with no clear exit.”

JVTMQPC8NJ_RVKR7MUG5895DWO,"In a New Cannabis Landscape, a Navy Veteran Battles for Racial Equity",By Joshua Needelman,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/business/cannabis-marijuana-racial-equity-wanda-james.html,"“Transforming Spaces” is a series about women driving change in sometimes unexpected places.
Jam the towel under the door. Open the window. And hide the bong.
For decades, college students have found ways to mask the pungent aroma of marijuana smoke on campuses. Wanda James, however, did not always feel a need to hide. A 1986 graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder, Ms. James would sit on the steps outside her dorm and roll joints with her friends.
It would be decades before Colorado became one of the first two states in the country to legalize recreational cannabis, but on campus, James never worried.
“The worst that would happen is they would tell us to put it away, or they might take it from us, and that was the end of it,” Ms. James recalled of the campus police.
Fast forward 40 years: Ms. James, a former Navy lieutenant, is a member of her alma mater’s Board of Regents — and a prominent advocate of racial justice in the changing cannabis landscape.
It wasn’t until after college that Ms. James realized she had been living in something of an alternate reality with her cannabis use. She learned how the United States’ marijuana laws have led to Black Americans’ being sentenced to prison at a higher rate than white Americans despite near equal usage rates, setting her on the mission to which she has dedicated her life.

JYQO7BTQKZ_OBTFOR6UJE5WTUF,L.A. County to Pay $5 Million to Election Executive Wrongly Charged With Data Breach,By Stuart A. Thompson,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/los-angeles-county-eugene-yu-wrongful-charges.html,"Los Angeles County agreed to pay $5 million to the top executive of an election software company who had been arrested and charged in 2022 with mishandling voter data in a case that prosecutors dropped a few weeks later, the executive’s lawyer said this week.
The payment, which settles a lawsuit filed last year, is yet another twist for Eugene Yu, 66, the co-founder of the software company Konnech.
Mr. Yu and his company faced a barrage of right-wing conspiracy theories after the 2020 election including that Konnech, which is based in Michigan, had stored election data in China. Mr. Yu repeatedly denied sending data to China, including in an article by The New York Times about the false claims as a part of coverage of misinformation and elections.
Los Angeles prosecutors later arrested Mr. Yu, raiding his home and workplace. They charged him with embezzling public money by storing data on poll workers in China, a violation of its contract with the county, along with conspiracy to commit a crime. Right-wing media pointed to the arrest as evidence that claims of widespread election interference were true.
Five weeks later, the district attorney dropped the charges, citing concerns of “potential bias in the presentation” of evidence.
Mr. Yu sued Los Angeles County last year, claiming the arrest cost Mr. Yu and Konnech more than $80 million in lost business and other damages. His lawyers called the arrest “politically motivated” and “based solely on utterly false conspiracy theories about Chinese election interference” in a news release announcing the lawsuit.
As part of the settlement of the suit, the district attorney’s office will not pursue charges against Mr. Yu. The office and Mr. Yu will also petition a judge for a finding of factual innocence, according to Mr. Yu’s lawyer.
The district attorney’s office has never clarified whether the company had, in fact, stored data in China. The office declined to comment. Los Angeles County did not respond to questions about the decision.
Gary S. Lincenberg, who represented Mr. Yu in his criminal trial, said, “Mr. Yu should have never suffered through his wrongful arrest, loss of business or tarnishing of his good reputation.”
“But the settlement in his favor,” Mr. Lincenberg added, “represents a measure of recompense for the wrongs done to him by the wrongful prosecution.”"
KACL0TRCX4_UQPW3OX6V3AX7WJ,"Yes, Take Me Back to 2001",_,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/opinion/politics-nostalgia.html,"In 1996, accepting the Republican nomination for president, an aged (by his era’s standards, not ours) Bob Dole issued a stirring defense of the past against the present. “Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth,” he told his audience. “Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action. And to those who say it was never so, that America’s not been better, I say you’re wrong. And I know because I was there. And I have seen it. And I remember.”
America declined Dole’s offer, choosing to stay on Bill Clinton’s bridge to the 21st century instead. But much of contemporary conservatism believes strongly in Dole’s formulation — in a lost Arcadia and a debased present. There are elements of futurism and optimism on the Trump-era right, which Donald Trump himself has occasionally encouraged. But they’re usually couched as a kind of reactionary futurism, where going forward requires first taking several big steps back. And they coexist with the more straightforward the-past-was-better pessimism you’d expect from a movement that represents a lot of discontented older Americans.
Matt Yglesias has a critique of this mentality in his newsletter, in which he begins by discussing the oddness of right-wing nostalgia for the cultural landscape of his own lost youth, just 20-odd years back and hardly a traditionalist era, and then segues into critiquing economic pessimists who imagine the America of the baby boomers’ youth as a middle-class utopia when it fact most people were much poorer than today.
He links both forms of nostalgia to the basic human preference for being young and vigorous: You don’t really miss the world when you were 25; you miss being 25 yourself. He worries about the kind of politics that this bias creates — a politics that’s romantic rather than substantive, uninterested in practical policymaking and resistant to just about all forms of change. And he warns against the growing power of nostalgia-driven politics in an age of gerontocracy, where “the psychological burden of nostalgia will weigh increasingly heavily on the entire political arena, making it harder for us to wrestle with our problems in a remotely concrete way.”
I’ve defended the nostalgic impulse in the past, but I think there’s an important truth to this critique that all forms of developed-world conservatism are wrestling with. Contemporary populism draws its power not just from pure nostalgia but from a specific nostalgia for a period of faster growth and greater optimism about the future: A slogan like “Make America Great Again” implicitly promises both a return to the past and a restoration of the brighter future that the past expected to achieve.
But that restoration depends, inherently, on making changes that would unsettle current arrangements of property and power, and since older conservative voters tend to have a lot of property, they’re unlikely to be enthusiastic about many forms that such unsettlement might take. So they want the dynamism of 1960s or 1990s America back, but without, say, building any more housing in their neighborhoods or cutting old-age entitlements to spend more money on the young. This yields a mentality of “everything is awful, change everything, but don’t change my situation” — which in turn becomes a prison for conservative politicians and policymakers. (I would say that British Tories even more than American Republicans are trapped by this dynamic.)

KAPIUXCD0X_V0RIGZZ9T9R7A7R,"Netanyahu Restates Opposition to Two-State Solution, Despite Pressure From Biden",By Adam RasgonReporting from Jerusalem,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-biden-israel-palestinian-state.html,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state this weekend, again rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza is over.
“My insistence is what has prevented — over the years — the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement in Hebrew on Sunday. “As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.”
The statement reiterated comments he made on social media the previous day, when he said in Hebrew that he “will not compromise on full Israeli security control of the entire area west of the Jordan River — and that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state.”
Mr. Netanyahu’s comments came after Mr. Biden spoke to him on Friday about a two-state solution and floated the possibility of a disarmed Palestinian nation that would not threaten Israel’s security. Mr. Biden has argued that the creation of a Palestinian state is the only viable long-term resolution to a conflict that has dragged on for decades, repeating a position held by most American presidents and European leaders in recent history.
While there was no indication that Mr. Netanyahu would ease his strenuous opposition, which is popular with his fragile right-wing political coalition, Mr. Biden had expressed optimism that they might yet find consensus.
“There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the president told reporters at the White House several hours after Friday’s call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the U.N. that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added, “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.”

KC0SGQVYU8_7EWZ76L8U6ZMLIT,Global Galleries Return to an Expanding London Scene,By Scott ReyburnReporting from London,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/arts/design/condo-london.html,"Britain’s economy is stagnant, the international art market is in a downturn and the wider world is weighed down with ongoing geopolitical crises in the Middle East, Ukraine and beyond.
Yet, perhaps counter-intuitively, London’s contemporary art gallery scene is expanding.
This past weekend was the preview of the sixth edition of Condo London, a collaborative citywide exhibition featuring 27 invited international dealerships presenting exhibitions at 23 London contemporary galleries. Host dealers can choose to give over their spaces to their visiting colleagues, or hold their own exhibitions alongside them. Most of the works at the event, which runs through Feb. 17, are by emerging artists and are priced at under $20,000.
Back in 2016, the inaugural edition of this innovative alternative to an international art fair featured just eight London dealerships. Since then, spinoff events have been held in Athens, Mexico City, New York, São Paulo and Shanghai. This latest iteration is the first in London since 2020.
The four year gap “was because of the pandemic,” said Vanessa Carlos, a co-founder of the Carlos/Ishikawa gallery in the East End and the creator of the Condo concept. “We wanted to wait for the moment when the most people could travel freely,” she said.
Now, she added, “new things are happening in London.” The biggest challenge was keeping Condo London “small and intimate” at a time when the city’s re-energized gallery scene is growing, she said. “Scale is important. There are too many large, exhausting events,” she added, pointing out that Condo was small enough for many visitors to see all of it.

KCHOIKBMBN_Y3OMDHXBE5WYDVY,Supreme Court Backs Biden in Dispute With Texas Over Border Barrier,By Adam LiptakReporting from Washington,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/supreme-court-texas-border-barbed-wire.html,"The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration on Monday, allowing federal officials to cut or remove parts of a concertina-wire barrier along the Mexican border that Texas erected to keep migrants from crossing into the state.
The ruling, by a 5-to-4 vote, was a victory for the administration in the increasingly bitter dispute between the White House and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, an outspoken critic of President Biden’s border policy who has shipped busloads of migrants to northern cities.
Since 2021, Mr. Abbott, a third-term Republican, has mounted a multibillion-dollar campaign to impose stringent measures at the border to deter migrants. Those include erecting concertina wire along the banks of the Rio Grande, installing a barrier of buoys in the river and enacting a sweeping law that allows state and local law enforcement to arrest migrants crossing from Mexico.
In lifting an appeals court ruling that had generally prohibited the administration from removing the wire while the court considers the case, the justices gave no reasons, which is typical when they act on emergency applications. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal members to form a majority.
A spokesman for Mr. Abbott, Andrew Mahaleris, defended Texas’ practices and vowed to keep pressing its case. “The absence of razor wire and other deterrence strategies encourages migrants to make unsafe and illegal crossings between ports of entry,” he said in a statement, adding, “This case is ongoing, and Governor Abbott will continue fighting to defend Texas’ property and its constitutional authority to secure the border.”
Angelo Fernández Hernández, a White House spokesman, embraced the decision and called on Congress to come to a bipartisan deal on changes to the immigration system. “Texas’ political stunts, like placing razor wire near the border, simply make it harder and more dangerous for frontline personnel to do their jobs,” he said in a statement. “Ultimately, we need adequate resources and policy changes to address our broken immigration system.”

KG2KDXN5OP_KDGQQTSBBA5GYJD,Nitrogen Hypoxia: What to Know About This New Method of Execution,By Jan Hoffman,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/health/what-is-nitrogen-hypoxia.html,"The planned execution of a death row inmate by the state of Alabama on Thursday evening will be carried out by a procedure that has never been used for capital punishment in the United States.
The inmate, Kenneth Smith, who was convicted in a 1988 stabbing murder, will be put to death by inhaling nitrogen gas, a method known as nitrogen hypoxia.
Supporters of the method say it is fast and painless. But earlier this month, the United Nations Human Rights Office urged Alabama to stop the execution, saying it could amount to torture and be in violation of human rights treaties that the United States has agreed to.
Alabama would be the first state to use nitrogen hypoxia, but other states are interested in employing the method.
Hypoxia is a medical term for a state of insufficient oxygen in the body. Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, makes up about 78 percent of the air inhaled by humans. But under the method of nitrogen hypoxia, the person breathes in only nitrogen, leading within minutes to unconsciousness and then death from lack of oxygen.
According to the protocol released by Alabama prison officials, members of the “execution team” will strap Mr. Smith to a gurney in the state’s execution chamber in Atmore. A mask will be placed on his head and nitrogen will be released into it, depriving him of oxygen. Many experts compare this process to putting a plastic bag over someone’s head, although in that situation, the person would be inhaling carbon dioxide rather than nitrogen.

KIKTHI2W16_Q821MM21AVS2NU0,Biden Presses Netanyahu on Working Toward a Palestinian State,By Peter BakerReporting from Washington,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/us/politics/biden-netanyahu-palestinian-state.html,"President Biden pressed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Friday to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza is over and raised options that would limit Palestinian sovereignty to make the prospect more palatable to Israel.
Hoping to overcome Mr. Netanyahu’s strenuous resistance, Mr. Biden floated the possibility of a disarmed Palestinian nation that would not threaten Israel’s security. While there was no indication that Mr. Netanyahu would ease his opposition, which is popular with his fragile right-wing political coalition, Mr. Biden expressed optimism that they may yet find consensus.
“There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the president told reporters at the White House several hours after the call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the U.N. that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added, “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.”
Asked what Mr. Netanyahu was open to, Mr. Biden said, “I’ll let you know.” But he rejected the notion that a so-called two-state solution is impossible as long as Mr. Netanyahu is in power — “no, it’s not” — and he brushed off the idea of imposing conditions on American security aid to Israel if the prime minister continues to resist.
“I think we’ll be able to work something out,” Mr. Biden said.
A day later, however, Mr. Netanyahu appeared not to have been swayed by Mr. Biden’s pitch. “I shall not compromise on full Israeli security control of the entire area west of Jordan River — and that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state,” he said in a post on social media.
The last time the two leaders were known to have talked was on Dec. 23, in a call that was later described as especially tense.

KSAFXSIAQC_ZGMXGWUJEBUW0R5,Sweden’s Leader Says He Will Meet With Orban to Advance NATO Bid,By Andrew Higgins,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/europe/nato-sweden-orban-hungary.html,"Bowing to a Hungarian demand for negotiations over the expansion of NATO, the prime minister of Sweden on Thursday agreed to hold talks with Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orban, the last obstacle blocking the Nordic nation’s admission to the military alliance.
The decision by the Swedish leader, Ulf Kristersson, to accept an invitation from Mr. Orban to visit Budapest for talks reversed an earlier position that the future of the United States-led alliance — a bloc whose 31 member states have a total population of nearly a billion — was not something to be negotiated with Hungary, a military lightweight with only 10 million people.
A vote by Turkey’s parliament on Tuesday to accept Sweden as a member of the alliance, however, left Hungary as the only holdout and strengthened Mr. Orban’s leverage. It also intensified accusations abroad that he was effectively holding Sweden’s membership for ransom.
In a sign that Mr. Orban intended to use his leverage, Laszlo Kover, a close ally of the Hungarian prime minister and the speaker of Parliament, indicated Thursday that he was in no hurry to put the matter to a vote. Parliament is in recess and is not scheduled to return until Feb. 15.
“I don’t feel that anything is urgent for us; in fact, I don’t think an extraordinary situation has arisen,” Mr. Kover said in an interview with a pro-government news portal, Index.
The portal, like many other Hungarian media outlets, used to be independent but aligned itself firmly with the government after being taken over by a businessman loyal to Mr. Orban.

KUSZQ5OMTI_EOQ72HCCVZ6ARDY,"In Angola, a Former Cold War Rival, Blinken Touts U.S. Investments","By Michael CrowleyMichael Crowley, traveling with the secretary of state on his visit to Africa, reported from Luanda, Angola.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/africa/angola-blinken-us-investments.html,"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken wrapped up a four-nation tour through Africa on Thursday with a visit to Angola, an oil-rich former Cold War battleground that has become the site of a struggle for 21st-century economic influence.
During his visit to the coastal capital, Luanda, Mr. Blinken spotlighted major American investments in Angola, including more than $900 million for solar energy projects and $250 million to upgrade a rail corridor that carries critical minerals, including cobalt and copper, from central Africa to Angola’s Atlantic port of Lobito.
Those solar investments help to advance President Biden’s climate agenda while the transportation improvements further his goal of diversifying American supply chains — in part to reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese control of the vital ingredients for a modern economy.
Just over 20 years since the end of Angola’s civil war, which left perhaps as many as one million people dead, the country has rebuilt, modernized and developed friendly relations with Washington, which once funded rebels against a government backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba.
Speaking at a news conference alongside Téte António, Angola’s foreign minister, Mr. Blinken proclaimed that U.S.-Angola relations were at their “strongest” point in their history.
Unspoken was Angola’s economic links to China, which has lent Angola nearly $43 billion.
Those financial ties between Beijing and Luanda are one of several relationships that have alarmed U.S. military officials, who warn that China is seeking to establish a naval base with Atlantic Ocean access.

KWEVXYTA46_FQ61K32D21L8NX0,‘Zoomers’ Review: Just Don’t Kill the Vibes,By Brittani Samuel,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/theater/zoomers-review-matthew-gasda.html,"“Zoomers,” the new play written and directed by Matthew Gasda, explores the specific milieu of artsy 20-something transplants, largely the same population that frequents the Greenpoint loft of the Brooklyn Center for Theater Research, where the show is currently running.
It’s immediately clear that the 30-something Gasda, whose 2022 play “Dimes Square” captured the crowd of artists, writers and scenesters in New York City’s downtown, has spent significant time observing his younger subjects. With the exception of a few awkward phrases, his naturalistic play captures the way Gen Z talks.
“Zoomers” opens with three roommates ambling around their Brooklyn apartment in Bushwick, a land where shaggy hair is a personality trait and hard kombucha might as well be on tap. Michael (Jonah O’Hara-David), Jacob (Henry Lynch), and Jada (Reneé-Nicole Powell) are recovering from a night of respective drinking, smoking weed and existential dread. The cure for their ills? Intense rounds of Super Smash Bros.
The video game is their other vice. For the emotionally stunted Jacob in particular, it’s a pleasurable escape whenever conversations get too heated. Any time characters dare to reveal their anguish — Michael’s commute is interrupted when a man jumps in front of the L train; Jada dreams of metastasizing tumors in her eyes — their traumas are swept aside by a call to play Smash or a damning accusation of killing the “vibes.” It is not until the penultimate scene of the play, when a new roommate named Ella (Sophia Englesberg) presses her much older architect boyfriend (George Olesky) about his emotional detachment, that we see any of the characters scale the hump of adversity and land somewhere close to catharsis.
Conflict avoidance, and the way digital media abets it, is a recurring theme here, but “Zoomers” is no satirical work of social horror. The play refuses to hook onto any distinct point of view about the generational issues it raises. It’s neither a full-on curmudgeonly condemnation of Gen Z stereotypes — avoidant, anxious, narcissistic, polyamorous — nor an enlightening investigation of them. Instead, Gasda goes full Warhol with his art: replication for the sake of reflection. The result is a play filled with humorous moments that feel real, but trite.

KYGORHPO50_W7YQPURJMX7EFB2,Full Appeals Court Spurns Request by Trump to End Gag Order in Election Case,By Charlie SavageReporting from Washington,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/trump-gag-order.html,"The full federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday rejected former President Donald J. Trump’s bid to lift a gag order imposed on him in the criminal case in which he stands accused of trying to subvert the results of the 2020 election.
The terse ruling, issued on behalf of the 11 judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, leaves Mr. Trump with only the option of appealing to the Supreme Court if he wants to keep fighting the gag order, which restricts his ability to publicly criticize certain people involved in the legal proceeding.
D. John Sauer, a lawyer for Mr. Trump who has been handling appeals, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing the federal prosecution of Mr. Trump, declined to comment.
The dispute is one of the extraordinary legal fights spinning off from the cases against Mr. Trump. It has pitted the First Amendment rights of a former president and the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination against fears that his hostile rhetoric targeting people involved in the matter could spur supporters to acts of violence.
The judge overseeing the election case, Tanya S. Chutkan of Federal District Court, first imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump in October. It restricted him from making public statements attacking witnesses and specific prosecutors or court staff members — but not herself — in the case. Mr. Trump appealed, saying the order violated his First Amendment rights.
In December, a three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld the order but narrowed its terms, including to allow him to keep attacking one of his main targets: Mr. Smith, the special counsel. Mr. Trump then asked the full D.C. Circuit to intervene and rehear the matter, seeking a further narrowing or elimination of the order.

L5ISC3WXR0_W4NVW0IU1J43Y0L,Trump Defamation Trial Is Delayed Until Wednesday for Illness,By Maria Cramer and Kate Christobek,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/nyregion/trump-defamation-testify-e-jean-carroll.html,"The trial of E. Jean Carroll’s defamation suit against Donald J. Trump was delayed until Wednesday after a juror fell ill.
Judge Lewis A. Kaplan did not give a reason for his decision, which was announced by the federal court in Manhattan late Monday.
The decision followed uncertainty over the condition of the juror and a request from Mr. Trump to postpone the trial because of the Republican primary in New Hampshire, which is on Tuesday. The former president, who is seeking to return to the White House, has been alternating campaign stops with court appearances, using his time in the courtroom as an opportunity to reach voters and complain that he is being mistreated.
The Carroll trial, which is in its second week, had already been suspended for the day after the juror reported flulike symptoms. Mr. Trump had said he wanted to testify, but his lawyer Alina Habba said in court Monday morning that he would not be able to take the stand on Tuesday because of the primary.
“He was planning to testify,” Ms. Habba said. “Clearly, he flew in last night to be here. I would just need his testimony to be Wednesday in light of the news about the juror today.”
Ms. Habba also said she had been exposed to Covid during a visit to her parents; she said she had tested negative but was still feeling symptoms. In court, she sat unmasked next to the former president.

LF294D1M2X_M2RKBJPM2S2U6TM,Cheney Says Haley Should Stay in G.O.P. Primary Through Super Tuesday,By Alyce McFadden,"Jan. 27, 2024, 8:12 p.m. ET",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/nikki-haley-liz-cheney.html,"Former Representative Liz Cheney urged Nikki Haley to stay in the Republican primary race through Super Tuesday in an episode of “Pod Save America” that will be released on Friday. Ms. Cheney, an outspoken critic of former President Donald J. Trump, called his candidacy an “existential threat” to the nation and commended Ms. Haley for running against him, despite her long odds.
“We need to make sure that we’re challenging him and working to defeat him at every step of the way. And right now, Nikki Haley is in this fight, and I think she ought to stay in it,” Ms. Cheney said, according to a transcript of the interview shared with The New York Times.
Ms. Cheney has not endorsed a presidential candidate, and has teased the possibility of a third-party run herself. She didn’t rule that out on the podcast, and she told Jon Favreau, the podcast’s host and a former speechwriter in the Obama administration, that she “certainly” thinks a third-party candidate, whether her or someone else, will enter the race before November.
“I think we’ll see what happens,” she said. “You know, my No. 1 priority is defeating him and I think that’s going to guide whatever ultimately I decide I’m going to do.”
She dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump has all but clinched his party’s nomination and criticized Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, for urging Republicans to consolidate support behind Mr. Trump after his victory in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
“That’s inappropriate, to say the least, for the chairperson of the R.N.C. to be asserting that the primary’s over when it’s not over,” Ms. Cheney said.
Ms. Cheney has long been critical of fellow Republicans who kowtow to Mr. Trump and in the interview, she singled out Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who endorsed Mr. Trump at a rally in New Hampshire last week, months after suspending his own primary bid. The endorsement stirred more speculation that Mr. Trump might be considering Mr. Scott as his running mate. On Tuesday, Ms. Cheney called another potential vice-presidential contender, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, a “crackpot.”
“You’ve got members who used to be responsible and thoughtful and honorable. And now for some reason, they feel that they can sort of jettison all of that in the name of loyalty to Trump,” she said.
Another subject of Ms. Cheney’s ire on the podcast was Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate’s minority leader. She called him “disgusting” for signaling that he would back away from a deal with Democrats on immigration legislation after Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to oppose it.
“History will judge them, in my view, as harshly as it will judge Trump because he can’t do what he’s doing without them,” Ms. Cheney said."

Trump wrote messages on Twitter warning that increased reliance on mail-in ballots would lead to a “rigged election,” the platform ran a corrective, debunking his claims.
“Get the facts about mail-in voting,” a content label read. “Experts say mail-in ballots are very rarely linked to voter fraud,” the hyperlinked article declared.
This month, Elon Musk, who has since bought Twitter and rebranded it X, echoed several of Mr. Trump’s claims about the American voting system, putting forth distorted and false notions that American elections were wide open for fraud and illegal voting by noncitizens.
This time, there were no fact checks. And the X algorithm — under Mr. Musk’s direct control — helped the posts reach large audiences, in some cases drawing many millions of views.
Since taking control of the site, Mr. Musk has dismantled the platform’s system for flagging false election content, arguing it amounted to election interference.
Now, his early election-year attacks on a tried-and-true voting method are raising alarms among civil rights lawyers, election administrators and Democrats. They worry that his control over the large social media platform gives him an outsize ability to reignite the doubts about the American election system that were so prevalent in the lead-up to the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

LO6BIKA8Y6_FXJ58C3671U34QK,Plans for Gaza’s ‘Day After’ Seem Ever Distant,By Steven ErlangerSteven Erlanger reported from Jerusalem.,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/europe/gaza-peace-plans-day-after.html,"As the war in Gaza grinds on, there is increasing talk of some “day after” formula for the broken territory. But that notion is an ephemeral one — there is not going to be a bright line between war and peace in Gaza, even if some sort of negotiated settlement is reached.
Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.
Israel has made it clear that it will not subcontract security along its southern border to anyone else, and Israeli military officials say their forces will come in and out of Gaza based on intelligence for a very long time to come, even after troops finally withdraw.
“The whole conceit of ‘the day after’ has to be retired,” said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. official at the Carnegie Endowment. “It’s misleading and dangerous,” he said, because there will be no clear dividing line “between the end of Israeli military operations and a relative stability that allows people to focus on reconstruction.”
There are a variety of sketchy ideas — “plans” would be too specific a word — for what happens in the aftermath of hostilities. But there is a growing understanding that any sustainable settlement would require a regional deal involving countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar.
Inevitably such a deal would have to be led by the United States, Israel’s most trusted ally. Most officials and analysts assume it would require new governments both in Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which partially governs the West Bank but is considered stale and corrupt, an indication of the long road ahead.

LP7UZCEHKV_CWLS4RLUUVRN0OK,Trump Strengthens Grip on Capitol Hill as He Presses Toward Nomination,By Annie KarniReporting from Capitol Hill,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/trump-congress-immigration-ukraine.html,"For months, Senate Republicans have been working with Democrats on a deal they have described as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a conservative border security bill, and for weeks, they have hinted that they are tantalizingly close to an agreement.
Their timing could not be worse.
As former President Donald J. Trump moves closer to becoming his party’s presidential nominee and Republican lawmakers consolidate behind him, he is wielding a heavier hand than any time since leaving office over his party’s agenda in Congress. His vocal opposition to the emerging border compromise has all but killed the measure’s chances in a divided Congress as he puts his own hard-line immigration policies once again at the center of his presidential campaign.
His shadow has always loomed large over the Republican-controlled House, which has opened congressional investigations to defend him, launched an impeachment inquiry into his chief rival and approved legislation to reinstate the hard-line immigration policies he imposed. But as Mr. Trump barrels toward the party’s 2024 nomination, his influence on the legislative agenda on Capitol Hill is expanding.
His “America First” approach to foreign policy already helped to sap G.O.P. support for sending aid to Ukraine for its war against Russian aggression, placing the fate of that money in doubt. That led Republicans to demand a border crackdown in exchange for any further funding for Kyiv, a compromise that Mr. Trump has now repudiated. He frequently consults with the inexperienced Speaker Mike Johnson, weighing in on policy and politics. And his uncompromising approach has emboldened copycat politicians in Congress, like Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, who are helping to drive an ongoing impasse over government spending.
For a Congress that has struggled for more than a year to do the bare minimum of legislating, Mr. Trump’s dominance among Republicans is yet another drag on the institution’s ability to function in an election year when his name is likely to be on the ballot.
Mr. Trump burst onto the national political scene in 2015 with a dark warning about dangerous immigrants invading the country’s southern border and one slogan that outlasted them all in “Build the Wall.” More than eight years later, he is agitating against compromise and saying he wants no action taken on the border “unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION.”

LZMQRYJ14T_S36RDWV9G25H9A6,The Looming Contest Between Two Presidents and Two Americas,"By Peter BakerPeter Baker has covered the past five presidents, including Donald J. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr.","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/biden-trump-presidential-election.html,"Each of them has sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, signed bills into law, appointed judges, bartered with foreign leaders and ordered the armed forces into combat. They both know what it is like to be the most powerful person on the planet.
Yet the general election matchup that seems likely after this week’s New Hampshire primary represents more than the first-in-a-century contest between two men who have both lived in the White House. It represents the clash of two presidents of profoundly different countries, the president of Blue America versus the president of Red America.
The looming showdown between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, assuming Nikki Haley cannot pull off a hail-mary surprise, goes beyond the binary liberal-conservative split of two political parties familiar to generations of Americans. It is at least partly about ideology, yes, but also fundamentally about race and religion and culture and economics and democracy and retribution and most of all, perhaps, about identity.
It is about two vastly disparate visions of America led by two presidents who, other than their age and the most recent entry on their résumés, could hardly be more dissimilar. Mr. Biden leads an America that, as he sees it, embraces diversity, democratic institutions and traditional norms, that considers government at its best to be a force for good in society. Mr. Trump leads an America where, in his view, the system has been corrupted by dark conspiracies and the undeserving are favored over hard-working everyday people.
Deep divisions in the United States are not new; indeed, they can be traced back to the Constitutional Convention and the days of John Adams versus Thomas Jefferson. But according to some scholars, they have rarely reached the levels seen today, when Red and Blue Americas are moving farther and farther apart geographically, philosophically, financially, educationally and informationally.
Americans do not just disagree with each other, they live in different realities, each with its own self-reinforcing Internet-and-media ecosphere. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was either an outrageous insurrection in service of an unconstitutional power grab by a proto-fascist or a legitimate protest that may have gotten out of hand but has been exploited by the other side and turned patriots into hostages.

M64L5IXCJX_96CNTZL5BVEUU0R,"Haley Looks to Fight on Home Turf, Which Her Rival Claims as Trump Country","By Jonathan Weisman and Rebecca Davis O’BrienJonathan Weisman reported from Charleston, S.C. Rebecca Davis O’Brien reported from New York.","Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/haley-trump-south-carolina.html,"A combative Nikki Haley brought her presidential campaign back to South Carolina on Wednesday after a disappointing defeat the night before in New Hampshire, and told a boisterous crowd in a cavernous ballroom in North Charleston that she would fight Donald J. Trump for the Republican nomination.
“The political elites in this state and around the country say we just need to let Donald Trump have this,” she told her supporters, who were jeering at the idea. “Listen. We’ve only had two states that have voted. We’ve got 48 more.”
Nowhere is more immediately important than South Carolina, where she served two terms as governor before being tapped to serve as Mr. Trump’s first ambassador to the United Nations. But just because it’s her home state does not mean it is friendly territory. As Ms. Haley looked to reinvigorate her campaign here on the ground, Republicans, as varied as local party officials and the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, stepped up the pressure on her to drop out. As she made her case for pressing on, the former president significantly consolidated his support.
While she spoke, the Trump campaign blasted out a fresh list of endorsements in South Carolina that now includes the state’s two senators, most of its House members, its governor and lieutenant governor, and much of its State House — more than 150 names in all.
“Welcome home to Trump Country, Nikki,” Austin McCubbin, Mr. Trump’s South Carolina director, taunted.
Some of Ms. Haley’s closest allies and confidants on Wednesday continued to insist that Ms. Haley had met her own expectations: She had winnowed the field and was now in the two-person contest she wanted, with time enough until the primary on Feb. 24 to spread her message to a broader electorate and draw contrasts between herself and Mr. Trump.

MLI6UNXY40_1QZL4Q6JMQ0J40I,Late Night Bids Adieu to G.O.P. Dropout Ron DeSantis,By Trish Bendix,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/arts/television/late-night-ron-desantis.html,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.
Days after finishing 30 points behind Donald Trump in the Iowa caucuses, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida bowed out of the presidential race on Sunday.
“Yeah, DeSantis knew it was time to go four months after the rest of us did,” Jimmy Fallon joked on Monday.
“Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced yesterday that he was suspending his presidential campaign — and this only a few days after Iowa announced it.” — SETH MEYERS
“DeSantis met with his advisers, and they were, like, ‘Ron, how do we put this? There’s a better chance of you being a judge on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” than being president of the United States.’” — JIMMY FALLON
“Yeah, when he saw the latest polls, DeSantis clicked his high heels together three times and said, ‘There’s no place like home, there’s no place like home, there’s no place like home.’” — JIMMY FALLON
“It’s estimated that Ron DeSantis spent $2,263 per vote he got. It literally would have been cheaper to buy each of his supporters a Peloton bike.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“I don’t understand why Americans didn’t rally behind a guy who declared war on the Magic Kingdom, attacked trans kids, denied Covid, kidnapped migrants and flew them to Martha’s Vineyard, and ate pudding with his fingers.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
“This is one of the most spectacular political crash-and-burns of all time. At least DeSantis doesn’t have to worry about banning history books anymore, because he won’t be in them.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
“That’s right, it’s been a real roller coaster ride for DeSantis. But he said he’s happy, ’cause at least with this roller coaster, he was tall enough to ride.” — JIMMY FALLON
“So now the field has been narrowed down to Nikki Haley and nobody else, living every woman’s nightmare: being left alone with Donald Trump.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“DeSantis posted a video announcing that he was dropping out, and during it he attributed a quote about failure to Winston Churchill, but Churchill never actually said it. See, this is what happens when you ban textbooks.” — JIMMY FALLON
“The International Churchill Society says on its website, ‘We can find no attribution for the quote, and it is found nowhere in his canon.’ Now, I know a lot of people are saying DeSantis could have fact-checked that in one of the books he banned, but that’s not fair. To quote Winston Churchill, ‘you can also just [expletive] Google it.’” — SETH MEYERS

N03OEO0VBR_830QIA4T5JOMS2H,9 Democratic Governors Push Biden and Congress to Address Migrant Crisis,"By Grace AshfordReporting from the State Capitol in Albany, N.Y.","Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/nyregion/hochul-immigration-biden-policy.html,"Nine Democratic governors have joined together to urge the Biden administration and congressional leaders to address what they call “a humanitarian crisis” created by the surge of migrants seeking refuge in the United States.
The governors, led by Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, asked in a letter to the White House and Congress for “a serious commitment” to overhauling the immigration system that would include federal coordination on a strategy to relieve pressure on the southern and northern borders, as well as for more funds for states.
“It is clear our national immigration system is outdated and unprepared to respond to this unprecedented global migration,” reads the letter, which is signed by Ms. Hochul and the governors of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland.
Last year, President Biden proposed a $106 billion package that included aid to states and localities as well as more funding for border security and deportations, along with aid to Ukraine. But like so many other immigration-related proposals of the past, his effort failed to garner the bipartisan support necessary to pass a divided Congress.
A strong Biden ally, Ms. Hochul has until now been reluctant to take a leadership role in pushing the White House for more federal aid, even as New York has been a focal point of the migrant crisis. Mayor Eric Adams of New York City has not hesitated to lobby, and his attacks on the Biden administration have been met with brusque criticism of how the city has handled the crisis.
Since last spring, 170,000 migrants have arrived in New York City, and the city is still housing about 70,000 of them. Many of those seeking refuge came to New York on buses paid for by Republican governors who saw the move as both a way to ease the burden on their own states and a potent political message for Democrats who in their view had played down the situation at the border for too long.

N1J44VCTE9_GPM1HUEHJTXR5KQ,"Two Men, Including Murder Suspect, Escape From Arkansas Jail",By Eduardo Medina,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/arkansas-jail-escape-manhunt.html,"The authorities on Tuesday were searching for two men who had escaped from a jail in Central Arkansas and were considered to be dangerous, in a manhunt that has mobilized law enforcement agencies across the state, officials said.
The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement on Tuesday that officers found out Monday morning that two detainees were missing from the W.C. “Dub” Brassell Adult Detention Center in Pine Bluff, about 40 miles southeast of Little Rock.
Officials are investigating how the men, Noah Roush, 22, and Jatonia Bryant, 23, escaped undetected, Maj. John Bean, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said on Tuesday. They likely fled within the last two days, he said, and they are not believed to be armed.
The Arkansas State Police and the Department of Corrections are assisting in the investigation.
Major Bean said reverse 911 calls had been made to the roughly 66,000 residents of Jefferson County, cautioning them about the manhunt.
He added that officials were also investigating the men’s relationship and whether they worked together.

NH92AYIGLA_IZFUEPBWMK514GZ,The One Part of the Housing Market That’s Growing,By Gregory Schmidt,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/business/housing-market-new-existing.html,"When Joel Adler decided it was time to downsize from his six-bedroom house in Parkland, Fla., where he had lived for more than 20 years, he was disappointed with the lack of options.
“There weren’t a lot of homes to look at,” said Mr. Adler, a 76-year-old retired teacher, who had been searching for a year and a half.
Eventually, he turned to Valencia Sound, a gated community in Boynton Beach, Fla., that opened in 2019, joining the growing ranks of home buyers who opted for a newly built house instead of an existing one, a rare bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market.
The housing market has been mired for much of the past year, bogged down by high prices, soaring mortgage rates and a dearth of inventory, pushing many would-be buyers to the sidelines.
Existing homes typically account for about 90 percent of sales, but homeowners who have locked in low-rate mortgages have been reluctant to sell, resulting in limited choices and sky-high prices for prospective buyers. Last year, existing-home sales fell to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, while the median price hit a record high, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors.
That spurred a rise in construction, as developers rushed to meet demand and dangled incentives to entice buyers. Sales of new homes jumped 4.2 percent last year from 2022, the Census Bureau reported on Thursday.

NP14MXJ60Q_GQ35R8IWKIXQZC5,An Unlikely New Threat to Haiti’s Stability: An Armed Environmental Group,By Frances Robles,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/americas/haiti-political-instability-bsap.html,"In Haiti, as the number of murders soar and kidnappings rise, even the police are fleeing.
With no elected president in office and a prime minister widely seen as illegitimate, calls for the government’s ouster are now being heard from an unlikely source: a brigade of armed officers ostensibly responsible for protecting environmentally sensitive areas.
Armed uniformed members of the brigade clashed with government forces in northern Haiti this week, heightening tensions in an already volatile nation where gangs have seized control over large swaths of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and are wreaking havoc in rural areas.
The environmental group, the Brigade for the Security of Protected Areas (known as B-SAP), became angry after the prime minister fired its leader. On Wednesday, the group’s officers attempted to invade the local customs office, and Haitian National Police units repelled them using tear gas.
Just as worrisome to analysts is the allegiance some of the group’s leaders have publicly declared to Guy Philippe, a former police commander and coup-plotter who recently returned to Haiti after serving six years in a U.S. federal prison.
In the less than 60 days since Mr. Philippe returned home, he has been traveling the country, shoring up support for his so-called revolution.

O0KNAK60UM_5HMAJOEK8SN86H6,"After Years, F.B.I. Recovers Remains of American Woman in Afghanistan",By Adam GoldmanReporting from Washington,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/fbi-american-woman-afghanistan.html,"Cydney Mizell, an aid worker teaching English in southern Afghanistan, vanished in 2008, abducted after being driven off the side of a road and presumed dead for 15 years.
Members of her family, left with few other details of the circumstances surrounding her disappearance, wondered whether they would ever learn her fate.
Jan Mizell, her younger sister, said she would tell people: “Somebody over there knows what happened to my sister. They’re just not talking.”
But about a year ago, Ms. Mizell, 64, who lives south of Seattle, received news from the F.B.I.: Agents had collected small bone fragments belonging to Cydney in Afghanistan and would try to bring back all of her remains.
The recovery of Cydney Mizell brings to an end a terrorism case that had long stymied investigators, becoming one of the oldest kidnappings that the F.B.I. has worked on in Afghanistan. It also demonstrates the intricacies of tracking down hostages, particularly in a country where the United States no longer has a presence, and underscores the difficulty of finding the bodies of those lost abroad.
The F.B.I. did not make the discovery public at the time but confirmed in a statement on Saturday that Ms. Mizell’s remains were “recovered and repatriated to her family.” The effort included F.B.I. agents in the District of Columbia, as well as officials across the intelligence community who are part of the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which focuses on hostage cases.

OE08O6QPEA_EYGUBQQ7UGP3VEJ,"500,000 New Yorkers Could Have Medical Debt Erased Under New Program",By Joseph Goldstein,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/nyregion/medical-debt-forgiveness.html,"New York City will buy up millions of dollars of medical debt and erase it in a program that officials hope will ultimately help as many as 500,000 New Yorkers.
Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday that the city would invest $18 million in a partnership with a nonprofit organization that buys up unpaid medical debt from hospitals at steep discounts and then erases it. Hospital systems and commercial debt buyers are often willing to sell medical debt at steep discounts, and the $18 million could wipe out over $2 billion in unpaid medical bills, city officials said.
“Up to half a million New Yorkers will see their medical debt wiped thanks to this life-changing program — the largest municipal initiative of its kind in the country,” Mayor Adams said.
Daniel Lempert, a spokesman for the nonprofit organization RIP Medical Debt, said that the group had begun conversations with New York City hospitals about examining their books to identify patients eligible for debt relief. In deciding which debts to buy, the group looks for patients whose unpaid medical bills are at least 5 percent of their annual household income or patients in households with an income under four times the federal poverty line — which is $31,200 for a family of four.
New Yorkers do not need to apply to be included in the program. RIP Medical Debt said that those chosen to have their debts erased would receive a letter in the mail.
“No one in New York City, or in America, in 2024, should have to choose between getting the health care they need and paying their rent or buying food to feed their families,” the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Ashwin Vasan, said.

He stated he has always said he would “support” the eventual Republican Party presidential nominee, not that he would “endorse” the nominee.
A picture caption with an article on Jan. 19 about the U.S. funding of the atomic bomb misstated which structures remained in the area of Hiroshima immediately affected by the blast. Several structures beyond the frame of the photograph still stood; the structure pictured, now referred to as the A-Bomb Dome, was not the only one that remained. The caption also misstated the building’s current function. While it is known as the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, it does not house a memorial. It is instead one part of a larger Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and museum.
An article on Thursday about a U.N. shelter in Gaza that was struck by tanks misstated the day that the Israeli military ordered evacuations from parts of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, that included two hospitals. It was Tuesday, not Wednesday.
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the ways that NATO’s role has shifted since Russia invaded Ukraine misstated the number of years that the fighting in Ukraine has been underway. It’s been nearly two years, not three.
An article on Thursday about how Nikki Haley’s approach to the Republican primary race in New Hampshire ignored lessons from past presidential candidates misstated the year that Bill Clinton finished the Iowa caucuses with 2.8 percent of the vote. It was 1992, not 1996.

OPFH637SJX_FG6VES10Q8PQ1IZ,A Norwegian Official Fought Plagiarism. Then She Was Caught Copying.,"By Emma Bubola and Henrik Pryser LibellEmma Bubola reported from London, Henrik Pryser Libell reported from Oslo.","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/europe/norway-plagiarism-minister-resigns.html,"As Norway’s higher education minister, Sandra Borch was responsible for making sure that students played by the rules. When one of those students was acquitted of the offense of plagiarism, Ms. Borch appealed, taking the case to the nation’s Supreme Court.
So it shocked the country when, just a few days later, Ms. Borch had to resign after it emerged that parts of her master’s thesis seemed identical to other reports that she had not referenced.
“When I wrote my master’s thesis around 10 years ago, I made a big mistake,” Ms. Borch said at a news conference on Friday, when she stepped down. “I took text from other assignments without stating the sources.”
The person who uncovered Ms. Borch’s misdeeds was Kristoffer Rytterager, a 27-year-old student in Oslo, who said he got “a bit pissed” that the minister went after an individual student for what he considered a minor mistake, and decided to look into the minister’s own academic work.
“When you are acting like you’re more sacred than a saint,” Mr. Rytterager said in an interview. “You shouldn’t have any skeletons in the closet.”
The case that angered him involved a student who had submitted an exam with some excerpts from a test she had turned in — and failed — the previous year. The student was suspended for two semesters in 2022, and her lawyer said the case had psychologically devastated her. More than a hundred professors and other academics signed a petition objecting to her treatment.

OQOMMAKZ2N_OVBL9LD126UYPLW,Richard Prince to Pay Photographers Who Sued Over Copyright,By Matt Stevens,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/design/richard-prince-copyright-lawsuit.html,"The artist Richard Prince agreed to pay at least $650,000 to two photographers whose images he had incorporated in his own work, ending a long-running copyright dispute that had been closely monitored by the art world.
Two judgments filed on Thursday in New York awarded damages to the photographers, Donald Graham and Eric McNatt, and barred Prince from reproducing the photographs known as “Rastafarian Smoking a Joint” and “Kim Gordon 1” (of the musician Kim Gordon).
Those images were part of a Prince installation, called “New Portraits,” in which he printed several Instagram photos on large canvases and added his own Instagram-style comments below them.
Graham’s image was incorporated into a work referred to as “Portrait of Rastajay92,” which was exhibited at a New York gallery in 2014. McNatt’s image was used in a work referred to as “Portrait of Kim Gordon,” which was shown at a gallery in 2015.
David Marriott, a lawyer for Graham and McNatt, said the photographers were pleased with the judgments and called the cases “a ‘David vs. Goliath’ matter for the art world, and a story of principle and perseverance.”
Matt Gaughan, Prince’s studio manager, said that the artist “adamantly refused to admit infringement” and had “agreed to settle over eight years of costly litigation for a tiny fraction of what trial alone would cost.”

OTCCCCCFIL_21OG4ZOAC7ZWLUG,San Francisco Tried to Build a $1.7 Million Toilet. It’s Still Not Done.,By Heather KnightReporting from San Francisco’s Noe Valley Town Square while avoiding liquids.,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/san-francisco-toilet.html,"You could say San Francisco’s charming Noe Valley neighborhood has it all.
A thriving commercial corridor brimming with restaurants, bookstores and artisan coffee shops. So many throngs of young families that it has the moniker “Stroller Valley.” A town square with yoga classes and a farmer’s market.
But what Noe Valley still needs is a toilet.
Fifteen months after city officials were ready to throw a party in the Noe Valley Town Square to celebrate funding for a tiny bathroom with a toilet and sink, nothing but mulch remains in its place.
The toilet project broke down the minute taxpayers realized the city was planning an event to celebrate $1.7 million in state funds that local politicians had secured for the lone 150-square-foot structure. That’s enough to purchase a single-family home in San Francisco — with multiple bathrooms.
Even more confounding was the explanation that the tiny bathroom would take two to three years to install because of the city’s labyrinthine permitting and building process. City leaders quickly canceled their potty party, and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California took back the funds.
Late-night comedians skewered the city. Residents dubbed the saga “Toiletgate,” and the $1.7 million toilet soon became the “it” costume at local Halloween parties that year.

P5WG1TXVUG_YGKUJP8WI6VZ5X2,"Jesse Jane, Pornographic Film Star, Dies at 43",By Remy Tumin,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/arts/television/jesse-jane-dead.html,"Jesse Jane, a onetime Hooters waitress and beauty pageant contestant who went on to star in the highest-budget film series in pornographic film history, was found dead on Wednesday at a home in Oklahoma. She was 43.
The cause was believed to be a drug overdose, said Lt. Francisco Franco of the Moore Police Department in Moore, Okla. He said that officers responded on Wednesday morning for a welfare check at a house where Ms. Jane and her boyfriend, Brett Hasenmueller, had been staying. They were both found dead, Lieutenant Franco said, adding that the deaths remained under investigation.
Ms. Jane, with her sweeping blond hair, high-arched eyebrows and vivacious personality, was a defining star of early 2000s pornography as the internet transformed the industry. She then crossed over into some mainstream productions.
“She was a performer during an era where adult films were seen all over the world, and the promotions were massive,” Brian Gross, a publicist for the porn industry, said in a text message to The New York Times. “She made sure that she gave her all, not only in performing, but in promotion as well.”
Ms. Jane was born Cynthia Ann Howell on July 16, 1980, in Fort Worth, according to public records. Her family settled in the Oklahoma City area when her parents worked at Tinker Air Force Base, according to a 2006 interview Ms. Jane gave The Oklahoma Gazette. She graduated with honors from Moore High School in 1998.
Ms. Jane modeled for retailers like 5-7-9 and David’s Bridal before landing a job with Hooters, the restaurant chain, for a commercial. The Gazette wrote. She worked her way up in the organization to regional training coordinator before deciding to become a full-time Hawaiian Tropic bikini model.

P6F2OB8C09_21UOKSUX84HP0BU,"Military Plane Crashes in Russia, Killing All Aboard, Moscow Says","By Andrew E. Kramer and Ivan NechepurenkoAndrew E. Kramer reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, where he has covered the war since the 2022 invasion, and Ivan Nechepurenko reported from Tbilisi, Georgia.","Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/europe/russia-military-plane-crash-ukraine.html,"A large Russian military transport plane crashed on Wednesday near the border with Ukraine, killing everyone onboard, the Russian Defense Ministry said, accusing Ukraine of shooting down the plane with missiles.
The ministry said in a statement that the plane had been carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transferred to the Belgorod region to be exchanged for Russian service personnel. It accused Ukrainian forces of launching two missiles from the nearby Kharkiv region of Ukraine that struck the aircraft. The plane was also carrying six crew members and three other individuals, the ministry said.
The Russian claims could not be independently verified.
Officials in Kyiv did not comment directly on Moscow’s accusations that Ukraine shot down the plane. The military’s general staff headquarters issued a statement Wednesday afternoon asserting a right to target Russian military transport airplanes in the border region.
But later Wednesday, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency hinted that the episode might have been a tragic mistake, saying that Russia had not informed it that prisoners would be flown to Belgorod’s airport, as was the case in previous exchanges. The airport is within range of Ukrainian drones and missiles.
Ukraine acknowledged, though, that a prisoner exchange was planned for the day, raising questions about whether it should have assumed that prisoners would be transported into the region.
If Ukraine did shoot down a plane with its own soldiers onboard, even unwittingly, it would be painful setback at a difficult time for its war effort, which is severely challenged by ammunition and personnel shortages and fears that Western support is eroding.

Fitzsimmons,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/nyregion/adams-nyc-speech.html,"After facing mounting challenges in his second year in office, Mayor Eric Adams on Wednesday used his third State of the City address to deliver a rah-rah overview of his tenure, highlighting improvements in public safety and jobs while playing down the migrant crisis that has overwhelmed New York City’s shelter system.
Mr. Adams contended that the city was moving in the right direction and chose not to dwell on his earlier warning that the migrant crisis would destroy it. He focused on three themes: protecting public safety, rebuilding the economy after the devastation of the pandemic and making the city more livable.
“The state of our city is strong, far stronger than it was two years ago,” Mr. Adams said at the speech at Hostos Community College in the Bronx. “I want to thank every hard-working New Yorker out there for helping bring our city back from the brink.”
Mr. Adams, a Democrat, acknowledged the need to address the city’s affordability and housing crisis. And while he did not unveil any major initiatives, he announced a plan to build 24 affordable housing projects on city-owned properties.
The mayor also announced the redesign of a plaza in Manhattan’s Chinatown, a “green economy action plan” that focuses on climate change and plans to create an agency to regulate the delivery industry.
Mr. Adams said the proposed Department of Sustainable Delivery would “regulate new forms of delivery transit and ensure their safety,” noting the rise of e-bikes and other motorized forms of transportation used by delivery workers.

PDVOPCR3IA_MHWYRPGOJCN5BNI,A Hazard for Visitors to Colombia: ‘Devil’s Breath’,By Annie Correal and Genevieve GlatskyAnnie Correal and Genevieve Glatsky reported from Bogotá.,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20230123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/americas/colombia-dating-apps-sedatives-deaths.html,"Steven Valdez thought he recognized the woman in the Medellín park. Chatting, the two realized they had matched on the dating platform Tinder. They exchanged numbers and made plans.
On their date last spring, he said the woman suggested that he try a typical Colombian dish — a creamy soup called ajiaco. She carried it from a restaurant counter to their table.
He had two spoonfuls, Mr. Valdez, 31, said. “And that’s the last thing I remember.”
Like scores of visitors to the Colombian city last year, Mr. Valdez, a travel blogger, said he was told at the hospital that he had ingested a powerful, potentially fatal cocktail of sedatives, including a drug called scopolamine.
Scopolamine makes its victims black out, and experts say it can also make them unusually open to suggestion — including agreeing to hand over a wallet or reveal passwords.
American officials are so concerned that they issued a security alert this month about the sedatives and a wave of violent crime targeting visitors to Colombia, especially in the increasingly popular tourist destination of Medellín, a city of 2.6 million in a valley of the Andes Mountains.

PKJOWP5M8G_FL0XT62J26VXTY1,How Haley Lost New Hampshire: Ignoring Lessons From Underdogs of the Past,By Jonathan Weisman,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/haley-new-hampshire-loss.html,"Senator John McCain’s first town hall in May 1999 was awful. Thirteen people milled around at a nearly empty American Legion Hall in Manchester, and only nine of them were still deciding whom to vote for in the first-in-the-nation primary.
But the Arizona Republican, facing a goliath named George W. Bush with the entire Republican establishment behind him, stuck with it. He took questions in church basements, diners and community centers until the assembled voters ran out of questions to ask. He talked to reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus and made no secret of reaching out to independents.
In February 2000, Mr. McCain shocked the Texas governor with a convincing New Hampshire victory, 49 percent to 30 percent.
Accessibility, honesty, vulnerability and a near-constant presence — Nikki Haley did none of that in New Hampshire against her own goliath, Donald J. Trump, a far different candidate from Mr. Bush but one who also has the aura of inevitability. On Tuesday, she lost New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary.
Maybe it didn’t have to happen that way.
“Seven, 10, 14 days ago, I thought she could have won,” Mike Dennehy, Mr. McCain’s New Hampshire campaign manager and the architect of his improbable victory. “I really did.”

PLQXPDMDNI_898102F9I0GSE72,Protesters Storm Meeting at Israel’s Parliament to Demand More Action on Hostages,By Adam Rasgonreporting from Jerusalem,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/middleeast/israel-parliament-hamas-hostages-protest.html,"Supporters and relatives of hostages captured in the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks burst into a meeting at Israel’s Parliament on Monday to demand that lawmakers take greater action to secure the captives’ release from Gaza.
The protest reflected the growing frustration of hostage families who have become increasingly concerned about the fate of their family members as the war, already well into its fourth month, continues.
“You will not sit here while they are dying there,” read signs held up by some of the demonstrators, who interrupted a meeting of the Finance Committee.
“Shame on you!” one of the protesters yelled.
Over the past week, several current and former Israeli security officials have suggested that making a deal with Hamas would be the only way to bring the hostages back to Israel safely. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has continued to speak of both eliminating Hamas in Gaza and returning the hostages.
Gilad Korngold, 62, whose son Tal Shoham is one of the hostages, was seen on video being restrained by an usher in the conference room. In an interview later in the day, Mr. Korngold said time was running out to bring his son home alive.
“The danger is increasing every day that passes,” Mr. Korngold said. “Israel and the relevant countries in the region need to sit at the table — without eating or sleeping — and make this terrible situation end.”
He said that three members of his family were killed on Oct. 7, and six others who had been abducted were released during a short-lived cease-fire in late November.
On Saturday, protesters at rallies in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Caesarea — near a private residence of Mr. Netanyahu — called on the government to take immediate action to secure the release of the more than 100 hostages still being held in Gaza.
The cease-fire in November between Israel and Hamas, which lasted a week, was brokered with help from Qatar and Egypt. It allowed for the release of about 100 hostages and 240 Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel, but efforts to secure another such deal have made little apparent progress.
On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu told representatives of hostage families that there was “no real proposal” from Hamas, but that Israel had put forward its own offer, without elaborating on its details, according to a statement from his office.
Brett McGurk, a senior Biden administration official, was scheduled to travel to Cairo and Doha, Qatar, this week in hopes of making progress toward an agreement that would result in the release of more hostages in exchange for a pause in Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, two American officials said on Sunday."
POE8OSFTHJ_46M4KB9DSE2MH9A,F.A.A. Tells Airlines to Check Panels on a Second Boeing Plane,By Mark WalkerReporting from Washington,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/faa-boeing-737-900er-doorplug.html,"The Federal Aviation Administration recommended late Sunday night that airlines begin visual inspections of door plugs installed on Boeing 737-900ER planes, the second Boeing model to come under scrutiny this month.
The F.A.A. said the plane had the same door plug design as the company’s newer 737 Max 9. The agency grounded about 170 Max 9 jets after a door panel blew off one of the planes shortly after an Alaska Airlines flight left Portland, Ore., on Jan. 5, forcing an emergency landing.
The door plugs are placed as a panel where an emergency door would otherwise be if a plane was configured with more seats.
After grounding the Max 9 planes, the F.A.A. subsequently announced it was investigating whether Boeing failed to ensure that the jet was safe and conformed to the design approved by the agency.
The F.A.A. said on Sunday that the door plug on the 737-900ER, an earlier-generation model that is not part of Boeing’s Max line, had not yet been a problem.
“As an added layer of safety, the Federal Aviation Administration is recommending that operators of Boeing 737-900ER aircraft visually inspect mid-exit door plugs to ensure the door is properly secured,” the agency said in a statement.
The F.A.A. is recommending that the airlines using the 737-900ER immediately inspect the four locations used to secure the door plug to the airframe. The 737-900ER has over 11 million hours of operation and about four million flight cycles, according to the F.A.A. Boeing delivered about 500 of the planes globally between 2007 and 2019, though not all of them have door plugs.
“We fully support the F.A.A. and our customers in this action,” Boeing said in a statement.
Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which both use the 737-900ER, said in statements that they had already started inspecting their planes of that model. Delta Air Lines, which also flies the aircraft, said it had “elected to take proactive measures to inspect our 737-900ER fleet.” None of the airlines expected any disruptions to their operations.
The episode involving the Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 flight this month did not result in any serious injuries, but it could have been far more serious if the plane had been at its cruising altitude. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the episode in hopes of learning what caused the door plug to blow off the plane.
In the meantime, the F.A.A. recently ordered an initial round of inspections of 40 of the grounded Max 9 planes as it works to finalize inspection instructions for the aircraft. The agency announced last week that those inspections had been completed and that it would review the data from them."
Q2Q9PKW63F_R08OSHM5TAR5PHT,Genocide Ruling Has Deep Symbolism but Little Immediate Effect,By Patrick KingsleyReporting from Jerusalem,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/middleeast/icj-genocide-ruling-israel-gaza.html,"A ruling on Friday by the International Court of Justice on charges of genocide against Israel had deep historical resonance for both Israelis and Palestinians. But it lacked immediate practical consequences.
The World Court did not order a halt to fighting in the Gaza Strip and made no attempt to rule on the merits of the case brought by South Africa, a process that will take months — if not years — to complete.
But the court did order Israel to comply with the Genocide Convention, to send more aid to Gaza and to inform the court of its efforts to do so — interim measures that felt like a rebuke to many Israelis and a moral victory to many Palestinians.
For many Israelis, the fact that a state founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust had been accused of genocide was “one hell of a symbol,” Alon Pinkas, an Israeli political commentator and former ambassador, said after the ruling by the court in The Hague.
“That we’re even mentioned in the same sentence as the concept of genocide — not even atrocity, not disproportionate force, not war crime, but genocide — that is extremely uncomfortable,” he added.
For many Palestinians, the court’s intervention offered a brief sense of validation for their cause. Israel is rarely held to account for its actions, Palestinians and their supporters say, and the ruling felt like a welcome exception amid one of the deadliest wars this century.

Q6Y1SI2GKA_PF8D5D63Q3B5F95,Did a Delicious Mistake Lead to This National Dish?,By Christina Morales,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/dining/sopa-paraguaya.html,"If you ever order sopa, or soup, in Paraguay, don’t expect to be served a steaming bowl of broth. What you’ll get instead is a dense and cheesy hunk of cornbread.
This bread, also known as sopa Paraguaya, is one of the country’s most popular dishes. Cornmeal, onion, cheese, milk and eggs are mixed together to make a custardy cornbread, with a texture similar to bread pudding, that is commonly served alongside grilled meats.
The bread can be difficult to find in the United States, where nearly 30,000 Paraguayans live — the smallest Latino group in the country, according to census data.
And it can be challenging for Paraguayan American cooks to ensure that the moist texture of the bread remains the same when using American ingredients. Instead of the creamy queso Paraguaya that’s traditional in the recipe, for instance, many chefs and cooks substitute similar cheeses like mozzarella, Muenster and Monterey Jack.

Q7ZP43I3T6_VG7RR261LT2IFX0,What Is ‘Settler Colonialism’?,By Jennifer Schuessler,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/arts/what-is-settler-colonialism.html,"In the intense war of words over the Israel-Gaza war, a particular phrase has popped up repeatedly. At protests, on fliers and in some mainstream publications, it is common to see Israel described — or more likely, assailed — as a “settler-colonial” state.
The concept of settler colonialism originates in academia, where its use has surged over the past two decades, whether in case studies of particular places or sweeping master narratives that purport to explain everything since Columbus. It has also been widely taken up on the activist left, invoked in discussions of gentrification, environmental degradation, financial capitalism and other subjects.
The term “settler colonialism” may combine two words that are very familiar. But in combination, the term can land as a moral slander — or worse.
Those who call Israel a settler-colonial enterprise see a country formed by waves of Jewish arrivals who pushed Arab inhabitants out to create an exclusive ethnostate. To others, that is a gross distortion that redefines refugees as oppressors and ignores the long history of the Jewish diaspora’s attachment to its ancestral land — as well as the continuous existence of a Jewish community whose ancestors never left.
More broadly, critics say that the embrace of the term reflects a dangerously simplistic view of history — a kind of “moral derangement,” as Adam Kirsch, an editor at The Wall Street Journal, wrote recently, which justifies violence and rests on “the permanent division of the world into innocent people and guilty people.”

QAUYXIE4MF_T0E783LRE8MNFTS,Trump Ally Withdraws Plan for a G.O.P. Resolution to Move Past Haley,"By Shane Goldmacher, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan","Jan. 25, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/trump-rnc-presumptive-nominee.html,"One of Donald J. Trump’s key allies inside the Republican National Committee withdrew a planned resolution to try to force the party’s official body to say that the G.O.P. presidential nominating contest is effectively over, even though only two states have voted and Nikki Haley has vowed to continue her campaign against the dominant front-runner.
David Bossie, an R.N.C. committeeman from Maryland and a longtime Trump confidant, had proposed a draft resolution proclaiming Mr. Trump the party’s “presumptive” nominee, according to two people with direct knowledge of his role in the effort.
But he withdrew the plan to push the resolution after Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social website that he did not want such a measure.
“While I greatly appreciate the Republican National Committee (RNC) wanting to make me their PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, and while they have far more votes than necessary to do it, I feel, for the sake of PARTY UNITY, that they should NOT go forward with this plan, but that I should do it the ‘Old Fashioned’ way, and finish the process off AT THE BALLOT BOX,” he wrote.
Mr. Bossie previewed his plan in an interview with the television host Chris Cuomo on NewsNation after Mr. Trump won the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
“Donald Trump is the apparent nominee at this point,” Mr. Bossie said, adding that he would bring up the issue at the R.N.C.’s meeting next week in Las Vegas. “It’s over and it is time for us to come together.”

QGBLHO7Z8A_ANH5APZR67U3I34,U.N. to Investigate Claim That Employees Participated in Oct. 7 Attack,"By Farnaz Fassihi, Edward Wong, Russell Goldman and Ronen BergmanReporting from the United Nations, Washington and Tel Aviv","Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/middleeast/un-aid-israel-oct-7-attacks.html,"The United Nations on Friday fired 12 of its employees in Gaza and began an investigation into them after accusations by Israel that they had helped plan and had participated in the Oct. 7 terrorist assault that left about 1,200 Israelis dead and more than 240 others captured.
The workers, all men employed by the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, known by the acronym UNRWA, are subject to a criminal investigation, two U.N. officials said.
“UNRWA reiterates its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the abhorrent attacks,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the agency. “Any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror will be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution.”
In addition, a senior U.N. official, briefed on the accusations, called the allegations “extremely serious and horrific.”
UNRWA has long denied Israel’s claims that it fuels anti-Israeli incitement in Gaza. But it took a sharply different approach to the more serious accusations on Friday, just days after Israel presented them to the agency.
The accusations quickly led the United States to temporarily halt funding to the organization. UNRWA, which provides social services in the Gaza Strip, has been the principal agency overseeing the distribution of aid to Gazans amid a dire humanitarian crisis in the territory that has worsened through months of war since the Oct. 7 attack.

QHQZGO0CMA_RF8KPOP8CBO6P7S,Voters in Colorado Case Lay Out Their Argument to Block Trump From Ballot,By Abbie VanSickleReporting from Washington,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/us/politics/colorado-trump-supreme-court-election.html,"A group of Colorado voters laid out its argument to the Supreme Court on Friday for why former President Donald J. Trump should be barred from the state’s primary ballot, contending that his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol amounted to an insurrection.
In a court filing embedded with photographs of rioters attacking the Capitol and tweets from Mr. Trump, the voters forcefully asserted that Mr. Trump had spurred a brazen attack on democracy, betraying his oath of office.
“As president, Trump swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,” the voters’ brief said. It added, “Instead of peacefully ceding power, Trump intentionally organized and incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol in a desperate effort to prevent the counting of electoral votes cast against him.”
Mr. Trump’s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Colorado’s top court declared him ineligible because it found that he had engaged in insurrection in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election leading up to the Capitol riot.
The justices are expected to hear the case, Trump v. Anderson, No. 23-719, on Feb. 8, less than a month before Super Tuesday, when many states, including Colorado, hold their primaries.
The central issue in the case is the meaning of a clause in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution that was added in the wake of the Civil War. That language prohibits from holding office those “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States,” have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”

QLPPRBO6CR_T93238QFKCV1KL5,One Hope From Changes at This Holocaust Museum: Fewer Nazi Selfies,By Ralph Blumenthal,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/design/zekelman-holocaust-center-detroit.html,"Students on school trips to a Holocaust museum outside Detroit would stand riveted at one stark display: a Nazi officer’s black uniform with a red swastika armband, guns and a whip.
Some couldn’t resist snapping selfies.
Now, however, the exhibit, at the Zekelman Holocaust Center in Farmington Hills, Mich., has been redone as part of a major redesign. The showcase with the uniform is still there, but the view of those artifacts is partially blocked by photographs of German soldiers lounging at ease or leading Jews to mass shooting sites.
“I don’t want them to see this uniform without facing the truth of these people who wore these uniforms,” said Mark Mulder, the museum’s curator and a scholar of what is called atrocity imagery.
In the same way, the museum has rearranged a pile of captured Nazi banners to obscure the swastikas. And gone altogether is a giant blowup of Hitler where some visitors were caught on security cameras giving the Nazi salute.
As the world marks another Holocaust Remembrance Day on Saturday, commemorating the 1945 liberation of Auschwitz, some museum curators are reimagining how to present the grim lessons of Nazi genocide while grappling with how younger generations with little connection to those cataclysmic events behave in settings meant to memorialize immense suffering.

QM9EHU0O3D_8H08UDL4OSPZPG2,Palestinian Americans’ Lawsuit in Oakland Seeks to Halt U.S. Support for Israel,By Shawn Hubler,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/middleeast/oakland-lawsuit-biden-israel-palestinians.html,"Palestinian American plaintiffs asked a federal judge in California on Friday to force the White House to withdraw U.S. support for Israel pending a cease-fire in Gaza and accused President Biden and other administration officials of abetting a genocide of the Palestinian people.
In more than two hours of testimony before Judge Jeffrey White in U.S. District Court in Oakland, plaintiffs in the unusual lawsuit expressed grief and outrage, choking back tears as they spoke of their loved ones who have been killed in Gaza.
One Palestinian immigrant, who lives in Fairfield, Calif., said seven members of his family had been killed in airstrikes in Gaza, including the children of a cousin “who is like a brother to me.” Another, living in San Ramon, Calif., said his family had lost more than 100 members, and a single Israeli attack had killed his cousin, his cousin’s son, and 14 members of a neighbor’s family.
The testimony came in the second judicial proceeding in a day to frame Israel’s bombardment of the embattled Palestinian enclave as a potentially grave violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Hours earlier, the United Nations’ highest judicial body ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts by its forces, as part of that court’s consideration of formal charges that Israel’s response to Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7 was crafted to deny Palestinians the right to exist.
The federal case in Northern California is unlikely to succeed, given legal precedents that limit judicial power over U.S. presidents on foreign policy decisions. But the lawsuit has energized pro-Palestinian activists, who have convinced about a dozen local governments in the Bay Area, Atlanta and other regions of the country to call for a cease-fire in Gaza.
Telling the plaintiffs that he wanted them to know that they “have been seen,” the judge called the testimony “gut wrenching” and the case “probably the most difficult” he had ever dealt with.

QOM9K0GVRW_SUDYGF5Q1ATH677,New Hampshire Showed Trump’s Strengths and Weaknesses,By Matthew Cullen,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/briefing/new-hampshire-trump-russian-plane-crash.html,"Donald Trump’s comfortable victory last night in New Hampshire’s Republican presidential primary demonstrated his ironclad control of the party’s right-wing base and set him on what could very well be a short march to his third nomination.
Trump is the first non-incumbent Republican candidate to win both Iowa and New Hampshire. His dominance has melted away much of the remaining opposition to him among Republicans on Capitol Hill, and his polling numbers suggest that there is probably no state in the country where another Republican could defeat him.
But last night’s results also underscored some of Trump’s potential vulnerabilities. Independents, college-educated voters and Republicans who are unwilling to dismiss his legal jeopardy voted in large numbers for his rival, Nikki Haley. Those intraparty divisions point to trouble ahead for Trump as the presidential race enters a broader electorate, one that rejected him less than four years ago.
In other politics news, the United Automobile Workers union, an influential voice on labor issues, endorsed President Biden.

QT8WYEITS3_ZC73NXCONTQ2DNZ,"TurboTax Can No Longer Advertise Products as Free, F.T.C. Says",By Rebecca Carballo,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/intuit-turbotax-free-federal-regulations.html,"Federal regulators have ruled that Intuit, the maker of the tax-filing software TurboTax, must stop marketing its services as free, unless they are free to everyone or exceptions are clearly disclosed.
TurboTax had for years claimed customers could file their taxes online for free. The Federal Trade Commission said in an opinion and final order issued on Monday that its advertising was deceptive because two-thirds of taxpayers were not eligible to file with the free product.
The commission also found that the company’s attempts to disclose that not everybody qualified for free services were “ineffective and often inconspicuous.”
Examples of ineligible taxpayers include those claiming mortgage and property deductions, charitable donations over $300, unemployment income, investment income, rental property income and certain education expenses. Gig workers who reported income as independent contractors, including many delivery drivers, were also ineligible.
Samuel Levine, the director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, described Intuit’s violations as “egregious.”
Federal regulators cited misleading language in the company’s “AbsoluteZero” advertising campaign. That campaign included the phrase “Free Guaranteed” and told consumers, “At least your taxes are free.”
“The order also sends a message across industry — ‘free’ means free — not ‘free for a few’ or ‘free for some,’” Mr. Levine said in a statement. “Businesses can expect an F.T.C. enforcement action if they harness the power of ‘free’ in the dishonest way Intuit did.”
The F.T.C. order not only bars TurboTax from marketing its products as free, unless the products are free to everyone, it also requires it to “clearly and conspicuously” disclose the percentage of taxpayers or consumers who qualify for the free product or service. Alternatively, TurboTax may disclose that a majority of consumers do not qualify.
Intuit said in a statement that the decision was “deeply flawed” and that the company would appeal it.
“This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in the same case,” the statement said.
In 2022, after a multistate investigation led by Attorney General Letitia James of New York, Intuit agreed to pay back $141 million to more than four million Americans who had been unfairly charged for tax services that were falsely advertised as free. The company did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.
Settlement checks were sent out last year, according to The Associated Press. Those affected were predominantly low-income taxpayers who qualified for a free federal tax service program operated by the Internal Revenue Service."
QYPKRC7HL4_NFDBKO7SOWGWPOL,The Cosmic Genius of Iris van Herpen,By Vanessa FriedmanReporting from Paris,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 25, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/style/iris-van-herpen-sculpting-the-senses-couture.html,"It is possible that the most dazzling couture show in Paris this week is not actually taking place on a runway at all, but in an entirely different sort of setting. Possible that said couture show is not an invitation-only affair with gold ballroom chairs and the latest celebrity du jour, but rather one open to the public. And certain that it is less about nostalgia for a past when couture was defined by the whispering of silk satin ball gowns, and more about a dream of the future.
The show in question? “Iris van Herpen: Sculpting the Senses,” a one-woman exhibition that opened at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in late November and scheduled to run through April 28.
Five years in the making, “Sculpting the Senses” crystallizes why Ms. van Herpen, 39, is the youngest female designer to be granted a solo show at the museum in its 140 years of existence. And why, more than a decade after being invited to join the ranks of Paris’s couturiers, Ms. van Herpen has also been made a Chevalier des Arts et Lettres, an honor presented by the French Ministry of Culture.
“She has managed to create a unique world, somewhere between fairy tale and science fiction,” said Christine Macel, director of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. “In my opinion, she is unique and essential.”
Though couture is generally referred to as fashion’s “laboratory,” its place of “experimentation” — in part because, as a made-to-order art, it can be as wildly inaccessible and expensive as it needs to be — it also is often treated as an anachronism. Seen as a relic of another time, before technology; part of a cultural legacy, sure, but without much use beyond the red carpet and fabulous Instagram content.
Ms. van Herpen’s work, which takes the whole idea of the “lab” at face value (she is a regular visitor to CERN’s Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, and there three microscopes are included in the exhibition), is an authoritative rebuttal of this idea, made in cloth.

R4VCUP1Y6M_N84KCCJ6VMA16YI,Last Exit Before Trump: New Hampshire,By Nate Cohn,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/upshot/trump-haley-new-hampshire-primary.html,"Let’s be blunt about the stakes of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
If Donald J. Trump wins decisively, as the polls suggest, he will be on track to win the Republican nomination without a serious contest. The race will be all but over.
The backdrop is simple: Mr. Trump holds a dominant, 50-plus-point lead in the polls with just seven weeks to go until the heart of the primary season, when the preponderance of delegates will be awarded. His position has only improved since Iowa, with national polls now routinely showing him with over 70 percent of the vote.
Even skeptical Republican officials are consolidating behind the party’s front-runner. Ron DeSantis’s decision to suspend his campaign and endorse Mr. Trump is only the latest example.
The polling by state isn’t much better for Nikki Haley, the only remaining opponent for Mr. Trump. He leads Ms. Haley by at least 30 points in all of the states after New Hampshire until Super Tuesday. So without a monumental shift in the race, he will secure the nomination in short order.
New Hampshire is the only state where we can entertain — however unlikely — the possibility that the race could be shaken up by enough to put additional states into play.
Why is New Hampshire the only real opportunity?
It’s the only state where the polls are even close. On average, Ms. Haley trails Mr. Trump by about 15 points in New Hampshire polls, 49 percent to 34 percent. That’s a comfortable lead for Mr. Trump, but there have occasionally been polls showing a single-digit race. It’s close enough to contemplate a Trump loss.

R6Y7P2PLUN_QC95OTNVLMU0995,Trump Joins Motion to Disqualify Prosecutor in Georgia Election Case,By Richard Fausset and Danny HakimRichard Fausset reported from Atlanta and Danny Hakim from New Jersey.,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/trump-fani-willis-georgia-disqualify.html,"Lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump on Thursday joined an effort to disqualify Fani T. Willis from leading the election interference case against Mr. Trump in Georgia, on the grounds that she created a conflict of interest by hiring her romantic partner to help prosecute the case.
Mr. Trump’s lawyers also raised a new argument for ousting Ms. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney: that she violated state bar rules when she claimed in a recent speech that racism was behind the effort to remove her.
The relationship claim surfaced on Jan. 8 in a filing from Michael Roman, one of Mr. Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia case. Six days later, Ms. Willis, who is Black, gave a speech at a church in Atlanta in which she suggested that her critics were “playing the race card” by criticizing her hiring of the special prosecutor, Nathan J. Wade, who is also Black.
Ms. Willis has neither confirmed nor denied a relationship with Mr. Wade, though she has been ordered to provide a written response to Mr. Roman’s motion by next week.
The filing on Thursday from Mr. Trump’s lawyers called Ms. Willis’s comments “a glaring, flagrant and calculated effort to foment racial bias into this case by publicly denouncing the defendants for somehow daring to question her decision to hire a Black man.”
Ms. Willis’s statement, the lawyers wrote, violated a section of the state bar’s rules of conduct for Georgia prosecutors that instructs them to “refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.”

RL6043OFBE_TH7BSHQ8PXU72F2,"For People Fleeing War, U.S. Immigration Fight Has Real-Life Consequences",By Zolan Kanno-YoungsZolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Baltimore and has covered refugee and border policy since the Trump administration.,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 26, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/parole-immigration-biden-congress.html,"Artem Marchuk needed to escape Ukraine or die. He didn’t see any other options.
He and his wife and children had been living in Bakhmut, the site of the war’s deadliest battle. Even when they made it out of the city, nothing in Ukraine felt safe.
“My kids were very hungry,” Artem’s wife, Yana, said in an interview from the family’s home in Baltimore, where the U.S. government resettled them in 2022. “There was darkness everywhere.”
Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.
The Marchuks are among more than a million people whom the Biden administration has allowed into the United States over the past three years under an authority called humanitarian parole, which allows people without visas to live and work in the United States temporarily. Parole has been extended to Ukrainians, Afghans and thousands of people south of the U.S.-Mexico border fleeing poverty and war.
Now the program is at the heart of a battle in Congress over legislation that would unlock billions of dollars in military aid for some of President Biden’s top foreign policy priorities, such as Ukraine and Israel.
Republicans want to see a severe crackdown on immigration in exchange for their votes to approve the military aid — and restricting the number of people granted parole is one of their demands.

RXTGKRO9NP_J5UNPQIP0C5ZEV4,Here Is One Way to Steal the Presidential Election,_,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/opinion/election-president-steal-democracy.html,"What happens when you stress-test America’s system for electing a president? How well does it hold up?
After the assault on the nation’s Capitol three years ago, we worked through every strategy we could imagine for subverting the popular will by manipulating the law. What we found surprised us. We determined that the most commonly discussed strategies — such as a state legislature picking a new slate of electors to the Electoral College — wouldn’t work because of impediments built into the Constitution. We also concluded that the most blatantly extreme strategies, such as a state canceling its election and selecting its electors directly, are politically unlikely.
The scenario we see as the most alarming was made possible by the Supreme Court itself. In a 2020 decision, the court held, in our reading, that state legislatures have the power to direct electors on how to cast their electoral votes. And this opens the door to what we think is the most dangerous strategy: that a legislature would pass a law that directs electors to vote for the candidate the legislature picks.
The question now is whether there is any way to close that loophole before a stolen election slides through.
The cases that led to the decision involved electors in 2016 who had voted contrary to their pledge. Recognizing that Hillary Clinton, the winner of the popular vote, would not be elected president, these electors worked to rally enough Republican and Democratic electors to vote for a Republican candidate other than Donald Trump, thus throwing the election into the House of Representatives.
Three electors from the state of Washington cast their votes for Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, rather than for Mrs. Clinton, who won the popular vote there. Mrs. Clinton also won the popular vote in Colorado, where one elector attempted to vote for John Kasich, the former Ohio governor who had run for the Republican presidential nomination that year. Those electors were punished by their states with fines and removal as electors. They challenged that punishment in the Supreme Court. (One of us, Mr. Lessig, represented the Washington and Colorado electors.)

S0DUQ2JAFL_9XKULC82Q2OOO8Y,"He’s Not on the N.H. Ballot, but Biden’s Allies Hope He’ll Still Win","By Reid J. EpsteinReporting from Manchester and Nashua, N.H.","Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/biden-write-in-new-hampshire-democrats.html,"If President Biden’s re-election campaign can feel like a slog elsewhere, the write-in effort for him in New Hampshire’s primary election is infused with the sort of joy found in spirited underdogs.
Veteran Democrats in the state have been pushing the party’s voters and independents to write in the name of Mr. Biden on Tuesday, a move necessitated by his absence from the ballot after New Hampshire fought his decision to push the state back on the nominating calendar.
The effort has energized New Hampshire Democrats, who have long chafed under the micromanagement of national party leaders. The write-in effort has freed them from outside interference and allowed them to run a campaign as they like.
And they are growing optimistic.
With no backing or communication from the Democratic National Committee or Mr. Biden’s campaign headquarters in Delaware, these New Hampshire Democrats, who began the Write-In Biden campaign late last year, now expect to help deliver the president an overwhelming victory.
“There’s a lot going on here to support Joe Biden,” said Kathleen Sullivan, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party who is leading a write-in Biden super PAC. “We’ve been able to build some energy and excitement and support for him that we’re not seeing anywhere else in the country.”
Mr. Biden did not submit his name for the primary ballot after New Hampshire refused to comply with the Democratic National Committee’s new calendar, which made South Carolina the first presidential nominating state.

S3GTY8CIHV_2DWRHSTEIH0IYWT,The Great Freight-Train Heists of the 21st Century,By Malia Wollan,"Published Jan. 23, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/magazine/train-robbery-amazon-packages.html,"Of all the dozens of suspected thieves questioned by the detectives of the Train Burglary Task Force at the Los Angeles Police Department during the months they spent investigating the rise in theft from the city’s freight trains, one man stood out. What made Victor Llamas memorable wasn’t his criminality so much as his giddy enthusiasm for trespassing. He was a self-taught expert of the supply chain, a connoisseur of shipping containers. Even in custody, as the detectives interrogated him numerous times, after multiple arrests, in a windowless police-station room in the spring of 2022, a kind of nostalgia would sweep over the man. “He said that was the best feeling he’d ever had, jumping on the train while it was moving,” Joe Chavez, who supervised the task force’s detectives, told me. “It was euphoric for him.”
Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.
According to detectives, Llamas divulged how he learned to decode the containers stacked on freight trains through his repeated break-ins and by Googling the placards, locking devices, logos and numbers on the containers, which often provided clues to the loot he might find inside. An upgraded lock was a sure sign of more valuable contents. Inside the containers — most of them were secured with metal locks about the size and shape of a corkscrew that easily succumbed to his bolt cutters or mechanized handsaw — the items were varied and plentiful: TVs, beer, clothing, makeup, shoes, electric bicycles, hard drives, tablets.
Llamas worked with Connie Arizmendi, his girlfriend at the time. After becoming aware of them, the detectives put a tracking device on the couple’s S.U.V. and followed them around Southern California. The couple would set up in a motel near the tracks somewhere out in the Inland Empire or farther south; they ranged as far as Barstow, more than 100 miles to the east. After nightfall, they would hit the trains and then often shuttle cargo back to their motel rooms for storage. By that point, Chavez, who is 58, had been at the L.A.P.D. for nearly 35 years, working homicides, drugs, gangs, auto thefts and robberies, and he had never heard anyone talk about his crimes as rapturously as Llamas. “He straight out told me, he goes, ‘Detective Chavez, I’m never going to stop doing it,’” Chavez says.
Some 20 million containers move through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach every year, including about 35 percent of all the imports into the United States from Asia. Once these steel boxes leave the relative security of a ship at port, they are loaded onto trains and trucks — and then things start disappearing. The Los Angeles basin is the country’s undisputed capital of cargo theft, the region with the most reported incidents of stuff stolen from trains and trucks and those interstitial spaces in the supply chain, like rail yards, warehouses, truck stops and parking lots. Cases of reported cargo theft in the United States have nearly doubled since 2019, according to CargoNet, a theft-focused subsidiary of Verisk, a multinational company that analyzes business risks, primarily for the insurance sector. On CargoNet’s map of cargo-theft hot spots, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and Memphis show up as distinct, high-incident red blobs. But the biggest blob, a red oblong smear, stretches out over the Los Angeles valley like molten lava.
Freight trains are massive mechanical constructions, but because they’ve been on the landscape for so long, they tend to be part of the background, like hills. In Los Angeles, however, trains roared back into the public imagination in late November 2021, when a local NBC affiliate ran footage from a section of Union Pacific tracks strewed with thousands of ransacked boxes. The video included a man with bolt cutters climbing up onto moving cars and a reporter’s calls to the packages’ intended recipients, as well as their reactions to seeing their emptied-out boxes. “I’m honestly just disgusted in human behavior,” said a woman in Seattle who was waiting for a car seat for her unborn baby. It was like an IMAX-scale version of those now-ubiquitous security camera videos of porch pirates sneaking off with deliveries.

S7LT21LZ2E_O8892JUX4NTIAP8,Remnants of Sprawling Ancient Cities Are Found in the Amazon,By Alan Yuhas and Jesus Jiménez,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/ecuador-amazon-cities-discovery.html,"The Amazon valley looked like so many others, with a muddy river snaking through dense forest, except that this one had earthen mounds rising at clear right angles and ditches carving long straight lines through the soil.
In this rainforest, archaeologists say, lay the bones of sprawling ancient cities: earthworks that were once roads, canals, plazas and platforms for homes where thousands of people had lived for centuries, long before Europeans ever tried to chart South America.
The cluster of interconnected cities was only recently mapped in the Upano Valley of eastern Ecuador, a research team reported this month in the journal Science, working off decades of research and laser-mapping technology that has helped to revolutionize archaeology.
With the technology, called lidar, researchers were able to pierce the forest cover and map the ground below it, documenting five major settlements and 10 secondary sites across more than 115 square miles.
Radiocarbon dating found that people lived there from around 500 B.C. to between A.D. 300 and A.D. 600, which would make the settlements some of the oldest found so far in the diverse landscapes of the Amazon.
“It’s a huge contribution to Amazonian archaeology,” said José Iriarte, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the research.

SC51BX2CY1_2IUHXCCF2Q3DDHU,We Are Normalizing Trump. Again.,_,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/opinion/trump-republican-nomination-coalition.html,"Over the past nine years, Donald Trump has been variously described as narcissistic, mendacious, authoritarian, unbalanced, ignorant, incompetent, egotistic and racist — as someone who demonizes minorities and fans ethnic hostility. These assessments are a major reason roughly half of American voters, according to polls, say they will not vote for him.
But even as Trump has steadily escalated his defiance of behavioral norms, a substantial share of the American electorate remains willing to cast a ballot for him. Approximately half of the electorate views Trump as a legitimate 2024 presidential contender, repeatedly demonstrating in surveys that they plan to vote for him in a matchup with President Biden.
In other words, these voters have normalized perhaps the least normal president in American history.
Followers granting political legitimacy to Trump go well beyond his hard-core MAGA supporters. His adherents at present include half of all whites, 18 percent of Black voters, 31 percent of Hispanics and pluralities of independent (40 percent) and suburban (44 percent) voters, according to an Economist/YouGov survey of 1,660 U.S. adults conducted Jan. 14-16.
Results from the Iowa caucuses last week and Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary reaffirm Trump’s strong backing among Republican voters. It’s the first time in 40 years that the same Republican candidate won both states, when Ronald Reagan ran virtually unopposed. Polling on a Trump vs. Biden rematch in the fall demonstrates that — at least so far — Trump’s extremist behavior has failed to destroy his chances in November.
Racial issues and those involving immigration are crucial to Trump’s continued level of support. “While many of the positions that Trump is taking (and the rhetoric that he is using) on these issues may appear extreme to objective observers,” Zoltan Hajnal, a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego, wrote by email, “public opinion data suggest that much of America believes in much of what Trump is selling on race and immigration.”

SCQRMWKW8O_5U8IR8GGDYAZ7RJ,"Did No One Tell Ron DeSantis That Trump Was Running, Too?",_,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/opinion/desantis-trump-republicans-primaries.html,"Despite the early enthusiasm for his policies and political persona in various corners of the conservative media, it was easy to see from the start that Ron DeSantis would not — and clearly does not — have the juice to defeat or supplant Donald Trump in a Republican presidential primary.
Part of this was the Florida governor’s soft skills or rather lack thereof. He is not a people person. He does not excel at the task of retail politics. He is not, to put it gently, strong on the stump, and he has a bad habit of speaking in the esoteric and jargon-filled language of online conservatives.
Consider his first major performance in Iowa last year, in front of an audience of likely Republican caucusgoers. “We say very clearly in the state of Florida that we will fight the woke in the Legislature,” DeSantis said, as he tried to rouse the crowd to applause. “We will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in the businesses, we will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Our state is where woke goes to die.”
There is a relatively small group of people for whom this is a resonant message. For everyone else, it is basically static. It doesn’t speak to the animating concerns of the blue-collar voters who will make or break a campaign in the Republican primary. DeSantis’s inability to create a compelling message, however, might not have been fatal to his campaign if he had been able to distance or distinguish himself from Trump in any meaningful way. The opportunities were there. DeSantis could have used the criminal indictments against the former president to make the practical case that Trump would not win if he was in jail.
But DeSantis chose to run as Trump’s heir apparent and treated him as though he wasn’t actually in the race. He could not turn on the former president without undermining the premise of his own campaign. And so DeSantis sat silent or even defended Trump against legal accountability for his actions in office. “Washington, D.C. is a ‘swamp’ and it is unfair to have to stand trial before a jury that is reflective of the swamp mentality,” DeSantis wrote on X after Trump was charged with four felony counts by a federal grand jury in connection with his effort to overturn the 2020 election. “One of the reasons our country is in decline is the politicization of the rule of law. No more excuses — I will end the weaponization of the federal government.”
To the extent that DeSantis tried to differentiate himself from the former president, it was by running to Trump’s political right. The Florida governor in this view would be a more competent Trump — the Trump who gets things done. It was a good pitch for the conservative intellectuals who wanted to support a Trump-like figure without embracing Trump himself. But it was a terrible pitch to the Republican electorate, which did not nominate Trump in 2016 — or turn out in 2020 — because of Trump’s ability to clear a checklist of agenda items.

SHGYIBWX4I_CEO4BWVH9D4SVDJ,Critics Protest Harvard’s Choice to Lead Antisemitism Task Force,By Anemona Hartocollis,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/harvard-antisemitism-larry-summers.html,"A Harvard task force on antisemitism has gotten off to a rocky start, with complaints that the professor chosen to help lead the panel had signed a letter that was critical of Israel, describing it as “a regime of apartheid” for its treatment of Palestinians.
Harvard’s new interim president, Alan Garber, announced the formation of two “presidential task forces” on Friday, one to combat antisemitism and the other to combat Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias. The move came less than a month after his predecessor, Claudine Gay, was forced to step down over plagiarism accusations and criticism that she had been weak on reining in antisemitism.
But the choice for co-chair of the task force, Derek J. Penslar, a professor of Jewish history at Harvard, was met with opposition from Lawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, and Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager whose relentless criticism of Dr. Gay helped bring about her downfall.
Dr. Penslar was among nearly 2,900 academics, clergy members and other public figures who signed an open letter in August, before the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, condemning the Israeli government and saying that it was determined to “ethnically cleanse all territories under Israeli rule of their Palestinian population.”
“Meanwhile,” the letter, written by a group called Academics4Peace, said, “American Jewish billionaire funders help support the Israeli far right.”
The same group circulated another letter in December with a call for a cease-fire and an exchange of hostages and prisoners in the Israel-Hamas war. Dr. Penslar did not sign that version.

SHW8SZ04A8_N7HBLXAKQPC5GG1,How a Diversity Initiative Changed Course With the Times,By Steve LohrSteve Lohr has written about efforts to increase economic opportunity in the workplace since 2017.,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/business/diversity-oneten-black-employment.html,"Three years ago, dozens of big companies formed a coalition and declared an ambitious goal: to lift one million Black workers into good-paying jobs over the next 10 years, by hiring or promoting them.
The resulting nonprofit, OneTen, was created amid a crescendo of calls to address racial injustice after George Floyd’s murder in 2020. It asked its members — including AT&T, Bank of America, Cisco, Delta Air Lines, Dow, General Motors, Nike and Walmart — to pledge to hire and promote Black workers based on skills instead of college degrees.
Fast-forward, and the social climate has since changed drastically. Pushing Black-only hiring programs has grown increasingly controversial, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling last year against race-based affirmative action policies at universities.
OneTen, which has fallen far behind the pace needed to reach its initial goal, is at the forefront of a movement to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion methods in business. And it has been forced to change with the times.
The organization has modified its messaging in the past year, especially since the Supreme Court decision, to emphasize that the policies it advocates will help “Black talent and others.”
More concretely, the organization’s leaders realized that asking companies to vow to make changes was not enough. OneTen has helped its members rewrite job descriptions for hundreds of roles to remove unnecessary degree requirements and clearly state the skills sought and needed. The organization has helped to design apprenticeship programs for enterprises like Delta and the Cleveland Clinic, tailored for different fields. And it has set up a network for human resources and hiring managers to share their challenges and suggest solutions, in virtual and in-person sessions.

SJXI7W86F4_UTPC8WEHG5ZL7ND,Are His Parents Responsible? A Mass Shooter’s Mother Goes on Trial.,By Campbell Robertson,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/jennifer-crumbley-trial-michigan-school-shooting.html,"The trial of Jennifer Crumbley, whose son carried out the worst school shooting in Michigan history, began on Thursday with dueling portraits: one of a mother whose negligence was so extreme that it caused a tragedy, and another of a good, even “hypervigilant” mother who was in the dark about her son’s troubles until that tragedy unfolded.
These starkly different images were presented to jurors in a courtroom in Pontiac, Mich., about 20 miles south of Oxford High School, where the mass shooting took place on Nov. 30, 2021.
While the case centered on a momentous legal question — whether parents should be held criminally liable for violent crimes committed by their children — the horror of that day in Oxford hung over the first day of testimony in the trial. School employees, including one who was shot in the arm, testified of the terror they experienced, and surveillance videos of the shooting were played, showing some of the victims.
The shooter, Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 at the time, killed four students and injured seven others. He pleaded guilty to 24 charges, including first-degree murder, and was sentenced last month to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
The cases against Ms. Crumbley and her husband, James Crumbley, are at the leading edge of a push by some prosecutors to hold parents accountable when they are suspected of enabling deadly violence by their children. Just in the last few months, parents whose children carried out gun violence in other states have pleaded guilty to charges of reckless conduct or neglect.
In the Michigan trial, Ms. Crumbley, 45, faces more serious charges: four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors say that despite glaring signals of Ethan’s violent intentions, his mother’s failures to take “just ordinary care” to act on what she knew made her criminally liable for the carnage at Oxford High School. In charging her with manslaughter, they are arguing that her behavior was “a cause” of the killings.

SQXV2JZX8J_EGA0DWX7H9EBYK0,"Dexter Scott King, Younger Son of Martin Luther King Jr., Dies at 62",By Clay Risen,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/dexter-scott-king-dead.html,"Dexter Scott King, who as one of four children of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked closely with — but also frequently fought against — his siblings and the civil rights community over his father’s legacy, died on Monday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 62.
The King Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta said the cause was prostate cancer.
Mr. King was the longtime chairman of the King Center, an institution established by his mother, Coretta Scott King, in 1968 to advance the vision of her husband. He was also the president of the King Estate, which managed licensing of his father’s image and likeness.
Both positions put him at the center of a shifting, byzantine web of alliances and conflicts with his siblings — in particular his brother, Martin Luther King III, and his younger sister, Bernice King — and with his father’s former allies. Lawsuits and public clashes were common as they jostled to shape and control the King legacy.
Mr. King was 7 years old when his father was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968. He and his brother, who was 10, were sitting on the floor at home in Atlanta watching TV when a news bulletin reporting the shooting interrupted their show.
They raced to their parents’ bedroom, where their mother was on the phone getting the same news from one of Dr. King’s associates.

SR473OC3M7_VNJX2B7DT7172YV,21 Savage Returns to No. 1 With Solo Album ‘American Dream’,By Ben Sisario,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/arts/music/21-savage-american-dream-billboard-chart.html,"21 Savage, the London-born mainstay of Atlanta rap, has the first new No. 1 album of 2024 with “American Dream,” following holdovers by Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen.
“American Dream” is 21 Savage’s fourth chart-topper overall, and the first time he has led the Billboard 200 as a solo artist since “I Am > I Was” five years ago; since then, he has gone to No. 1 twice via collaborative projects with Drake (“Her Loss,” 2022) and the producer Metro Boomin (“Savage Mode II,” 2020).
The album is 21 Savage’s latest since the apparent resolution of his long-running problems with his immigration status. The week before the Grammy Awards in 2019, where he had been set to perform, the 31-year-old rapper, whose real name is Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for being in the United States illegally. After delays in his case, 21 Savage said in October that he had become a permanent U.S. resident.
In its debut week, “American Dream,” which was announced just a few days before its release on Jan. 12 — and features guest appearances by Doja Cat, Travis Scott, Lil Durk, Young Thug and others, as well as spoken segments by the rapper’s mother, Heather Carmillia Joseph — had the equivalent of 133,000 sales in the United States. Most of that was from streaming, with nearly 170 million clicks, according to the tracking service Luminate. The 15-track LP had 4,000 sales as a complete package.
Ariana Grande’s first solo song in more than three years, “Yes, And?,” opens at No. 1 on the Hot 100, her eighth track to top Billboard’s flagship pop singles chart. “Eternal Sunshine,” her next studio album, is due March 8.
Also this week, “Orquídeas,” the fourth studio album by the singer Kali Uchis, which is performed primarily in Spanish, opens in second place, Uchis’s highest chart position ever. The album, whose title translates as “Orchids,” and features guest spots by Latin stars like Peso Pluma, Karol G and Rauw Alejandro, had the equivalent of 69,000 sales, including 51 million streams and 31,000 copies sold as a complete package.
Wallen’s nearly year-old “One Thing at a Time,” which logged a 17th time at No. 1 last week, falls to third place this week, while Drake’s “For All the Dogs” is No. 4 and Swift’s “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” is No. 5."
SUSYWRUE20_3M2E33ZNSR3W14X,"‘Mutt,’ ‘Unpregnant’ and More Streaming Gems",By Jason Bailey,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/movies/mutt-unpregnant-streaming-movies.html,"Stream it on Netflix.
Vuk Lungulov-Klotz’s micro-budget New York drama is everything indie movies are supposed to be: keenly observed and modestly executed, telling us a story and showing us a world we don’t usually see in mainstream cinema. In this case, it’s the world of Feña (Lío Mehiel), a transgender man and a semi-desperate pseudo-hustler whose life goes momentarily topsy-turvy when he accidentally reconnects with a former boyfriend from before his transition. Every performer is on point, natural and credible, and the screenplay is lived-in and mostly devoid of histrionics (Feña gives a big speech to his dad about how difficult it all is, and it’s the single false note, the only scene that feels like a scene from a movie instead of a scene from real life). This is a small film, but a mighty one.
Stream it on Max.
When this Max original debuted in 2020, its story — of a young woman (Haley Lu Richardson, “The White Lotus”) inviting her former BFF (Barbie Ferreira, “Euphoria”) on an impromptu road trip to a state that doesn’t require parental consent for an abortion — felt a bit less urgent. In this post-Dobbs world, in which such journeys have become necessary even for some adults, the picture’s light tone and comic beats could seem to make light of a serious situation. But the co-writer and director Rachel Lee Goldenberg balances these trick tones with aplomb, primarily focusing on the splintered (but repairable) friendship between these disparate women, without trivializing the motivation for their reunion. The result is a sharp but likable road movie, and a fine showcase for two charismatic performers.
Stream it on Hulu.
The filmmaker Sammi Cohen, who had a popular hit on Netflix with last year’s Adam Sandler (and family) vehicle “You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,” directs this delightfully frisky queer teen sex comedy. Rowan Blanchard is Paige, split between two potential romantic interests: the popular Gabriela (Isabella Ferreira) and the introverted AJ (Auli‘i Cravalho), who also, inconveniently enough, happen to be sisters. Though contemporary in its setting and sexual politics, “Crush” betrays Cohen’s love for ’90s teen comedies of the “Clueless” ilk, borrowing their candy-colored aesthetics as well as their knowing and occasionally adult-oriented sense of humor. Blanchard is a charming anchor, Ferreira a memorable counterpoint and Cravalho, currently brightening up “Mean Girls” and best known to younger viewers for voicing “Moana,” is one of the most exciting young actors on the scene.

SV6S9LXJ4O_KXHLPGEA22E2X8X,Tensions Erupt at Los Angeles Times as Owner Weighs Deep Cuts,By Benjamin Mullin and Katie Robertson,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/business/media/los-angeles-times-tensions-cuts.html,"Around twilight on Thursday, Los Angeles Times journalists gathered at Flora, a rooftop bar not far from the paper’s headquarters, to toast their departing editor, Kevin Merida.
As reporters and editors sipped cocktails under a darkening sky, the talk was focused on why Mr. Merida, the paper’s editor for nearly three years, had decided to suddenly leave — and about the prospect of deep layoffs discussed in emergency meetings earlier that day, according to four attendees.
In the days since, internal negotiations between the company and the employee union have included talk of about 100 job cuts, or about 20 percent of the newsroom, according to two of the people, who also have knowledge about the discussions. It has put journalists at The Times at odds with their owner, the biotechnology billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. Those relations reached a nadir on Friday when employees walked off the job, in the newsroom’s first union-organized work stoppage in the 142-year history of the newspaper.
The tensions escalated even further on Monday, after several of the state’s congressional representatives sent Dr. Soon-Shiong a letter raising concerns about the scope of the cuts and employees received a note informing them that two other senior editors had departed.
A spokeswoman for the company, Hillary Manning, had no comment on tensions in the newsroom or the scope of the proposed cuts but said in a statement that the newspaper appreciated “the concerns elected officials have expressed regarding the anticipated layoffs.”
She added that The Los Angeles Times had appealed to lawmakers to pass legislation that could help address financial challenges faced by local news publishers.

SX3R8MAYZV_WYV8UMNR86XTBRC,Police Officer Who Threw Cooler at Fleeing Man Charged With Manslaughter,By Hurubie Meko and Anusha Bayya,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/nypd-cooler-incident-manslaughter.html,"A police sergeant who threw a cooler at a Bronx man in August, knocking him off a motorbike and killing him, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, assault and criminally negligent homicide.
The sergeant, Erik Duran, 36, was suspended without pay days after the episode in which he hit the man, Eric Duprey, 30, who was fleeing narcotics officers attempting to arrest him.
The charges were filed on Tuesday by the office of Attorney General Letitia James of New York, which began investigating the encounter shortly after Mr. Duprey’s death.
The indictment charged Sergeant Duran with second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and first- and second-degree assault. Sergeant Duran was arraigned in Bronx criminal court and pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to court records. Sergeant Duran posted bail, which was set at $150,000.
In court, prosecutors said Sergeant Duran’s actions showed “excessive force while on duty.”
According to police officials at the time, undercover narcotics officers were near 192nd Street and Aqueduct Avenue conducting a “buy-and-bust” — an operation to catch unsuspecting drug dealers. The police said that Mr. Duprey had sold drugs to one officer, which prompted others nearby to move in to arrest him.

T5LB66SNBX_GLGZA3STPRZGL94,Biden Urges Congress to Quickly Approve F-16 Sale to Turkey,By Edward WongReporting from Washington,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/biden-congress-f-16-turkey.html,"President Biden sent a letter to four senior members of Congress on Wednesday urging them to quickly approve a $20 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, following the vote one day earlier by Turkey’s Parliament to allow Sweden to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three U.S. officials.
The White House sent the letter to the top Democratic and Republican lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which have oversight of arms transfers by the State Department to other nations. As of Wednesday night, the four senior lawmakers had not given their approval, and one or more of them might ask the Biden administration to give assurances about Turkey’s actions on some foreign policy issues before agreeing to the transfer, a congressional official said.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a member of NATO, has linked his country’s approval of Sweden’s accession to the security organization to the F-16 sales, which had been pending. Both Sweden and Finland had asked to join NATO after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the vast majority of the alliance’s members soon agreed. Turkey approved Finland’s bid but, along with Hungary, has withheld approval for Sweden.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met with Mr. Erdogan in Istanbul this month and pushed him to have Turkey approve Sweden’s accession. Mr. Blinken tried to assure him that the F-16 sale would happen, U.S. officials said.
The State Department gave the two congressional committees informal notification of the sale more than one year ago, starting the review process by lawmakers. However, congressional officials have gone back to the department repeatedly with questions about how Turkey might use the jets, as well as some of Turkey’s foreign policy moves that seem to run counter to U.S. interests.

T6B1JQ4CHQ_H8CFN5VNTG2ORUA,JetBlue Says It May Back Out of Deal to Acquire Spirit Airlines,By J. Edward Moreno,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/business/jetblue-spirit-airlines-acquisition.html,"JetBlue Airways said on Friday that it might back out of a $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines after a federal judge blocked the deal.
The announcement came just a week after JetBlue and Spirit had said they would appeal the decision, which was made in an antitrust case brought by the Justice Department.
In a regulatory filing on Friday, JetBlue said the deal could be terminated after Sunday if certain conditions weren’t met. Spirit said in its own filing that it disagreed with JetBlue and believed “there is no basis for terminating” the deal.
A federal judge in Boston blocked the proposed merger on Jan. 16, ruling that Spirit plays an important role in keeping airline fares low and that a takeover by JetBlue would hurt travelers. The ruling was a win for the Justice Department, which under President Biden has sought to limit corporate consolidation across the economy.
The agreement has an expiration date of Jan. 28, and if certain conditions are met that date is automatically extended to July 24. JetBlue appears to be arguing that Spirit has not met its end of the bargain, allowing JetBlue to walk away from the deal on or after Sunday.
As part of the merger agreement, JetBlue agreed to pay Spirit and its shareholders a combined $470 million if regulators blocked the deal.

TB7WZTOIV2_BUEVXQTG89K29BX,"Haley Gets a Trump Matchup, but Now Faces the Trump Machine","By Lisa Lerer, Jazmine Ulloa and Michael C. Bender","Published Jan. 22, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-primary.html,"With only about 48 hours left to campaign in the New Hampshire primary, Nikki Haley finally got the two-person race she wanted.
It might not live up to her expectations.
For months, it has been an article of faith among Ms. Haley’s supporters and a coalition of anti-Trump Republicans that the only way to defeat Donald J. Trump was to winnow the field to a one-on-one contest and consolidate support among his opponents.
That wishcasting became reality on Sunday afternoon, when Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida ended his White House bid.
And yet, as the race reached the final day, there was little sign that Mr. DeSantis’s departure would transform Ms. Haley’s chances of winning.
Ms. Haley quickly learned that the role of last woman standing against Mr. Trump meant serving as the last target for a party racing to line up behind the former president.
Two former rivals in the race — Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Mr. DeSantis — both endorsed the former president. The head of the party’s Senate campaign arm proclaimed Mr. Trump to be the “presumptive nominee.” And Mr. Trump’s campaign strategists vowed that she would be “absolutely embarrassed and demolished” in her home state of South Carolina, the next big prize on the calendar.

TISO2DFBDE_KEABB1EDNO2TOA2,Swatting and the Dangerous Rise of Political Violence,_,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/opinion/swatting-political-violence.html,"In a year with so much political and legal tension, law enforcement is seeing a disturbing trend: targeting public officials with swatting, or false emergency calls intended to draw a heavily armed police response. This conduct isn’t a harmless prank; it’s a symptom of a deeper disorder in American politics. Recent incidents involving officials who have taken stands seen as hostile to Donald Trump and bomb threats in multiple state capitols are signs of a troubling escalation in political violence.
These hoaxes pose real dangers. Sending armed police officers to someone’s home on the ruse that violence is occurring there risks tragic outcomes, including fatalities, as we saw in Kansas in 2017, when swatting led to a police officer shooting an unarmed man. In addition, swatting diverts law enforcement resources from real emergencies. But more insidiously, these tactics are tools of intimidation, designed to silence voices in the political process.
The frequency and visibility of these incidents suggest that swatting and political violence require prosecutors to prioritize their efforts to stop it. Recent targets of swatting include Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, who is presiding over the federal election interference case and whom Mr. Trump has accused of election interference; the special counsel Jack Smith, whom Mr. Trump has called “deranged” and a “thug”; and Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official in Georgia who rejected Mr. Trump’s claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Justice Arthur Engoron, who is presiding over Mr. Trump’s New York civil fraud trial, received a bomb threat at his home on the day of closing arguments. Maine’s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, became a victim of swatting shortly after she removed Mr. Trump from the presidential ballot in her state under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment. She rightly sees these acts as attempts to chill efforts to enforce the law, calling the incident at her home “designed to scare not only me but also others into silence, to send a message.”
Public officials are human. Threats and the specter of violence can get into their heads. The possibility that a loved one might be unnerved, injured or worse as a result of one’s official duties isn’t easily shrugged off for most of us. The husband of Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, retired from his dental practice about eight years earlier than planned because of threats he received at his office. The risks can go beyond words. A federal judge in New Jersey suffered the loss of her 20-year-old son in 2020 when a gunman, apparently dressed as a delivery driver, came to her home looking for her and killed her son instead. We cannot forget that threats can escalate into violence. Fear of placing family members in harm’s way can make public officials shrink from making unpopular decisions and can even cause some good people to avoid serving altogether.
Of course, this phenomenon isn’t entirely new. At the dawn of the American Revolution, some colonists harassed tax collectors and published the names of those who refused to boycott British goods. And we have experienced bomb threats for decades, learning to live with the disruptions caused by evacuations that result when a threat is phoned in or posted online.
But the recent uptick in swatting can be attributed, at least in part, to the dangerous drumbeat of disinformation and dehumanization, a tactic long employed by authoritarians. Political extremists engage in what is known as the either-or fallacy. By framing issues as binary conflicts and demonizing opponents, they create a climate in which violence becomes normalized. Recent statements by Mr. Trump exemplify this strategy. He uses Truth Social posts to make unfounded accusations and express disdain for rivals. These posts do more than spread disinformation. They foster an environment in which violence against perceived enemies becomes not just conceivable but justified.

TQISO3AUMK_35L0SXDHS9R8HYW,Israeli Soldiers Clearing Buffer Zone in Gaza Die in Blast,"By Patrick Kingsley, Ronen Bergman and Ameera HaroudaReporting from Jerusalem and Doha, Qatar","Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-buffer-zone.html,"The Israeli military suffered the deadliest day of its ground invasion of the Gaza Strip on Monday when 24 soldiers were killed, about 20 of them in an explosion as they were preparing to level buildings to help create a buffer zone with the Palestinian enclave, Israeli officials said.
The deaths plunged Israel into a state of mourning as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces intensifying domestic divisions over how to proceed in the war as well as growing international condemnation of the civilian death toll in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian conditions there.
Israeli leaders expressed heartbreak over the deaths, but declared that the fighting would continue until Hamas was defeated. Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel had “experienced one of the most difficult days since the start of the war,” but that “we will not stop fighting until complete victory.”
The prime minister also said the military was investigating the events leading up to the blast that killed the soldiers, all of them reservists, near Gaza’s border with Israel. “We need to learn the necessary lessons and do everything to preserve our soldiers’ lives,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday.
With no end of the war in sight, and the United Nations reporting that more than half a million people in Gaza were facing “catastrophic hunger,” the Israeli military pressed ahead with its offensive. On Tuesday, it said it had encircled the largest city in southern Gaza, Khan Younis, in a major campaign marked by intense gun battles and bombardments in an area packed with civilians.
Many Gazans, seeking safety in Khan Younis, had fled their homes in other parts of the territory.

TVOSNFF36A_AQGLXCXSJCJZ1UX,What’s Next for Nikki Haley?,By Adam Nagourney,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/nikki-haley-trump-south-carolina-republican-primary.html,"Losing is never easy.
That can be forgotten in the rush of a presidential campaign — the speeches, attacks, television advertisements, endorsements and the ups-and-downs of polls. But the candidates are, in the end, ambitious men and women who have invested their egos and reputations in an enterprise that can define their political lives.
Having to quit can be painful, an act of minor humiliation carried out on a public stage. Conversations about what comes next — whether to slog it out in a race or think about next adventures — are difficult. So it is that candidates who have spent months running for president often need a few days to realize their campaigns are over.
Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina governor, is facing her own decision this morning after losing to former President Donald J. Trump in the New Hampshire primary. This was the race that she wanted — a two-person face-off in a state where independents are a key bloc and Republicans are more moderate than in Iowa. It is hard to put a good spin on it.
But Ms. Haley is only 52 years old and there are still five months until Republicans gather in Milwaukee to nominate a presidential candidate. Here are a few things she might decide to do in the days ahead:
The next contested state on the Republican primary calendar is Ms. Haley’s back yard — “my sweet home state,” she said in Concord on Tuesday night, after New Hampshire was called for Mr. Trump.
Ms. Haley said the race was “far from over” as she pledged to stay in it on Tuesday. She has invested considerable time and advertising money in the state where she was born and won two terms as governor. But South Carolina has become Trump territory since she stepped down from that job to join his administration, and most polls show her heading for what would be a third decisive loss. (While she campaigns in South Carolina, Mr. Trump is likely to continue consolidating his party’s support. In early February, he’s expected to win the Nevada caucuses, a contest Ms. Haley is skipping.)

TVVH2NMX8O_VDB2EVMYZVXQXXO,Trump’s Defamation Trial Delayed Until Thursday,By Benjamin Weiser,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/nyregion/trump-defamation-trial-e-jean-carroll.html,"The trial of E. Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit against Donald J. Trump has been postponed for another day and will resume Thursday, a federal court announced on Tuesday.
The court did not offer a reason for the additional delay, but the trial was originally postponed for a day after Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said in court Monday that a juror had reported flulike symptoms and would be getting a Covid test.
Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, who said on Monday that her client wanted to testify but needed to be in New Hampshire for that state’s primary the next day, had asked that Mr. Trump be allowed to testify on Wednesday.
The former president, who is running for a return to the White House, has been alternating campaign stops with court appearances, using his time in the courtroom as an opportunity to reach voters and complain that he is being mistreated.
If Mr. Trump testifies, that would be likely to occur on Thursday or perhaps Friday if the court holds trial that day.
The condition of the juror who said he was ill is unknown. He had reported feeling hot and nauseated, the judge said in court on Monday.
Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, said in court that she wants the trial to move along as quickly as possible."

The evacuation order posted by the military’s Arabic-language spokesman, Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, designated blocks that include the grounds of the two facilities, Nasser Hospital and Al-Amal Hospital. They are among the last hospitals still providing some medical care to Gazan patients even as many more people seek refuge there from intensifying Israeli air and ground attacks.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society on Wednesday reported “intense shelling” near Al-Amal hospital, which it runs, and said that a strike had killed three people outside its offices in an adjacent building. Israeli forces were “surrounding” its teams and “enforcing restrictions on movement” around its offices and the hospital, the group said.
The Gazan Health Ministry said in a statement that Nasser Hospital effectively had been cut off by “continuous bombing,” preventing injured people from getting there and blocking the transfer of patients to a nearby Jordanian field hospital. The United Nations’ humanitarian affairs office said in its daily update on Tuesday that the Jordanian hospital was also included in the evacuation area.
The three hospitals, with a total of more than 600 beds, account for a fifth of the remaining functional hospital capacity in Gaza, according to the U.N. It said the evacuation area held 88,000 residents and an estimated 425,000 displaced people, packed into about 1.5 square miles.

U2RGM4Q2JY_487QVB1DJMPVHA8,Nikki Haley and the W-Word,_,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/opinion/nikki-haley-trump-women.html,"Back in 2012, long before Nikki Haley hit the presidential campaign trail — and years before Hillary Clinton faced off against Donald Trump — Ms. Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, told this newspaper, “The reason I actually ran for office is because of Hillary Clinton.”
“Everybody was telling me why I shouldn’t run,” she elaborated. “I was too young, I had small children, I should start at the school board level. I went to Birmingham University, and Hillary Clinton was the keynote speaker on a leadership institute, and she said that when it comes to women running for office, there will be everybody that tells you why you shouldn’t, but that’s all the reasons why we need you to do it, and I walked out of there thinking, ‘That’s it. I’m running for office.’”
Ms. Haley hasn’t been keen on sharing her political origin story of late: Just this month she denied ever saying that Mrs. Clinton was an inspiration, as her male primary opponents were trying to weaponize her words against her. But there is a fresh poignancy to her anecdote and her experience these days as her candidacy has struggled to catch fire, especially in light of what I saw and heard at her events in the closing days of the New Hampshire primary this week.
At every stop, Haley supporters expressed their longing for a younger, fresher face in the White House. Several of them specifically noted how great it would be to have the first woman president come from the Republican Party. (These folks really, really hated the idea of Kamala Harris claiming the honor of being the first female president.) At the same time, there was often an equivocal or even embarrassed tinge to any talk of Ms. Haley breaking that glass ceiling — an ambivalence about emphasizing gender that the candidate herself seems to share.
This is why, coming out of New Hampshire, the conversation that stuck in my head was with Lee Dunn, who had come up from the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., to volunteer for Team Haley. Waiting for a rally to begin on the eve of the primary, I asked Ms. Dunn why she had committed to “pick Nikki,” as the campaign swag implores. She didn’t hit the darker notes I had been hearing so often: The panicked, Trump is a disaster. Or the disgusted, I cannot bear a November rematch between two old geezers. Instead, she gushed about how amazing it was to see an impressive, accomplished woman in this position — someone she saw herself in. Sure, Mrs. Clinton had walked this path before, but Ms. Haley is younger, she noted, and more relatable. (And, of course, more conservative.)
“She’s the kind of person you can see driving car pool. She seems like one of your mom friends who, if you were sick, would show up at your house with food,” said Ms. Dunn, a lawyer and mother of three.

U2ZASDM3SY_A3K2DKQMXV9ZQ63,The Ghosts of Black Appalachia Visit Her Kitchen,By Korsha Wilson,"Published Jan. 22, 2024Updated Jan. 25, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/dining/crystal-wilkinson-black-appalachia-cooking.html,"When Crystal Wilkinson wants to summon her kitchen ghosts, she retrieves a fuchsia-hued dress from her closet and hangs it in the doorway. The sturdy, double-hemmed garment invites her grandmother Christine, who sewed it by hand and wore it often before she died in 1994, to join her.
The dress acts as “a literal and metaphorical tethering to her and this matriarchal lineage,” Ms. Wilkinson said in a phone interview from her kitchen.
A poet and professor at the University of Kentucky, Ms. Wilkinson, 62, explores such physical and spiritual ties between the past and present in her new book, “Praisesong for the Kitchen Ghosts.” Combining elements of poetry, prose and fiction, the book tells stories from her upbringing in Indian Creek, Ky., alongside recipes from five generations of her family, from her enslaved ancestors to the present day.
“The kitchen was where the secrets were revealed, plans were made, advice was given, all while preparing mouthwatering meals,” she writes, describing her grandmother’s kitchen.
Raised by her grandparents in rural Appalachia, Ms. Wilkinson remembers in vivid detail the dishes that were commonplace in her childhood: thick and buttery biscuits, sorghum syrup boiled by her grandfather, wild kale and dandelion greens stewed with alliums, and sweet jam cake made with preserved blackberries picked during the previous summer’s harvest.

UDA64IN5A2_TUKO6I1GBC0LA5J,China’s Travel Economy Is Slowly Coming Back. Here’s Where It Stands.,By Tiffany MayReporting from Hong Kong,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/china-business-travel.html,"Since China reopened its borders in 2023 after three years of Covid isolation, domestic travel has thrived and high-speed rail has grown increasingly popular. But international trips in and out of the country are lagging, and flight capacity is still just two-thirds of prepandemic levels.
The economic stakes are high. Before the pandemic, Chinese travelers were the world’s biggest spenders, accounting for 20 percent of global tourism spending, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization.
In the past year, the Chinese authorities have tried to spur more inbound travel. Among the changes: China has waived travel visas or agreed to extend the length of visa-free travel for visitors from eight countries, including Germany and France.
The main factor holding back international travel by Chinese will continue to be China’s economy. Growth has bounced back from the pandemic, but the weight of a severe real estate downturn has dampened consumer spending and confidence inside China. And global geopolitical tensions remain a wild card. China is engaged in trade disputes with the United States and Europe, home to many major multinational companies. As they think twice about their business in China, travel suffers.
Here’s what to know about the state of China’s travel economy.
Throughout the pandemic, China enforced some of the strictest travel rules in the world. Overseas travelers who managed to enter the country sometimes had to quarantine at their own expense for as long as two months.

UF4MRNKFZH_TGPDLVGNNDRCL95,Iran Executes 23-Year-Old Man in Further Crackdown on Protests,By Leily Nikounazar and Emma Bubola,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/middleeast/iran-execution-protests.html,"The Iranian authorities hanged a 23-year-old man early Tuesday, the latest in a string of executions linked to the large-scale protests that shook the country in the fall of 2022.
The man, Mohammad Ghobadlou, who worked in a barbershop, was accused of killing a police officer by running over him with his car. His execution, several months after the last hanging of a protester, illustrated how the government is continuing to crack down on dissent in the wake of that monthslong uprising against the Islamic Republic.
“They are killing us one by one,” the actor Ashkan Khatibi wrote on social media in a post that included a picture of Mr. Ghobadlou’s father, a disabled veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, wrapped in a blanket in front of the prison, north of Tehran, where his son was held.
The protests were set off by the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in September 2022 while she was in the custody of the morality police, accused of violating Iran’s hijab law. The months of demonstrations that followed in cities across the country broadened to include demands for social freedom and political change.
The security forces killed hundreds of protesters and arrested thousands. Many of the detained were accused of “moharebeh,” a broad term that means waging a war on God and is typically punishable with death. Iran has executed least eight people over the protests.
After Mr. Ghobadlou’s arrest in Tehran in September 2022, his mother, Masomeh Ahmadi, said that her son’s actions had been affected by “bipolar disorder and not taking his medication” and by the overall situation in Iran.

UJDDLYECXT_BQSDOCDJ6U0ZD1S,Kenyan Court Blocks Deployment of Police Force to Haiti,"By Declan Walsh and Frances RoblesDeclan Walsh reported from Nairobi, Kenya, and Frances Robles from Florida.","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/africa/kenya-haiti-peacekeeping-force.html,"A Kenyan court on Friday prohibited the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti, jeopardizing a multinational security force charged with stabilizing the chaos-hit Caribbean island nation before it even got off the ground.
The force, which is backed by the United Nations and financed by the United States, had been stalled since October, when Kenyan opponents of the mission challenged it in court, calling it unconstitutional. The High Court upheld those arguments on Friday, throwing into doubt the latest international effort to rescue an impoverished country that is spiraling ever deeper into violence and instability.
“An order is hereby issued prohibiting the deployment of police officers to Haiti or any other country,” Justice Chacha Mwita said at the conclusion of a judgment that took over 40 minutes to read.
The international force was meant to help break the grip of the armed gangs that control most of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, and that have turned Haiti into one of the world’s most dangerous nations. Haiti’s government has pleaded for foreign military forces to restore order, but the United States and Canada have been unwilling to commit their own troops.
Kenya agreed last summer to lead the mission, with backing from Washington, which pledged $200 million. The force was intended to eventually increase to 3,000 security officers.
But just a handful of Caribbean nations have stepped forward to contribute police officers, and the court order on Friday raised questions about whether the mission will deploy anytime soon.

UK38288OVG_STENBME0WN5C8VD,"The New Migrant Shelter Hurdle: Waiting for the City to Call No. 14,861",By Andy Newman and Wesley Parnell,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/nyregion/migrants-homeless-shelters-evictions.html,"Moises Chacon is number 14,861. Jon Cordero’s number is in the 15,000s. Oumar Camara’s wristband says he is number 16,700.
The men are all migrants who have come up against New York City’s 30-day limit for single adults on stays at any one homeless shelter. After 30 days, anyone who wants to stay in the shelter system has to reapply. But there are not enough beds these days, so each person has to take a number at a city office in the East Village in Manhattan, and wait.
As of Tuesday, several migrants said, the city had reached people with numbers in the 14,000s. For those with higher numbers, the city offered only a spot on the floor or a chair at one of a handful of waiting centers scattered around the five boroughs.
New York City has a unique “right to shelter” that requires it to provide a bed to every homeless person who asks. In recent weeks, however, for increasing numbers of migrants, the guarantee has become something that exists only on paper.
The Legal Aid Society, which monitors the city’s compliance with the right-to-shelter mandate, said on Monday that it had been told by the city that on any given night, 800 to 1,000 migrants are left on the waiting list, and that the average wait for a bed is more than eight days. City officials declined to confirm or contradict the numbers cited by Legal Aid.

UKUE77T3HT_VXW705H74EIC7WP,The Man Who Could Unseat Netanyahu,_,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/opinion/gantz-netanyahu-israel-election.html,"Just over 100 days ago, Benny Gantz was the leader of a small Israeli opposition party. Now, in a shared office inside a nondescript building within the Defense Ministry compound in Tel Aviv, Mr. Gantz is helping lead Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza as a member of the war cabinet formed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Mr. Gantz spends his days poring over operational plans, not just of the ongoing campaign in Gaza but also of contingencies for a war that may erupt with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite organization, on Israel’s northern border.
But the most complex challenge facing Mr. Gantz sits with him at the war cabinet table: Mr. Netanyahu. He has accused the prime minister numerous times in the past of dividing Israeli society. And since the war began, Mr. Gantz’s opinion of Mr. Netanyahu — and his estimation of the damage he is causing Israel — has sunk even lower, according to Gantz aides and political allies interviewed for this piece. Several security officials and foreign diplomats were also interviewed about Mr. Gantz.
Mr. Gantz, 64, is in a unique and contradictory position. He is now, essentially, the grown-up in the room of the Israeli government. Many, if not most, Israelis, as well as Israel’s allies, look to him to prevent the radical moves being urged by the government’s far-right members. At the same time, according to polls, he is also the man most likely to replace Mr. Netanyahu and his disastrous government. To manage that transition and set the stage for a potential successful premiership will require political deftness, ruthlessness and, above all, an acute sense of timing.
In his political career so far, he has yet to prove he has those qualities to the necessary degree.
Practically from the moment he entered politics in 2018, Mr. Gantz found himself the target of a smear campaign orchestrated by a network of Mr. Netanyahu’s supporters. Despite this, he agreed to join an emergency government with Mr. Netanyahu to help Israel fight the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. That decision split his party (at the time it was called Blue and White) and cost him a large chunk of voters, and the government fell apart within a few months. Three years later, Mr. Gantz is back with Mr. Netanyahu once more. By all appearances, the war left him no alternative. On Oct. 7, as the scale of Hamas’s devastating surprise attack became evident, Mr. Gantz told Mr. Netanyahu he was willing to join an emergency government. If he had any concern, it was apparently about the presence of far-right party leaders in the coalition.
Judging by the polls, it was the right political move for Mr. Gantz. Mr. Netanyahu’s popularity has plummeted. If elections were held now, Mr. Gantz’s National Unity party would receive the most votes by far. He could form a ruling coalition with ease.

ULSCMWQCTO_D89VGCN2MJ941T4,Barnard College’s Restrictions on Political Speech Prompt Outcry,By Sharon Otterman,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/nyregion/barnard-college-free-speech-restrictions-israel-hamas-war.html,"Three weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, the Department of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Barnard College in New York posted a statement on its departmental website in support of the Palestinian people.
Below the statement, the professors posted links to academic work supporting their view that the struggle of Palestinians against “settler colonial war, occupation and apartheid” was also a feminist issue. Two days later, they found that section of the webpage had been removed, without warning, by Barnard administrators.
What happened next has sparked a crisis over academic freedom and free expression at Barnard at a time when the Israel-Hamas conflict has led to tense protests on American college campuses and heated discussions about what constitutes acceptable speech.
Asked to explain why the page was removed, college administrators told the department that the statement and links were “impermissible political speech,” a statement from the department said.
The Barnard administration then, in late October and November, rewrote its policies on political activity, website governance and campus events, giving itself wide latitude to decide what was and was not permissible political speech on campus, as well as final say over everything posted on Barnard’s website.
The moves caught the attention of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which wrote a letter to Barnard’s new president, Laura Rosenbury, in December, warning that the website and political speech policies violated fundamental free speech principles and were “incompatible with a sound understanding of academic freedom.”

UMLJON6WA5_HNCD2X2O1DN3L88,Trump’s ‘Al Capone’ Strategy Carries Risks in November,By Maggie Haberman and Alan Feuer,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/trump-trial-legal-woes-election.html,"Two days after his victory in the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump was back in court today, testifying in the defamation case brought against him in New York by E. Jean Carroll, the writer who has accused him of raping her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.
“I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency,” Trump said in his under four-minute appearance on the stand. He was responding to a question about whether he had intended to harm his accuser with his defamatory statements denying her allegations despite having been found liable in the civil proceeding for sexually abusing her.
And though the judge told the jury to disregard those remarks, Trump got his message across.
It’s a pattern Trump has stuck to for months: Far from playing down his many legal woes, he has put them front and center, often bragging (apparently falsely) that he has been charged more times than Al Capone.
He features his courtroom troubles in his stump speeches, portraying them as an effort by Democrats who fear they cannot beat him at the ballot box to weaponize the justice system against him. Casting himself as the victim of a witch hunt, Trump has highlighted his four criminal indictments in fund-raising emails. He revels in media coverage of his motorcade speeding to various courthouses. And his confrontational performances in front of judges and juries are calculated for maximum attention.
So far, the strategy appears to be working, helping to rally Republican base voters to his side in Iowa and New Hampshire.
But as he tries to shift into general election mode, it is much less clear that making his legal liabilities central to his campaign will be an effective way of building the broader coalition he needs to win in November.

UX5AZGU0ZP_2A13RSOTKDWTV6R,Man Arrested on 77 Counts of Murder in Johannesburg Building Fire,By Lynsey Chutel and John EligonReporting from Johannesburg,"Published Jan. 24, 2024Updated Jan. 25, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/world/africa/johannesburg-building-fire-arrest.html,"The South African police have arrested a man who confessed to having caused a fire that killed 77 people in a derelict building in downtown Johannesburg last year after a drug dispute led him to strangle a man and set the body alight, a police spokeswoman and a victims’ advocate said on Wednesday.
The man, a 29-year-old whose name has not been released, was arrested on Tuesday on 77 counts of murder and 120 counts of attempted murder, said Col. Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi, a spokeswoman for the police in Gauteng Province, which includes Johannesburg. Colonel Nevhuhulwi initially gave the figure as 76 counts, but then clarified that it was 77.
The man made his confession during a hearing of a special commission investigating the fire, which tore through an overcrowded five-story building in the early hours of Aug. 31. The commission was later told that the exact death toll was unclear because of how badly some of the bodies were burned.
“We were shocked when he incriminated himself,” said Andy Chinnah, an advocate for the victims who was briefed on the testimony by lawyers at Norton Rose Fulbright, which is representing the victims.
In preparation for the commission hearing, which started last year, Mr. Chinnah said that he and other activists had interviewed more than 300 survivors. While there were theories that the blaze could have been the result of a drug deal gone bad, a domestic dispute or an attempt to destroy corpses in the building, the suspect’s testimony seemed to come out of nowhere.
“Do I believe him?” Mr. Chinnah said. “Nothing’s impossible. But right now it just doesn’t make sense for one body to be set alight and cause such a big fire.”

V3GLTHHSHC_ZO6TVQPEIBJB2GG,Never-Trumpers Never Had a Chance,_,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/trump-primary-election-2024.html,"The Republican presidential primary is all but over. Even if Nikki Haley stays in the race, it’s hard to see her winning a single primary, including the one in her home state of South Carolina next month. Even though Haley received an impressive 43 percent of the New Hampshire vote, her electoral reality is grim. According to the most recent FiveThirtyEight polling averages, she trails Donald Trump by more than 56 points nationally and by 37 points in South Carolina.
It’s déjà vu all over again. Since the moment Trump took the G.O.P. primary lead in 2015, he’s never relinquished his hold on the party. And since Trump’s hostile takeover and unexpected 2016 victory, the G.O.P. has also experienced consistent losses. Democrats seized the House from Republicans in 2018. They took the presidency and the Senate in 2020. In those two elections, the Democrats accomplished a political feat not seen since the Herbert Hoover era: winning the House, Senate and White House in a single four-year span.
And the Democrats’ success didn’t stop there. In 2022, despite political conditions that should have been overwhelmingly favorable to Republicans, Democrats made a modest gain in the Senate and barely lost the closely divided House. Election-denying MAGA candidates were routed in multiple swing-state elections. Yet none of those setbacks broke Trump’s grip on the G.O.P.
This is in part because while Democrats have been able to mobilize an effective anti-Trump opposition, conservative Never-Trumpers — Republicans and former Republicans like me who have desperately tried to break Trump’s grip on the party — mostly failed. It’s now clear to me that we never had a chance. And the reason is equally clear: We did not truly understand our own party.
To appreciate our confusion (and our mistakes), let’s go back to the Before Times, to the year 2014. Back then, I was a stalwart Republican working for a conservative Christian law firm. If you had asked me to describe the Republican Party, I would have answered something like this: At our best, we are a party that possesses a distinct conservative ideology and a commitment to character.
The ideology revolved around the three legs of the Reagan Republican stool: limited government, social conservatism and a strong national defense. The commitment to character was born out of the political conflicts of the Clinton years, in which conservatives were furious that Democrats were willing to overlook or rationalize disgraceful and unlawful behavior by Bill Clinton. No one would claim that every conservative had character — we’ve seen far too many scandals to believe that — but I refused to believe that the G.O.P. would broadly excuse, rationalize or defend a Bill Clinton in our midst.

VC7VNQP43F_65M1ZAJ9CDLAWTX,New Hampshire’s G.O.P. Primary Sets a State Turnout Record,By Nick Corasaniti,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/new-hampshire-primary-voter-turnout.html,"A record number of voters cast a ballot in New Hampshire’s Republican primary on Tuesday, according to a New York Times analysis of election data, as former President Donald J. Trump cruised to an easy victory over Nikki Haley, his last remaining rival.
The total of more than 300,000 votes as of early Wednesday surpassed the previous high-water mark for a Republican primary, when more than 287,000 voters turned out in 2016. The previous record for either party was the Democrats’ 2020 contest, with more than 296,000 voters, many supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont.
The exceptionally high turnout on Tuesday underscores the electrifying effect Mr. Trump has on the electorate, driving loyal supporters and determined opposition to the polls as his divisive style of politics both inspires and revolts.
The A.P./VoteCast exit poll split the electorate, using Mr. Trump’s Make America Great Again movement as a dividing line. Mr. Trump won nearly 90 percent of the MAGA segment of the Republican Party, evidence of deep enthusiasm, while Ms. Haley carried about two-thirds of the non-MAGA base.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” said Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who specializes in American elections. “It cuts one way that Trump could draw out so many supporters. It cuts the other in that so many opposed him. When Trump is on the ballot he inflames passions.”
All three national elections held after Mr. Trump first took office produced exceptionally high turnout. The 2018 elections had the highest midterm turnout rate — 49 percent of the eligible voting population — since 1914. The 2020 presidential contest had the highest rate in any federal election since 1900.

VCLIU10THC_040L6NEE1YAYSIL,G.O.P. Voters Said No to Tim Scott. His Girlfriend Said Yes.,By Maya King,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/tim-scott-engaged.html,"Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who for years faced speculation about his marital status, on Saturday proposed to Mindy Noce, his girlfriend and an interior designer who lives in Charleston. She said yes.
It’s been a whirlwind few days for Mr. Scott, whose endorsement of former President Donald J. Trump at a New Hampshire rally on Friday renewed talk about his consideration as a running mate, should Mr. Trump win the Republican nomination.
The engagement, which was first reported by The Washington Post, comes after more than a year of dating. Mr. Scott made his relationship with Ms. Noce public when he brought her onstage after a Republican presidential primary debate — the last he would participate in before suspending his campaign in November. The two met at church.
A spokesman for Mr. Scott, Nathan Brand, confirmed the engagement, which took place on Kiawah Island, S.C., near Charleston. Mr. Scott and Ms. Noce had a celebratory dinner afterward and Ms. Noce attended church the following morning, wearing her engagement ring.
Mr. Scott shared his news with a national audience on “Sunday Night in America,” the Fox News program hosted by Trey Gowdy, his friend and a former South Carolina congressman.
Mr. Scott, a longtime bachelor, attempted to keep his relationship status quiet. Even so, his bachelorhood had been the subject of much scrutiny during his presidential run and in his Senate career. Asked multiple times on the campaign trail about his marital status, Mr. Scott often demurred, saying he was praying for the right woman before taking that step.
“One of the things I love about the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it points us always in the right direction. Proverbs 18:22 says, ‘He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord,’” he told Brenna Bird, the Iowa attorney general, in September. “So can we just pray together for me?”"
VL3H18AB50_LENX32AYGFW3DOQ,Turkey Backs Sweden’s NATO Bid,"By Ben Hubbard and Lara JakesBen Hubbard reported from Istanbul, and Lara Jakes from Rome.","Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/world/europe/turkey-sweden-nato.html,"Turkey’s Parliament voted on Tuesday to allow Sweden to join NATO, putting the Nordic country one step closer to entering the military alliance and easing a diplomatic stalemate that has clouded Turkey’s relations with the United States and hampered Western efforts to isolate Russia over its war in Ukraine.
The measure passed after a vote of 287 to 55, with four abstentions in the 600-member body. It will go into effect once it is published in the country’s official gazette, usually a swift formality. That would make Hungary the only NATO member that has not approved Sweden’s accession, depriving the alliance of the unanimity required to add a new member.
The bill’s passage is a big moment for NATO, paving the way for expanding its deterrence against Russia at a time when some of its members are struggling to provide Ukraine with enough arms to roll back Russia’s invasion.
NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a statement late Tuesday that he welcomed the news from Turkey, according to Reuters. But, he said, “I also count on Hungary to complete its national ratification as soon as possible.”
He continued: “Sweden has fulfilled its commitments. Sweden’s membership makes NATO stronger and all of us safer.”
Sweden’s accession would open a vast stretch of Nordic land to potential military operations by the alliance and extend to Sweden the other members’ automatic protection should it come under attack.

VN3J32EZFU_XVC996DE0DAE19Z,A Boom in Comics Drawn From Fact,By Julia Webster AyusoReporting from Paris,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/books/french-nonfiction-comic-books.html,"Soon after the journalist and historian Valérie Igounet heard about the killing of Samuel Paty, the schoolteacher whose 2020 murder by an Islamist extremist shocked France, she knew she wanted to write a book about him.
Paty, who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to students during a class on freedom of expression, was murdered near the middle school where he taught in a Paris suburb. “I absolutely wanted Samuel Paty’s students to be able to read this book,” Igounet said, “and it was obvious that a 300-page book with footnotes would be reserved for a different kind of readership.”
Instead, Igounet decided to produce a comic book: “Black Pencil: Samuel Paty, the Story of a Teacher,” based on two years of reporting and made with the illustrator Guy Le Besnerais, was published in October. It meticulously reconstructs the events leading up to the murder while also showing Paty’s daily life in the classroom. Le Besnerais’s illustrations are accompanied by Paty’s handwritten notes, newspaper clippings and messages exchanged by his students in the weeks before he was killed.
One in four books sold in France is a comic book, according to the market research company GfK, and a growing number of those are nonfiction works by journalists and historians. In the past year, they have included titles such as “M.B.S.: Saudi Arabia’s Enfant Terrible,” a biography of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by Antoine Vitkine and Christophe Girard; “What Are the Russians Thinking?” based on the cartoonist Nicolas Wild’s conversations about the war in Ukraine during a 2022 trip to Russia; and “Who Profits From Exile?,” by Taina Tervonen and Jeff Pourquié, which looks at the economics of European immigration.
This growing trend will be on show at the Angoulême International Comics Festival, one of the world’s leading comic book gatherings, which starts Thursday in southwestern France and runs through Jan. 28.

VPZUXU2HWE_G5IPG8HWBUXXJXN,We Need a New Word for ‘Plagiarism’,_,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/opinion/plagiarism-claudine-gay-ackman-oxman.html,"In December, a group of outside scholars appointed by a Harvard board was roundly criticized for describing the plagiarism that ultimately contributed to former President Claudine Gay’s resignation as “duplicative language.” This description was seen by many as an effort to minimize Gay’s transgression. And it was. But I think the board was on to something useful nevertheless. The term “plagiarism” is overstretched.
Ironically, Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager who worked so hard to push Claudine Gay out of her job, would now seem to agree. In a twist so uncanny you couldn’t have written it any better, Ackman’s wife, Neri Oxman, a former M.I.T. professor, appears to have lifted chunks of her dissertation from other sources, including Wikipedia.
In the blink of an eye after these revelations, Ackman acquired an exquisite sensitivity to the difference between real plagiarism and the other, accidental-word-copying kind. Yet the difference he suddenly understands is one that anyone can. To think that neither Gay nor Oxman “really” plagiarized, or to believe that the sanction for such errors should be less severe, is an entirely reasonable point of view.
But here in this world, in this language, the term “plagiarism” still covers both “real” plagiarism — the theft of another person’s ideas — and the use, perhaps inadvertent, of another person’s language. For that reason, I continue to think Gay was correct to step down — especially given that Harvard, like many universities, explicitly defines plagiarism for undergraduates in the “old” way. If accidental cutting and pasting could theoretically get a sophomore suspended, repeated instances of the same should lead an administrator to step down. Meanwhile, given his support for the attacks on Gay, Ackman’s defense of his wife is a hot mess: He should knock off the sputtering and just eat crow.
Leave it to a linguist to say this, but we need another word. In this case, we need a word for the relatively minor, “duplicative language” version of plagiarism.
To present someone else’s ideas as one’s own is unquestionably wrong, in academia and elsewhere. However, to cite boilerplate statements — the assumptions basic to a field, for instance — word for word, or close to it, without citing the person who typed the words originally is something different, and vastly less egregious. I would argue, in fact, that there may be nothing wrong with it at all, in particular when it is done accidentally.

VTHUSCUZ4A_9SQM0CVQKODM1X6,Israeli Leaders Slam U.N. Court Ruling but Applaud Lack of Cease-fire Order,By Aaron BoxermanReporting from Jerusalem,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-icj-ruling.html,"Officials in Israel on Friday denounced the International Court of Justice’s order seeking to prevent genocidal acts in its offensive against Hamas in Gaza but also expressed relief the court did not order it to halt its military campaign.
Israeli officials had feared the judges would order an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, as South Africa had requested in its initial petition. The U.N. court ultimately ordered Israel to act to ensure that its soldiers and leaders were adhering to the 1948 U.N. genocide convention, but stopped short of demanding an end to the war.
Israel has strongly rejected the accusation that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. After the interim ruling on Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the court.
“The very notion that Israel is perpetrating genocide is not only false, it is outrageous, and the court’s willingness to discuss it is a mark of shame that will last for generations,” Mr. Netanyahu said.
But he said the court order had upheld Israel’s right to protect itself after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 prompted it to go to war in Gaza.
“Like any state, Israel has the basic right of self-defense. The court justly rejected the disgraceful demand to nullify that right,” Mr. Netanyahu said.
Raz Nizri, a former Israeli deputy attorney general, said Israel was already taking most of the actions the court has ordered it take, such as ensuring the provision of humanitarian aid into Gaza and punishing statements that could incite genocide.
“And there was no injunction to stop the fighting,” he said. “It’s extremely important that no such order was given.”
Many Israelis think South Africa’s charge of genocide amounts to a reversal of reality. They accuse Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that ruled Gaza, of committing genocide in its Oct. 7 assault, which killed about 1,200 people in Israel, the authorities say. Another 240 were taken hostage by Hamas and other militant groups, many of whom are still captive in Gaza.
“There has certainly been attempted genocide of the Jewish people by Hamas, the barbaric Nazis,” said Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli finance minister.
Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said Israel did not need “to be lectured on morality” by the court. The justices had noted some of Mr. Gallant’s previous comments — including that Israel was at war with “human animals” — when discussing whether Israeli officials had used genocidal rhetoric.
In their ruling, the U.N. court’s judges pronounced themselves “gravely concerned” about the fate of the hostages and called for their immediate release.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 25,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials in the enclave. Most of Gaza’s more than two million residents have fled their homes fleeing Israel’s airstrikes and ground invasion."
VVX3XMRZJA_822Q2L4S2GOG4UJ,"After Days of Waiting, Trump Spends Minutes on the Witness Stand","By Benjamin Weiser, Maria Cramer and Kate Christobek","Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/nyregion/trump-testimony-carroll-defamation-trial.html,"Follow our live updates from today’s closing arguments.
Former President Donald J. Trump took the stand in his own defense on Thursday in the trial of E. Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit against him, a civil case that grew out of her accusation that he raped her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s.
His testimony, after days of anticipation, lasted less than five minutes.
“The defense calls President Donald Trump,” Alina Habba, his lead lawyer, told the court.
She asked the former president whether he stood by his remarks in a deposition in which he had called Ms. Carroll a liar.
“One hundred percent, yes,” Mr. Trump said. “She said something; I consider it a false accusation.”
Mr. Trump’s brief appearance came after much debate before the trial over whether the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, should ensure Mr. Trump did not stray from the sole issue in the case — damages. Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, had written to the judge, saying Trump might see a political benefit “from intentionally turning this trial into a circus.”
In the end, both sides seemed to attain at least part of their goals on Thursday: Mr. Trump answered the handful of questions his lawyer asked, and he did not embark on a rant about Ms. Carroll.
The only issue facing the nine-member jury considering the case is how much money, if any, Mr. Trump must pay Ms. Carroll in damages for defaming her in June 2019 after she first publicly accused him, in a book excerpt in New York magazine, of attacking her. At the time, Mr. Trump, who was still in office, called her accusation “totally false,” and said he had never met Ms. Carroll and that she was just trying to sell a book.

W2W0T68NSN_98Z60GQ0TZXFTB8,"As Changes Come to Boston Symphony, Conductor’s Contract Is Extended",By Joshua Barone,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/arts/music/boston-symphony-andris-nelsons-carlos-simon.html,"The tenure of Chad Smith, the innovative arts leader who last year left the Los Angeles Philharmonic to run the comparatively old-fashioned Boston Symphony Orchestra, is beginning to take shape.
In an announcement on Thursday, the Boston Symphony said that Andris Nelsons, its music director, would move to a rolling, evergreen contract rather than one with a fixed expiration date, and that he would take on a new, educational role as the head of conducting at Tanglewood.
Additionally, the orchestra appointed Carlos Simon to a newly created post of composer chair; and announced that it would establish the Boston Symphony Orchestra Humanities Institute, an initiative with the goal of expanding the ensemble’s relationship with Boston outside its storied concert hall.
“I came to the Boston Symphony with the idea that this is an extraordinary institution with a remarkable history,” Smith said in an interview. “But the opportunities of what we can do in the future were most compelling.”
This announcement is the beginning of that work, he added.
Smith took over at the Boston Symphony last fall after two decades at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, where, in shaping its programming, he played a large role in establishing the orchestra as one of the most creative and exciting in the country. In 2019, he became the Philharmonic’s chief executive.
The orchestra in Boston, while a perennial generator of new music, is widely seen as traditional. Thursday’s announcements draw from both of those reputations, with forward-thinking aspiration.

W6NHY3RIZG_VTNBPKJ2CQYG3J3,Exxon Sues to Prevent Climate Proposal From Getting a Shareholder Vote,By J. Edward Moreno,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/business/exxon-climate-change-lawsuit.html,"Exxon Mobil is suing two activist investors to prevent their proposal calling for emissions cuts at the oil giant from going to a vote of shareholders.
In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Sunday, Exxon accused the investors, Arjuna Capital and Follow This, of abusing the process for proposing shareholder votes to advance their priorities with votes “calculated to diminish the company’s existing business.”
Arjuna filed a proposal in December for a nonbinding resolution that urged Exxon to accelerate its plans to reduce its carbon emissions and expand the scope of the emissions it measures to include its suppliers and customers. Follow This joined in support of the proposal shortly thereafter, according to the complaint.
The proposal “does not seek to improve ExxonMobil’s economic performance or create shareholder value,” Exxon said in the complaint, but is instead “constraining and micromanaging” the company’s operations.
Exxon said it already planned to exclude the proposal from appearing on the ballot for shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in May, arguing that U.S. securities law allows the company to toss petitions that “deal with matters relating to the company’s ordinary business operations.” In an unusual twist, the company also sued the investors in an effort to secure a “declaration” from a judge supporting its move to exclude the proposal.
The company said guidance from staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission was informal and could be subject to interpretation. A court ruling in favor of Exxon could generate stricter scrutiny of the kinds of shareholder proposals that companies allow to be put to a vote in the future.

WC8JK1SI7B_99P4B1GLWH66FFS,Los Angeles Times to Slash Newsroom by Over 20%,By Katie Robertson and Benjamin Mullin,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/media/los-angeles-times-layoffs-newsroom.html,"The Los Angeles Times said on Tuesday that it would lay off about 115 journalists, slashing its newsroom by more than 20 percent after a tumultuous few weeks that saw top editors depart and workers walk off the job.
Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of The Los Angeles Times, said in an interview with his paper that it was losing $30 million to $40 million a year and needed to make more progress in building a larger audience.
“It is indeed difficult to reflect upon the recent tumultuous years, during which our business faced significant challenges, including losses that surpassed $100 million in operational and capital expenses,” Dr. Soon-Shiong said, noting that the paper had not done layoffs in the first years of the pandemic.
Dr. Soon-Shiong added that since he had bought The Times in 2018, “we have invested almost a billion dollars, underscoring our dedication to preserving its legacy and securing its future,” though he did not specify how he had arrived at that figure.
A spokeswoman for The Times had no immediate comment.
The announcement ends uncertainty about the extent of the cuts, after negotiations were held between the union and Times management. On Friday, hundreds of journalists walked off the job for the day in the first newsroom-organized work stoppage in The Times’s 142-year history, protesting the planned layoffs.
This month, the executive editor, Kevin Merida, announced suddenly that he would step down. Dr. Soon-Shiong wrote in a note to staff that he and Mr. Merida had “mutually agreed” that Mr. Merida should leave. Two other top editors, Shani Hilton and Sara Yasin, announced their departures in recent days.
News of the layoffs — which will shrink the newsroom to the size it was when Dr. Soon-Shiong bought it — was delivered on Tuesday in a brief email to affected employees. The human resources department cited “a difficult economic operating environment” notifying them that their last day would be near the end of March, according to a copy of the email viewed by The New York Times.
“We are saddened to have to take this step and thank you for your work for the Los Angeles Times,” the email said.
The cuts affected many departments at The Los Angeles Times, including its business desk, its Washington bureau and its “Fast Break” desk, which covers breaking news.
Matt Pearce, president of Media Guild of the West, which represents unionized workers at The Times, said in a post on X that 94 of those being laid off were union members.
“This total, while devastating, is nonetheless far lower than the total number of Guild layoffs initially expected last week,” he wrote.
In an email to colleagues on Tuesday, Sam Dean, a business reporter who is a member of union leadership, said: “Keep in mind that these proposed layoffs are not final, they are proposed and have to be bargained with the Guild, and could be changed as buyouts, negotiations, etc., continue.”
“Do not sign anything,” he added."
WDOF6Z3DZ5_TKRCRZ4P8M8FTNM,Top Cancer Center Seeks to Retract or Correct Dozens of Studies,By Benjamin Mueller,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/health/dana-farber-cancer-studies-retractions.html,"A prominent cancer center affiliated with Harvard said it will ask medical journals to retract six research papers and correct dozens of others after a British scientist and blogger found that work by some of its top executives was rife with duplicated or manipulated data.
The center, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, one of the nation’s foremost cancer treatment and research facilities, moved quickly in recent days to address allegations of faulty data in 58 studies, many of them influential, compiled by a British molecular biologist, Sholto David.
In many cases, Dr. David found, images in the papers had been stretched, obscured or spliced together in a way that suggested deliberate attempts to mislead readers. The studies he flagged included some published by Dana-Farber’s chief executive, Dr. Laurie Glimcher, and its chief operating officer, Dr. William Hahn.
The retractions come as researchers in the United States face growing pressure to account for instances of scientific misconduct, sloppy work or outright fraud. Image sleuths have recently found evidence of fabricated data in scores of influential papers on Alzheimer’s disease. Last year, Marc Tessier-Lavigne resigned as president of Stanford University after some of his published papers were found to contain manipulated results.
Allegations of misconduct have ballooned in part because experts have access to new artificial intelligence tools that can flag suspicious images depicting experimental results.
In the wake of recent high-profile misconduct claims, experts have drawn attention to a “publish or perish” culture in academia, which pressures researchers to generate striking results and place papers in major journals, whatever the merits of a study. Some researchers have also said that certain labs, explicitly or not, encourage junior researchers to take shortcuts.

WHQULLQI54_22R5QFT6Y79KGHU,"After Early Primary Victories, Republicans in Congress Fall in Line Behind Trump",By Annie KarniReporting from Capitol Hill,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/republicans-congress-endorse-trump.html,"Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican and die-hard ally of former President Donald J. Trump, was exasperated with her colleagues as she left the House floor last Thursday evening.
“I don’t know if it’s sunk in this place around here,” Ms. Greene vented as she headed for the elevators and then for Manchester, N.H., where she was stumping for the former president. “I’ve been telling everyone that President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party; he’s going to be our presidential nominee. It’s time for all Republicans to get behind his policies.”
If it hadn’t sunk in yet, it has now.
After Mr. Trump won the New Hampshire primary by 11 percentage points on Tuesday night following his steamrolling victory in the Iowa caucuses, the small segment of Republicans in Congress who had tried to distance themselves from him, ignore him, cast doubt on his staying power or condemn him have begun swiftly falling into line behind him. And this time, it is happening even faster than it did in 2016, when Mr. Trump first subsumed his party.
In the Senate, at least 29 Republicans — more than half the conference — have now endorsed Mr. Trump, compared with zero for the lone Republican challenger still standing, former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, who vowed on Tuesday night to carry on with her campaign despite outlining no clear path to victory.
In the Republican-controlled House, which has acted as Mr. Trump’s sword and shield, vulnerable Republicans who represent districts President Biden won in 2020 are speed walking to the Trump bandwagon, where their MAGA-loving colleagues are greeting them with an “I told you so.”
Two of them, Representatives Brandon Williams and Nick LaLota of New York, said that Mr. Trump was the party’s inevitable nominee and that they fully supported the voters’ choice. Representative John Duarte, a California Republican whose district Mr. Biden won in 2020 by almost 11 points, told Axios that he expected to “ultimately endorse Donald Trump for president.”

WKK8EV95TT_99G7FHC6PE0BF25,Murder on a Private Greek Island,By Sarah Lyall,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/books/review/new-thrillers-alex-michaelides.html,"Alex Michaelides, who is best known for his blockbuster first novel, “The Silent Patient,” has a devoted following and a knack for explosive, change-everything revelations. He sets THE FURY (Celadon, 298 pp., $28.99) on a private Greek island where Lana Farrar, a stunningly beautiful British movie star, has gathered a small party of relatives and frenemies.
The foreshadowing is afoot. The wind is gathering force. Naturally, the weather will render the island unreachable, and the author will render a character dead. “This is a tale of murder,” the narrator, an unpleasant playwright named Elliot Chase, intones in the first sentence.
As he often reminds us, Elliot is unreliable. “I’m a sly one, aren’t I?” he says. He’s fond of portentous pronouncements and banal observations presented as piercing insights (“Never let it be said that an Englishman’s home is not his castle”).
The book name-drops a dizzying array of writers and playwrights, and takes as its epigraph the classic opening line of Ford Madox Ford’s “The Good Soldier” (“This is the saddest story I have ever heard”). But Michaelides undercuts his ambitions with a flabby plot and uneven pacing that ricochets between plodding and breakneck. The characters are unbelievable. The payoff is anticlimactic. The chapters end with simple declarative sentences dressed up as cliffhangers: “Smiling to herself, Kate emptied the cocaine onto the bedside table. Then she pulled out her credit card and started chopping it up.”
Whodunit, and why? Who cares? Reading this novel is like seeing a play where the actors yell at you and spray you with water while repeatedly announcing that theirs is a tragic tale.

WLQQ4HP24L_8Z2HANZ61XMR9TM,A Child of Another War Who Makes Music for Ukrainians,"By Carlotta GallReporting from Kyiv, Ukraine","Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/world/europe/ukraine-music-mirza-ramic.html,"When the owner of an underground club in Kyiv reached out to Western musicians to play in Ukraine, long before the war, there were not so many takers.
But an American from Boston, Mirza Ramic, accepted the invitation, spawning a lasting friendship with the club’s owner, Taras Khimchak.
“I kept coming back,” Mr. Ramic, 40, said in an interview at the club, Mezzanine, where he was preparing for a performance during a recent tour of Ukraine.
The country, he said “is one of the places that has welcomed me most and been the most supportive of my music.” And so especially after the Russian invasion two years ago, he added, “I wanted to come now, to show my support in these hard times.”
Mr. Ramic, born in Bosnia, is a child of war himself. At 11, he lost his father in the shelling of his hometown, Mostar, and spent years as a refugee, moving from country to country with his mother as she struggled to find a way to survive.
They lived in Zagreb, Croatia; Tunis; and Prague, before moving to the United States, first to Arizona, and eventually Boston. There, he finished his education and began a career as a musician, forming an electronic band, Arms and Sleepers, with a college friend, Max Lewis.

WMSVVS1IMK_FEZRZGZGH7WDZPP,Monday Briefing,By Natasha Frost,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/briefing/gaza-war-hostages-desantis-storms.html,"Brett McGurk, President Biden’s Middle East coordinator at the White House, departed for Cairo yesterday for talks aimed at the release of more hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a pause in Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip, U.S. officials said.
Egypt and Qatar helped broker a cease-fire in November during which Hamas released more than 100 people from captivity. The hope is that another such deal can be arranged. But U.S. officials have said that a new hostage release has been complicated by Hamas’s evident desire for a permanent cease-fire.
The trip comes as Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated that he would not withdraw Israeli forces and remained opposed to the two-state solution backed by the U.S. and other allies. Divisions have emerged in Israel over the path forward, including over whether military action can achieve the hostages’ safe return.
In other news from the war:
At least two U.S. service members in western Iraq were wounded on Saturday when their air base came under fire from what American officials said were Iran-backed militias.
The Israeli military took reporters on a tour of an underground compound where it says about 20 hostages were held by Hamas.
International agencies, aid workers and physicians portray a harrowing picture of what they say is the disproportionate burden and risk of war borne by the women of Gaza.
This map shows how Houthi attacks have upended global shipping.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida suspended his campaign for U.S. president and endorsed Donald Trump, less than 48 hours before the primary race in New Hampshire. The move cements the Republican contest as a two-person race between the former president and Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina.

WR2MKHVXZB_24YIMY350XTEZX0,Suspect in Fatal Shootings of 8 in Illinois Is Found Dead in Texas,By Livia Albeck-Ripka,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/joliet-illinois-shooting-romeo-nance.html,"The suspect in the fatal shooting of eight people in Joliet, Ill., fatally shot himself Monday evening after an hours-long manhunt and confrontation with law enforcement in South Texas, the authorities said.
The suspect, Romeo Nance, 23, was found at about 8:30 p.m. by U.S. Marshals near Natalia, 30 miles southwest of San Antonio, the Joliet Police Department said in a statement posted to social media. The authorities believe Mr. Nance “took his own life with a handgun,” the department said.
The manhunt for Mr. Nance began Monday, after the authorities discovered seven of the bodies — two in one home, and five in another — on the same block on the east side of Joliet, a city about 35 miles southwest of Chicago, they said. Mr. Nance was also suspected in a fatal shooting on Sunday afternoon about four miles southeast, the authorities said.
The police were notified of the seven bodies by the Will County Sheriff’s Office just after 12 p.m. Monday, Chief William Evans of the Joliet Police Department said at a news conference on Monday evening. The motive for the killings was unclear, but the police believe that Mr. Nance knew the victims, who appeared to have been related to one another, Chief Evans said.
The authorities said that the last known address for the suspect was one of the homes where the bodies were found. They would not provide the ages of the seven victims or any further details on how they might have known the suspect.
“I’ve been a policeman 29 years,” he said. “This is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with.”
Daniel Jungles, a deputy chief with the Will County Sheriff’s Office, said at the news conference that deputies had responded on Sunday to a shooting at an apartment block in unincorporated Joliet that may be connected to the other seven victims. There, deputies found a man with a gunshot wound to his head, he said. The man, Toyosi Bakare, 28, was transported to a hospital, where he died of his injuries, Deputy Jungles said.
Deputies linked that fatal shooting to an episode about 10 minutes earlier in which a 42-year-old man was shot in the leg and “sustained non-life-threatening injuries,” according to a news release from the Sheriff’s Office. Mr. Nance’s red Toyota was seen at both crime scenes, according to the release, which described the victims as having nothing to do with one another, and Sunday’s shootings as “random in nature.”"
WX2OG1RE6T_7OOZD2BLRCU8WE9,When Will We Get Results for the New Hampshire Primary?,By Alyce McFadden,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/us/politics/when-new-hampshire-primary-results.html,"The very first results in the New Hampshire primary became available within minutes of midnight on Tuesday.
But beyond Dixville Notch, where polling opened at midnight for the small town’s six registered voters and closed soon afterward, voting locations in most of the rest of the state will be open until 7 p.m. Eastern time. Initial results will most likely become available soon after that.
David Scanlan, the secretary of state, said he expected that most votes would be counted on Tuesday night. News media outlets are likely to call the race before all ballots are counted, whenever a winner becomes apparent.
The Associated Press does not expect to make a call before 8 p.m., when the last polls close. But in 2016, its call in the Republican primaries came right at 8 p.m.
Results in the Democratic race might come in later because it will take election workers extra time to count the write-in votes for President Biden, who is not on the ballot after New Hampshire fought his decision to push the state back on the party’s nominating calendar. The results may be slightly delayed, but state officials expect them to be counted before the end of the night.
“Several of the larger communities have recruited extra volunteers to help with the process, so we are not expecting huge delays,” said Anna Sventek, the communications director for the New Hampshire Department of State."
X0912DTG2H_B073IO3CR2W7X49,"Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, Diagnosed With Skin Cancer",By Isabella KwaiReporting from London,"Jan. 22, 2024",20230122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/europe/sarah-ferguson-fergie-skin-cancer.html,"Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York and the former wife of Prince Andrew, said on Monday that it had been a “shock” to receive a second diagnosis of cancer within a year, after doctors found melanoma, a serious type of skin cancer.
The former royal, 64, had spoken publicly about her decision to undergo a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery last year, following a breast cancer diagnosis in the summer.
A spokesperson for Ms. Ferguson told The Associated Press on Sunday that the melanoma was found after several moles were removed during her treatment for breast cancer and that doctors were still analyzing the situation.
On Monday, Ms. Ferguson said on Instagram that she had received care “in the past weeks” and was recuperating at home with family. “It was thanks to the great vigilance of my dermatologist that the melanoma was detected when it was,” she wrote.
“Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock,” she added, “But I’m in good spirits and grateful for the many message of love and support.”
Melanoma is a particularly deadly type of skin cancer. It accounts for only one percent of all diagnosed skin cancers in the United States but causes the majority of deaths. In Britain, it makes up about 4 percent of all new cancer cases, and melanoma rates have been on the rise, according to Cancer Research U.K., a charity that supports cancer research.
Ms. Ferguson, known widely as “Fergie,” rose to mainstream attention in the 1980s — and became British tabloid fodder — after she married Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, who was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in 2022 after being named in a sexual abuse case.
The pair divorced in the 1990s but remained friends; they have two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
Ms. Ferguson has since worked as a television presenter, written children’s books and historical romances and launched a podcast. After revealing her breast cancer diagnosis last year, Ms. Ferguson had urged her podcast listeners to get routine mammograms.
“It’s very important that I speak about it,” she said at the time, adding that both her father and stepfather died from cancer. She is a longtime patron for charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust.
On Monday, she warned people to “be diligent” about checking for changes in and the emergence of new moles.
Senior members of the royal family were hit by health worries last week. King Charles III was to receive a “corrective procedure” for an enlarged prostate this week, the palace said. Catherine, the Princess of Wales and the wife of Prince William, will take a hiatus from public duties to recuperate from abdominal surgery."

That has left anti-Trump donors and the broader business community glimpsing an increasingly likely future: The former president will become the Republican nominee, and stands a good shot of winning in November.
Haley said she would fight on, arguing last night that “this race is far from over.” But the former South Carolina governor will head to her home state — she’s skipping the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 8 — badly trailing Trump in polls there, with many of her Palmetto State colleagues having endorsed her opponent.
A growing number of Republicans are now suggesting that she should drop out: Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a senior G.O.P. lawmaker, said that his party needed “to unite around a single candidate.”
Donors may start falling in line, too. A number of Haley supporters are reportedly heading to the exits: An unnamed Republican fund-raiser told CNBC’s Brian Schwartz that one of her donors was done with her campaign, declaring it over.
Meanwhile, Puck’s Teddy Schleifer wrote on the social media platform X that the casino magnate Steve Wynn and the financier John Paulson attended Trump’s New Hampshire victory party last night. And Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who appeared at the event, told Schleifer that he expected the Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, his biggest backer before Scott dropped out of the primary race, to support Trump as well.

XHTE0QFBJ4_NFPF3EQM559TG3K,Review: A Japanese ‘Boléro’? It’s a Spooky Ride of Revenge.,By Gia Kourlas,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/arts/dance/ravel-bolero-dance-japan-society.html,"For better or worse, Ravel’s “Boléro,” with its churning swell of sound, has stirred the imagination of artists over time, among them the choreographer Maurice Béjart and the ice dancing team of Torvill and Dean. It even found a seductive partner, Bo Derek — along with her cornrows — in the Blake Edwards movie “10.”
With “Nihon Buyo in the 21st Century: From Kabuki Dance to Boléro,” performed at the Japan Society on Wednesday, it has a new rendering. In “Boléro — The Legend of Anchin and Kiyohime,” the director and choreographer Hanayagi Genkuro uses Ravel’s score to retell the folk tale “The Legend of Dojoji.”
In the tale, Kiyohime (the striking Azuma Tokuyo, well known in Kabuki theater as Nakamura Kazutaro), an innkeeper’s daughter, falls in love with Anchin, a monk who promises to return to her but never does. She takes revenge by transforming into a snake and chasing him until he perishes, burning to death as he tries to escape to the bell of the Dojoji temple.
Genkuro coaxes out the sinister notes of the score in a deranged but good way. If you have to watch another dance to “Boléro,” this one, at least, is full of drama, danger and brittle, seething anger. As the music builds so does Kiyohime’s rage, which Tokuyo illuminates with icy solemnity as the fire of passion is turned into despair and, ultimately, revenge.
“Boléro” closes the program, which highlights the art of nihon buyo, a style that translates literally as “Japanese dance.” The training and technique of nihon buyo derives from Kabuki dance; its repertoire can be original or inspired by plays, folklore and stories. Presenting nihon buyo comes with challenges: dancers are in demand; live music is a must; and wigs and costumes can get pricey. In a program note, Yoko Shioya, Japan Society’s artistic director, says that this is only her third time presenting nihon buyo in her two decades in the job.
Along with “Boléro” (2021) was the comical “Toba-e” (1819); in showcasing a pair of dances more than 200 years apart, the program demonstrates the range of Kabuki technique. And because live music is essential in nihon buyo, rounding out the evening were three musical selections: “Matsuri (Festival), “Yugiri, the Courtesan” and “Hana (Flower),” brought to fragrant life by Tosha Suiho’s delicate flute.

Jean Carroll for defaming her in social media posts, news conferences and on the campaign trail ever since she first accused him in 2019 of raping her in a department store dressing room decades earlier.
It is the second time in less than a year that Trump has been ordered to pay Carroll damages. In May, a different Manhattan jury awarded her $5 million after finding Trump liable for sexually abusing her in the mid-1990s, and for defaming her in a post on his Truth Social website in October 2022.
During closing arguments today from Carroll’s lawyer, Trump rose from the defense table without saying anything and left the courtroom. He returned about 75 minutes later, when his lawyer offered her summation.
Trump posted on Truth Social, calling the verdict “absolutely ridiculous.” He said he planned to appeal, and again accused Carroll’s suit of being a “Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party.” His account made about 16 posts in 15 minutes during the summations.
Trump faces a series of civil and criminal cases as he seeks to return to the White House. During the trial, Trump alternated campaign stops in New Hampshire, where he won the Republican presidential primary, with court appearances, using them as an opportunity to reach voters and complain that he had been mistreated.

XK9S04ZM11_YIF80PXLPI1A2C9,Cindy Sherman: Woman of an Uncertain Age,By Nancy Princenthal,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/arts/design/cindy-sherman-photography-hauser-wirth.html,"The facial features in Cindy Sherman’s hyperenergetic new photo-portraits slide around crazily. Eyes spin out in different directions, competing clamorously for attention. Noses and mouths engage in pitched conflict. The electrifying images, now on view at Hauser and Wirth’s SoHo gallery, are primarily black and white, but there are patches of vivid color.
Butting one fragment of skin, makeup, hair and headgear up against another, Sherman dispenses with the capacity of Photoshop to smooth out edges. Instead, she creates a sense of instability by folding photographic nips and tucks right in with their aging subjects’ wrinkles. Finding physical comedy in the efforts women take to conceal the effects of time is the least of her concerns. There is also the dark humor she brings to the consideration of photography’s credibility. And the dash of pathos she adds to both.
When Sherman emerged, meteorically, in the late 1970s, it was with an extended series of black and white photographs she took of herself. They are not to be confused with self-portraits. In each, Sherman, newly arrived in New York City from Buffalo, was made up and dressed to suggest she was the (fictional) star of an (imaginary) noirish film. Her timing was perfect. The body-baring, soul-searching feminist art of the late ’60s and early ’70s had given way to more conceptually based work.
Femininity was understood to be a cultural construct, a masquerade, and Sherman’s photographs were considered exemplary of this turn. In the following decades, quite independently of the politics swirling around her, Sherman continued to deploy her face and body in fanciful guises that ran the gamut from an Italian Renaissance Madonna to an All-American clown.
For all its jangly discontinuities, the current work (all untitled) feels newly grounded. It emerged, Sherman told me, from a creative slump. In a conversation at the gallery, she was warm and open, and, as we settled in, she admitted, “I was going through a real creative block during Covid.” She had committed to the show in New York and a previous one in Zurich, and, she says, “I had no idea what I was going to do.” While “fooling around” with a body of photographs from 2010 — in color, as usual — she decided to flip them to black and white. It clicked.

XNN6CGW4ZO_WMZ7RQ7JLGBROC2,Victims Describe Their Pain and Prisoners Apologize in Bali Bombing Trial,"By Carol RosenbergReporting from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba","Jan. 25, 2024",20240119,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/bali-bombing-trial.html,"Relatives of tourists killed in the 2002 terrorist bombing in Bali, Indonesia, spoke of endless, devastating grief, and two prisoners who conspired in the attack renounced violence in the name of Islam on Thursday for a U.S. military jury assembled at Guantánamo Bay to deliberate their sentence.
The prisoners, Mohammed Farik Bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep, both Malaysians, pleaded guilty last week to war crimes charges for conspiring with an affiliate of Al Qaeda that carried out the attack. The bombings killed 202 people from 22 nations.
“No God of any religion rewards such acts of horror,” said Solomon Lamagni-Miller, 18, of London. He was born after his uncle, Nathaniel Dan Miller, 31, was killed in the bombing and read a statement written by the victim’s mother, his grandmother.
Christopher Snodgrass of Glendale, Ariz., said the loss of his daughter, Deborah, 33, in the bombing and other “terrorist activities worldwide” left him despising “over 20 percent of the world population, Muslims. I’m a religious person, and the hate-filled person I have become is certainly not what I wanted.”
Echoing the sentiment of several family members, he appealed to the jury to “deal with these murderers in such a manner that they can’t do to others as they’ve done to us.”
For hours this week, fathers, mothers, a brother and three sisters of the victims offered anguished descriptions of searches for missing relatives, of life-altering burns and of the vacuum left by the deaths of young people who had gone on vacation in Bali and never came home.

XOFQI98P5T_VCWJ638BZMQCZJ1,"Charles Osgood, Lyrical Newscaster on Radio and TV, Dies at 91",By James Barron,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/media/charles-osgood-dead.html,"Charles Osgood, a newscaster who told unconventional stories on the radio in unconventional ways — sometimes with rhyme, sometimes with humor, often with both — died on Tuesday at his home in Saddle River, N.J. He was 91.
The cause was dementia, CBS News reported, quoting his family.
Mr. Osgood became a familiar face on television as the host of “CBS Sunday Morning” from 1994 to 2016. But his passion was the medium he had grown up listening to in the 1930s and ’40s, so much so that he closed his TV broadcasts by saying, “See you on the radio” — an oxymoron, to be sure, but one masked by the cleverness that his audiences had come to expect. He also used the phrase as the title of a book.
On television, he was known for his trademark bow ties; on the radio, it was for his distinctive voice, most familiar from his short “Osgood File” segments on CBS Radio. It was not booming like Paul Harvey’s, deeply authoritative like Edward R. Murrow’s or telegraph-staccato like Walter Winchell’s. Some listeners compared the way Mr. Osgood sounded to the jerky rhythms of Rod Serling, the host and creator of “The Twilight Zone.”
But Mr. Osgood’s voice was lighter, his approach more conversational, a style he attributed to his having avoided the “journalism machine” when he was young.
“I never took a journalism course or worked for a newspaper or news department of a broadcast operation,” he told Broadcasting magazine in 1985. “Whatever is unique or different in my style would probably have been drummed out of me in journalism school on the first day.”

Y11LE99ZU5_YCRI4REYQ6C4LA7,How a Ragtag Militia in Yemen Became a Nimble U.S. Foe,By Helene Cooper and Eric SchmittReporting from Washington,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/houthis-red-sea-airstrikes.html,"For years, the scrappy Iran-backed Yemeni rebels known as the Houthis did such a good job of bedeviling American partners in the Middle East that Pentagon war planners started copying some of their tactics.
Noting that the Houthis had managed to weaponize commercial radar systems that are commonly available in boating stores and make them more portable, a senior U.S. commander challenged his Marines to figure out something similar. By September 2022, Marines in the Baltic Sea were adapting Houthi-inspired mobile radar systems.
So senior Pentagon officials knew as soon as the Houthis started attacking ships in the Red Sea that they would be hard to tame.
As the Biden administration approaches its third week of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, the Pentagon is trying to thread an impossibly tiny needle: making a dent in the Houthis’ ability to hit commercial and Navy vessels without dragging the United States into a prolonged war.
It is a difficult task, made more so because the Houthis have perfected the tactics of irregular warfare, American military officials say. The group does not have many big weapons depots for American fighter jets to bomb — Houthi fighters are constantly on the move with missiles they launch from pickup trucks on remote beaches before hustling away.
The first barrage of American-led airstrikes nearly two weeks ago hit nearly 30 locations in Yemen, destroying around 90 percent of the targets struck, Pentagon officials said. But even with that high success rate, the Houthis retained around 75 percent of their ability to fire missiles and drones at ships transiting the Red Sea, those officials acknowledged.

YL7045OJY2_KGQDXVG4KS73L3H,"Cuomo Created ‘Sexually Hostile’ Workplace, Says Justice Department",By Grace AshfordReporting from Albany N.Y.,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-justice-department-harassment.html,"The Department of Justice concluded that former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and his executive staff subjected female employees to a “sexually hostile work environment,” and then retaliated against several who complained, according to a settlement announced on Friday.
The findings appear to largely substantiate the investigation by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who concluded that Mr. Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women, amid a culture of fear and intimidation. Mr. Cuomo, who denied having sexually harassed anyone, resigned in August 2021, shortly after the release of Ms. James’s report.
Since his departure, Mr. Cuomo has engaged in a multipronged campaign to discredit the report and Ms. James as being politically motivated, and has been slowly maneuvering toward re-entering political life.
But Mr. Cuomo’s efforts may be sharply compromised by the Justice Department’s investigation, which determined that he repeatedly subjected women who worked for him to unwelcome sexual contact, comments and looks, and gave preferential treatment to some women based on their physical appearance.
In its findings, the Justice Department reported that at least 13 female state employees had been subjected to Mr. Cuomo’s behavior — two more than were cited in Ms. James’s report. The identities of the women and the nature of their complaints were not disclosed.
Investigators also found that Executive Chamber staff systemically enabled this conduct, and in four cases, senior staff retaliated against women who accused Mr. Cuomo of harassment. The Executive Chamber didn't have an adequate process for handling complaints of misconduct, according to the report.

YLD9TRLMPC_GUM3SSKFV2E4S7V,Reading the Signs in New Hampshire,By Lisa Lerer,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/us/politics/new-hampshire-primary-yard-signs.html,"If you want to understand the New Hampshire primary, stand at the corner of West Broadway and Valley Street in Derry, N.H.
There are two huge yard signs — one for Nikki Haley and one for Donald Trump — on adjacent houses. Perhaps a neighbor-on-neighbor feud?
Not exactly: When my colleague Michael Bender headed there recently, neighbors told him that the pro-Haley house had been vacant for years, and that political campaigns often planted their signs there. And the pro-Trump house was actually owned by an absentee landlord who lives in Florida.
It felt like one big metaphor for this campaign. The race looks like a real contest, with yard signs and all the usual campaign events. Yet when you dig a little deeper, there’s far less going on than it may seem.
Trump is the political version of a Florida-based absentee landlord. He barely held any campaign events in the state until the final week. Now the former president has come to collect what he believes is his due.
He has flown in for nightly rallies with a flurry of surrogates, including Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Haley’s home state. That’s been enough to boost enthusiasm and extend his lead. Trump’s double-digit advantage has never wavered, only grown.

YOBDB9UPL0_YCQKRT1P95IMNUK,"In Trump’s Defamation Trial, the Nine Most Important People Are Enigmas",By Maria Cramer and Benjamin Weiser,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/nyregion/trumps-defamation-trial-carroll-jury.html,"Attorneys for E. Jean Carroll and Donald J. Trump, pitted against each other in a civil defamation trial in Manhattan, know little about the nine people considering her claim for millions of dollars in damages against the former president.
So, their lawyers have been left making pitches to those nine, the jurors, about whom they have only the barest scraps of information, working on hunches and instincts to persuade people who by design are not knowable.
The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, ordered that the jurors remain anonymous as they considered how much Mr. Trump should pay for saying Ms. Carroll lied when she accused him of sexual abuse, for which he has already been found liable. Judge Kaplan said jurors should be identified only by number and even suggested they not share their actual names with one other.
In a pretrial ruling, he explained his rationale, citing the potential for influence attempts, harassment or worse by Mr. Trump’s supporters — or the former president himself.
The jurors in the trial, which resumed Thursday after a pause following a juror’s illness, have revealed no real clues about how they view the case unfolding before them.
Ordinarily, before a trial, lawyers on both sides dig into the backgrounds of those summoned for jury duty, scanning their social media pages and, in a case like Carroll v. Trump, searching for indications of polarized political beliefs, said Rosanna Garcia, the chief executive of Vijilent Inc., a Massachusetts-based research firm that gathers public data about prospective jurors for attorneys.

YS635VSOID_8453TQ5C3PTT27U,Arizona G.O.P. Chairman Resigns After Tape Suggests Attempt to Bribe Kari Lake,By Kellen Browning,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-gop.html,"The chairman of Arizona’s Republican Party resigned abruptly on Wednesday, a day after the publication of a 10-minute recording of a conversation between himself and Kari Lake, a former nominee for governor, in which he appeared to offer a bribe to persuade Ms. Lake to drop her 2024 Senate campaign.
In the recording, which was published by The Daily Mail, Jeff DeWit, the chairman, tells Ms. Lake that there are “very powerful people that want to keep you out” of the race, and suggests he is passing on a message from them. He says he had been told to ask her: “Is there any companies out there or something that could just put her on the payroll and give her — to keep her out?”
Later in the conversation, which Mr. DeWit repeatedly urges Ms. Lake not to repeat to anyone, he starts to ask, “Is there a number at which — ” before Ms. Lake interrupts, saying “I can be bought?” He replies, “Not be bought,” but instead wait a few years before running.
Ms. Lake brushed off the attempts, repeatedly telling Mr. DeWit that she was offended by the approach. “That’s immoral — I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror,” she says, according to the recording.
The recording concludes with one more request from Mr. DeWit: “I actually just wish you’d give me a counteroffer that’s big,” he says. She replies: “I can’t be bought.”
Ms. Lake, a close ally of former President Donald J. Trump, ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2022 with a fervent embrace of his false claims about the 2020 election. Arizona voters instead picked her opponent, Katie Hobbs, flipping control of the governor’s mansion to a Democrat in a key battleground state.

YSD7KC43UF_OHF4401EUYJ5CE3,Britain’s Foreign Secretary Pressures Netanyahu on More Aid for Gaza,By Mark Landlerreporting from London,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/world/middleeast/david-cameron-israel-gaza-netanyahu.html,"Britain’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, raised the pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday to allow more channels for humanitarian relief to enter Gaza.
Mr. Cameron made the case during a private meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in Jerusalem. In a statement Thursday morning, he said he had told Mr. Netanyahu that more crossings into Gaza needed to be opened to allow more trucks to enter.
“The scale of suffering in Gaza is unimaginable,” Mr. Cameron said. “We need an immediate humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostages out, followed by a sustainable cease-fire, without a return to hostilities.”
After the meeting in Jerusalem, Mr. Cameron traveled to the West Bank to meet the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. On Thursday he was in Qatar, where he spoke with the prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and said the two countries were jointly sending tents to Gaza to shelter displaced people.
The mounting civilian death toll in Gaza has become an acute source of concern in London. But Mr. Cameron’s pleas to the Israelis, like those of President Biden and his aides, have not borne much fruit, and on Wednesday, he found a defiant Israeli leader, who along with much of the country was mourning the deaths of 24 Israel Defense Force soldiers in the Gazan city of Khan Younis.
“We will continue to fight determinedly to vanquish the brutal enemy we face,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a speech on Wednesday marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Israeli Knesset. “We will continue to safeguard our national revival.”
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Netanyahu have a history of diplomatic relations going back more than a decade. When Mr. Cameron was prime minister, the Israeli leader referred to him as a “true friend of Israel,” though the two diverged in the past over Gaza and Israel’s settlement policy."

He was 85.
Mr. Coward died after he drove onto U.S. Highway 23 in Haywood County in the western part of the state and was struck by a truck, said Sgt. Marcus Bethea, a North Carolina State Highway Patrol spokesman. A passenger in Mr. Coward’s vehicle, Bertha Brooks, 78, was also killed, as were a Chihuahua and pet squirrel, Sergeant Bethea said.
Mr. Coward, who lived in Canton, N.C., in Haywood County, was often seen with his pet squirrel, according to local news reports.
The 16-year-old driver of the truck was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, according to Sergeant Bethea. He said that it was unclear what had led to the crash and that no charges had been filed.
Mr. Coward, who went by the nickname Cowboy, was best known for his role in “Deliverance,” which featured Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Jon Voight. The film is an adaptation of a novel by James Dickey about four Atlanta businessmen on a harrowing canoe trip in rural Georgia.

YWQJ4WUALL_99LSHBZ50ZQ3TYP,New Hampshire and Iowa Reveal Broader Weaknesses for Trump,By Michael C. Bender and Lisa Lerer,"Jan. 24, 2024",20240124,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/us/politics/trump-independent-voters.html,"For weeks, Donald J. Trump has romped through Iowa and New Hampshire without breaking a sweat, muscling out rivals for the Republican nomination and soaking up adoration from crowds convinced he will be the next president of the United States.
But as Mr. Trump marches steadily toward his party’s nomination, a harsher reality awaits him.
Outside the soft bubble of Republican primaries, Mr. Trump’s campaign is confronting enduring vulnerabilities that make his nomination a considerable risk for his party. Those weaknesses were laid bare in New Hampshire on Tuesday, where independents, college-educated voters and Republicans unwilling to dismiss his legal jeopardy voted in large numbers for his rival, Nikki Haley.
Mr. Trump still won easily. The voters opposed to his bid didn’t outnumber the many Republicans clamoring to see him return to power. But the results, delivered by more than 310,000 voters in a politically divided state, pointed to the trouble ahead for Mr. Trump as the presidential race leaves MAGA world and enters a broader electorate, one that rejected him less than four years ago.
“When I have people come up to me who voted for Reagan in ’76 and have been conservative their whole life say that they don’t want to vote for Trump again, that’s a problem,” Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said Tuesday in an interview with Blaze TV, a conservative media company, just a couple of days after he ended his own campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump. “So he’s got to figure out a way to solve that.”
President Biden would face his own challenges in a rematch of the 2020 contest. Unlike four years ago, Mr. Biden, 81, is widely disliked and most Americans disapprove of his job performance. Four years older than Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden is facing deep skepticism about his age and is struggling to hold onto the coalition of voters who underpinned his first victory. He has turned to issues like abortion rights and democracy, themes that resonate among his base, independents and even some moderate Republicans.
But like Mr. Trump, he faces some doubts from within his own party. Immigration, inflation and his support for Israel in its war in Gaza have chipped away at his support among young voters, Black and Latino voters, and liberals.

YY7QE42ZV7_O6F01F5JZTRBSXX,How ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Presses Up Against the Limits of Empathy,_,"Jan. 25, 2024",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/killers-flower-moon-scorsese-empathy.html,"“Can you find the wolves in this picture?” Ernest Burkhart asks, with the faltering pace of a child, from his home within the Osage Nation — lands only recently annexed by the United States to form Oklahoma. Ernest is seemingly reading both to himself and the audience of Martin Scorsese’s monumental “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which was nominated on Tuesday for 10 Academy Awards, including best picture. The film offers more than three hours of violent detail from a period in Native American history during the 1920s that newspapers called the “Reign of Terror” — a period that included the slaughter of dozens, possibly hundreds, of the Osage Nation’s citizens by non-Native people.
These non-Native people, we learn throughout the movie, are the wolves in Mr. Scorsese’s “picture,” and they are hidden everywhere in plain sight. Some have become intimate with the Osage people, and others, like Mr. Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, have married into Osage families and even fathered Osage children.
“Killers of the Flower Moon” is rare in that its filmmakers worked closely with Osage citizens to portray this gruesome, oft-forgotten slice of American history. Despite this collaboration, the film has been criticized for centering on the unsophisticated Ernest Burkhart and for failing to cede precious screen and script time to the Osage protagonist, Mollie Burkhart, played brilliantly by Lily Gladstone (Blackfeet) — a performance that made history by garnering Ms. Gladstone the first best actress Oscar nomination for a Native American actor. Of course, centering primarily white and male perspectives in Hollywood is nothing new and is a valid critique of nearly every film about Indian Country.
But there are lessons offered by “Killers” that have been overlooked, unexpected lessons about empathy, the soul of the American public and how a reckoning with American colonialism must begin.
As Mr. Scorsese seems to have learned through decades of exploring the darkest and most violent aspects of human nature, encountering the pain and weakness of Mollie Burkhart may not generate the empathy and reckoning with colonialism that Mr. Scorsese seeks to provoke with the film. Pain and weakness may only make the wolves more hungry, more determined.
Mr. Scorsese takes a different tack. Rather than aim for moral development of the audience through empathy for Osage suffering, he focuses on Ernest Burkhart. Ernest is the paradigmatic wolf, just as Mr. DiCaprio has played other wolves throughout his career, on Wall Street and elsewhere. Mr. Burkhart acts on simple, underdeveloped moral principles — and often not exactly out of malice, but self-interest. Even in the intimate context of his own family, he is unable to see the “other” in his wife and her people. He is unable to move from wolf to human because he drowns in self-interest and delusion. Mr. Burkhart is driven by base desires — financial gain and other perquisites of power — toward horrific acts against his own family. “Killers” is a painful film to watch.

Z64Q98SD6K_9MD4YEWD5U5OVGG,Tuesday Briefing: North Korean Missiles in Ukraine,By Justin Porter,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/briefing/north-korea-ukraine-india-temple-china-landslide.html,"Russians are beginning to deploy North Korean arms on the battlefield in Ukraine.
Though many of the North Korean artillery rounds are proving to be duds — some appear to have been manufactured decades ago — they’re giving the Russians something to fire while Ukraine’s military rations its own dwindling supply of munitions.
But what has U.S., NATO and European officials worried are the missiles: So far, fewer than 50 appear to have been transferred to Russia, but there could be far more to come. Three barrages of North Korean-made missiles targeted Ukrainian positions around the new year, American officials say, and they believe more were used on the battlefield over the weekend.
An analysis by Conflict Armament Research, an organization that has documented the arms used in Russia’s war in Ukraine, showed that the North Korean missiles were relatively recent in their design. U.S. officials say they’re proving as accurate as Russia’s home-built equipment.
A testing ground: In South Korea, officials and analysts say the Ukraine war is giving the North something it desperately needs: a way to see how its new missile arsenal, designed for a conflict with South Korea and the U.S., fares against Western-designed air defenses.
Supplies: Last summer, Ukraine was firing as many as 7,000 artillery shells a day, compared with 5,000 a day by Russia. Now the Ukrainians are struggling to fire 2,000 rounds daily, while Russia, augmented by the North Korean shells, is reaching about 10,000 a day, analysts said.

ZAS088E2NM_J8M10A8ODCW5C19,The Wrong Party May Be Worrying About Its Nominee,_,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/opinion/trump-biden-nomination.html,"Technically speaking, Donald Trump is still far from winning the Republican presidential nomination, but his victory on Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary was enough to push the Republican National Committee off the sidelines and into his corner.
“I do think there is a message that is coming out from the voters which is very clear. We need to unite around our eventual nominee, which is going to be Donald Trump, and we need to beat Joe Biden,” Ronna McDaniel, the R.N.C. chairwoman, said in a recent interview on Fox News.
Other high-profile Republicans, like Senator John Cornyn of Texas, have followed suit, endorsing the former president even as he still has an opponent, Nikki Haley, in the nomination contest. “To beat Biden, Republicans need to unite around a single candidate, and it’s clear that President Trump is Republican voters’ choice,” Cornyn said on the X website.
But at least one Republican has, unsurprisingly, sounded a sour note about the prospect of another candidacy for Trump. “When I have people come up to me who voted for Reagan in ’76 and have been conservative their whole life say that they don’t want to vote for Trump again, that’s a problem,” said Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who recently left the race for president (and who also endorsed Trump). “So he’s got to figure out a way to solve that. I think there’s an enthusiasm problem overall, and then I also just think there are some voters that have checked out at this point that you got to find a way to get them back.”
DeSantis is right. He also understates the problem for the former president, whose victory in the New Hampshire primary rests on shakier ground than might appear at first glance.
Trump, predictably, dominated among Republicans, the bulk of the electorate on Tuesday. But among the 44 percent of primary voters who identified as independents, Trump lost, by 58 percent to 39 percent. Among the 28 percent of primary voters who identified as moderate, Trump lost, by 72 percent to 25 percent. And among the 48 percent of voters who had a college education or higher, Trump lost, by about 56 percent to 42 percent.

ZE1LCW7GTQ_1AXZTDSU9T04ZPY,Sunak’s Flagship Immigration Plan Fails First Test in House of Lords,By Stephen CastleReporting from London,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/europe/uk-sunak-rwanda-asylum-plan-lords.html,"Four days ago, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain urged the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament, not to block his plans to put asylum seekers on one-way flights to Rwanda, describing his contentious migration policy as “the will of the people.”
On Monday night, the Lords did not play ball.
Instead, they voted to delay the crucial treaty with Rwanda that underpins Mr. Sunak’s legislation — underscoring the hostility among some members of the chamber to a policy that has proved divisive ever since it was introduced by Boris Johnson, then the prime minister, in 2022.
In practical terms, the vote has limited impact because the House of Lords — a legislature which is largely made up of former politicians, civil servants and diplomats, as well as 26 bishops — does not have the power to prevent the treaty from coming into force.
But it is a symbolic setback for Mr. Sunak and suggests that the Lords may try to amend the broader legislation, the so-called safety of Rwanda bill, which they are scheduled to start debating next week. It may also strengthen future legal challenges by asylum seekers against their deportation to the African country.
The Conservative government’s Rwanda plan would mean that anyone arriving by small boat or other “irregular means” could not claim asylum in Britain. Instead, those asylum seekers would be detained and then sent to Rwanda. Their asylum cases would be heard in the African country, and they would be resettled there.
By threatening asylum seekers with deportation to Rwanda, Mr. Sunak hopes to deter people from making the dangerous crossing of the English Channel. But so far, despite Britain’s having paid 240 million pounds, about $300 million, to the Rwandan government, nobody has been put on a plane to the African country because of legal challenges.

ZJWJGOU10U_CDFGCI76QX577IF,‘We’re All Climate Economists Now’,By Lydia DePillisLydia DePillis attended three days of back-to-back paper presentations to absorb the latest economics research.,"Jan. 23, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/economy/climate-change-economics.html,"In early January in San Antonio, dozens of Ph.D. economists packed into a small windowless room in the recesses of a Grand Hyatt to hear brand-new research on the hottest topic of their annual conference: how climate change is affecting everything.
The papers in this session focused on the impact of natural disasters on mortgage risk, railway safety and even payday loans. Some attendees had to stand in the back, as the seats had already been filled. It wasn’t an anomaly.
Nearly every block of time at the Allied Social Science Associations conference — a gathering of dozens of economics-adjacent academic organizations recognized by the American Economic Association — had multiple climate-related presentations to choose from, and most appeared similarly popular.
For those who have long focused on environmental issues, the proliferation of climate-related papers was a welcome development. “It’s so nice to not be the crazy people in the room with the last session,” said Avis Devine, an associate professor of real estate finance and sustainability at York University in Toronto, emerging after a lively discussion.
The conference, which is among the economics profession’s biggest, tends to be a distillation of what the field is fixated on at any given moment, and there’s plenty of evidence that on the heels of the hottest year in recorded history, climate is in the spotlight.
There were papers on the local economic impact of wind turbine manufacturing, the stability of electricity grids as they absorb more renewable energy, the effect of electric vehicles on housing choices, how wildfire smoke strains household finances. Others analyzed the benefits of a sea wall for flood risk in Venice, the economic drag of uncertainty about climate policy, the flow of migrants displaced by extreme weather, how banks are exposed to emissions regulations and the impact of higher temperatures on factory productivity — just to name a few.

ZM3BIZQ4EY_G2Q2CF3NSFG7BOU,Fierce Storm Sends Flights Bound for One Country to Another,By Amanda Holpuch and Remy Tumin,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240122,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/world/europe/storm-isha-flight-delays-britain.html,"A powerful storm diverted dozens of flights in Britain and Ireland on Sunday and Monday, sending passengers to Germany, France and northern Britain, and stranding some at airports overnight.
At Dublin Airport, 166 flights were canceled Sunday night, another 29 flights were canceled on Monday, 36 flights were diverted to other airports and 34 aircraft performed what are known as “go-arounds,” or aborted landings, according to the airport.
Despite the flight chaos, the airport was open and operational on both Sunday and Monday, Graeme McQueen, a spokesman for Dublin Airport, said in a statement to The New York Times. Winds from the storm, named Isha, eased overnight on Sunday and changed to a more favorable westerly direction to allow “for a smooth first wave of flights.”
transcript
Oh, she’s up. She’s down. She’s gone. Oh, big power up there. See? Altitude is your friend. Speed is also your friend in these conditions. Oh, go around.
The storm’s wind challenged flight crews, with gusts between 70 and 75 miles per hour in the south of England and Ireland, Steve Fox, the head of network operations at NATS, which provides air traffic control services in Britain, said in a statement on Monday. In the north, gusts were more than 90 m.p.h.
Mr. Fox said that aircraft that could not land safely were diverted to other airports.
“Yesterday, because the storm blanketed the whole country, we alerted airlines that their normal diversion airfield might not be available and they should plan to potentially have to divert further afield,” he said, adding that flights were diverted to destinations that were “least affected” and still had space available “at the pilot’s critical decision point.”

ZSOY8DKW0X_DD0U5LF7NLWP7F7,Norman Jewison Was a Versatile Director. These 6 Films Show His Range.,By Esther Zuckerman,"Jan. 22, 2024",20240123,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/movies/norman-jewison-streaming-guide-moonstruck.html,"The oeuvre of director Norman Jewison, who died this past weekend at the age of 97, can’t be simply categorized. His versatility was rarely matched by any of his peers. He made epic musicals like “Fiddler on the Roof,” heart-stirring romantic comedies like “Moonstruck” and tense social thrillers like “In the Heat of the Night.” Over his decades in Hollywood, he directed everything from the Cold War comedy “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming” (1966) to the sexy heist feature “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968) to the based-on-a-true-story drama “The Hurricane” (1999). While the divergent tones could imply that Jewison was something of a journeyman, instead he brought a humanity to every story he touched, treating each one, regardless of subject matter, with the grace it deserved. Here are some films of his available to stream, no matter your mood.
‘Send Me No Flowers’ (1964)
Early in his career, when Jewison was under contract with Universal, he made the last of the three Doris Day and Rock Hudson comedies, “Send Me No Flowers.” In a divergence from the pair’s earlier collaborations, this one finds them not as warring city dwellers but as a married suburban couple who undergoes a crisis when the husband, George Kimball (Hudson), a hypochondriac, begins to think he’s going to die. Without telling his wife, Judy Kimball (Day), George goes about trying to make sure she is set for when he dies, including finding her a new man to marry when he’s gone. Naturally, misunderstandings ensue. It’s a classically zany rom-com from the era, but the film also shows Day and Hudson at their most vulnerable as they untangle all these complications. It’s a sign of what was to come from Jewison, who always found the emotional core of his characters and allowed actors to do some of their best work.
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
‘In the Heat of the Night’ (1967)
From the very first moment of “In the Heat of the Night,” a close-up of a fly crawling across a calendar, there’s an unsettling air to Jewison’s film about a Black police officer, Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier). He first is wrongfully accused of a murder in small-town Sparta, Miss., and then is tasked with solving the crime. Poitier’s forceful delivery of the line “They call me Mister Tibbs” — a declaration of his personhood in the face of racist dehumanization — is perhaps what’s best remembered from this Oscar winner for Best Picture. But it’s a towering film in every respect, a document of the insidiousness at the heart of places like Sparta and in American culture in general. Jewison’s careful framing of Poitier makes sure he’s the most dominant person in every scene, even as the shadows of this nasty place encroach on him.
Stream on Prime Video.
‘Fiddler on the Roof’ (1971)
Norman Jewison, despite his last name, was not Jewish. It was a common misunderstanding throughout his youth, and he was bullied by classmates nonetheless. Jewison, however, would go on to make one of the classic Jewish films with the adaptation of the Broadway musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” which tells the story of Tevye the milkman and his family, as a pogrom approaches their village of Anatevka.
Jewison brought a painterly quality to the landscapes of the movie, once telling The New York Times that he “tried work in the colors of Chagall,” referencing the artist Marc Chagall. Anatevka is rendered in earthy tones — a sunset has never looked more vivid than the one behind the film’s protagonist. When Tevye speaks to the camera, the breaking of the fourth wall feels like a warm invitation rather than a cheesy cinematic convention. In choosing the Israeli actor Chaim Topol to play Tevye over Zero Mostel, who had played the role on Broadway, Jewison eschewed star power in favor of an actor who he felt would make the audience travel back in time.

ZT7LABP3FL_98KATH3NGOYOCG9,The Enduring Appeal of Britain’s Posh Young Things,By Calum Marsh,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/arts/television/made-in-chelsea-reality-tv.html,"In late 2010, on the verge of signing a contract to appear on a new reality TV series about fashionable young people in one of London’s wealthiest boroughs, Ollie Locke, then 23, had a moment of hesitation.
Locke — with his glossy hair falling past his shoulders, Queen’s English and predilection for wearing designer shirts open to the sternum — worried that he might be depicted as garish, affluent, out of touch with the common man. He voiced his concerns to an executive, Locke recalled in a recent interview, who reassured him by explaining that it was basically out of his control: The show could make Locke appear that way only if he already had those attributes.
When “Made in Chelsea” premiered in the spring of 2011, Locke had a starring role among a coterie of chic socialities. The show was a stylized observational documentary in the style of MTV’s “The Hills,” and a consciously upper-class counterpoint to “The Only Way Is Essex.” — “Made in Chelsea” followed Locke and his circle as they navigated the often tumultuous ups and downs of friendships and relationships, all while dining at London’s swankiest restaurants, sipping cocktails at exclusive nightclubs and cheering on polo matches.
The formula has been an enduring success. “Made in Chelsea” is one of Britain’s longest-running reality TV programs; it has had dozens of seasons over the past 13 years and has ranked among the top unscripted programs on its home channel, E4, every year since its debut, even as it has gently changed with the times.
“It’s amazing,” Locke said in a recent video interview from a resort in Barbados, “because we didn’t think it was going to work at the beginning. We thought it would be kind of a funny show that people would laugh at for six months and then move on with their lives.”

ZYU443JWQD_4BND7BQCXRGS1LJ,Pennsylvania Governor Proposes to Overhaul the State University System,By Stephanie Saul,"Jan. 26, 2024",20240126,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/us/politics/pennsylvania-governor-proposes-to-overhaul-the-state-university-system.html,"Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who has complained that his state’s higher education “isn’t working,” proposed on Friday a sweeping overhaul of the state’s sprawling college and university system that would reduce tuition for many students and determine funding for individual schools based in part on their performance.
The plan would consolidate 10 of Pennsylvania’s state universities and all 15 of its community colleges under one governance umbrella, boost state funding for public higher education, and allow students with low to middle incomes to pay only $1,000 a semester in tuition.
Most of the plan would not affect Pennsylvania’s best-known public universities, including Penn State, Pittsburgh and Temple.
“After 30 years of disinvestment, too many of our colleges and universities are running on empty, and not enough students have affordable pathways into good jobs,” Mr. Shapiro said in a statement.
Plans for the overhaul have been under development for nearly a year by a working group formed by the governor, who complained publicly shortly after taking office in 2023 about problems in the state’s higher education system.
Competition among state-funded universities, he said last year, was creating a negative effect, with “colleges competing with one another for a limited dollar, duplicating degree programs, driving up costs and actually reducing access.”

ZZFQUTID57_LSJRQ241SPIF2WC,Friday Briefing: Will North Korea Attack?,By Justin Porter,"Jan. 28, 2024, 6:00 a.m. ET",20240125,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/briefing/north-korea-gaza-cease-fire-south-korea-lawmaker-attacked.html,"North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, could take some form of lethal military action against South Korea in the coming months after having shifted his policy to one of open hostility, U.S. officials say.
The officials have assessed that Kim’s recent declarations have been more aggressive than previous statements and should be taken seriously, but U.S. agencies have not detected concrete signs that North Korea is gearing up for combat or a major war.
Kim could carry out strikes in a way he thinks would avoid rapid escalation, U.S. officials said, such as when the North shelled a South Korean island in 2010. The two sides exchanged artillery fire, resulting in the reported deaths of troops on both sides and of civilians in the South, but both militaries soon stopped.
The Biden administration has been trying since 2021 to persuade North Korea to engage in diplomacy. But, one former intelligence analyst said, Kim felt betrayed and humiliated by Donald Trump during the failed diplomacy of 2019.
Background: On Wednesday, the North fired several cruise missiles from its west coast into the sea, the South Korean military said. On Jan. 14, Kim’s government said that it had tested a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile with a hypersonic warhead. And on Jan. 5, his military shelled waters near South Korean islands. Kim also abandoned a longtime official goal of peaceful reunification with South Korea, the state news media announced on Jan. 16.
