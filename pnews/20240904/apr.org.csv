0LRPQ6R6MN_KKWV8JZRXIGY5MB,Ukraine's foreign minister submits resignation as Russian strikes kill 7 in Lviv,By The Associated Press,"Published September 4, 2024 at 4:13 AM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-04/ukraines-foreign-minister-submits-resignation-as-russian-strikes-kill-7-in-lviv,"KYIV, Ukraine — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, one of Ukraine's most recognizable faces on the international stage, submitted his resignation on Wednesday before an expected Cabinet reshuffle. Russian strikes, meanwhile, killed at least seven people in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, a day after one of the deadliest missile attacks since the war began.
Kuleba, 43, didn't give a reason for stepping down and his resignation will be discussed by lawmakers at their next session, parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said on his Facebook page. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated that a Cabinet reshuffle was imminent last week as he tries to strengthen the government 2½ years into the war.
During Russia’s war in Ukraine, Kuleba has been second only to Zelenskyy in carrying Ukraine’s message and needs to an international audience, whether through social media posts or meetings with foreign dignitaries. In July, Kuleba became the highest-ranking Ukrainian official to visit China since Russia’s full-scale invasion started in February 2022. He has been foreign minister since March 2020.
More than half the current Cabinet will undergo changes, said Davyd Arakhamiia, a leader of Zelenskyy’s party in the Ukrainian parliament. Ministers will be resigning on Wednesday and new appointments will be made Thursday, he said.
Russian attacks, meanwhile, killed at least seven people and wounded 35 others in an overnight strike on Lviv, Mayor Andrii Sadovyi said Wednesday morning. A child and a medical worker were among the dead and others are in critical condition, he said.
An overnight strike also wounded five people in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown, regional head Serhii Lysak said Wednesday morning.
Zelenskyy reacted to the attacks by urging Ukraine's allies to give Kyiv “more range” to use Western weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory.
The attack happened a day after two ballistic missiles blasted a military academy and nearby hospital in Poltava in Ukraine, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 200 others, Ukrainian officials said, in one of the deadliest Russian strikes since the war began.
The missiles tore into the heart of the Poltava Military Institute of Communication’s main building, causing several stories to collapse.
The missiles hit shortly after an air-raid alert sounded, when many people were on their way to a bomb shelter, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said, describing the strike Tuesday as “barbaric.”
Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border.
The attack happened as Ukrainian forces sought to carve out their holdings in Russia’s Kursk border region after a surprise Ukrainian incursion that began Aug. 6 and as the Russian army hacks its way deeper into eastern Ukraine.

0QZNZTH8CY_T0B9ZHGO9AC3L7T,"Pope opens Asia odyssey in Indonesia to rally Catholics, hail religious tolerance",By The Associated Press,"Published September 3, 2024 at 1:57 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-03/pope-opens-asia-odyssey-in-indonesia-to-rally-catholics-hail-religious-tolerance,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Pope Francis arrived in Indonesia on Tuesday at the start of the longest trip of his pontificate, hoping to encourage its Catholic community and celebrate the tradition of interfaith harmony in a country with the world’s largest Muslim population.
After an overnight flight from Rome, Francis was wheeled off the plane in his wheelchair and onto the tarmac for a welcoming ceremony under Jakarta’s perennial hazy, humid and polluted skies.
Two children wearing traditional clothes handed him a bouquet of vegetables, fruits, spices and flowers.
Francis planned to rest for the remainder of the day, given the rigors of an 11-day voyage zigzagging across time zones that will also take him to Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore. However, the Vatican said the 87-year-old pope would meet later Tuesday with a group of refugees, migrants and sick people at the Vatican residence in Jakarta.
His first full day of activities begins Wednesday with visits to the country’s political leaders and meetings with Indonesian clergy who are helping to fuel the growth of the Catholic Church in Asia.
1162954465  Indonesian President Joko Widodo welcomed the pope, saying in a broadcast statement that “Indonesia and the Vatican have the same commitment to fostering peace and brotherhood, as well as ensuring the welfare of humanity.”
The highlight of Francis’ first stop will be his participation Thursday in an interfaith meeting in Jakarta's iconic Istiqlal mosque with representatives of the six religions that are officially recognized in Indonesia: Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Catholicism and Protestantism.
The mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, sits across a piazza from the capital’s main Catholic cathedral, Our Lady of Assumption, and the two are so close to each another that the Muslim call to prayer can be heard during Mass.
Their proximity is not coincidental, but strongly willed as a symbol of religious freedom and tolerance that is enshrined in Indonesia’s Constitution. The buildings are also linked by an underground “Tunnel of Friendship” which Francis will visit with the grand imam, Nasaruddin Umar, before they sign a joint declaration.
While Francis will want to highlight Indonesia's tradition of religious tolerance, the country's image as a moderate Muslim nation has been undermined by flare-ups of intolerance. In 2021, a militant Islamic couple blew themselves up outside a packed Catholic cathedral on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island during a Palm Sunday Mass, injuring at least 20 people.
“We have no problem with the visit. He’s a guest and we will welcome him,” said Eldy, a 64-year-old retired government worker who uses one name and was out walking during a car-free day in Jakarta on Sunday. “He wants to visit our Istiqlal mosque, he can do it.”
Even though Catholics make up only 3% of Indonesia’s population, the sheer number of Indonesians -- 275 million -- makes the archipelago home to the third-largest Christian community in Asia, after the Philippines and China.
As a result, thousands are expected to throng to Francis’ events this week, which include a Mass on Thursday afternoon at Jakarta’s main stadium expected to draw some 60,000 people. City authorities have urged residents to work from home that day given roadblocks and crowds.
“It is a joy for our country, especially for us Catholics,” said Elisabeth Damanik, a 50-year-old housewife outside a packed Mass on Sunday at Our Lady of the Assumption. “Hopefully the pope’s visit can build religious tolerance in our beloved country of Indonesia.”
Care for the environment, conflict resolution and ethically minded economic development are the major themes for the trip, and Francis may touch on them during his main speech to Indonesian authorities on Wednesday.
Francis has made caring for the environment a hallmark of his pontificate and has often used his foreign visits to press his agenda on the need to care for God’s creation, prevent exploitation of its natural resources and protect poor people who are bearing the brunt of climate extremes and pollution.
In Jakarta, he will find a metropolis of 11.3 million people choking under gray clouds of air pollution caused by coal-fired power plants, vehicle exhaust, trash burning and factories. Jakarta’s air pollution regularly registers eight to nine times above World Health Organization limits.
“Indonesia has the worst air pollution in Southeast Asia,” said Piotr Jakubowski, an air pollution expert and co-founder of Indonesian air quality monitoring company Nafas. “The visit of the pope is great because it provides a sounding board ... from another, very well-respected world leader.""
Residents, too, hope Francis will speak out about the issue.
“The pollution in Jakarta is at an alarming level. That’s why the presence of the pope can provide a benefit with the discussion of environmental issues,” said government worker Erik Sebastian Naibaho, 26.
Francis is the third pope to visit Indonesia after Pope Paul VI in 1970 and St. John Paul II in 1989. Their attention underscores Indonesia’s importance to the Vatican both in terms of Christian-Muslim dialogue and Catholic vocations, since it is home to the world’s largest seminary and produces hundreds of priests and other religious workers a year.
“Indonesia is trying to grow in the faith,” said Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, the archbishop of Jakarta whom Francis made a cardinal in 2019.
At a briefing last week, he said Francis wanted to express his appreciation for Indonesia’s interfaith tradition “and encourage this kind of brotherhood to continue to be maintained and developed.

1D5CXUNAYV_QHK8OE9Q5CMXI19,Israeli boy who broke an ancient jar learns how the museum is piecing it back together,By The Associated Press,"Published September 3, 2024 at 8:34 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-09-03/israeli-boy-who-broke-an-ancient-jar-learns-how-the-museum-is-piecing-it-back-together,"HAIFA, Israel — As her 4-year-old son perused the Israeli museum's ancient artifacts, Anna Geller looked away for just a moment. Then a crash sounded, a rare 3,500-year-old jar was broken on the ground, and her son stood over it, aghast.
""It was just a distraction of a second,"" said Geller, a mother of three from the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. ""And the next thing I know, it's a very big boom boom behind me.""
The Bronze Age jar that her son, Ariel Geller, broke last week, has been on display at the Hecht Museum in Haifa for 35 years. It was one of the only containers of its size and from that period still complete when it was discovered. It was likely used to hold wine or oil, and dates back to between 2200 and 1500 B.C.
What could be considered every parent's worst nightmare became a learning experience Friday, as the Geller family returned to the museum, which is associated with Haifa University in northern Israel. Ariel gifted the museum a clay vase of his own and was met with forgiving staff and curators.
Alex Geller said Ariel — the youngest of his three children — is exceptionally curious, and that the moment he heard the crash last Friday, ""please let that not be my child"" was the first thought that raced through his head.
""I'm embarrassed,"" said Anna Geller, who said she tried desperately to calm her son down after the vase shattered. ""He told me he just wanted to see what was inside.""
The jar was one of many artifacts exhibited out in the open, part of the Hecht Museum's vision of letting visitors explore history without glass barriers, said Inbar Rivlin, the director of the museum.
She said she wanted to use the restoration as an educational opportunity and to make sure the Gellers — who curtailed their initial museum visit soon after Ariel broke the jar last week — felt welcome to return.
Nahariya, where the family lives, is in an area just south of Israel's border with Lebanon that has come under Hezbollah rocket fire for more than 10 months, in a conflict linked to the war in Gaza. The family has been visiting museums and taking day trips around Israel this summer to escape the tensions, Alex Geller said.
There were a lot of kids at the museum that day, and he said when he heard the crash he prayed that the damage had been caused by someone else. When he turned around and saw it was his son, he was ""in complete shock.""
He went over to the security guards to let them know what had happened in hopes that it was a model and not a real artifact. The father even offered to pay for the damage.
""But they called and said it was insured and after they checked the cameras and saw it wasn't vandalism they invited us back for a make-up visit,"" Alex Geller said.
Experts were using 3D technology and high-resolution videos to restore the jar, which could be back on display as soon as next week.
""That's what's actually interesting for my older kids, this process of how they're restoring it, and all the technology they're using there,"" Alex Geller said.
Roee Shafir, a restoration expert at the museum, said the repairs would be fairly simple, as the pieces were from a single, complete jar. Archaeologists often face the more daunting task of sifting through piles of shards from multiple objects and trying to piece them together.
Shafir, who was painstakingly reassembling the jar, said the artifacts should remain accessible to the public, even if accidents happen because touching an artifact can inspire a deeper interest in history and archaeology.
""I like that people touch. Don't break, but to touch things, it's important,"" he said.

2M5LPNJSTQ_R4DDC9SBGHETBM4,"Titanic research dive reveals discovery, decay and new photos","By Scott Detrow,","Published September 2, 2024 at 8:00 AM CDT",20240902,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-02/titanic-research-dive-reveals-discovery-decay-and-new-photos,"More than a century after the Titanic sank, the wreck is still offering up new discoveries to researchers.
This summer, RMS Titanic, Inc. — the salvor-in-possession of the wreck — made its first unmanned dive to the site in 14 years. The expedition was armed with high-resolution cameras and scanning equipment, and took more than two million photos of the Titanic.
The goal was to image the wreck in the highest quality possible, and also to seek out artifacts for future recovery expeditions.
James Penca is a researcher with the company, and he joined the nearly month-long expedition earlier this summer. He spoke with All Things Considered host Scott Detrow about the finds — and the losses — that the team discovered.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.


Scott Detrow: Your group is the official company that explores and preserves artifacts from the Titanic. And this is not the group's first expedition, it's been down there several times. What was distinct about this particular recent mission?
James Penca: We haven't been to the wreck since 2010. It's been 14 years. So 14 years of technology, as we all know, is quite advanced from what we had back in 2010. What we were able to take down there, the cameras and the scanners, would make 2010’s expedition look like child's play in terms of what we were able to learn from the wreck.
Detrow: What did it feel like? What was that moment like for you the first time that you saw the wreck?
Penca: I have been a hopeless Titanic enthusiast since I was six years old, and it never ceased to amaze me that I was that close to the wreck. Seeing the first images of the ship on a screen, it was emotional. There were a lot of tears in the room for a lot of us, even the people who've been there before.
Detrow: Let's talk about some of the discoveries that were made on this trip. I understand there were some exciting ones and there were some bittersweet ones. Let's start with the exciting.
Penca: On this expedition, we weren't recovering, but we were looking out for artifacts for future recovery. And there was one artifact at the top of our list. It was a bronze statue about two feet tall, known as the Diana of Versailles. This statue sat in the first class lounge aboard Titanic, and this statue was the centerpiece of that elegant room. The trouble with this artifact is, it has been photographed only one time, in 1986. So, to find this statue to us would be one of the great achievements of this expedition, but the odds of finding it, it's truly a needle in a haystack that is two-and-a-half miles underwater in pitch black darkness. After many trials and errors, we did manage to find Diana and take her first photos in 38 years, and we found her with just hours remaining in the expedition.
Detrow: So on one hand, high profile aspects of the wreck have been found and remain shockingly the same. But on the other hand, there was some evidence you gathered that some of the iconic aspects of the ship may be collapsing.
Penca: Yeah, so everyone knows the famous James Cameron film, the “I'm flying,” scene, you know, “I’m the king of the world.” [That] scene all took place on Titanic's iconic prow at the very, very point of the ship. We discovered when we reached the wreck last month that the port side railing has fallen off. This is a very natural thing, different parts of the railing are getting weaker. But for such a high-profile and highly photographed and iconic railing to now be resting on the ocean floor below, it's a significant change. Titanic will literally never look the same.
Detrow: There have been many shipwrecks throughout history. There have been many high-profile tragedies. There have been many of those things that have become big blockbuster movies. But there's something different about Titanic. What do you think it is that attracts people's imaginations in this way, yours or others?
Penca: You know, we are storytellers. We love a good story. And I would put Titanic's life and loss up against any great story, any Hollywood film, any great novel, a war story. Every single element of it lined up as if it was written for a Hollywood film. It is truly too good to be true. But, the more you dive into Titanic, the more true it becomes.

2R7U25GJQ5_DKA2T66WHEU37IX,Trump Jan. 6 case gets its first hearing since the Supreme Court's immunity ruling,By Carrie Johnson,"Published September 5, 2024 at 4:05 AM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-05/trump-jan-6-case-gets-its-first-hearing-since-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling,"Lawyers for the Justice Department and former President Donald Trump are set to appear in federal court in Washington on Thursday for what could be the final hearing in his election interference case before the November election.
This year, voters will decide the race for the presidency — and, by extension, whether Trump will ever face justice on charges that he led overlapping conspiracies to try to cling to power.
A D.C. grand jury indictment accused Trump of actions that culminated in the violent siege at the U.S. Capitol in early 2021. If he regains the White House, Trump is expected to direct new Justice Department leaders to drop the landmark case.
Trump will not appear in person at the courthouse, steps away from the Capitol crime scene. Instead, he's scheduled to give a midday campaign speech at the Economic Club of New York. He has authorized his lawyers to plead not guilty to ""each and every count"" in a new superseding indictment from special counsel Jack Smith.
Trump said in a court filing this week that he has reviewed the four felony charges with his attorneys, Todd Blanche and John Lauro.
The task ahead for U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is not an easy one. The conservative Supreme Court supermajority gave Trump and future presidents blanket immunity for actions at the core of presidential powers.


Last week, prosecutors retooled the allegations against Trump, scrapping language that mentioned his bid to use the Justice Department to advance phony claims of election fraud. They also removed references to what top Justice Department and White House officials told Trump about the 2020 presidential election, to steer the case toward Trump's role as a political candidate and not as a political officeholder.
""It's still not an enviable task to try to sort through the court's decision and decide how that applies to each little item of evidence that might come in at the trial,"" said George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason.
The judge has directed Trump and the special counsel team to identify areas where they agree about how to proceed. But there's virtually no common ground, a point underscored by their late-night court filing the Friday before Labor Day weekend.
Prosecutors said they want to start with the core issue of presidential immunity. They've signaled they believe the immunity described by the Supreme Court majority ""does not apply"" to the new indictment or to ""additional unplead categories of evidence the Government intends to introduce at trial and will proffer in its brief.""
If Chutkan agrees, ""there could be a lot of allegations coming out in the next couple of months about what's the proof at trial,"" said Eliason, the GWU law professor.


Trump, on the other hand, has asked the judge to smash the brakes on the immunity issue until after the polls close in November. His lawyers said they want to file court papers arguing that the special counsel was appointed in an unconstitutional manner, which could lead to the dismissal of the entire case.
""The superseding indictment is an effort to respond to the direct instructions of the Supreme Court as to how to effectuate a new indictment in an ongoing case,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said. ""The special counsel is required by the regulations to follow the policies of the Justice Department, including the election sensitivities policies, and I'm quite confident he did so.""
Perhaps the biggest legal fight ahead will be the role of then-Vice President Mike Pence in any future trial. Trump is charged with leaning on Pence to delay the electoral count on Jan. 6, 2021, as rioters screamed “Hang Mike Pence” outside the Capitol.
Pence has declined to endorse Trump for reelection, and he did not appear at the Republican National Convention this summer.
The Supreme Court found that Trump may be ""at least presumptively immune from prosecution"" for the pressure campaign against Pence. And Trump's attorneys said those allegations are ""foundational"" to the new superseding indictment, requiring that it be dismissed.
Prosecutors took pains in the new indictment to point out that Pence had been acting in his role as president of the Senate on Jan. 6, 2021 — and that “the Defendant had no official responsibilities related to the certification proceeding, but he did have a personal interest as a candidate in being named the winner of the election.""

35OUAI5N92_EOGPS5H7DJNYTUC,5 takeaways from Germany's regional elections after far right makes historic gains,By Rob Schmitz,"Published September 2, 2024 at 5:38 AM CDT",20240902,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-02/5-takeaways-from-germanys-regional-elections-after-far-right-makes-historic-gains,"BERLIN — Voters in two states in eastern Germany have delivered a far-right party its best result since World War II. The outcome of Sunday's elections in the states of Thüringen and Saxony has political observers worried about a resurgence of anti-immigrant, nationalist, populist politics in Germany and Europe.
Here are five takeaways from the elections:


The Alternative for Germany, known by the German initials AfD, a nationalist party that routinely blames immigrants for many of Germany’s problems, has been around for 11 years. It rose in prominence six years ago after former Chancellor Angela Merkel allowed more than a million migrants from war-torn countries in the Middle East to resettle in Germany.
The AfD has become so notorious that it’s been placed under domestic surveillance for the threat that it poses to Germany’s constitution. Despite this, the party won the most seats in the election in Thüringen, with nearly a third of parliament (32.8%), and it nearly won the most seats in Saxony, with more than 30% of the vote.


German voters are becoming increasingly frustrated by a wave of migrants arriving in the country in recent years, especially now that Germany’s economy has stagnated.
This frustration peaked last month when a Syrian man stabbed to death three people and injured several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen.
After the attack, it was discovered that the man was supposed to have been deported months ago, and it led to growing anger about Germany’s immigration system.


That’s because every other party in Germany has refused to enter into a coalition government with the AfD.
Still, the nationalist, Russia-friendly party could end up with enough seats in both states to block decisions requiring a two-thirds vote, such as the appointment of judges and top security officials.


The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, known as BSW, a party centered on a popular former communist party politician, won more than 15% of seats in Thüringen and more than 11% of seats in Saxony’s parliament, just eight months after the party was founded.
Like the AfD, the leftist party also advocates tightening immigration into Germany and opposes support for Ukraine, wanting a diplomatic solution to that country's war with Russia. The BSW’s strong showing is bad news for Germany’s Social Democrats, the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which could see more left-leaning voters drawn away from the party.


Perhaps most interesting is that the three parties in power on a national level — the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and the libertarian Free Democratic Party — all suffered big losses in these state elections, and it underscores how unpopular they’ve become with voters not only in the former East Germany, but nationally as well.
It's clear that in the next national election, the country will make a shift to the right. That will mean stricter immigration rules and a bigger focus on growing Germany’s stagnant economy. This is a trend playing out in other parts of Europe, too — namely France, where a strong showing by a right-wing party there has yet to produce a new government.

""She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went- she became a Black person,"" Trump said, falsely characterizing the way Harris has spoken about her biracial background.
This is nothing new, Senna explains: ""He's articulating the relationship of America to mixed race people and the hostility, the suspicion and the kind of bewilderment with which we've been faced with, historically.”
Senna's mother, who is white, is from a prominent Boston family. Her father, who is Black, grew up in an orphanage in a small Alabama town. Senna has explored her own racial identity in both fiction and in the memoir, Where Did You Sleep Last Night? She notes that when she was born in 1970, ""there was no 'mixed-race' category.""
""You were either going to identify as white ... or you were going to identify as Black,"" she says. ""And there was no doubt in my mind or my family's mind that I was going to identify as Black. ... My father … really wanted to impress upon us our Black identity.""
Senna's new novel, Colored Television, tells the story of a writer named Jane who's devastated when the book she's been working on for 10 years — a novel about how the meaning of being biracial has changed over generations — is rejected by her publisher. Without publication, Jane won't get tenure at the university where she teaches, which means not having enough money to get by. The only solution she sees is to pitch an idea for a TV series.
""Some of my impulse to be a writer comes from that feeling that I want to write myself into existence,"" Senna says. ""I want to write the worlds that I've lived in, and the people I've been in the world with, into existence because I never see them.""



On her parents getting married in 1968, one year after the Supreme Court's landmark Loving v. Virginia  decision
They were part of a whole wave of the first marriages to come out of this huge political change. Their marriage was filled with all this symbolism and hope for the future and the sort of integration of American society and the kind of movement beyond these incredibly strict laws of segregation. ...
What it meant was also that I grew up with ... other mixed people around me who were also born out of the exact same moment in the exact same political movement. And so I've never been able to kind of separate the politics of the moment in which I was born from the personal, like those things are so intertwined for me, and the history is so clear.
On whether her parents saw their marriage as a political statement
I don't think that you could be a white woman of a certain class — my mother's a blond, blue-eyed, white woman who grew up the daughter of a Harvard professor in Cambridge and has this lineage that goes back to the earliest Americans, and also the slave-trading Americans — I don't think you could be her and marry a Black man without that seeming like an incredibly potent political gesture at that time. And then there was the class issue of my father being first from an orphanage and then from a very poor family in the South and then the housing projects in Boston. ... For him to marry someone of my mother's background was a huge class leap and ... crossing all sorts of lines.
I think people ... Black and white people get married nowadays and it's so common and can be sort of seen as ""We just fell in love,"" but at that time you were really breaking all of those laws, even those that had already been dismantled were still in place in people's minds. I remember my mother went to the courthouse to get some paperwork for the marriage and in Boston, where interracial couples hadn't been illegal at that time ... [and] the woman said to her, ""Wait, I have to go in the back and see if this is legal that you two are getting married."" And there were constant experiences that we had in the world that really brought home to all of us that we were a radical statement in the culture as a family. Just merely existing as a family was a radical statement at that time.
On how publishers reacted to her writing about biracial people
When I first started publishing was in the ‘90s with my first novel [Caucasia], and there really wasn't anything like that. And that was a novel about a young girl of mixed race and racial passing. I had, like, eight rejections from agents when I first sent it out. And they would say, ""This is too specific. … I don't recognize this family, and I don't understand this character's identity, and they're strange to me."" And finally, I found an agent who really loved it and sold it.
When I published that book, it was met with a lot of acclaim. And I had this really great experience in terms of my first novel. But one of the things I kept hearing from publishers was. ""Don't do this again. Don't keep writing about mixed-ness,"" like, ""It's time to graduate on to something new and just leave that behind."" And, it was almost as if they thought that mixed-ness was a plot and not a world and not a people, not a geography. ...
And I find that so interesting, because I never hear people say that to white authors who write about, say, a particular world of white people. And I actually don't hear it as much about Black authors who write about Blackness or Black worlds or race. But when I write about my people, it's considered somehow ... a ""very special episode"" that I shouldn't do again. I think part of the reason that I find that so telling is that it's that idea that you're a predicament. You're not a world. I think of it as: This is the world I write from. This is the geography and the culture that I write from, and it's interracial America, it's mulatto America.
On why she uses the term “mulatto”
I use the word mulatto a lot in my work, and I have sort of rejected the more politically correct term of ""biracial"" or ""multiracial,"" mainly because it's meaningless and vague, and it could describe any two or three mixes that one could be. But mulatto — as problematic as the word is, and it comes out of slavery and the sort of pseudoscientific ideas of race, as problematic as it is — it's the only word that really describes this very specific experience of being Black and white and being that mixture in America, which is, singular, and I think an important distinction from the other mixes.
On how writing for television compares to writing novels
I wrote a pilot for a show that was based on my work. I wrote an original pilot for a limited series that is still out there being shopped around. … What I felt writing scripts is, I really like it. It's very interesting and sort of technical-feeling compared to writing novels. And I will continue to do it because it's a nice break between books, and it kind of can pay … to get a new stove in your kitchen, like there's actual financial benefits to doing it. But I think my soul is in the page and in writing novels. Being in control of the entire universe that I'm writing is really what feeds me on a much deeper level. And so I will never kind of fully abandon the written word. It just feeds me in a whole other way, but unfortunately doesn't literally feed me or my children.

Hossein Shanbehzadeh, a longtime critic of Iran’s leadership, was active on social media, supporting political prisoners and the removal of mandatory headscarves for women. He was sent to prison in 2019 for his online comments insulting Khamenei. He later wrote about the experience, including being flogged, according to Voice of America.
In early June, 35-year-old Shanbehadeh was arrested in Ardabil, northwestern Iran. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, he told his family he wasn’t sure why he was arrested, but it came shortly after he posted the response to Khamenei’s tweet, which showed the Iranian leader with the country’s national volleyball team.
The Islamic Republic's security forces on Tuesday arrested Iranian blogger, writer and proofreader Hossein Shanbehzadeh who, last month, posted a single dot in reply to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's tweet, and that comment was liked far more than Khamenei's original tweet.… pic.twitter.com/P4Bram1nr6
Shanbehzadeh’s post received far more “likes” than Khamenei’s original tweet, according to Iran International English.
Shanbehzadeh is just the latest activist to be caught up in the hard-line government’s crackdown on critics. Iran watchers say the leadership has felt insecure about the high level of dissent in the country for a while. Artists, playwrights, directors and others are also being swept up and given long prison sentences. In late April, Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi was handed the death sentence for his antigovernment videos.
Shanbehzadeh was sentenced to five years for alleged pro-Israel propaganda activity, four years for insulting Islamic sanctities, two years for spreading lies online and an additional year for anti-regime propaganda.
His lawyer, Amir Raisian, told Shargh Network, a reformist newspaper in Iran, that he would appeal the verdict, especially the accusation of pro-Israel activity. The prosecutor’s office in Ardabil alleged that Shanbehzadeh had been in contact with Israeli intelligence officers and was arrested when trying to leave the country, according to Voice of America.

5E54MFPJBK_TM26PHLDFDCFI4Y,U.S. charges Hamas leaders with terrorism over October attack in Israel,By Ryan Lucas,"Published September 3, 2024 at 5:01 PM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-03/u-s-charges-hamas-leaders-with-terrorism-over-october-attack-in-israel,"The Justice Department announced terrorism charges against six Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the group’s deadly Oct. 7 attack against Israel.
The other defendants named in the criminal complaint unsealed on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan are Ismail Haniyeh, Mohammad al-Masri, Marwan Issa, Khaled Meshaal and Ali Baraka. Three of the defendants—Haniyeh, Issa and Masri, who is also known as Mohammed Deif—have been killed in recent months.
The Hamas leaders face seven counts, including conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, conspiracy to bomb a place of public use resulting in death.
A DOJ official said in a statement on background that the charges were filed under seal on Feb. 1, in order to be ready to take Haniyeh into custody if needed. But after Haniyeh’s death and other recent developments in the region, the seal was no longer necessary, the official said.
“Today, the Justice Department unsealed charges against Yahya Sinwar and other senior leaders of Hamas for financing and directing a decades-long campaign to murder American citizens and endanger the security of the United States,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a video statement. “The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas’ operations. These actions will not be our last.”
Garland mentioned the recent news that six hostages held by Hamas, including U.S. citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin, had been killed.
He said the Justice Department is investigating Goldberg-Polin’s murder, as well as the killings of other Americans by Hamas.

5NPKIUHRIP_5P0UJ0Q52SSBEJ5,China is pushing divisive political messages online using fake U.S. voters,By Shannon Bond,"Published September 3, 2024 at 5:00 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-03/china-is-pushing-divisive-political-messages-online-using-fake-u-s-voters,"A long-running Chinese influence operation is posing as American voters on social media in an attempt to exacerbate social divisions ahead of the 2024 presidential election, according to a new report from the research company Graphika.
The push by the campaign known as “Spamouflage” includes accounts claiming to be American voters and U.S. soldiers. They posted about hot-button topics including reproductive rights, homelessness, U.S. support for Ukraine, and American policy toward Israel. They criticized President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as well as former President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, and sometimes used artificial intelligence tools to create content.
The group of fake accounts Graphika identified is small — 15 accounts on X (formerly known as Twitter), one on TikTok, as well as a persona impersonating a U.S. news outlet across platforms. They claimed to be U.S. citizens or U.S.-focused activists “frustrated by American politics and the West,” the report said. With the exception of one TikTok video, they didn’t gain much traction with real users online.
Still, the activity underscores how China is “engaging in these more advanced deceptive behaviors and directly targeting these organic but hyper-sensitive social rifts” as part of a broader effort “to portray the U.S. as this declining global power with weak political leadership and a failing system of governance,” said Jack Stubbs, Graphika’s chief intelligence officer.
The U.S. intelligence community said in its most recent election security update in late July that China’s influence operations “are using social media to sow divisions in the United States and portray democracies as chaotic.”
However, intelligence officials say they do not believe Beijing plans to influence the outcome of the presidential election, which may explain why the Spamouflage cluster Graphika identified targeted both Democrats and Republicans.
“Generally, the accounts were very critical of Biden, but we also saw them criticizing Trump as well, and in more recent weeks, actually increasingly targeting Kamala Harris since Biden dropped off the ticket,” Stubbs said. “It looks to us like they were attempting to build their fake identities less around an individual party or individual party candidate and more around the idea of U.S. patriotism or national pride.”
Graphika is a research company that studies social networks and online communities for companies, tech platforms, human rights organizations and universities.
The findings build on another report earlier this year from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit which studies extremism and disinformation, that uncovered four other Spamouflage accounts on X posing as supporters of Trump and the MAGA movement.
Graphika first publicly identified the Spamouflage operation in 2019. It’s grown into one of the most sprawling networks of fake accounts across the internet. It has largely focused on pushing pro-China narratives, including attacks on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, praise for China's COVID-19 response, and AI-generated news videos promoting Chinese leadership. More recently, it has also begun posting about American politics and elections. Last year, Facebook owner Meta linked the operation to Chinese law enforcement.
The accounts Graphika identified bore many hallmarks of Spamouflage activity, including coordinated posting and sharing content that has previously been linked to the operation. Some accounts occasionally slipped up and posted in Chinese. One account on X, calling itself “Common fireman,” was previously branded as a pro-China media outlet, Graphika said.
Stubbs cautioned that the cluster of accounts Graphika found is “one small sliver of this wider operation.” He noted a larger portion of the Spamouflage network is also targeting the U.S. using different types of accounts. “And then there are huge parts of the network that are targeting issues in Hong Kong, for example, or the broader Indo-Pacific, that aren't directly concerned with the upcoming U.S. election.”
While the cluster’s efforts went largely unnoticed by real people, it did strike one success. A TikTok account posing as a conservative American news outlet and social media influencer posted a video mocking Biden in July that was viewed 1.5 million times, Graphika said.
TikTok said it has taken the account down for violating its policies, as well as the other accounts Graphika identified.
""The TikTok accounts referenced in this report have been banned, and we will continue to remove deceptive accounts and harmful misinformation as we protect the integrity of our platform during the US elections,"" a TikTok spokesperson said.
The fake news outlet also has an account on X, and previously had a YouTube channel and Instagram account, both of which have been taken down.
Stubbs said it wasn’t clear why that particular video had been removed, but that occasional hits are possible with a “high volume, low impact” operation like Spamouflage.
“They’re just throwing a lot of stuff out there, and every now and then a little bit of it will stick,” he said. “But it’s probably worth noting that throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping that occasionally a piece will stick doesn't feel to be a recipe for longer term success.”

7N2KRDL47N_VBCHJHOOVGGE4TC,These Alaska moms couldn’t find a Yup’ik children’s book. So they made one themselves,By Julie Depenbrock,"Published September 4, 2024 at 2:00 PM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-09-04/these-alaska-moms-couldnt-find-a-yupik-childrens-book-so-they-made-one-themselves,"Updated September 04, 2024 at 14:59 PM ET
Nikki Corbett was desperate.
The mother and small business owner had searched online and in stores near her home in Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula, but she could not find any books to teach her young children the Yup’ik language.
Growing up, Corbett says, she was more fluent in the language – because she lived in the largely Yup’ik community of Bethel, Alaska.
“And so obviously being immersed in that, you understand more and can speak more,” Corbett says. “But being away from it – the community that I live in, it’s not a language that’s normally spoken.”
So Corbett – and her friend, Katie O’Connor, an illustrator and mother – decided to create their own Yup’ik alphabet coloring book.
In Alaska, there’s a market for primers like this.
More than 20% of the state’s population is Native. Of the estimated 21,000 Alaskans who identify as Yup’ik, nearly half speak the language.
In fact, Yup’ik is the most commonly spoken Native language in Alaska.
Corbett may have been immersed in Yup’ik culture when she was growing up in Bethel. But that’s not the case for every Alaska Native.
The subjugation of Native Americans and hostility toward Native language and culture has a lot to do with it, Corbett says.
“The younger generations, like my generation, in some of those areas, they don’t know the language because their parents were punished for speaking Yup’ik,” Corbett says. “And so I think that they were afraid to teach their children because they didn’t want their children to be punished for speaking our language.”
There are immersion schools in Alaska that have Yup’ik learning materials, but Corbett says it’s nearly impossible to find those books outside the classroom.
“If you go in the store and you see the kids section and you look at the educational material and you’ll see French or German or Spanish,” Corbett says. “Wherever those things are, we want to be able to create something similar in the Yup’ik language.”
Katie O’Connor is an Inupiaq artist based in Nome, Alaska.
Growing up, O’Connor says, she didn’t learn much about her own Inupiaq culture until after high school.
“There’s not a lot available out there. And then also, when you start digging into it, the literature, the books that are out there related to any Alaska Native culture, most of them are written by non-Native people,” O’Connor says. “Most of them are written by people who aren’t from Alaska, and some are written by people who’ve never even been to our region.”
Corbett and O’Connor, who had met at the Iditarod, teamed up and applied for a fellowship to make their book.
The result is 27 pages, each featuring a letter of the Yup’ik alphabet and illustrations celebrating Yup’ik culture and heritage.
“The letters of the Yup’ik language, they relate to something in our culture, like you won’t see a coloring book that has fry bread in it,” Corbett says. “And so it’s images from a part of who we are as Alaska Natives.”
Corbett says they have between 700 and 1,000 bulk order requests for the coloring book — including an Alaska school district.
“Our culture is so strong and our people are resilient and just to be able to, you know, it’s just a coloring book. But for us, it’s just so much more than a coloring book,” Corbett says.
Corbett and O’Connor hope to release their next coloring book in the Inupiaq language.

7P9LYPEJ94_7EMWB2O9P6N7K26,A German far-right party wins its first state election,By The Associated Press,"Published September 1, 2024 at 1:32 PM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-01/a-german-far-right-party-wins-its-first-state-election,"BERLIN — The far-right Alternative for Germany won a state election for the first time Sunday in the country's east, and was set to finish at least a very close second to mainstream conservatives in a second vote, projections showed.
A new party founded by a prominent leftist also made an immediate impact, while the parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results.
Projections for ARD and ZDF public television based on exit polls and partial counting showed Alternative for Germany winning 32-33% of the vote in Thuringia — well ahead of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, the main national opposition party, with about 24%.
In neighboring Saxony, projections put support for the CDU — which has led the state since German reunification in 1990 — at 31.7%, with AfD on 30.6-31.4%.
""An openly right-wing extremist party has become the strongest force in a state parliament for the first time since 1949, and that causes many people very deep concern and fear,"" said Omid Nouripour, a leader of the Greens, one of the national governing parties.
Other parties say they won't put AfD in power by joining it in a coalition. Even so, its strength is likely to make it extremely difficult to form new state governments, forcing the parties into exotic new coalitions. The new Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, or BSW, was seen taking up to 16% of the vote in Thuringia and 12% in Saxony, adding another level of complication.
""This is a historic success for us,"" Alice Weidel, a national co-leader of AfD, told ARD. She described the result as a ""requiem"" for Scholz's coalition.
The CDU's national general secretary, Carsten Linnemann, said his party will stick to its longstanding refusal to work with the far right. ""Voters in both states knew that we wouldn't form a coalition with AfD, and it will stay that way — we are very, very clear on this,"" he said.
Weidel denounced that as ""pure ignorance"" and said that ""voters want AfD to participate in a government.""
Deep discontent with a national government notorious for infighting, anti-immigration sentiment and skepticism toward German military aid for Ukraine are among the factors that have contributed to support for populist parties in the region, which is less prosperous than western Germany.
AfD is at its strongest in the formerly communist east, and the domestic intelligence agency has the party's branches in both Saxony and Thuringia under official surveillance as ""proven right-wing extremist"" groups. Its leader in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, has been convicted of knowingly using a Nazi slogan at political events, but is appealing.
Scholz's center-left Social Democrats were at least on course to remain in the two state legislatures with single-digit support, but the environmentalist Greens appeared set to lose their seats in Thuringia. The two parties were the junior coalition partners in both outgoing state governments. The third party in the national government, the pro-business Free Democrats, also was set to lose its seats in Thuringia. It had no representation in Saxony.
A third state election follows Sept. 22 in another eastern state, Brandenburg, currently led by Scholz's party. Germany's next national election is due in a little over a year.
Thuringia's politics are particularly complicated because the Left Party of outgoing governor Bodo Ramelow, who led a minority government, has slumped into electoral insignificance nationally. The projections showed it losing nearly two-thirds of its support compared with five years ago, dropping to around 12%.
Sahra Wagenknecht, long one of its best-known figures, left last year to form her own party, which is now outperforming the Left. Wagenknecht celebrated what she called an unprecedented success for a new party, underlined its refusal to work with AfD's Höcke and said she hopes it can form ""a good government"" with the CDU.
The CDU has long refused to work with the Left Party, descended from East Germany's ruling communists. It hasn't ruled out working with Wagenknecht's BSW — which will probably be needed to form any government without AfD at least in Thuringia. BSW is also at its strongest in the east.
AfD has tapped into high anti-immigration sentiment in the region. The Aug. 23 knife attack in the western city of Solingen in which a suspected extremist from Syria is accused of killing three people helped push the issue back to the top of Germany's political agenda, and prompted Scholz's government to announce new restrictions on knives and new measures to ease deportations.
Wagenknecht's BSW combines left-wing economic policy with an immigration-skeptic agenda. The CDU has also stepped up pressure on the national government for a tougher stance on immigration.
Germany's stance toward Russia's war in Ukraine is also a sensitive issue in the east. Berlin is Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier after the United States; those weapons deliveries are something both AfD and BSW oppose. Wagenknecht has also assailed a recent decision by the German government and the U.S. to begin deployments of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.

7URQZYG573_W9YSHHL3Y681307,"Wheelies look fun, but they're a serious skill for kids in wheelchairs",By Elizabeth Gabriel,"Published September 2, 2024 at 4:00 AM CDT",20240902,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-02/wheelies-look-fun-but-theyre-a-serious-skill-for-kids-in-wheelchairs,"Around 3.7 million wheelchair users live in the United States, each pushing themselves an average of 2,000 to 3,000 times a day. Some of that is straightforward, but wheelchair navigation sometimes includes negotiating unexpected curbs, stairs, steep hills and other obstacles— and most wheelchair users don’t have access to formal training to learn how to smoothly navigate on their own.
A unique, free program called Skills on Wheels run by Indiana University Indianapolis aims to address the gap for young people. Around 20 kids ranging from age 8 to 17, spend multiple days on campus learning how to navigate props like ramps and speed bumps. Then they take those new skills for a test run outside.
Savannah Healton, 12, has spina bifida, a neural tube defect in the spine. She needs a wheelchair, and lately, she’s been practicing how to do wheelies.
“It’s basically where you push two times, and then you pop into your wheelie,” Healton said. “So if you’re going up a curb, you can get into your wheelie so you can go up the hill or the curb or wherever you’re going.”
There’s little research about the use of wheelchairs by children, but one study shows that 75% of adults who use a wheelchair have a fear of falling. Nearly 65% reported falling out of their chair, and more than half had incidents resulting in an injury. Even without accidents, improper technique can injure muscles and nerves.
A child’s confidence can take a big hit if they don’t know how to maneuver their wheelchair or fear falling out of it, says program director and Indiana University occupational therapy researcher Tony Chase. Kids may decide to skip certain activities at school or with friends if they know there will be obstacles like narrow doors or stairs.
“We would love to change the world, and just make it all of a sudden accessible, but that's a little bit too lofty of a goal,” Chase said. “So instead, let's try to make kids more confident in navigating this inaccessible world.”
Researchers have developed a list of 33 core skills that are essential for navigating a wheelchair in a variety of environments, but kids might not learn these skills in school or in physical and occupational therapy.
Maria Fuchs, an occupational therapist volunteering with the program, said she didn’t learn much about hands-on wheelchair training during grad school.
“A lot of times wheelchair training isn’t a main focus…other things like feeding or dressing or play skills, things like that, are kind of the priority,” Fuchs said.
Kids often learn only the basics of wheelchair operation, she said, like using the wheel locks and taking the device apart, and even then only if insurance covers it.
Kerri Morgan, an occupational therapy and neurology researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, said some people’s insurance won’t reimburse them for rehab to learn how to use a wheelchair.
“There's this gap in education, [and] there's the gap in actually having the environment in the medical model where clinicians know how to justify it in their notes, so that health insurance pays for it,” Morgan said.
Morgan said it’s common for wheelchair users to learn new skills through other people with disabilities or watching online videos. But that isn’t always safe if someone isn’t advanced enough to try a new skill, if their wheelchair is set up differently, or if they don't have someone behind them to catch a fall.
Even with a spotter, practicing some skills can be dangerous. Large wheelchairs can weigh between 15 and 50 pounds, not including the weight of the person inside it.
That’s why Savannah’s mom, Chanda Healton, holds onto a strap that connects to the back of her daughter’s wheelchair so it’s safe for Savannah to practice wheelies.
The program isn’t just helpful for Savannah, it allows her mom to learn proper techniques in case the wheelchair starts to tip backward. Healton says she plans to bring her daughter back again next year.
“It’s amazing,” Healton said. “First time I watched her I had tears in my eyes. I’m like oh my gosh, that’s my baby girl.""

Creation Lake by Rachel Kushner (Sept. 3) Kushner’s new novel is about a spy named Sadie Smith (great spy name), infiltrating an eco-extremist group in southern France. The book’s already being met with great reviews, including a spot on the longlist for the Booker Prize, the UK’s fanciest literary award.
Guide Me Home by Attica Locke (Sept. 3) Darren Matthews is a detective pulled out of retirement for one last case.

A Sunny Place for Shady People by Mariana Enriquez, translated by Megan McDowell (Sept. 17) Enriquez has made a name for herself blending supernatural horrors (ghosts, haunted houses, witches, that sort of thing) with the concrete horrors of everyday life in Argentina. Her last novel was a nearly 600-page tome, but this newest one is a collection of shorts – like a pillowcase full of trick-or-treat candies.
The Mighty Red by Louise Erdrich (Oct. 1) The newest Erdrich release (which is always a big deal in the literary world) will take place during the economic crisis of 2008. There’s something of a love triangle in this book, with a woman named Kismet at the center. But Kismet’s mother has reason to worry about Kismet’s future.
The Great When by Alan Moore (Oct. 1) The legendary comic book writer returns with his first novel since 2016’s Jerusalem. This new one takes place in postwar London, following a young bookshop employee named Dennis who finds a copy of a book from a different, more fantastical London.

And this new book is the result of that reporting, documenting his travels everywhere from the West Bank to Columbia, South Carolina, in order to come to terms with the myths we tell ourselves.
Sonny Boy: A Memoir by Al Pacino (Oct. 15) It was Pacino’s mom that first used the nickname Sonny Boy. It comes from an Al Jolson song she used to sing to him.

9CWU62HBHF_V28D6IYJH80WFIX,Whatever happened to ... the doctors who stand by their patients in gang-ridden Haiti?,By Ari Daniel,"Published September 4, 2024 at 12:01 PM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-04/whatever-happened-to-the-doctors-who-stand-by-their-patients-in-gang-ridden-haiti,"In March, Haiti began convulsing with violence stemming from heavily armed street gangs that took control of the country. The groups closed the airport, freed several thousand prisoners and demanded that Prime Minister Ariel Henry step down — which he did. We interviewed physicians and nonprofits in Haiti at the time and published an article about the disastrous impacts on access to routine and long-term health care.
Now, almost six months later, the gang violence continues even after the arrival of 400 Kenyan police officers to serve as an international peacekeeping force. The UN Migration Agency reports that some 5% of Haitians are now internally displaced — over half a million people as gang warfare continues, We spoke to representatives of health-care organizations about the continuing challenges of providing basic medical services.
Much of Dr. Joseph Reginald Fils-Aimé’s time these days is consumed with coordinating logistics.
For instance, last Tuesday, he spoke with the manager of a screening program in southern Haiti. “She has diagnosed someone with cervical cancer,” he says, “and was calling me to decide, ‘OK, we need that person to find care.’ In the south, she doesn’t know of any places where she can send her.”
Fils-Aimé directs strategic planning for Zanmi Lasante, a nonprofit connected to Partners In Health and Haiti's largest health-care provider after the government. He explains that in normal times, the capital of Port-au-Prince would be the best option for the cancer patient. But many of the public and private health facilities there (and elsewhere) are no longer operating due to gang violence and looting.
So on that phone call, he and his colleague were strategizing how to get this patient to Mirebalais, a community northeast of the capital where Zanmi Lasante runs its largest hospital and has oncologists and a cancer treatment program. “Mirebalais becomes her only option now,” Fils-Aimé says matter-of-factly.
“Some people take the road [there] even if it's controlled by armed group[s],” he continues. “They take the risk because they need health care. They desperately need the care.”
But he and his colleague weren’t willing to risk the seizure of a car and everyone inside it by the gangs. So they worked through the details of getting the patient onto a flight to Mirebalais and finding her a place to stay for the days she’d need to have her diagnosis confirmed and her treatment started.
Fils-Aimé admits they can’t make those highly personalized arrangements for every patient — so Zanmi Lasante gives priority to women in precarious situations, including those with risky pregnancies. In addition to moving patients, they’re also considering transporting medication and other supplies on a boat that will travel from port to port to avoid the risky roads.
Here’s what the situation comes down to: Across Haiti, a patient no longer presents with just their symptoms and medical history. Their treatment plans and care must also be filtered through the complex geography of a country that’s become a deadly obstacle course. “This is very, very…” Fils-Aimé pauses before concluding: “This is tough.”

Every Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., a couple of Toyota Landcruisers from the NGO Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) pull into a different school or empty lot in central Port-au-Prince. Six people file out, including a doctor, nurse, midwife and psychologist. One of the SUVs is loaded up with drugs and medical equipment. Someone sets up a table and chair in the parking lot.
This is a free mobile clinic. Over the course of each day, the medical team might see up to 100 patients spanning all ages. “It’s very busy,” says Dr. Abdoulaye Ousmane, ALIMA’s medical coordinator in Haiti.
The mobile clinic is equipped to handle minor cases — “outpatient consultation, antenatal care, postnatal care, family planning, psychological support,” says Ousmane.
Anyone who shows up with an emergency is brought by ambulance to one of the hospitals still open. “But of course, the issue become[s] the day we are not there and they have emergency cases,” he says. That’s when such a patient would be out of luck.
To reach more people, ALIMA has a second mobile clinic. Other NGOs are running them in Haiti too. Ousmane says his teams have seen 3,000 patients in the last few months. “Of course we are [making a difference],” he says. “We feel proud.”
And yet it’s possible to view these mobile clinics as a partial effort to plug the holes of a health system that’s falling apart. “Five million people are suffering from acute hunger and nearly 1.6 million are at a risk of severe hunger,” he says, based on reporting from UNICEF and the World Food Programme.
In late June, Kenya began sending private security forces to Haiti to take on the gangs and bring order. But Ousmane says the danger continues. “We still record a lot of security incidents, a lot of attacks,” he says, adding that he’s seen no improvements in health care or security since the street gangs first took control six months ago. “You have a higher rate of mortality at the community level.”
“All the hospitalization, all the surgery… all those services are not available because of this insecurity,” he says.
Ousmane agrees that women are the most vulnerable population in Haiti currently. “When one woman need[s] to give birth,” he says, “and she cannot because there is no place to give birth, it becomes something very dangerous for her — and for the children.”
The day-to-day work of treating a country with a health care system on life support is a hefty challenge. But Ousmane isn’t blinking.
“There is hope,” he says, that “maybe in the coming months or weeks, we will see change.”
“We hope that the security situation and political situation,” he adds, choosing his words carefully, “it will resolve soon.”
And until that resolution comes, Fils-Aimé says, “we are trying to do whatever we can.”

BCG11LML4M_RX8T02W4GPD0GJJ,"Despite evidence, Trump calls Arlington Cemetery incident a 'made up story'",By Tom Bowman,"Published September 3, 2024 at 2:19 PM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-03/despite-evidence-trump-calls-arlington-cemetery-incident-a-made-up-story,"Former President Donald Trump denied Tuesday there was a conflict or “fighting,” during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week, calling it a “made up story,” though Army officials said one of their employees “was abruptly pushed aside” by Trump campaign officials.
“It was a made up story by Comrade Kamala and her misinformation squad,” Trump posted on his Truth Social website using the sobriquet he has coined for Vice President Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. “She made it all up to make up for the fact that she and Sleepy Joe have BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS for the INCOMPETENT AFGHANISTAN Withdrawal – THE MOST EMBARRASSING DAY IN U.S. HISTORY!!!”
Meanwhile, members of Congress are asking for details about the incident, which was first reported by NPR.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, wrote to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, asking for the incident report from Arlington as well as a briefing.
“Although the incident was reported to the Joint Base-Myer-Henderson Hall police department, reporting indicates that the employee declined to press charges for fear that the Trump supporters would retaliate against her,” Raskin wrote.
Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, last week also said he wanted the Army to provide the incident report.
“This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,” Kaine said in a statement.
Harris issued a statement over the weekend, saying Arlington Cemetery is “not a place for politics.” She wrote that Trump “disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.”
President Biden, when asked about the incident by reporters, said ""I don't want to answer because I might tell you what I think.""
Trump was visiting Arlington Cemetery on Aug. 26 at the invitation of some Gold Star families whose loved ones were killed at the Abbey Gate of Kabul International Airport while U.S. forces were evacuating Afghan allies. Thirteen service members were killed after an Islamic State fighter detonated a bomb that also killed more than 170 Afghan civilians three years ago.
The Army said in a statement that Trump campaign officials violated cemetery rules and federal law by taking photos and video at Section 60, where those killed in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars are buried.
""Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,"" the statement said. ""An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside. Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption.”
The Army statement added that it considered the incident closed as the employee was not pressing charges. NPR has identified the Trump campaign officials allegedly involved in the incident and has reached out to them for comment. They have not responded.
In the aftermath of the visit to Arlington, the Trump campaign said the cemetery staffer was ""clearly suffering from a mental health episode"" and promised to release footage of the encounter but has so far declined to do so.
Chris LaCivita, a top Trump campaign adviser, also lashed out at the cemetery employee.
“For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery,” he said in a written statement, misspelling the word hallowed. “Whoever this individual is, spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces.”
A source familiar with the event said the cemetery staff worked with the staff of Republican Congressman Brian Mast of Florida, who joined Trump at Arlington. Arlington Cemetery staff dealt directly with Mast’s chief of staff, James Langenderfer, briefing him extensively on the rules, which include no campaign events at the cemetery. They also reiterated that only an official Arlington National Cemetery photographer — and no campaign photographer — could be used at Section 60. The source said Langenderfer told them the Trump campaign agreed to these rules. NPR reached out to Mast’s staff and asked if Langenderfer was briefed and relayed that information to the Trump campaign. They did not address the questions but instead released a statement, which said: ""President Trump conducted no politics at Arlington National Cemetery.""
This is not the first time Trump has been accused of politicizing the military for his personal gain. He has allegedly called dead soldiers ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" insulted the late Sen. John McCain for being a prisoner of war and recently stoked controversy for saying civilian Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients are much better than those who received the Medal of Honor — the highest military award in the country, often given posthumously.

D5G68DCM8M_6LG9UK9KS1W6WRY,First doses of mpox vaccines arrive at the heart of Africa's outbreak. What took so long?,By Gabrielle Emanuel,"Published September 5, 2024 at 2:25 PM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-05/first-doses-of-mpox-vaccines-arrive-at-the-heart-of-africas-outbreak-what-took-so-long,"How do you tell a mother not to hold her sick child?
This is a dilemma Dr. Dago Inagbe knows well. He’s the head of mission for Doctors Without Borders in the Democratic Republic of Congo — a country in the throes of a major mpox outbreak with more than 20,000 suspected cases so far this year and hundreds of deaths, most of which are children.
“The mothers, they would like to be with their children,” says Inagbe, who worries about their chance of contracting the virus that causes painful skin lesions and can be deadly. “This is why the vaccine would be welcome.”
Yet up until now, there were no mpox vaccines in the country. The 99,100 doses that landed in Kinshasa on Thursday come more than 18 months after Congo declared the situation an epidemic.
It seems as if getting mpox vaccines to Congo should have been straightforward — one country needs vaccines, other countries are willing to give them. The U.S. in fact has been ready to send doses to Africa for two years. But, it turns out, it’s not that simple.
Some blame Congo's government for the delays. Others blame the World Health Organization. Some point to real gaps in scientific knowledge.
“It really is this shell game,” says Rick Bright, former director of the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. “And in the meantime, people are getting infected, the virus is mutating and spreading more widely, and people are dying.”
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of WHO, pushed back on the notion that anyone is dragging their feet. “We will not take shortcuts,” he said at a press conference last week.

It’s tricky to figure out exactly where to lay the blame because there are so many factors at play from logistical challenges to scientific questions and financial considerations. But some say the biggest first hurdle has been bureaucratic.
Up until June 27, Congo's regulatory body had not authorized mpox vaccines for use. And even after that was done, donations from the U.S. have been held up waiting for the Congolese government to finalize preshipment requirements, including proper storage and handling of the vaccines once they arrive.
The other path for vaccines to get into the country is through the WHO. Many low- and middle-income countries defer to WHO to assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. But WHO has not yet given its blessing to any of the mpox vaccines, which are relatively new. Some public health specialists say this should have been done when the U.S. and Europe health authorities allowed the vaccines to be used during the 2022 global mpox outbreak.
WHO, for its part, says it is now reviewing the vaccines but, until very recently, didn’t have complete enough information to make an official decision. Now that the drug companies have submitted all the data and information, “we're working to review those applications as fast as possible,” says Tedros.

Experts on all sides agree there are still substantial gaps in what’s known about the mpox vaccines and how they will work given the particulars of this outbreak, which has now spread to over a dozen African countries.
For example, most of the vaccine studies were done against the strain of the virus that went global in 2022 and not the more dangerous strain surging in Congo. Complicating matters further is that the mpox virus in Congo has recently evolved and mutated into a whole new strain.
“Will the vaccines work [against this new strain]? I think the honest answer is: ‘We do not know yet,’” says Marion Koopmans, director of the Pandemic and Disaster Centre at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands.
Also, most of the existing studies focused on a very different population than those currently at risk. “The vaccine effectiveness studies were done in the Global North and amongst gay and bisexual men,” says Dr. Dimie Ogoina, an infectious diseases physician and researcher at Niger Delta University in Nigeria. But in Congo, he notes, children make up the majority of cases and deaths — and the vaccine the U.S. is donating has yet to be licensed for children.
Vaccines are not the only way to combat the outbreak, says Ogoina. Testing, surveillance and infection control can play major roles. But, he says, vaccines “may be one of the best tools we have available now based on existing knowledge.”

For some in Africa, the mpox vaccine situation is a case of deja vu. At the height of the COVID pandemic, wealthy nations had plenty of COVID vaccines and lower income countries struggled to get doses.
“We faced COVID. We didn't have vaccines, medicines. We didn't have even syringes, gloves. We were abandoned,” said Dr. Jean Kaseya, director-general at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press conference last week. “Today, we are in a similar situation where we start to look for vaccine because we don't manufacture vaccine.”
“We can't play that scene out again, and I am concerned [that’s what’s happening],” says William Moss, an epidemiologist and professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Others disagree. “We're not in the same situation we were in when COVID began,” says Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s interim director of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention. She argues that many of the systems set up during the COVID era have helped the global community respond. “We need to shift this narrative a little bit and talk about not only the challenges, but the strengths that exist across the continent of Africa,” she says.
One of those strengths, many public health experts say, is the role African leaders are taking in managing the outbreak.
For the first time, the Africa CDC used its authority to declare a “public health emergency of continental security” on Aug. 13 — raising the alarm about the mpox situation and even beating the WHO to the punch by a day. It’s also “the first time that Africa will have one response plan and one budget,” says Africa CDC’s Kaseya.
Placide Mbala Kingebeni has noticed the difference. “This is really good,” says Kingebeni, who is the director of the Clinical Research Center at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Congo. In the past, he says, outside groups have determined which health situations in Africa merit global attention “and for the first time, the continent has had the courage to say that this is a continental situation.”
Inagbe, head of Doctors Without Borders in Congo, has spent time in the far north of the country caring for mpox patients. He is hopeful that the African leadership and coordination will smooth the vaccine procurement and rollout.
“It looks like there is a new dynamic,” Inagbe says, adding that his “fingers are crossed” that the children, parents, health workers and others who most need the vaccines will start getting their shots soon.

D7LWLQG51P_DL75HPR9G1FP5N0,Could you live without shopping for a year? Try the 'no-buy challenge',By Stacey Vanek Smith,"Published September 5, 2024 at 10:01 AM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-05/could-you-live-without-shopping-for-a-year-try-the-no-buy-challenge,"Elysia Berman remembers the moment she realized her shopping was out of control. Last December, she ducked into a store to buy a pair of gloves. And she came out with a $600 coat she didn’t need and couldn’t afford.
“That was my breaking point,” she recalls.
Berman, 35, knew she had an unhealthy relationship with shopping. So she decided to do something drastic. She’d try the no-buy challenge, a popular social media experiment that encourages people to buy less stuff. For a set time period -- in her case, a whole year -- she’d stop spending money on non-essential items. No clothes. No makeup. No home decor. Instead, she’d use what she had and buy second hand.
The challenge is harder than it seems. Berman, who is documenting her no-buy journey on TikTok, had to break her habit of buying 10 to 30 new items a week. And as a fashion industry professional, she was surrounded by the temptation to shop.
Since starting the challenge in January, Berman has saved tens of thousands of dollars, paid down a quarter of her debt -- and says her mental health has improved. “Essentially, I had gone through detox and withdrawal from the dopamine you get from shopping.”
Anyone can try the no-buy challenge. Whether your reason is to curb spending, cut back on fast fashion or reduce your carbon footprint (about 10% of all carbon emissions come from the fashion industry, according to the United Nations), here are some tips to help get you started.


Grab a pen and paper and write down a list of non-essential items that you’ll stop buying -- and continue buying -- for a set period of time. It’ll help you pinpoint items you tend to overspend on, and be more intentional about what’s really worth buying. It can also help you focus on the goals of your no-buy experiment.
“The no-buy rules are going to be different for everyone,” says Berman. She knows she has a weakness for fashion, so her “no” column included clothes, beauty products, perfume, jewelry and bathing suits.
Your “yes” column should target items that enrich your life and encourage your hobbies, she says. Berman’s list included fresh flowers, museum tickets, pilates classes and budget travel.


Berman decided to do the No-Buy Challenge for a whole year. If that feels too restrictive, maybe try it out for a few months -- or even a couple of weeks.
You can also change the rules of the experiment to make it more fun. Sustainable fashion writer Aja Barber runs an online community where she encourages people to consume more mindfully. “I challenge people not to buy a single new dress this year. That forces people to be a little bit creative, but it doesn't entirely limit them,” she says. “I've also challenged my readership to buy 50% of their clothing secondhand.”


In a world of flash sales and ads that follow you from site to site, the temptation to shop is everywhere. So limit your exposure to shopping deals -- and “get a grip on your social media,” says Barber.



It’s easy to overspend on fast fashion. But when you start to humanize its supply chain, you start to see that the amazing deal of, say, an $8 Shein dress, isn’t so amazing after all.
Fast fashion is quick and cheap because companies cut every possible corner and cost, says Dilys Williams, director of the Centre For Sustainable Fashion at the University of the Arts in London. That often means using oil-based fabrics like polyester, which do not biodegrade, and factories that pollute and often drastically underpay or mistreat workers.
As a result of this system, humans are consuming more than ever, and the consequences are real, says Barber. There is a giant pile of discarded clothes in Chile’s Atacama Desert that is so large it can be seen from space. And the beaches of Ghana have been overtaken with discarded clothes that have washed up on the shores.
So recalibrate your idea of what is normal when it comes to how much clothes cost. Support sustainable fashion brands. And understand the harms of fast fashion, says Barber.
Months into the challenge, Berman says that her no-buy journey has helped her consume more mindfully. And there have been other payoffs as well.
“I am very proud of myself,” she says. “I’ve seen a new level of dedication and focus that I wasn’t aware I was capable of before.”

DJHQXPBTLD_QTBER6I1JBJ6OBP,Here’s why many election experts aren’t freaking out about certification this year,By Miles Parks,"Published August 30, 2024 at 3:00 PM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-04/heres-why-many-election-experts-arent-freaking-out-about-certification-this-year,"Updated September 04, 2024 at 05:01 AM ET
As the lead election official in one of the biggest counties in a swing state, Derek Bowens is thinking about a lot of things as voting season nears. His county just relocated its elections department into a more secure facility to protect from threats, and it unveiled an app to communicate accurate information directly to voters.
But one thing the election director of Durham County, N.C., is not worried about is election certification.
“I have not thought at all [about it],” Bowens said. “I don’t have any concerns. The law is clear.”
This is the first presidential election since Donald Trump’s sprawling nationwide effort to overturn the 2020 results, and watchdog groups and pundits have been sounding the alarm about the potential for mischief when it comes to certification. Finalizing vote tallies had typically been a mundane part of the election process, but it’s come under new focus, especially after Georgia’s state election board recently gave local boards there more latitude for investigation, even though that could violate state law.
Across the country, dozens of local officials this year are tasked with some role in certification who have shown an openness to refusing to do so, based on disproven or unsubstantiated election conspiracy theories, according to a recent report from the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Despite that, election experts and the people actually in charge of tallying the votes are still projecting confidence in the certification process. That’s partly because of changes implemented since 2020 and partly because the legal system has shown an ability to be a backstop against political interference in the process.
“I'm feeling better than most people, but maybe that's because I don't freak out about things,” said Charles Stewart, an elections expert at MIT. “All the evidence is that state and federal courts have shut down election officials going beyond their authority and acting on hunches rather than evidence.”


Certification is the administrative last step of the elections process, in which local political bodies finalize the work of election officials. Trump’s efforts to sow doubt in voting processes have given way to a new trend in which local Republican officials have refused to finalize results in situations where there are no actual underlying issues.
Still, in every case since the 2020 election where a local body has declined to certify, courts have stepped in to force certification. That’s because generally, state laws don’t allow people in these positions much discretion — if any at all — not to certify, after the election has been held, challenges about voting rules have been litigated through the courts, and the local election administrator has tallied the vote.
Every state does provide some mechanism, outside of the certification process, where voters or candidates can challenge election procedures or results. And in some states, that process can only take place after local certification, so local officials holding it up may be standing in the way of legitimate investigation.
In Pennsylvania, a state that could very well swing the presidential race, Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt told NPR his office is preparing as though there will be local boards that decline to certify.
“We’re not worried but we will be prepared,” said Schmidt, a Republican who was targeted by Trump in 2020 when Schmidt was a local election commissioner in Philadelphia.
In the 2022 midterms, three different Pennsylvania counties declined to certify elections at the local level.
“And that wasn’t because the election was close, that wasn’t because there was any evidence whatsoever of voter fraud or an election irregularity,” he said.
Members of the local boards disagreed with a court ruling regarding mail ballots in the state, and Schmidt’s office eventually sued to force the counties to comply.
“It's always possible that people can try to interfere with election administration and the timelines, which are pretty strict admittedly,” said Schmidt. “But for us, it's a matter of working closely with the courts to make sure these matters are disposed of expeditiously.”
And since 2020, laws at the state and federal level around certification have only been made clearer, as Votebeat detailed recently.
In Bowens’ state of North Carolina, for instance, those involved in county certification are only to make sure eligible ballots have been counted, and that any mandatory recounts have been completed.
Still, after the 2022 election, two members of a board in Surry County, N.C., declined to certify due to disagreements with a court decision about election rules. The state board removed the two from their posts last year.
“Those who administer elections must follow the law as it is written, not how they want it to be,” Damon Circosta, who was chair of the state election board, said at the time.
Bowens, of Durham County, added: “Under North Carolina law, the statute says a county board of elections ‘shall’ [certify]. It doesn't say, ‘might’ or ‘consider’ or ‘maybe.’ It says ‘shall.’ Our statutes are very clear on how the process works once we've completed the canvassing period.”

Even if these sorts of efforts fail to actually muck up the election process in various places, UCLA election law professor Rick Hasen says they still further false election narratives, which can lead to a host of other potential problems.
“When you have government officials saying the vote counts are not fair, even if there's no basis in doing that, it can spark conspiracy theories,” Hasen said. “It could provide the basis for people to act in a lawless way to try to overturn the results of the election.”
In fact, the first instance in 2020 where certification became a storyline was in Michigan, a state Trump lost by more than 150,000 votes.

DNAWSNJGEQ_C154735EQWMW3IE,"Coastal flooding is getting more common, even on sunny days",By Rebecca Hersher,"Published September 3, 2024 at 6:37 PM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-03/coastal-flooding-is-getting-more-common-even-on-sunny-days,"Coastal flooding from high tides is getting more common in most parts of the United States, as climate change causes sea levels to rise.
Millions of people are affected by so-called sunny day flooding each year, according to a new report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). On average, the U.S. now experiences five extra days of high-tide flooding each year compared to the year 2000.
“Over the past year we’ve seen record coastal flooding,” says Nicole LeBoeuf, the director of the NOAA National Ocean Service.
In the last year, St. Petersburg, Fla., Atlantic City, N.J., Charleston, S.C. and more than 30 other places tied or broke their records for the number of high-tide flood days. Galveston, Texas, which consistently sees some of the most severe and frequent high-tide flooding of any city in the U.S., experienced 23 days of high-tide flooding last year.
The costs of high-tide flooding are enormous. Even a few inches of water can make neighborhoods inaccessible to some residents, including those who use wheelchairs or rely on strollers to transport young children. And standing water can also snarl commutes, block emergency vehicles and cause secondary flooding if sewers back up into buildings or overflow into natural bodies of water.
“People living in the [Florida] Keys or Annapolis or Norfolk – they’re facing traffic delays dropping their kids off at school or getting to work because there’s water that’s flooding the streets,” says Karen Kavanaugh, an oceanographer at NOAA. High-tide flooding can also force businesses to close, and even a small amount of saltwater flooding can erode underground pipes and damage vehicles.
Sea levels don’t rise at the same rate everywhere, and the effects of high-tide flooding are even more pronounced in places where sea levels are rising most rapidly, the report notes. In the last 25 years or so, the number of days with high-tide flooding has increased by a whopping 250% or more in many regions, including along the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Islands.
“Decades of sea level rise are catching up,” says William Sweet, an oceanographer at NOAA.
And there’s no reprieve in sight, as global temperatures continue to increase and sea levels continue to rise. The average number of annual high-tide flood days for the U.S. is expected to top 45 days by mid-century. Local governments in many coastal areas are racing to upgrade infrastructure to withstand salt water, improve sewers and drainage and budget for the costs of damage and disruption from high-tide flooding.
While high-tide flood forecasts do not consider flooding from storms, the same sea level rise that is driving more sunny day floods also exacerbates coastal storm flooding, as residents of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina experienced following Hurricane Debby. The storm came ashore in Florida as a weak Category 1 hurricane and was quickly downgraded to a Tropical Storm, but storm surge and rain has nonetheless caused catastrophic flooding across the Southeast, in part because rising seas mean the ocean is closer to the built-up coastline.
“These areas are already under the thumb of sea level rise, making the combination of Debby’s storm surge and rainfall potentially catastrophic,” LeBoeuf explains.

EC6RD31MC5_1HAV5XE0RRLB0NO,"Decades of failures turned Grenfell Tower into a 'death trap,' report says",By The Associated Press,"Published September 4, 2024 at 10:25 AM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-04/decades-of-failures-turned-grenfell-tower-into-a-death-trap-report-says,"LONDON — A damning report on a deadly London high-rise fire concluded Wednesday that decades of failures by government, regulators and industry turned Grenfell Tower into a ""death trap"" where 72 people lost their lives.
The public inquiry into the 2017 blaze found no ""single cause"" of the tragedy, but said a combination of dishonest companies, weak or incompetent regulators and complacent government led the building to be covered in combustible cladding that turned a small apartment fire into the deadliest blaze on British soil since World War II.
The inquiry's head, retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, said the deaths were avoidable and ""all contributed to it in one way or another, in most cases through incompetence but in some cases through dishonesty and greed.""
Prime Minister Keir Starmer apologized on behalf of the British state, saying the tragedy ""should never have happened"" and promising to act on the report's recommendations.
""Today is a long-awaited day for truth but it must now lead to a day of justice,"" he told Parliament.
While the report may give survivors some of the answers they have long sought, they must wait to see whether anyone responsible will be prosecuted. Police will examine the inquiry's conclusions before deciding on charges, which could include corporate or individual manslaughter.
They say prosecutions are unlikely before late 2026.
Natasha Elcock of the group Grenfell United urged authorities to deliver justice.
""We paid the price for systematic dishonesty, institutional indifference and neglect,"" said Elcock, a survivor who lost her uncle in the fire.
The fire broke out in the early hours of June 14, 2017, in a fourth-floor apartment and raced up the 25-story building like a lit fuse, fueled by flammable cladding panels on the exterior walls.
The tragedy horrified the nation and posed one central question, the report said: ""How was it possible in 21st century London for a reinforced concrete building, itself structurally impervious to fire, to be turned into a death trap?""
The search for answers focused on a refurbishment completed in 2016 that covered the 1970s building in aluminum and polyethylene cladding — a layer of foam insulation topped by two sheets of aluminum sandwiched around a layer of polyethylene, a combustible plastic polymer that melts and drips on exposure to heat.
The report was highly critical of companies that made the cladding. It said they engaged in ""systematic dishonesty,"" manipulating safety tests and misrepresenting the results to claim the material was safe.
It said insulation manufacturer Celotex was unscrupulous, and another insulation firm, Kingspan, ""cynically exploited the industry's lack of detailed knowledge."" Cladding panel maker Arconic ""concealed from the market the true extent of the danger,"" the report said.
The three companies expressed sympathies to the bereaved, but all denied responsibility for the deaths. Arconic said its products were not unsafe. Kingspan said its ""historical failings"" were not ""causative of the tragedy."" Celotex said the decision to combine its insulation with combustible cladding panels had been made by others.
The inquiry said the combustible cladding was used because it was cheap and because of ""incompetence of the organizations and individuals involved in the refurbishment"" -– including architects, engineers and contractors — who all thought safety was someone else's responsibility.
It concluded the failures multiplied because bodies in charge of enforcing building standards were weak, the local authority was uninterested and the ""complacent"" U.K. government — led in the seven years before the fire by the Conservative Party — ignored safety warnings because of a commitment to deregulation.
The inquiry has held more than 300 public hearings and examined around 1,600 witness statements.
An initial report published in 2019 criticized the fire department for initially telling residents to stay put and await rescue. By the time the advice was changed, it was too late for many on the upper floors to escape.
London Fire Brigade came in for further criticism for a ""chronic lack of effective management and leadership,"" poor training in high-rise fires and outdated communications equipment.
The Grenfell tragedy prompted soul-searching about inequality in Britain. Grenfell was a public housing building set in one of London's richest neighborhoods, near the pricey boutiques and elegant houses of Notting Hill. The victims, largely people of color, came from 23 countries and included taxi drivers and architects, a poet, an acclaimed young artist, retirees and 18 children.
The report said the inquiry had ""seen no evidence that any of the decisions that resulted in the creation of a dangerous building or the calamitous spread of fire were affected by racial or social prejudice,"" though it said the public body that managed Grenfell had failed to treat residents with ""understanding and respect.""
The prime minister said the tragedy ""poses fundamental questions about the kind of country we are, a country where the voices of working class people and of those of color have been repeatedly ignored and dismissed.""
After the fire, the U.K. government banned metal composite cladding panels for new buildings and ordered similar combustible cladding to be removed from hundreds of tower blocks across the country. But the work hasn't been carried out on some apartment buildings because of wrangling over who should pay.

The report made multiple recommendations, including tougher fire safety rules, a national fire and rescue college and a single independent regulator for the construction industry to replace the current mishmash of bodies.

It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.
In January 2021, Leahruth Jemilo and three friends decided to book a weekend getaway. Jemilo was having a tough week at work, and by the Friday before the trip, she didn’t know if she could go.
“My tank was completely empty,” Jemilo said. She called her friends to cancel.
“I was crying to them saying, ‘I'm so anxious. I'm just exhausted from the week. I just don't think that I even have the energy to get in the car,’” she remembered.
“And they said, ‘Do it, just get in the car.’ So I listened to my girlfriends, got in the car and started driving.”
As she drove down the highway, Jemilo started to cry. She put on her sunglasses to hide her tears, and pulled up to a toll booth at the Chicago Skyway Toll Bridge. Then she noticed her toll collector.
""She had these really beautiful, very bright purple long braids in her hair, and was wearing these incredible, really long purple feather earrings,” Jemilo recalled.
The worker said hello, and asked Jemilo how she as doing.
“And I immediately burst into tears and I said, ‘I am actually not good. I am really not good.’”
Jemilo took off her sunglasses and tears streamed down her face. Then the toll collector said something to her that she won’t forget.
“She looked at me and her eyes were so kind. And she pointed her finger at me and she said, ‘Listen, I got you, girl. You're going to be in my prayers. And everything is going to be OK,’” Jemilo said.
“My tears actually dried up when she said that. And I felt lighter in that moment.”
Jemilo thanked the woman, paid the toll and went on her way. Then she found herself crying again — this time with tears of happiness.
“Her simple act of kindness in response to what is typically a very simple question ... was incredibly meaningful to me in that moment,” Jemilo said.
“It was amazing to me that she showed that kind of kindness to a stranger who just happened to be driving through her part of the tollbooth.”

FAIJII2KDT_WAUMJNOUGLPHE7W,5 things to know about the U.K.’s suspension of some arms exports to Israel,"By Lauren Frayer,","Published September 3, 2024 at 4:09 PM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-03/5-things-to-know-about-the-u-k-s-suspension-of-some-arms-exports-to-israel,"Updated September 03, 2024 at 17:05 PM ET
LONDON — The United Kingdom’s decision to suspend some arms exports to Israel has angered Israeli officials, confounded the U.K.'s chief rabbi — and even disappointed many human rights groups that say it doesn't go far enough.
It also marks a shift in British foreign policy, away from being lockstep with Washington when it comes to support for Israel.
After months of public protests at weapons factories across the country against arming Israel, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy told Parliament on Monday, lawmakers' first day back from summer recess, that the government is suspending about 30 of its 350 arms export licenses for Israel.
He said a legal review found that ""for certain U.K. arms exports to Israel there exists a clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law."" Israel denies breaking any laws.
As the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack approaches, and the death toll in Gaza mounts, the British government is one of several around the world that are expressing increasing alarm at how the war is being conducted.
Here are five things to know about this suspension:

The United States and Germany are Israel's biggest weapons suppliers. U.K. defense exports to Israel are relatively small and declined from about $55 million in 2022, to about $24 million in 2023, according to government figures.
Those exports include explosives and explosive devices, assault rifles and components of military aircraft. They're manufactured in Britain under a licensing scheme that allows different companies to export different weapons directly to Israel.
Altogether, the U.K. has licensed arms worth more than $725 million to Israel since 2008, according to parliamentary estimates.
British Defense Secretary John Healey told local radio Tuesday that the partial suspension of arms exports won’t have any “material” impact on Israel’s security.

Several countries — including Canada, Spain, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands — have announced a halt to all arms exports to Israel in recent months, out of concern about Israeli attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.
But the U.K. is suspending less than 10% of the licenses it has granted for weapons manufacturers to export to Israel.
“The U.K. continues to support Israel’s right to self-defense,” Lammy told lawmakers. Britain has long been one of Israel’s closest allies.
A legal review of U.K. arms exports to Israel was commissioned earlier this year by the previous Conservative-led government, which lost power in July 4 elections. It did not make public the findings of its review before it left office.
The new center-left government published a policy paper late Monday explaining its decision. It said it has also concluded that Israel is failing on humanitarian aid in Gaza and the treatment of detainees.


In a post Tuesday on social media, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Britain’s action “shameful,” and said it would not deter Israel from “pursuing a just war with just means.”
“Britain’s misguided decision will only embolden Hamas,” Netanyahu wrote.
Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said he was “deeply disheartened.”
In Britain, the country’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, said it “beggars belief” that the U.K would do this to its ally Israel. He suggested it was especially offensive to suspend weapons exports at a time when funerals were underway for Israeli hostages killed in Gaza. (The bodies of six hostages were recovered Sunday in Gaza.)
On Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that British officials had notified their U.S. counterparts about the suspension ahead of Lammy's announcement in Parliament.


Amnesty International calls the U.K. suspension of arms exports “too limited and riddled with loopholes.” Human Rights Watch said it “doesn’t go far enough.”
Activists are particularly concerned that Lammy announced an exemption for components of F-35 fighter jets, which Israel has used to drop bombs on Gaza. About 15% of those components are made in Britain, according to advocacy groups.
“That includes things like the rear fuselage, which is the entire back part of the plane, and many other bits including the release mechanisms for the bombs,” says Katie Fallon, an activist with the Campaign Against Arms Trade, one of the groups that has helped organize nationwide protests.
Fallon tells NPR she’s heartened by “all the ordinary people who’ve gone on a march, emailed their [member of Parliament], and worked on this nonstop for the last year.” She sees the U.K. decision as a partial victory for her group.
“We can't celebrate while Palestinians are still in such a horrific situation,” she says.
Polls show a majority of Britons want their government to halt all arms exports to Israel.

The U.K. has long been in lock step with its ally Washington on Israel policy. But a new center-left British government, elected in July, has indicated it may take a more independent approach.
The new prime minister, Keir Starmer, is a former human rights lawyer and prosecutor. He’s been under pressure from some of his own supporters to speak out about rising civilian death tolls in Gaza, and to condemn Israel more forcefully.
Within weeks of taking office, Starmer’s government said it was restarting funding for UNRWA, the main United Nations relief agency for the Palestinians.
Also in late July, Starmer’s government allowed a deadline to pass without filing any challenge to the International Criminal Court’s request for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. With the U.S. not a signatory to that court, its ally Britain had pledged — under Starmer’s predecessor Rishi Sunak — to file legal paperwork challenging those warrants.
But in another break with the U.S., Starmer’s government said it would leave the matter up to the ICC, and not intervene.

G7WKD97UJJ_TBA1WC6E5R14G1W,Did a powerful Democrat lie about #MeToo allegations to save his career?,By Tom Dreisbach,"Published September 3, 2024 at 5:00 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-03/did-a-powerful-democrat-lie-about-metoo-allegations-to-save-his-career,"Editor’s note: This story includes descriptions of sexual harassment and racist language.
In June 2017, Eric Garcetti gathered with a group of his staffers, advisers and lobbyists on a hotel rooftop in Miami Beach, Florida.
At the time, Garcetti was a rising star in the Democratic Party. He had just been reelected mayor of Los Angeles, the second-biggest city in the U.S., and he was actively laying the foundation for a potential presidential campaign.
Garcetti’s staff was in Miami Beach for a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. On the final night of the conference, with the sunset fading over the hotel pool, the group posed for pictures.
One of those photos would go on to haunt Garcetti’s political career, from his time as mayor of Los Angeles to his current post as U.S. ambassador to India.
In the middle of the photo, Garcetti is smiling, giving two thumbs-ups.
Garcetti is flanked by people he knew well: a pair of lobbyists, a business executive and a city official.
On the left is one of Garcetti’s closest political allies at the time, a man named Rick Jacobs. Jacobs is a powerful and well-connected figure in LA politics and was part of Garcetti’s inner circle. He had been a political consultant, fundraiser, deputy chief of staff, trusted adviser and friend to Garcetti for years.
In the photo, Jacobs is standing just a couple of feet from Garcetti, posing with his outstretched hand placed deliberately in front of a lobbyist’s crotch.
That lobbyist would later testify that he found the situation upsetting and embarrassing.
“I thought Rick Jacobs should be ashamed,” he said. (NPR is not naming him as a victim of sexual misconduct.)
For years, the photo circulated among Garcetti’s City Hall staff, the kind of photo that people gossiped about and showed at after-work happy hours.
For some, the photo of Garcetti, with his eyes looking toward the camera, functioned as a kind of visual metaphor.
When the photo was taken on that hotel rooftop, Garcetti said, he was looking the other way.
Just a few years later, in 2020, an LAPD officer on Garcetti’s protective detail sued the city of Los Angeles and alleged that Jacobs sexually harassed him over the course of 2014 to 2019 and that Garcetti witnessed the behavior and failed to act. That lawsuit led to the release of the photo, along with a cascade of accusations from people in and around the Garcetti administration.
Multiple city employees testified in depositions that Jacobs subjected them to unwanted massages and hugs, crude sexual comments and racist language without facing any consequences.
Jacobs denied all wrongdoing, calling the allegations against him “pure fiction.” Under oath, Jacobs denied sexually harassing anyone. He admitted, however, that he referred to his Asian American assistant at City Hall as a “Chinaman.” He acknowledged that he posed for the photo next to Garcetti as part of a “really stupid joke.” Asked whether he made “comments of a sexual nature” in front of Garcetti, Jacobs testified it was “possible.”
Garcetti said he never saw inappropriate behavior from Jacobs, in public or private, at any time. He testified he could not even recall Jacobs telling a joke, let alone an off-color comment.
After the lawsuit was filed, Garcetti initially stood by Jacobs and said they would continue to work together while a city-commissioned sexual harassment investigation was ongoing.
“Fundamentally, this is something that should take a process forward, but shouldn’t keep somebody who has been a committed public servant from being able to serve our community and our world,” Garcetti told reporters in July 2020. Garcetti stopped working with Jacobs months later, when additional accusations became public.
Despite the allegations, Garcetti fought to keep his political career on track while maintaining that he was completely unaware of any inappropriate behavior. Ultimately, he narrowly won confirmation in the U.S. Senate as ambassador to India amid questions about what he knew about the harassment allegations and when.
Months after Garcetti was sworn in, city leaders approved a $1.8 million settlement to resolve the lawsuit.
Like most settlements, this one did not include any admission of wrongdoing.
Garcetti told NPR, “I was surprised by the settlement. I wish it had gone to trial.”
Dueling investigative reports — one commissioned by the city of Los Angeles and the other by Senate Republicans — came to opposite conclusions. As a result, the truth of LAPD officer Matthew Garza’s allegations remains legally unresolved.
The closure of the case allowed NPR to use the California Public Records Act to obtain more than a thousand pages of unredacted transcripts of depositions of Garcetti’s inner circle.
NPR has also obtained, and is publishing for the first time, excerpts of the video of Garcetti’s deposition, showing his body language, facial expressions and demeanor as he responds to tough questions about the harassment allegations.
The evidence includes new allegations of workplace misconduct and retaliation against those who spoke out against Jacobs and Garcetti. In total, the records raise concern about Garcetti’s truthfulness, as well as the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to fully support Garcetti’s nomination as ambassador to India. NPR’s investigation also reveals the tension at the heart of a Democratic political scandal in the #MeToo era, between political ambition and a commitment to addressing sexual harassment.
The White House declined to answer NPR’s questions for this story.
Jacobs also did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment. When an NPR journalist reached Jacobs by phone and identified himself as a reporter, Jacobs responded, “Oh,” and immediately ended the call.
Multiple former members of the Garcetti administration say that the evidence refutes Garcetti’s consistent denials.
“To watch him lie like that is such a betrayal,” said Naomi Seligman, who served as Garcetti’s communications director from 2015 to 2017 and who has accused Garcetti of committing perjury.
“There are a lot of lives and people he left behind him that have been hurt, because of his inability to own his responsibility in this situation,” said Suzi Emmerling, who served as Garcetti’s communications director from 2017 to 2019.
Here are four key takeaways from NPR’s investigation:


By the time LAPD officer Garza went public with sexual harassment allegations against Jacobs in July 2020, Garcetti and Jacobs had been friends for nearly two decades. In a 2016 email, Garcetti called Jacobs “a dear friend, as well as one of my most trusted advisors.”
Throughout much of that time, people who knew and worked for Jacobs had concerns about his conduct, according to deposition testimony. Multiple employees testified that such concerns were widely known.
Jacobs met Garcetti in 2003, when Jacobs was working on former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean’s presidential campaign, and Garcetti endorsed Dean. Garcetti’s wife, Amy Wakeland, also worked on the campaign and was also friends with Jacobs.
In politics, Jacobs was known as a formidable, and even ruthless, fundraiser. After Dean’s campaign ended, Jacobs created a liberal group called the Courage Campaign, which is best known for its advocacy in support of same-sex marriage. Jacobs is gay.
The organization was small. Jacobs, who led the organization from 2005 to 2013, estimated in his deposition testimony that it had roughly eight employees at any given time.
NPR spoke to six former employees of the group. These former employees asked to speak anonymously, because they said they fear retaliation from Jacobs, who is still influential in LA politics as a consultant and lobbyist.
In interviews, these former employees said that Jacobs frequently made crude sexual comments at work and that he frequently hugged, squeezed and kissed the employees he managed.
“I haven’t seen any other leader I’ve worked for have that level of physical contact in the workplace,” said one former employee.
Another former employee, a gay man, said that Jacobs forcibly kissed him on the lips, touched and “aggressively” hugged him without his consent, and subjected him to “lewd and sexually graphic comments,” according to a summary of his complaint later provided to investigators for the city.
The organization was virtual and did not have a formal office. As a result, former employees said, work meetings often took place at Jacobs’ home and sometimes over alcoholic drinks, blurring the line between personal and professional. Evening fundraisers, which also frequently involved alcohol, made those lines even fuzzier. Jeremy Bernard, who did not work for the Courage Campaign but knew Jacobs socially during that time, agreed that Jacobs could be “handsy” and “aggressive” when drinking alcohol, according to his testimony.
In his deposition, Jacobs denied ever sexually harassing any employee of the Courage Campaign.
When asked whether he had kissed an employee without his consent, Jacobs replied, “I don’t recall doing so. Not without his consent.”
Jacobs is no longer formally associated with the Courage Campaign, which renamed itself Courage California and is now led by Executive Director Irene Kao.
NPR contacted Kao for comment about the former employees’ allegations.
“The allegations you shared happened some time ago, so I don’t think it would serve any purpose to send them to me at this time,” Kao wrote in an email. “Any allegations of any kind of discrimination or harassment is taken very seriously by Courage California, and we believe all parties should be afforded a just legal process.”
Kao declined to comment on Jacobs’ role with the organization, citing concerns about privacy.
During that same era, before Jacobs was hired at City Hall in 2013, Yashar Ali, a freelance journalist and former political fundraiser, said that Jacobs grabbed his face with two hands, forcibly kissed him on the lips at a party and said, “God your lips are so soft.” Ali, who is gay, said the kisses were not consensual and made him uncomfortable. He said he did not push Jacobs away.
“And once he did that, and I didn’t object to it, he continued,” Ali told NPR in an interview. “But not objecting to something is not consent. It’s just not objecting.” He estimates that Jacobs kissed him about a dozen times over the years and that Garcetti was sometimes present at these parties.
Jacobs spoke about this allegation with investigators for the city. “In Mr. Jacobs’ experience growing up and as a gay man, kissing on the mouth was a common way to greet others,” the investigators wrote in their report. Jacobs said that he believed the kisses with Ali were consensual and part of a “cutesy little game.” Ali told NPR that Jacobs’ statement was “absurd” and false.
NPR spoke to multiple sources who said that Ali’s story is consistent with their own experience and that Jacobs was widely known to touch people at parties in ways that made them uncomfortable. The Los Angeles Times and New York magazine both reported additional accounts of men who said Jacobs groped them at parties.
Garcetti’s own description of Jacobs’ behavior at parties has changed over time.
In his deposition, Garcetti testified, “I have no memory of ever meeting” Ali. But he said he witnessed Jacobs kissing people on the lips as a greeting in social environments.
“I think he might have been receiving it as much as somebody giving it,” Garcetti testified.
In an interview with city investigators, Garcetti said the contact he witnessed was appropriate, because Jacobs is gay and Jewish and, as Garcetti put it, Jews are an affectionate “hugging kind of people.”
But in his response to NPR’s questions for this story, Garcetti had a different answer.
“I don’t recall ever seeing Rick Jacobs kiss anybody, aside from social kisses on the cheek to say hello,” Garcetti wrote in an email.
NPR sought clarification of Garcetti’s answer, given that he had previously testified seeing Jacobs kiss people on the lips.
“There’s no contradiction,” Garcetti wrote in a follow-up email. “I only ever saw Rick kiss others during the normal course of social greetings, and I never witnessed any inappropriate behavior. I’ve given this testimony consistently.”


When Garcetti began running for LA mayor in 2013, Jacobs raised more than $2 million to support Garcetti’s campaign and attack his opponent.
Shortly thereafter, Garcetti hired Jacobs as his deputy chief of staff and gave him a special title, “executive vice mayor.” Together, Garcetti and Jacobs helped create a nonprofit called the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles. The organization raises private, tax-deductible donations from individuals, corporations and charities to help pay for initiatives in the city. Since its founding, the organization has faced questions about whether corporations, wealthy donors and even the government of Qatar, which is known for censorship and repression, were using contributions to win favor with Garcetti. And while the Mayor’s Fund is technically independent from the city government, it had an office at LA City Hall. (After Karen Bass became LA mayor, the organization moved its office out of City Hall and embraced new ethics guidelines regarding donations.)
In addition to the Mayor’s Fund, Jacobs also worked with Garcetti to create a nonprofit called Accelerator for America, which helped boost Garcetti’s presidential ambitions, as well as a political action committee called the Democratic Midterm Victory Fund, which raised money from big donors in Hollywood and business. Among the PAC’s donors were the tech billionaires Elon Musk and David Sacks.
“Rick Jacobs brought Eric Garcetti to the ball,” said Seligman, the former Garcetti communications director. “Rick Jacobs introduced him to the biggest donors he has. Rick Jacobs was his ticket.”
In Garcetti’s world, Jacobs “had more power than any other adviser,” said Emmerling, the other former Garcetti communications director.
In a 2019 email to some of his top advisers, Garcetti wrote, “I have led a new culture at City Hall that has been recognized as the best in the country.”
Behind the scenes, the picture was much darker, and often beset by internal rivalries.
Jacobs himself told city investigators that City Hall was an environment of “literal hatred.”
Five city employees testified that Jacobs subjected them to unwanted, inappropriate or otherwise discomfiting physical contact at work, including a forcible kiss, massages, squeezes and tight hugs.
Other City Hall employees testified that they witnessed physical contact between Jacobs and other employees. Former Chief of Staff Ana Guerrero, who remains close to Garcetti, told city investigators that Jacobs used hugs to “assert his dominance” with lower-level employees, though she did not describe the contact as sexual harassment. A former press secretary for Garcetti testified that Jacobs sexually harassed her fiancé at a dinner party.
Julie Ciardullo, then chief legal counsel in the mayor’s office, testified about an incident that she said Garcetti personally witnessed, in which Jacobs allegedly cornered her in a cramped elevator and pushed against her body, joking about the “tight fit.” He was “joking around” and “invading my personal space,” even after she told him to “cut it out,” Ciardullo testified. Jacobs stopped only after Garcetti intervened, she said. Ciardullo said that she did not consider the incident sexual harassment. Garcetti’s spokesperson told the LA Times that he did not remember the incident, but Ciardullo’s “description is consistent with how [Garcetti] would handle any situation where he witnesses someone behaving unprofessionally.”
Multiple witnesses testified that Jacobs regularly made sexual comments and jokes to employees.
In addition to Jacobs’ racist reference to his Asian American assistant — which three witnesses testified to — investigators for Senate Republicans reported that Jacobs used the term “yellow people” to describe participants at a U.S.-China summit. Paul Kadzielski, a former digital director in the Garcetti administration, testified that “occasionally [Jacobs] would make jokes of a racial nature that would make me uncomfortable.”
The testimony and other evidence in the case suggest that concern about Jacobs’ workplace behavior was widely known.
“My impression was that Rick’s behavior was common knowledge among people who were my superiors,” testified Anna Bahr, a former Garcetti press secretary, “and my expectation of any repercussions for him was zero.”
Emmerling told NPR that Jacobs was seen as “beyond untouchable,” so people were reluctant to speak out. “Everyone would just say, ‘Well, he’s always gonna win. You’re never gonna push back against him or any of his behavior and prevail. So you truly don’t have a choice but to just accept it,’” Emmerling said.
Garcetti testified — and reiterated to NPR — that he never witnessed any inappropriate behavior of any kind from Jacobs.
“As someone who has spent years advocating for victims of sexual harassment, I was deeply saddened to learn about these allegations during the course of the litigation,” Garcetti told NPR in an email. “What frustrates me most is that I was only made aware of these allegations years later, in [a] lawsuit and through the press during a campaign to damage my political career. I wish these individuals — and their supervisors — had come forward while this behavior was allegedly taking place. Had that happened, I would have taken immediate action to stop it.”


One revelation from the records obtained by NPR is that the sexual harassment lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles was not the first time Jacobs faced a formal claim of workplace misconduct.
Because of a confidentiality agreement, the details of the accusation were hidden from the public. NPR is reporting them now for the first time.
While at City Hall, Jacobs served as the board treasurer of the Mayor’s Fund and also as a kind of liaison between the fund and Garcetti. After he left his city position, Garcetti wrote in an email that Jacobs “will continue to keep me apprised of and engaged in the excellent work the Fund is doing.”
In 2018, Jeremy Bernard, a former social secretary in the Obama White House, took on the role of CEO of the Mayor’s Fund. Bernard had been a close friend of Jacobs. But that relationship changed when Bernard became alarmed by Jacobs’ treatment of Mayor’s Fund employees.
Bernard testified that Jacobs “could be quite rude” to female employees and treated them poorly in comparison with male employees.
According to testimony from the case obtained by NPR, this was not an isolated concern for women in and around the Garcetti administration. Multiple people who worked in and around City Hall said under oath that Jacobs bullied and abused female colleagues.
Jacobs was “mean spirited and condescending,” was “very disrespectful and very demeaning” and “created a hostile work environment,” testified one senior adviser to Garcetti. He was “dismissive of women in general” and was “generally disliked among women at City Hall,” said a fundraiser for Garcetti. “He was belittling, demeaning, at times, cruel,” said a former press secretary for Garcetti. He was “short-tempered, very snappy and snide,” testified one former administration official. He was “controlling” and “made my life more difficult,” said another former official.
Bernard testified that he reported concerns about Jacobs’ treatment of female employees to the chair of the board of the Mayor’s Fund, Kathleen Brown, in April 2020. (Brown is a former California state treasurer, and her father, Pat Brown, and her brother, Jerry Brown, both served as governor of the state.)
A few days later, Bernard participated in a conference call with Brown and Jacobs. On that call, Bernard said, he was fired.
Bernard testified that he was “shocked and dismayed” by what took place and that he believes his firing was an act of retaliation for reporting workplace misconduct.
“Did you form an impression that Rick Jacobs retaliates against people that complain about him?” Bernard was asked in his deposition.
“Yeah. I think that is a fair assumption,” he replied.
There’s a reason this complaint has not been publicly reported before.
Bernard and Jacobs were bound by a “bilateral confidentiality” agreement surrounding the circumstances of Bernard’s firing, deposition testimony indicates. Bernard declined to comment to NPR in any way about the circumstances of his departure from the organization.
An attorney representing the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles, Lisa Von Eschen, told NPR in an email, “It is the policy of the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles not to comment on personnel matters,” and said that because of changes in the board membership, no current board members were involved in the decision. She did not answer a question about whether the organization still intends to enforce any confidentiality agreement about Bernard’s dismissal.
Brown, the former board chair, did not respond to multiple messages from NPR seeking comment.
Bernard testified that “I assume [Garcetti] knows” about the reason for his firing, but he was not certain.
Garcetti told NPR that he was not involved in personnel decisions of the Mayor’s Fund and was not aware of the circumstances of Bernard’s exit.
“Aside from one instance of a colleague complaining that Rick had taken credit for their work, and Rick calling that person territorial — a professional conflict which I helped resolve — no complaints about Rick were ever raised with me,” Garcetti told NPR. “As I’ve said too many times to count over the years — if anyone had ever made me aware of any inappropriate behavior, I would have acted to stop it.”

Two eyewitnesses testified that they heard Garcetti personally express concern about Jacobs’ behavior before the lawsuit made allegations of misconduct public.
“The mayor and his wife had a conversation in the car about Rick Jacobs’ inappropriate behavior,” testified LAPD officer Matthew Garza, who often drove with Garcetti around the city. “I believe they used the wording that it was going to eventually ‘bite them in the ass.’”
Garcetti and his wife testified that they did not have this conversation.
Bernard, the former CEO of the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles, testified that Garcetti told him something to the effect of, “I can’t believe Rick worked out at City Hall and that we got through it without a lawsuit.”
“I have never said that to anybody, publicly or privately,” Garcetti testified in his own deposition.
“And were you ever concerned that while Rick Jacobs worked at City Hall, that he might cause a lawsuit somehow?” asked Greg Smith, the attorney for Garza.
“No, I was not,” Garcetti replied.
NPR showed Garcetti’s testimony to Bernard.
“I’m surprised that he denied it. I heard it. And I heard him say it numerous times,” he said. “I find it hard to believe that he doesn’t remember it.”
Garcetti told NPR that he stands by his testimony.
He was also asked in his deposition whether he could recall Jacobs telling jokes at work.
When asked in his deposition whether he made “jokes of a sexual nature” in front of Garcetti’s LAPD protective detail, Jacobs replied, “Oh, it is possible.”
“Have you ever done it in front of the mayor as well?” Smith asked Jacobs.
“I don’t recall,” Jacobs responded.
Garcetti was more definitive.
“I can recall him laughing at jokes, but I can’t recall him telling a joke,” Garcetti testified.
“Did he ever tell any jokes dealing with men’s body parts that you recall?” Smith asked Garcetti.
“In my presence, no,” he replied.
“And you would have never laughed at — never laughed at anything. If you never heard it, you never laughed, right?” Smith added.
“I would’ve — not only did I not laugh, I did not hear it, I did not laugh. Had I heard it, I would not have laughed, and I would’ve taken action,” said Garcetti.
Emmerling told NPR that in her position as communications director, she attended a meeting with both Garcetti and Jacobs in which Jacobs made a joke “about snorting cocaine off of a man’s penis.”
“I think we all laughed,” Emmerling said, including Garcetti.
Garcetti denied Emmerling’s account to NPR.
“Absolutely not. This didn’t happen,” Garcetti wrote in his email to NPR. “I can say with certainty that I would remember a grotesque joke like that, and there’s simply no world in which I would allow that kind of a comment in a professional setting.”
Garcetti maintains that he honestly addressed all questions about the harassment allegations. He told NPR that any criticism that he failed to properly respond to harassment allegations as LA mayor was “silly.”
“I have personally supported victims of harassment my entire life and will continue to do so until the day I die,” Garcetti told NPR in an email. “I have been very honest even as this touched my own office that every one who has made an accusation deserves to be heard and investigated. What I cannot do is lie about my experience — what I have witnessed, what I have heard, what I have known.”
Emmerling told NPR that she “absolutely” believes Garcetti is lying.
“Once you tell your first lie, then you’re dug in,” she said. “And he has no choice now but to continue lying.”

GDPHBTZZLN_7JV90JXMW4VDJ61,A photographer captures life in America’s last remaining old-growth forests,By Ben de la Cruz,"Published September 3, 2024 at 6:57 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-09-03/a-photographer-captures-life-in-americas-last-remaining-old-growth-forests,"“As humans, our everyday lives are sustained by the behaviors and interactions of forest organisms,” photographer David Herasimtschuk writes of old growth forests. “Yet, because these processes and relationships occur in places and at scales rarely observed, our connection with forest biodiversity and the role it plays in nurturing our well-being often goes completely unnoticed.”
In the last 10 years, Herasimtschuk has photographed forests across the Pacific Northwest, documenting the inhabitants of these last remaining old-growth ecosystems. From salamanders and salmon to bears and mountain lions, his images illustrate not only the beauty of the forests and their creatures but the symbiotic relationships which are vital to the forests’ health and the planet’s welfare.
We interviewed Herasimtschuk about his efforts to educate people about the importance of preserving these ancient forests. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
What motivates you to photograph old-growth forests?
Protecting intact, mature and old-growth forests worldwide has been found to be one of the most immediate and cost-effective solutions to mitigating the impacts of climate change, yet adequate policy to manage these forests for ecosystem health and carbon storage has been limited.
The temperate rainforests of western North America have the highest carbon storage potential of any forest type in the world and are recognized as some of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet. Yet, conflicts over these forests have been ongoing since the 1980s, with the timber industry and conservation community battling over how they are managed.
Celebrating the beauty and importance of these environments, this photo essay is a present-day look at the complex connections we share with these forests. Currently, there are numerous proposed policy initiatives that are focused on creating a new framework for forest health and old-growth protection in the Pacific Northwest. This includes a movement to protect mature forests, which are made up of trees that are 80-150 years old and viewed as comprising the next generations of old-growth forests.
These legislative actions also contain policy to update and rethink how private and state forests are managed in the state of Oregon, as well as work to modernize forest protection on federal lands nationwide. In an effort to advance our country’s climate initiatives, the Biden administration enacted an executive order in 2022 that committed the federal government to protecting the few remaining mature and old-growth forests we have left. In response to that order, the U.S. Forest Service plans to make major revisions to both the National Forest Plan and Northwest Forest Plan this year.
With many decisions currently being discussed about the fate of our forests in the Pacific Northwest, it's important that the public and decision-makers understand how healthy forests function, and have the information they need to make science-based decisions in regard to forest management.
How long have you been working on this project?
I have been working, living and exploring in the Pacific Northwest since 2011, and started this old-growth focused project in 2022.
What kinds of images were you hoping to capture with your work?
From the top of the canopy to the waters below, my goal for this project is to create a series of photos that provide an entire ecosystem aesthetic. To do this, I work to create wide-angle images that put a species, or human, in context of the forest or habitat type.
Currently, a large amount of my work focuses on the connections between forests, rivers and fish. In the Pacific Northwest, the relationship between salmon and forests embodies a sense of connection that seems almost mystical. Delivering a pulse of nutrients, returning adult salmon nourish some of the largest trees in the world, and in return, these ancient forests provide a foundation for the complexity of conditions that salmon and other fish rely on. For millions of years, salmon, trout and numerous other aquatic species have adapted to the conditions created by these massive trees. From bank stabilization and water filtration to the creation of cover and spawning habitat, large trees provide a multitude of ecosystem services for aquatic environments.
To illustrate these relationships, or to show how these connections have been lost, I work to find opportunities where I can put fish and forests in the same image. This type of image often helps share the story of how forest management plays a critical role in salmon conservation.
What have you learned about the forest’s ecosystem since you’ve started this project?
One of the most important concepts I’ve come to understand while working on this project is that not all forests are equal. How we manage a forest can have huge repercussions that impact numerous species and processes, and can often lead to changes in ecosystem services that humans rely on.
Historically, the idea of old-growth forests as important natural systems was not the dominant perspective in our society. These ancient trees were once considered crops and perceived as “biological deserts.” Industrial logging in the 20th century removed most of the old growth, resulting in the younger forests we experience today. While some areas on federal land have been protected, allowing forests to regrow, there have also been large tracts of private land that are now managed for timber, and are cut every 50-80 years to meet the demand for timber.
Over the last 50 years, science has been working to understand how these impacts have changed forest ecosystems in the region. Beyond carbon sequestration, scientists are finding these environments play an important role in a multitude of ecosystem services, including water quantity and quality, and that management decisions can greatly impact these processes.
What have you learned that’s surprised you?
Looking beyond their physical beauty, scientists are discovering that old-growth forests are home to a network of almost unfathomable connections that showcase the importance and complexity of regions biodiversity. One of the greatest examples is the relationship between salmon and trees. Salmon are fundamental to the health of forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. As they return home to spawn and die, they bring with them a large pulse of nutrients that helps drive stream and forest ecosystems. By absorbing the nutrients from decaying fish, researchers have found that salmon actually provide nitrogen to trees, which is a limited nutrient in forest ecosystems. It’s even been discovered that certain tree species can grow up to three times faster when influenced by salmon. As populations of these vital fish continue to decline throughout the Pacific Northwest, scientists worry that trees and forests no longer receive nutrients they need to reach their full ecological potential.
Beyond the salmon and trees, some of the largest surprises in these forests come from some of the smallest species, like salamanders. Due to the cryptic nature of these amphibians, it's hard to grasp their true importance within an ecosystem, but recent research has demonstrated that these amphibians play an important role in the global carbon cycle.
In Northern California, scientists have revealed that, by hunting and preying on insects that spend their lives ripping, shredding and feeding on leaves — a behavior that actually releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — salamanders effectively prevent this carbon from entering the atmosphere and allow it to stay locked in leaves and on the forest floor.
What is your process for documenting the wildlife in the forest? Do you need special equipment?
Working and photographing in old-growth forests definitely comes with a unique set of challenges, and through trial and error, I’ve been able to develop methods that work relatively well in these environments. Documenting these forests from an ecosystem perspective often means I need a wide range of gear. This includes everything from underwater housings and drysuits to document fish, to camera traps to photograph large mammals like bears.
For me, personally, I also really enjoy the process and exploration that goes into the creation of each photograph. For each image, this often results in many miles hiked, and snorkeled, to learn the best locations and approaches to photograph different species. Most days aren’t a great success, photographically speaking, but I love being in the forest, and with each outing, I feel like I learn a little more.
Do you work with scientists studying forest ecosystems? If so, how does that collaboration work?
Working at the confluence of science, conservation and storytelling, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with many passionate scientists working at the forefront of forest ecology. Much of the imagery created for this project has been guided and inspired by the research and science from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a forest co-managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Oregon State University. Tucked in the Cascade Mountain Range in western Oregon, this long-term ecological research site is one of the most studied old-growth ecosystems on the planet and has laid the foundation for forest science, understanding and policy worldwide.
As we move forward in our approach to address climate change, finding engaging and novel ways to communicate science becomes more important than ever. Working closely with the researchers who are uncovering the importance and mysteries of our natural world, this project focuses on creating imagery that sparks curiosity and helps celebrate the interactions and relationships in nature that are difficult to see.
What are some of your favorite images?
I think some of my favorite images so far for this project have been the ones created using camera traps. Communicating the size of old-growth trees is often difficult, so it’s helpful to have a subject in the image to convey scale. Few species symbolize wild environments better than mountain lions and bears, so to be able to create images of these elusive predators as they explore their old-growth habitats is truly special.
Creating a useful image with a camera trap can often take months of work and fine-tuning, and even then, it’s rare to get the shot you hoped for. The cameras sit in the forests for long periods of time, exposed to the elements and curious wildlife. It’s not uncommon to return to a trap to find it has been dismantled by a bear or knocked over from falling trees and branches.
Yet, with a little luck and a lot of persistence, every now and then you create a photo where all the elements come together. These unique photos provide an intimate perspective of these environments that few have ever seen, making them a valuable tool to help teach audiences about the importance of these forests.
What do you want people to come away with after looking at these images?
As the climate and planet continue to change, many people are trying to understand and grasp how the natural world is connected to their everyday lives. So often, the question is asked, what is the value of an individual species? Or what is the value of biodiversity? By creating storytelling imagery that helps audiences recognize the relevance of forest life, my hope is that this project will engage and inform audiences about the importance of old-growth ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Bringing to attention the individual species and relationships within ecosystems that play a role in maintaining our planet, my goal is to spark curiosity and wonder, encouraging people to want to learn more.
As our demand and impact on forests continues to grow worldwide, I believe images and stories of the environments and species affected will play a critical role in visually connecting forest ecosystems to their would-be stewards. Understanding the importance of biodiversity and how forests function is a critical part in creating that connection.

H8GPDCIJ2J_G6NNOVJ2N7OC2S5,Trump deputy campaign manager identified in Arlington National Cemetery dustup,"By Stephen Fowler,","Published September 5, 2024 at 5:47 PM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-05/trump-deputy-campaign-manager-identified-in-arlington-national-cemetery-dustup,"One of two staffers involved in the altercation at Arlington National Cemetery is a deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump’s reelection bid, NPR has learned. The former president insisted this week the incident did not happen, highlighting a growing disconnect between the messaging of the candidate and his campaign. NPR is identifying both staffers after the campaign’s conflicting responses to the incident last week outside Section 60 of the cemetery, where many casualties of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The two staffers, according to a source with knowledge of the incident, are deputy campaign manager Justin Caporale and Michel Picard, a member of Trump’s advance team.
Caporale is a one time aide to former first lady Melania Trump who left the White House to work for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before returning to the Trump campaign. He was also listed as the on-site contact and project manager for the Women for America First rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 where Trump urged the crowd to “stop the steal” before some of them stormed the U.S. Capitol.
After Trump participated in a wreath laying ceremony on the third anniversary of the deadly bombing at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members, Trump visited Section 60 at the invitation of some family members and friends of the fallen soldiers.
ANC rules, that had been made clear to the Trump campaign in advance, say that only an official Arlington photographer can take pictures or film in Section 60. When an ANC employee tried to enforce the rules, she was verbally abused by the two Trump campaign operatives, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. Picard then pushed her out of the way according to two Pentagon officials.

After NPR first reported the altercation last week, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said they were “prepared to release footage” of the incident, and attacked the Arlington employee as someone “clearly suffering from a mental health episode.” Cheung also said they were granted access to have a photographer present, and pointed to a statement from Gold Star family members that invited Trump to attend the ceremony.
The campaign also released a TikTok video that included video footage from Section 60, including a smiling Trump flashing a thumbs up with family members at the gravesites. But other tombstones are visible in the picture, and at least one family of a fallen Green Beret has confirmed they did not give permission for his grave to be filmed or used in a campaign ad.
The Army released a statement last Thursday acknowledging that a cemetery employee “was abruptly pushed aside” and the campaign was warned ahead of time of the prohibition against photography and political activities at Arlington. The Army said the cemetery employee tried to de-escalate the situation after she was pushed, in hopes of not upsetting the Gold Star families in attendance.
The Army said a police report of the incident was filed, but that the employee had declined to press charges, and that the Army considered the matter closed, but added that “the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked.”
When NPR emailed both Caporale and Picard, Cheung responded, “I see you've been emailing some of our team members…As the Army has said, they consider this matter closed. President Trump was there to support the Gold Star families and honor the sacrifices their loved ones made.”
Cheung also included a social media post that shows a Biden campaign ad from 2020 that used images of the then-vice president at the cemetery in 2010.
Neither Cheung, Picard or Caporale responded to emailed requests for comment as of publication time. Reached by phone, Caporale referred questions to Cheung. The Trump campaign has still not followed through on its pledge to release video of the incident, despite repeated requests from NPR.
This week, Trump contradicted his own campaign with a post on Truth Social falsely calling the confrontation a “made up story by Comrade Kamala and her misinformation squad” that attacked Harris and Biden for not attending the private ceremony.
In an interview on Sean Hannity’s radio show Tuesday, Trump reiterated the false assertion that nothing happened at the cemetery, questioning the motives of the unnamed employee and downplaying the accusations as attacks over “publicity.”
“Do you notice that the person represented now doesn’t want to talk, he doesn’t want to speak or talk?” Trump asked, mislabeling the employee as male. “The nice thing, the beautiful thing, was all the parents and relatives got together and they said ‘That’s a false story, it was totally false.’”
Former President Trump polls well among veterans, and has many vocal supporters with military ties. Some of the family members who invited him to Arlington also spoke at the Republican National Convention, bashing Biden and vocally endorsing Trump.
""Joe Biden may have forgotten that our children died, but we have not forgotten — Donald Trump has not forgotten,"" said Cheryl Juels in Milwaukee at the RNC in July. Juels is the aunt of Sgt. Nicole Gee, one of the service members killed at Abbey Gate in 2021, during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal.
""Joe Biden owes the men and women that served in Afghanistan a debt of gratitude and an apology. Donald Trump loves this country and will never forget the sacrifice and bravery of our service members,"" she added. ""Join us in putting him back in the White House.""
But those families do not have the power to suspend the rules at Arlington, where Section 60 is a fresh and on-going memorial to hundreds of recent war dead that, like the rest of the cemetery, is meant to be above politics.
The family of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a Green Beret who died by suicide after serving multiple combat tours and who is buried in Section 60, said according to their conversations with the cemetery, ""the Trump campaign staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit.""
""We hope that those visiting this sacred site understand that there were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected and treated accordingly,"" they said in a statement.
Jimmy McCain, a US Marine whose father was the late senator John McCain, also condemned the visit.
Trump has a history of controversial remarks about the military - he insulted Sen. John McCain for being a prisoner of war. He allegedly called dead soldiers ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" and recently stoked controversy for saying civilian Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients are much better than those who received the Medal of Honor — the highest military award in the country, often given posthumously.


The incident at Arlington National Cemetery is the latest example of conflict between the messaging efforts of Trump’s campaign and the candidate himself since President Biden ended his reelection bid and Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee.
The campaign’s attempts to use the bombing anniversary to attack Harris over the Afghanistan withdrawal, complete with videos from Gold Star family members blaming the administration for the deaths of their loved ones, has been overshadowed by the politicization of Arlington and its hallowed status.
Last week, both Trump and campaign staff sought to clean up his stance on abortion rights and a ballot measure in his home state of Florida. Trump initially seemed to signal support for the proposed amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and posted that his second term would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.”
After backlash from anti-abortion advocates and a statement from the campaign saying that Trump did not say how he would vote on the referendum, Trump eventually told a Fox News reporter he would vote against it.
Trump has also publicly questioned the rules, format and fairness for next week’s debate even as his campaign accepted the conditions and has worked behind the scenes to iron out details.
In a town hall conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity Wednesday, Trump called debate host ABC News “dishonest” and implied without evidence that Harris would get questions in advance.
The debate will be a pivotal moment for Trump to try and regain momentum against Harris, who has erased Trump’s onetime commanding lead in the polls in the seven key battleground states.
In the six weeks since the switch up on the Democratic side of the race, an NPR review of Trump campaign speeches has found the former president struggling to pivot a campaign tailor-made to beat Biden into focus against his new opponent.

IXXVF3YSDR_5KW0C47VY4RRQ4Y,Navy commander relieved of duty after photo showed him firing rifle with scope backward,By The Associated Press,"Published September 4, 2024 at 10:31 AM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-04/navy-commander-relieved-of-duty-after-photo-showed-him-firing-rifle-with-scope-backward,"SAN DIEGO — The commander of a Navy destroyer that’s helping protect the San Diego-based aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Middle East has been relieved of duty about four months after he was seen in a photo firing a rifle with a scope mounted backward.
The image brought the Navy considerable ridicule on social media. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Cameron Yaste, commanding officer of the destroyer USS John McCain, was removed on Friday.
The Navy said Yaste was relieved of duty “due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command the guided-missile destroyer” that's currently deployed in the Gulf of Oman. The statement didn't elaborate about why Yaste was replaced.
In April, a photo posted on the Navy's social media showed Yaste in a firing stance gripping the rifle with a backward scope.
The military news outlet Stars and Stripes reported that the Marine Corps took a dig at the Navy, sharing a photo on its social media of a Marine firing a weapon aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer. The caption read: “Clear Sight Picture.”
The post featuring Yaste was ultimately deleted. “Thank you for pointing out our rifle scope error in the previous post,” the Navy later wrote on social media. “Picture has been removed until EMI (extra military instruction) is completed.”
Yaste has been temporarily replaced by Capt. Allison Christy, deputy commodore of Destroyer Squadron 21, which is part of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group that's also in the Gulf of Oman.
The Pentagon sent the carriers to the Middle East to be in position should Israel need help repelling an attack by Iran or other countries, if such a thing happens, military officials said.
The Roosevelt is the flagship of a strike group that has recently included three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, $2 billion vessels that are designed to shield carriers from attacks by air, sea and land.

K41T2TWESR_XFOWE26Y4S2OMVK,"From lost followers to backlash in the comments, content creators reflect on the DNC",By Elena Moore,"Published September 1, 2024 at 4:00 AM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-01/from-lost-followers-to-backlash-in-the-comments-content-creators-reflect-on-the-dnc,"Merrick Hanna is, by any metric, a TikTok star.
The 19-year-old has more than 32 million followers on the platform and about 20 million across YouTube and Instagram. He’s known for his dancing videos, typically set to viral audio clips and pop songs.
Attending the Democratic National Convention definitely wasn't his normal style. And he wasn't sure it was a good idea.
“I've never made a video even talking vaguely about politics,” he told NPR about a week after the DNC had wrapped up. “It was only when I mentioned the opportunity to my grandmother that she told me that she had gone to the DNC in 1960 as a volunteer and thought it was an amazing experience and that I should go, too.”
Hanna was one of more than 200 credentialed content creators at the Democratic convention, almost three times as many compared to those at the Republican's convention in July.
The move is part of a larger push by the Democratic Party to reach Americans who don’t consume traditional political news, which includes many younger voters, who disproportionately use TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat at higher rates compared to older generations.
The Democratic Party is banking on the support of voters under 30 this fall, and despite increases in turnout over the past few election cycles, it’s a growing generation with largely untapped electoral might.
That goal puts potential value on working with digital creators, who may have more of a direct line to new voters. However, while some influencers who attended the DNC regularly post about news, elections and voting, and likely have political audiences, others, like Hanna, do not.
Instead, Hanna’s goal, he said, was to make entertaining videos devoid of personal political views.
“That proved to be a bit of a challenge,” he admitted.
His videos garnered between a few hundred thousand and a million views, which the teenage creator characterized as average. But he also fielded criticism online for attending the event.
Reflecting on the experience, he said that while he enjoyed the convention, navigating how to do his style of work was “tricky” and “slightly stressful.”
“The DNC is kind of a one-time event for me. I don't want to become a political creator,” he said. “This one time was an incredible experience. I loved it. But I'm not sure I want to go to more.”


Democrats have worked with influencers in the past, including during President Biden's 2020 campaign and his term in the White House. In Chicago, digital creators brought in more than 350 million views while at the convention, according to the DNC.
Hanna wasn’t the only creator who had to balance keeping his audience engaged, regardless of political appetite. It was something many creators struggled with, Nadya Okamoto told NPR.
“It wasn't startling to my followers,” the lifestyle creator said, referring to her decision to attend the DNC.
On top of her vlog-like posts, the 26-year-old influencer and entrepreneur is known for her work destigmatizing periods and runs the period product company, August. She calls herself a progressive and said she's previously lost thousands of followers over her support for abortion access.
Coming to the DNC, she admitted feeling some nervousness about how getting political could affect her work — but it didn’t change her decision to attend.
“I'm kind of in this awkward space where I'm a very forward-facing co-founder of a venture-backed company that has national retail partners. But I'm also an individual. I'm also an American voter,” she said. “But I think that's the nature of politics, right? Whether it was me posting to 5 million followers or to a family chat of five people, you're going to get that pushback. And I think that's why the conversations are so important to have.”
While in Chicago for the convention, Okamoto posted on TikTok nearly two dozen times. She talked about her support for Harris and shared multiple interviews with public figures, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
But Okamoto still kept to her typical style: giving short, candid updates on her experience at the convention.
“I’m unsurprised that the videos that performed the best weren’t substantially about politics,” she said, pointing to a post with her sisters that had the highest engagement with nearly 850,000 views.
“It's challenging because obviously, it's like you're dealing with an audience that cares about values and issues, which to them is not inherently politics — and if anything has been like quite the opposite of politics,” she said.
Tori Dunlap faced a similar situation. She runs the platform Her First 100K, which helps women learn how to invest and save their money, and has more than 4.5 million followers across social media platforms.
“We saw a hit to our follower counts when I started posting that we were attending the DNC and covering it, which honestly shocked me,” Dunlap said, telling NPR she lost about 10,000 followers on Instagram, where she has about 2.1 million in total.
“It felt very, very obvious maybe what my politics were or what they might be,” she added, highlighting that her podcast and book are called Financial Feminist.
But Dunlap, who just turned 30, said the criticism didn't faze her. Instead, she was extremely moved to attend the convention.
“Posts performed as well as our normal content, if not better,” she said. “The photos of me just absolutely so excited and losing it … We're continuing to see a lot of love on those posts.”
A post shared by Tori Dunlap — Money Expert (@herfirst100k)
But among that love, some of her followers expressed their disappointment with Dunlap’s decision to attend, so she responded.
“I’m so tired of watching everyone fight in the comments. Just because you vote for a candidate or party doesn’t mean you like everything about them or their policies,” she wrote in the comments. “I was honored to represent my platform and advocate for you all.”
Dunlap told NPR she went to the DNC to encourage her followers to participate and feel they have a voice.
Also, while her brand may be about money, its political roots run deep. Dunlap said that her opposition to former President Donald Trump’s win in 2016 motivated her to help women gain a stronger understanding of their finances. For these reasons, she said she doesn’t see a dip in followers as a loss.
“It's not an airport. You don't need to announce your departure,” she said. “If you don't want to talk about politics, first of all, that's a massive privilege. And second of all, it's OK. You can just leave, and you can find content elsewhere.”

KBWIS2NZ7G_6F9TOUAN8IA2DF6,Deadly suicide blast kills at least six in Kabul,By D. Parvaz,"Published September 2, 2024 at 3:10 PM CDT",20240902,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-02/deadly-suicide-blast-kills-at-least-six-in-kabul,"At least six people have been killed and 13 more have been injured in a suicide bombing in the Afghan capital of Kabul.
Khalid Zadran, the spokesman for the Kabul police chief, told the Associated Press that the dead included a woman, and that all of the injured were civilians.
The explosion took place in the Qala Bakhtiar neighborhood of Kabul, and quoting Zadran, Afghanistan’s Tolo News reported that the bomber “concealed explosives on their body.”
No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing yet, although ISIS-K, a faction of the self-proclaimed Islamic State, sporadically carries out attacks around the country. They frequently target Afghanistan’s minority Shia population, although schools and maternity hospitals have also been struck by deadly attacks.
Until August 2021, the Taliban were responsible for much of the violence in Afghanistan as they fought with U.S. and NATO forces.
But once the group took over the country three years ago and U.S. and NATO troops fully withdrew, they promised Afghans a greater measure of security.
That promise was immediately tested when ISIS-K launched twin attacks on Kabul’s international airport and the nearby Baron Hotel on Aug. 26, 2021.
Nearly 200 people were killed, including 13 members of the U.S. military. Most of those killed were Afghan civilians.
Although ISIS-K and the Taliban are both Sunni groups, their ideologies differ.
As the Taliban re-stablished the control they lost over Afghanistan in 2001, ISIS-K has stepped up its recruiting tactics and attacks, often going after the very groups the Taliban promised to keep safe: Women, children, minorities, and even foreign dignitaries.
In September of 2022, an ISIS attack outside the Russian embassy in Kabul killed 2 embassy staff. Three months later, another attack targeted the Pakistani embassy in Kabul, wounding a guard inside the embassy compound.

KMG80SSDQT_W6U5T9VTUYO9HK3,Hip-hop artist Fatman Scoop dies at 53 after collapsing on stage,By The Associated Press,"Published August 31, 2024 at 8:21 PM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-08-31/hip-hop-artist-fatman-scoop-dies-at-53-after-collapsing-on-stage,"NEW YORK — Fatman Scoop, the hip-hop artist who topped charts in Europe with “Be Faithful” in the early 2000s and later lent his distinctive voice and ebullient vibe to hits by artists including Missy Elliott and Ciara, died after collapsing on stage at a show in Connecticut, according to officials and his family. He was 53.
The cause of his death wasn't immediately clear.
He was performing at Hamden Town Center Park when he collapsed Friday evening, town chief of staff Sean Grace said Saturday. Mayor Lauren Garrett posted on Facebook that he had a medical emergency. Concertgoers and paramedics tried to aid the artist, who was taken to a hospital, she said.
His family said in an Instagram post that “the world lost a radiant soul, a beacon on stage and in life.”
With a gravelly voice and dance-floor-friendly sensibility, Fatman Scoop was a mainstay of club playlists around the turn of the millennium. But if the world knew him as the “voice of the club,” his family cherished him as “the laughter in our lives, a constant source of support, unwavering strength and courage,” his relatives said.
“His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity. His joy was infectious and the generosity he extended to all will be deeply missed but never forgotten,” they added, saying he leaves a legacy “of love and brightness.”
Born Isaac Freeman III, Fatman Scoop was from New York City’s Harlem neighborhood and broke out with 1999’s “Be Faithful.” What started as a minor success in the U.S. took off in Europe with a 2003 re-release, hitting No. 1 on the singles charts in the U.K. and Ireland.
The next year, he appeared on the U.K. television series “Chancers,” in which musicians mentored artists who wanted to make it in the U.S., the BBC reported. He also was a contestant on “Celebrity Big Brother 16: UK vs USA,” which was filmed in the U.K. and aired in 2015.
Scoop — sometimes stylized as Fat Man Scoop or FatMan Scoop — collaborated with Elliott on “Lose Control,” a 2005 song of the summer that also featured Ciara. The track won a short-form music video Grammy at the 2006 award show.
The same year as “Lose Control,” he was featured on Mariah Carey’s “It’s Like That.” He also was featured on tracks from Timbaland, David Guetta, The Situation and Skrillex, among other artists. In 2018, he reunited with Elliott and Ciara for a remix of the latter’s “Level Up.”
Elliott praised Scoop's “VOICE and energy” Saturday on X, saying he had contributed to many songs that made people happy over more than two decades.
“Your IMPACT is HUGE & will be NEVER be forgotten,” she added.
His longtime booking agency, MN2S, described him as an artist with “boundless enthusiasm,” a passion for music and a voice and personality that ""made an indelible mark on the industry.”
His MN2S representative, Sharron Elkabas, said in a statement Saturday that she had spoken to him a few days earlier.
“He was in such good spirits. It’s hard to believe he is no longer with us,” she said.

LMJIFWFNJL_C6SALLF4A47FIT0,Whatever happened to ... the Rohingya refugee who won a U.N. award for his photos?,By Maria Isabel Barros Guinle,"Published September 1, 2024 at 6:19 AM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-01/whatever-happened-to-the-rohingya-refugee-who-won-a-u-n-award-for-his-photos,"Since 2017, the Rohingya people from Myanmar have been fleeing anti-Muslim persecution in their predominantly Buddhist country. Most have fled to neighboring Bangladesh, where many now live in makeshift communities around Cox’s Bazar district.
About half of those living in the refugee camps are children. Despite fleeing violence in their home country, the Rohingya people continue to face threats of disease, hunger and natural disasters in their settlements.
Over the past year, the conflict between rebel forces and government troops in Myanmar has brought new refugees to the settlements. According to a statement issued this month by the group Refugees International: ""In Rakhine state, increased fighting between Myanmar’s military junta and the AA (Arakan Army) ... has both caught Rohingya in the middle and seen them targeted. The AA has advanced and burned homes in Buthidaung, Maungdaw, and other towns, recently using drones to bomb villages,”
According to the Associated Press: ""UNICEF said that the agency received alarming reports that civilians, particularly children and families, were being targeted or caught in the crossfire, resulting in deaths and severe injuries.""
In December 2023, we featured four Rohingya photographers who were the Asia-Pacific regional winners of the United Nations’ annual Nansen Refugee Award, which recognizes exceptional effort to protect refugees, displaced and stateless people. These photographers are among the nearly one million people who live as refugees in Bangladesh. This week, we followed up with one of the photographers, Sahat Zia Hero, to ask how life has been since then.
How have things been since we last spoke in December?
We have been very busy. I participated in a lot of exhibitions in Bangladesh. I also organized photo contests for the young photographers in the camp. I am the founder of Rohingyatographer Magazine, and we have a team of more than 30 photographers, including 11 women. Every day, they share their photos with us, and we post them on social media. And every month we select three winners — one from Facebook, another from Instagram and another from Twitter [now known as X]. I sponsor an award for the three winners every month.
How can you afford to sponsor a prize?
I have some funds from my Prince Claus Seeds Award [for work that makes a positive contribution to society] and Nansen Refugee Regional Award. This really encourages [the winners] and motivates them to keep getting better.
We [also] just won the Casa Asia awards in the category of Diversity, Inclusion and Sustainable Development. I was invited to receive the award in Madrid, but I could not attend because I don’t have any formal identity or passport. But we celebrated the award, and we are grateful and so happy to be recognized.
Our hard work, resilience, skills and talent made it possible to win this award. We can use this opportunity to further develop more collective work and make sure the plight of Rohingya people is heard.
You have been vocal about the importance of drawing attention to the challenges of the Rohingya community. Did the U.N. recognition make any difference?
Yes. It’s important that the Rohingya photographers get recognized by the U.N., the public and the international community. I hope to [continue to] draw the attention from the international community to amplify the voice of my community to solve the Rohingya crisis.
Could you elaborate on the current state of the Rohingya crisis? How are things going in Myanmar?
Right now, we are a million people living in the camps, and the conflict in the Arakan state [now known as Rakhine state] is still unfolding. More people from Myanmar are still fleeing and coming to the refugee camp due to the violence between the Arakan army and the Myanmar military.
Both the Myanmar military and the Arakan army target the Rohingya people. They are bombing our villages and homes, killing people. In June, more than 30 people were killed in the fight between the Arakan army and the Myanmar military — including children and women. Most were killed in the bombardments when they were sleeping in their homes.
There are whole families that were affected by the bombs, so there are a lot of people injured. Thousands of people were displaced, but most of them can’t find a way to flee.
The Rohingya people in Arakan don’t have food, security or health care. The hospitals are all closed. [In June], MSF [Doctors Without Borders] withdrew their activities from that area. And the rebels have been looting from the people. So the Rohingya people are facing a very difficult situation — they have nowhere to go, nowhere to flee, [and are] moving from one village to another village. The war continues. And no one is safe there. Nowhere is safe. I am really concerned.
And how is life at the refugee settlement in Bangladesh?
Living in this refugee camp is getting worse due to the decreased funds from the U.N. and international community. I am very concerned about the future of the young generation. They are facing food crises, water crises [and] health crises. We must find a solution so we can rebuild the hope and future of the young generation and the Rohingya people.
Last month, there was very heavy rain and landslides. Hundreds of families were displaced in the camp. This happens every year during the monsoon. The landslides demolish our shelters while we are sleeping. It is difficult to take all the bodies from the mud because we don’t have the equipment, so we have to take them with our hands. We don’t get emergency support from the rescue team if it happens at night. It takes a long time to come to help.
What do you wish people knew about the Rohingya refugees?
This a tough life.
We are humans too, and we have the right to seek a better life like other people around the world. So we need support from the international community to really focus on the Rohingya crisis to find a solution.
How can the international community help?
If the international community joins with the government of Bangladesh and makes dialogue with the Myanmar government and Arakan army to not target the Rohingya people, who are already vulnerable, then we can help ensure their safety. Maybe we can see a way to repatriate the Rohingya people in refugee camps.
Is seeking asylum elsewhere possible? Do you have any desire or plans to move?
It is hard for me to stay in the camp, and sometimes I think about seeking asylum in another country to study there. I could not complete my graduation in Myanmar — I got to my second year but could not complete my three years there. Completing graduation in the university was my dream — I wanted to be an engineer. I still want to study computer science. But I stay in the camp for the community — to do something for them.
Right now, I am empowering the community. [Many] people like me who are a bit educated or talented leave the camp, so the community feels like they are being forgotten. I like to encourage them to know we are not leaving them behind, we are staying together, we are fighting together. Staying with them encourages them to stay resilient, so that’s why I am still living here instead of finding opportunity for resettlement.
What are your plans for the future? What are you most excited about?
I hope for the world to recognize our resilience and acknowledge our work. For the world to hear the voice of our community and see [our] situation to generate empathy and action.
I want to do more projects with women photographers so we can ensure that women’s voices are also heard. But we have not received any sponsorship to fund us this year. But if we get any funding from generous donors or others who want to support our work, we can amplify the voices of the Rohingya women.

M2OPC6ZJ2I_6TYI4VPKJPGR56P,Whatever happened to ... the young Afghan musicians who fled after the Taliban took over?,By Anastasia Tsioulcas,"Published September 3, 2024 at 6:54 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-03/whatever-happened-to-the-young-afghan-musicians-who-fled-after-the-taliban-took-over,"Three years ago, nearly 300 young Afghan musicians, their teachers and staff from their music school fled Afghanistan in fear for their lives after their country fell again to the Taliban. NPR followed them on their journey from Kabul to a new life as refugees in northern Portugal. We caught up with them this summer, just before they toured the U.S. as the Afghan Youth Orchestra.
The Afghanistan National Institute of Music represented an exciting vision of Afghanistan. It brought together kids from all over the country, boys and girls alike, from vastly different socioeconomic circumstances, ethnicities and language groups, says Ahmad Sarmast, the school’s director. He founded the school in 2010.
""I think one thing that connects us is not just our nationality or language or religion but playing music,"" Sarmast observes. ""Making music together also plays a significant role in keeping our identity as a community.""
That shared love of music is what binds them together.
""The group is very diverse, like Afghanistan itself,"" he says. ""The community of the Afghanistan National Institute of Music is a mosaic, a smaller mosaic of the beautiful, diverse Afghanistan.""
The school quickly gained international prominence; its musicians even toured the U.S. in 2013, including a performance at New York City's Carnegie Hall. It seemed like a new era was dawning.
But even before the Taliban seized power again in 2021, everyone at the school knew that they were still at serious risk. The danger became very real: A suicide bomber attacked one of their concerts and severely injured Sarmast, who was sitting just a few seats from the attacker.
""Our school was in the high hit list of the Taliban. They attacked one of our performances in 2014, where two people were killed and I was injured,"" he says.
Sarmast was nearly killed in that attack — with 11 pieces of shrapnel lodged in his skull — and his hearing was severely damaged. Over the next few years, there were several more planned attacks on the school and Sarmast himself, all of which were foiled.
Once the Taliban again took control of Afghanistan in 2021, however, he felt there was no other choice. Once again, schooling for girls past the sixth grade has been banned. So has playing and listening to music — and the Taliban have seized and burned instruments.
""We knew when the Taliban was going to come [back],"" Sarmast says, ""our school will be the first target, and it will be the beginning of another cultural genocide.""

So in the fall of 2021, with the assistance of the governments of Qatar and Portugal, students, faculty, staff and some family members were airlifted out of Kabul and resettled together as a community. They were going to recreate the musical heart of Afghanistan — in northern Portugal, near Braga.
I visited them in Portugal in the fall of 2022, not long after they had been moved from temporary quarters in Lisbon to Braga, a quieter area not far from the border with Spain.
They were still settling in, enrolling in local schools and getting used to the food. I ate lunch with some of the teenage students at a local Catholic charitable organization, where most of them politely pushed plainly cooked fish and overboiled Brussels sprouts around their plates. It was a world away from the spiced meats and pilafs of their homeland.
But the taste of home came when they pulled out their instruments — such as the sitar, santoor, rubab and harmonium — and began rehearsing traditional Afghan music.
They love playing and are fulfilling their lifetime dreams of being musicians. But also, they understand their responsibilities, says 15-year-old Zohra Ahmadi, who plays trumpet.
""We are the voice of a country that has no music,"" she says. ""It’s a bit sad to think about it, that we are the only ones playing.""
Sarmast, the school’s director, says the school's mission has expanded and become even more urgent. He says his students must be the ones to preserve their country's music from more than 4,000 miles away. He says it's not just a mission: It's a duty to the country they had to flee.
""Now, we are responsible for safeguarding Afghan music,"" Sarmast says firmly. ""Advocating for the music rights and cultural rights of the Afghan people, and for freedom of expression, through music in all its forms and freedom. And also actively advocating for stopping gender apartheid in Afghanistan.""
While they are learning so much material that celebrates rich, ancient and deep musical traditions from across Afghanistan, they are also solidly becoming part of a new country.
Seventeen-year-old Elham Asefi plays guitar. He says the Portuguese locals have been very welcoming and friendly, and are patient in helping them master yet another language. ""The Portugal people are very kind,"" he says fondly. ""Like, they help us.""
And at long last, many of the students are looking forward to being reunited with family members in Portugal — hopefully very soon, Sarmast says.
""We are all waiting for the arrival of the families from Afghanistan to Portugal,"" he notes. ""We have the approval of the government of Portugal — 368 people to reunite with their families.""

In the meantime, these young Afghan musicians are finally back to touring internationally, bringing their music and message to new audiences. Recent appearances have included performances across the U.K. and at the 2023 United Nations Human Rights Conference in Switzerland.
Visiting this U.S. in August, they performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City and at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
Both trumpeter Zohra Ahmadi and guitarist Elham Asefi are thrilled to be visiting the U.S. — particularly to perform at Carnegie.
""Really excited!"" Ahmadi exclaims, giggling.
""We're really excited,"" Asefi chimes in. ""It's a big stage, the stage we play at Carnegie Hall. Every musician has a dream to play there.""
They say that no matter what, they will continue to be a voice for Afghanistan across the world — a voice that refuses to be silenced.

M6DYGM80AH_36H1IYQKH30NT75,Tim Walz's NRA rating went from A to F. It's part of a shift from Democrats on guns,"By Mia Venkat,","Published September 5, 2024 at 4:00 AM CDT",20240806,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-05/tim-walzs-nra-rating-went-from-a-to-f-its-part-of-a-shift-from-democrats-on-guns,"Tim Walz addressed something head-on at the Democratic National Convention last month, as he accepted the party's nomination for vice president — it was guns.
“Look, I know guns. I'm a veteran. I'm a hunter. I was a better shot than most Republicans in Congress and I have the trophies to prove it,"" he said. ""But I'm also a dad. I believe in the Second Amendment, but I also believe that our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.”
Walz used to be such a strong defender of gun rights that the NRA gave him an A rating at the start of his political career. Today, his grade is an F.
That reflects a larger shift in the Democratic Party and points to where gun policy might be headed if Democrats win the presidential election in November.


In the early 2000s, Democratic candidates lived in fear of talking about guns and would shut down any suggestion that they campaign on it, says Matt McTighe, a party consultant for hire at the time.
“Even the candidates themselves would say, ‘I’m totally good on the issue. I will support background checks. I’ll support all the policies. But we just can’t talk about it. It’s not a winning issue. There’s no constituency for it. Just don’t make me say anything about it.’”
Today, McTighe is with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. He says if you want to see the change in the party over time, you just have to look at a forum his group sponsored in August of 2019, where the leading Democratic primary candidates met in Iowa specifically to talk about guns.
“And they all showed up on, like, four days’ notice and they were all trying to outdo one another on who could have the most robust gun safety policy,” he said.
Also in attendance at that forum was then-senator and presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, who said in her address:
“The president of the United States has to stand up to the NRA and say, ‘Enough is enough. I’m not going to any longer accept your false choice that you’re either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away,’ and that we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country, including universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapons ban.”


At a side panel during the Democratic National Convention, two unlikely groups came together for a joint event titled: “Protecting Future Generations: The Power of Reproductive Rights and Gun Safety on the Ballot.”
It’s not an obvious choice to put abortion and guns side by side as campaign issues.
Every time abortion has been on the ballot since Roe v Wade was overturned, voters have chosen to expand reproductive rights — you can’t say the same for guns.
But for Angela Ferrell-Zabala — the executive director of the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, who spoke at the DNC event — changing views on gun laws is possible.
“We've done so much to move this issue that used to be a third rail,” she said, adding that in 2010, a quarter of congressional Democrats aligned with the NRA or had an A rating from the association. This year, only one Democratic House candidate and no Democratic Senate candidates received an A grade.
There were a few turning points that led to this change, says Matt Lacombe — the author of Firepower: How the NRA Turned Gun Owners Into a Political Force.
For one, the NRA became increasingly aligned and intertwined with the Republican Party, making it easier for Democrats to take the opposing stance. The NRA also became embroiled in some internal conflicts, scandal and legal challenges that have weakened and distracted it. And then gun deaths have become increasingly prominent in American society, along with school shooter drills that make gun violence front of mind for many parents.
Put all that together, and many Americans started to feel more strongly about gun safety laws.

“The advantage that Republicans used to have on this issue was a result of the fact that the pro-gun side cared a lot more about it than the gun control side,” Lacombe says. “That has flipped in a way that maybe hasn’t had the impact that reproductive rights has, but that nonetheless sort of changes which constituencies of each party end up being most important, electorally.”
In fact, Congress recently passed its first major gun legislation since the 1990s. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act expanded background checks and funding for red flag laws, among other things. President Biden signed it into law in June 2022.


It’s not surprising that gun safety activists and blue state politicians claim progress on this issue. But Democrats in purple states are also finding footing, like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also spoke at the “Protecting Future Generations” event at the Democratic National Convention.
Whitmer told NPR that talking about guns and reproductive rights helped her party win a majority in the Michigan state legislature. She calls these “freedom” issues.
“Do I have the freedom to make my own decisions about my body and my future and my family? Do I have the freedom to drop my child off at school and not worry that they are going to spend the whole day thinking about where their easiest exit place is, as opposed to being able to focus on what the lesson is of the day?”
This is part of a trend. These days you don’t often hear Democrats talk about gun control — the phrase you hear is “freedom from violence.” And for Whitmer, these language choices matter and could be a way Democrats shift views.
“I think that it is important to use the language, whether it is talking about abortion as abortion and health care, or it is being very clear about what we're talking about when it comes to common sense gun safety laws,” Whitmer said. “We’re not talking about taking away every person’s gun in this country. We’re talking about making our communities, our schools, our places of worship and education safer places.”

MCI31HDYM2_MFOAWQ0U0TWBL6M,Could bird flu spread at state fairs? Here’s why health experts advise caution,Side Effects Public Media | By Benjamin Thorp,"Published September 4, 2024 at 6:00 AM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-09-04/could-bird-flu-spread-at-state-fairs-heres-why-health-experts-advise-caution,"Between July and October states across the country hold their annual state fairs.
The events are known for things like Ferris wheels and corn dogs, sculptures made entirely from butter and the biggest pig in the state. But state fairs can also be places where it’s easier to spread disease – bringing humans and animals from farms across the state into close contact.
That’s of particular concern this year, as H5N1 or bird flu infections have been confirmed in dairy cattle in 14 U.S. states, including in California as of last Thursday.
The virus has also infected four dairy workers across Michigan, Texas, and Colorado.
But that’s not keeping many fairgoers from lining up in front of the cattle nosing their way out of their barn fences.
Mel Ventimiglia stood by several cows with his grandkids inside a barn at the Indiana State Fair in Indianapolis on a weekday in August. He said bird flu isn’t even on his radar.
“I haven’t heard anybody mention it except for you,” he told Side Effects. “Hopefully, I forget about it pretty quickly.”
At another nearby cattle barn, farmer Randy Mason says he follows basic precautions to keep his cattle from getting sick while at the fair, but he’s not particularly worried.
“A lot of that in my opinion gets overblown,” he said. “They get one or two cases and then it becomes –– like everything the government does –– it becomes overblown and out of proportion.”
But across the country, bird flu infections have been confirmed in nearly 200 herds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
That’s led officials at some state fairs to enact stricter rules to keep the virus from spreading.
In Minnesota, which has detected cases of bird flu within its dairy cattle, the state is requiring all cows to have a negative bird flu test before coming to the state fair.
That’s not the case in many other states, however, including Indiana, where there haven’t been any confirmed cases of bird flu.
“Since we've not had a diagnosis, we've not put those additional measures,” said Bret Marsh, Indiana state veterinarian.
He said the state has told farmers to keep an eye out for signs of bird flu in their animals. They have also communicated to farmers the risks of spreading illness when coming to the fair and advised that animals are quarantined for 30 days after being shown. But until there’s a positive test in Indiana, Marsh said, the state doesn’t need to put tighter restrictions in place.

But scientists widely agree that there is not enough testing going on to fully understand which states have cows infected with bird flu.
Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said states like Indiana don’t have any positive bird flu cases in cattle because they aren’t looking for them.
“The assumption should be, this virus is in the state of Indiana, we just haven't found it yet,” he said. “That's what they should be messaging, not ‘Our cows are free.’ That's foolish to believe.”
That makes sites like state fairs –– where humans will be coming into contact with different animals –– especially concerning. Scientists worry that the bird flu could mutate to spread more easily among mammals, including humans, if given the opportunity.
Currently, the virus seems to only have infected humans coming in direct contact with the udders and equipment used on infected cows, or farm workers involved in culling infected poultry flocks. The handful of human cases have had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye in humans. The broader concern is that the virus could mutate into a respiratory virus which would spread more easily from person to person.
And fairs have a history of being places where that spillover – from animals to humans – happen.
In 2012 a major swine flu outbreak led to over 300 infections in the U.S., with the majority of those associated with exposure at agricultural fairs. And last year, the CDC reported that two people caught swine flu after visiting pig exhibits.
Each time an influenza virus jumps into a new host it’s given an opportunity to evolve, potentially becoming one that could begin to spread among humans.
Experts worry that the risk of H5N1 becoming a human virus could be substantially heightened if the virus makes it to pigs in particular because they are a perfect mixing vessel for viruses from different species. This means that the different viruses can exchange genetic material and learn from one another, potentially mutating and becoming more adept at infecting humans.
“One of the things that people bring up so much about COVID-19 are the animal markets in China, where you have multiple different animals and different species interacting with each other,” Adalja said. “Similar things happen at state fairs in the United States. That's not really any different.”
Andrew Bowman, professor of veterinary preventive medicine at the Ohio State University, agrees that the co-mingling of animals and people at state fairs poses a risk.
“We've thought about new pandemic viruses arising from Southeast Asian live animal markets. And we think, ‘Oh, we would never do that in the U.S.’ Well, fairs kind of mimic that,” he said.

Still, experts like Bowman say that isn’t a reason to miss out on the state fair altogether.
“I'm still going to the fair, and my family is still going to the fair. I had a milkshake when I was there,” Bowman said.
He added that at-risk populations, such as the immunocompromised, should consider avoiding the cattle barn this year.
“You know, exercise caution and really kind of think about which contacts [you] need to have,” Bowman said. “Can I enjoy the animal exhibits, maybe from a little further distance, and not get right in the middle of it?”
The CDC issued guidance in June for state fairs to reduce the spread of bird flu, including a prohibition on dumping milk on the ground, because raw milk from infected cattle is likely to carry live virus. The guidance also advises keeping cows from different herds apart, and encourages visitors to wash their hands before leaving a barn.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Agriculture instituted a rule requiring cows test negative for the virus before crossing state lines.
Still, the risk to humans from the bird flu virus remains low, according to the CDC’s assessment.

MP2DFVQJBA_VLBAABKA6NWLM1D,Israelis protest and workers' strike is planned after 6 more hostages die in Gaza,By The Associated Press,"Published September 1, 2024 at 10:29 AM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-01/israelis-protest-and-workers-strike-is-planned-after-6-more-hostages-die-in-gaza,"Updated September 01, 2024 at 12:51 PM ET
JERUSALEM — Grieving and angry Israelis surged into the streets Sunday night after six more hostages were found dead in Gaza, chanting ""Now! Now!"" as they demanded that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reach a cease-fire with Hamas to bring the remaining captives home.
Israel's largest trade union, the Histadrut, also pressured the government by calling a general strike for Monday — the first since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that started the war. The strike aims to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, health care and the country's main airport.
Tens of thousands of Israelis were expected to protest. Many blame Netanyahu for failing to reach a cease-fire during nearly 11 months of war. Negotiations have dragged on for months. Israel's army has acknowledged the difficulty of rescuing dozens of remaining hostages and said a deal is the only way to bring a large-scale return.
""I'm crying the cry of humanity,"" said one protester who gave his name as Amos as thousands, some of them weeping, gathered outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem.
The military said all six hostages were killed shortly before Israeli forces arrived. Netanyahu blamed the Hamas militant group for the stalled negotiations, saying ""whoever murders hostages doesn't want a deal.""
Militants seized Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, and four other hostages at a music festival in southern Israel. The native of Berkeley, California, lost part of his left arm to a grenade in the attack. In April, a Hamas-issued video showed him alive, sparking new protests in Israel.
The army identified the other dead hostages as Ori Danino, 25; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Almog Sarusi, 27; and Alexander Lobanov, 33; also taken from the festival. The sixth, Carmel Gat, 40, was abducted from the nearby farming community of Be'eri.
The army said the bodies were recovered from a tunnel in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, around a kilometer (half a mile) from where another hostage was rescued alive last week.
Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesperson, said Israeli forces found the bodies several dozen meters (yards) underground as ""ongoing combat"" was underway, but that there was no firefight in the tunnel itself. He said there was no doubt Hamas had killed them.
Hamas has offered to release the hostages in return for an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants.
Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, said the hostages would still be alive if Israel had accepted a U.S.-backed cease-fire proposal that Hamas said it had agreed to in July.
Funerals began for the hostages, with more outrage. Sarusi's body was wrapped in an Israeli flag. ""You were abandoned on and on, daily, hour after hour, 331 days,"" his mother, Nira, said. ""You and so many beautiful and pure souls. Enough. No more.""

Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed.
Critics have accused him of putting his personal interests over those of the hostages. The war's end likely will lead to an investigation into his government's failures in the Oct. 7 attacks, the government's collapse and early elections.
""I think this is an earthquake. This isn't just one more step in the war,"" said Nomi Bar-Yaacov, associate fellow in the International Security Program at Chatham House, shortly before Sunday's protests began.
Israel's Channel 12 reported that Netanyahu got into a shouting match at a security Cabinet meeting Thursday with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who accused him of prioritizing control of a strategic corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border — a major sticking point in the talks — over the lives of the hostages.
An Israeli official confirmed the report and said three of the hostages — Goldberg-Polin, Yerushalmi and Gat — had been slated to be released in the first phase of a cease-fire proposal discussed in July. The official was not authorized to brief media about the negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity.
""In the name of the state of Israel, I hold their families close to my heart and ask forgiveness,"" Gallant said Sunday.
A forum of hostage families has demanded a ""complete halt of the country"" to push for a cease-fire and hostage release. ""Were it not for the delays, sabotage and excuses, those whose deaths we learned about this morning would likely still be alive,"" it said in a statement.
Even a mass outpouring of anger would not immediately threaten Netanyahu or his far right government. He still controls a majority in parliament. But he has caved in to public pressure before. Mass protests led him to cancel the dismissal of his defense minister last year, and a general strike last year helped lead to a delay in his controversial judicial overhaul.

Goldberg-Polin's parents, U.S.-born immigrants to Israel, became perhaps the most high-profile relatives of hostages on the international stage. They met with U.S. President Joe Biden and Pope Francis and on Aug. 21, they addressed the Democratic National Convention — after sustained applause and chants of ""bring him home.""
His mother, Rachel, who bowed her head during the ovation and touched her chest, said ""Hersh, if you can hear us, we love you, stay strong, survive.""
Biden on Sunday said he was ""devastated and outraged."" The White House said he spoke with Goldberg-Polin's parents and offered condolences.
Some 250 hostages were taken on Oct. 7. Israel now believes 101 remain in captivity, including 35 who are thought to be dead. More than 100 were freed during a cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Eight have been rescued by Israeli forces. Israeli troops mistakenly killed three Israelis who escaped captivity in December.

NUEUJZMS91_ENSSP3797QI2BW2,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson shares the poem she's kept in every one of her offices,By Tonya Mosley,"Published September 4, 2024 at 11:59 AM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-09-04/justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-shares-the-poem-shes-kept-in-every-one-of-her-offices,"In every office she's ever had, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has kept a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem, ""The Ladder of Saint Augustine."" There's one stanza in particular that she likes:

""I love the idea that in order to be successful, it takes hard work,"" Jackson says. ""You can't always control whether you're the smartest person in the room, for example, but you [can] commit to being the hardest worker.""
Jackson traces her interest in studying law back to her childhood. When she was 4, her father enrolled in law school at the University of Miami. She remembers sitting at the kitchen table with her coloring books, across from her father and his stack of law journals.
""We would work together and he'd ask me questions,"" she says. ""It was really a bonding moment for me.""
Jackson went on to attend Harvard for both undergrad and law school. As a young lawyer, she says, she was often at the office before anyone else — and then she'd stay until everyone else had gone home. Working as a public defender helped shape the type of judge she would become.
""One of the things I discovered very early on was how few of my clients really understood what had happened to them in the trial process,"" Jackson says. ""And so when I became a judge, I really focused on being clear.""
In 2022, Jackson became the first Black woman appointed to the United States Supreme Court. During her first year on the bench, she spoke more than any other justice in that same term — a marked departure from past justices who sometimes take years before becoming vocal. Now Jackson is sharing her story in a new memoir, Lovely One. (The title of the book derives from a translation of Jackson's West African name, “Ketanji Onyika."")



On learning about Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to argue a case before the Supreme Court
Judge Motley was appointed to the court in the ‘60s, I believe. And this is the court in the Southern District of New York. And I was born in 1970. And when I was in late elementary school, early middle school, I came across an article about her in Essence or Ebony, one of the Black magazines that my parents subscribed to. And, gosh, I mean, it was such an eye opener for me, in part because I learned that we share a birthday, September 14th. We were born on exactly the same day, 49 years apart. ...
And so here we had this woman who was a lawyer and who had gone on to be a judge, and the thought of being a judge just kind of planted in my mind. And it was something I guess I'd always wanted to do. And this was also around the time when Justice O'Connor had been appointed to the Supreme Court. So now we had a woman judge on the Supreme Court. I just remember those things being very motivational for me, early on.
On growing up in D.C. with parents from the South, who wanted her to be proud of being Black
I was born at this very, very pivotal time in American history. I was a first inheritor of Dr. Martin Luther King's dream ... if Dr. Martin Luther King presented America with a metaphorical check come due, my generation reaped the first installment. So what it meant for my parents, who were now young people with a baby coming of age in this really, sort of time of opportunity after being so limited in their upbringing, they wanted me to do all of the activities that they had been restricted in doing. But they also felt pretty strongly that it was important to shore up my own self-esteem. Having grown up in a society in which there was so much negative imagery and messaging about African Americans, they were worried that that would undermine my ability to perform in white spaces. And so they carefully monitored what I watched and worked on the inputs.
On what she was like in high school
It was a predominantly white school. ... I was popular. I was the student body president three years in a row. So I had a lot of friends and people who liked me, but no dates, which got to be a little bit of an issue my senior year because the student body president, one of the things you're responsible for is planning the prom. And I wasn't going to go until a friend of mine who was a junior said, ""Who are you going to go to prom with?"" And I was like, ""No one."" And he was like, ""Well, why don't I take you? Why don't we go together?"" So I went with him, just so I could go and not be totally left out of an activity that I was planning. But it was not easy to be a high school student and feeling like everybody else is dating and people have crushes, and not being a part of the culture was a little challenging.
On how she met her husband at Harvard
So I am in this class, and he's cute. He's sitting behind me. He's chatting with me and tapping on my shoulder and doing silly things. And afterwards we start to develop a friendship, talking about the material. And he would walk me to my next class on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and then on Tuesday and Thursday, I thought I saw him in our government class, and I would lean down the row and wave and he would, like, roll his eyes like, ""Who is this lady?"" And I thought, this is kind of weird. Like, why would this guy be so nice to be on some days and not on the others? And I told my roommates about it and they were like, ""Leave him alone. He's crazy. You don't want to be with a crazy person!"" One of the nice days … I went up to him and I said, ""Why don't you speak to me in our government class?"" And he said, ""I'm not taking a government class."" And I said, ""Yes, you are."" And then it dawned on him that I must be talking about his twin brother.
On how she had her husband have both balanced career and family
I think very early on we kind of decided to take turns. We could see how there would be different points in each of our careers where the other person's professional needs would have to take precedence. It's like we could have it all, but not at the same time. And so there were periods when he was in his surgical residency, for example, he couldn't do anything more than the 20 hours of service that they required in the hospital, sleeping overnight, doing [it] all. And so then I took a lot of the home responsibilities. And when I was clerking for the Supreme Court, it was flipped. He took time out of his residency to do research in Washington, came down and supported me. He brought me dinner at the Court.

OTJDAST6PH_FPEMZKTSVH0YLZS,The real ‘Only Murders’ crime is that it hasn’t won more Emmys,Fresh Air | By David Bianculli,"Published September 5, 2024 at 4:00 PM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-09-05/the-real-only-murders-crime-is-that-it-hasnt-won-more-emmys,"Since premiering on Hulu in 2021, Only Murders in the Building has gotten plenty of Emmy nominations, but hasn’t really gotten its due. Even for the 2024 Emmys, which are handed out later in September, the series was snubbed in the Comedy Series Writing category. Which is a small sin, because co-creators Steve Martin and John Hoffman have managed to craft a comedy mystery series in which the laughs are plentiful and the mysteries are plausible and surprising. Pulling off either one of those feats is impressive; nailing them both is indeed Emmy-worthy.
Not that Only Murders is completely lacking for attention, or awards. The show has won four Emmys to date — though only one for an actor, for guest star Nathan Lane in 2022. But every year, the show finds ways to showcase its regular and guest stars more creatively. And this year, for the first time, all three series leads are nominated.
And deservedly so: Martin as former TV detective Charles-Haden Savage, and Martin Short as former Broadway director Oliver Putnam, are both insufferably egotistic and painfully insecure — and sporadically, gleefully hilarious. And Selena Gomez, as mystery podcasting fan Mabel Mora, is as droll and dry as Short’s Oliver is bubbly and over the top.
The new season of Only Murders in the Building takes this unlikely trio to a new setting — but only temporarily. Because of the success of their previous seasons of crime solving, the three podcasting partners are flown to Hollywood, where a movie executive hopes to buy their life rights and make a movie based on their adventures.
The movie exec is played by Molly Shannon, formerly of Saturday Night Live, who throws a glitzy party for the new arrivals. At the party, she tries to wow them by introducing them to the actors cast to play their big-screen counterparts.
Once the movie is greenlit, Charles, Oliver and Mabel head back to their familiar New York apartment complex, where a recent bullet hole found in the window of Charles’ apartment leads them to suspect he may have been targeted for murder. They also suspect the sniper may have aimed from one of the apartments across their courtyard.
Charles studies the behavior of the residents occupying the west tower, then convenes his podcast partners to discuss his suspicions. At this point, Only Murders becomes the comedy equivalent of Rear Window. Like James Stewart in that famous Hitchcock movie, our heroes expect that evil is afoot across the way. But with these three, the way they go about their voyeuristic inquiry highlights their very distinct, and very funny, personalities.
Both of these Season 4 plots — the movie being made and a new murder in the building — make room for a small commuter plane full of guest stars, all of whom come to play, and show us a great time. And almost all the Only Murders actors nominated for Emmys this year, in various supporting categories, are back — including Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep. And Jane Lynch, Melissa McCarthy, Scott Bakula and Richard Kind are here, too.
They’re all wonderful. Streep and Rudd, in particular, are doing great work: With their screen time and no-holds-barred performances, they may as well be considered series regulars. The show’s writing is up to their level, and so are the show’s three headliners. When Streep shares intimate or sad or joyous scenes with Short, they all work. This season, there’s a major influx of talent added to Only Murders in the Building — but the new and returning faces don’t outshine the stars. They shine, and play, right along with them.

RP33L3RRRB_Z1P0BYVA25DMUJ8,2 years and counting. Inmate says medical delays still plague federal prison in Oregon,By Jaclyn Diaz,"Published September 1, 2024 at 4:00 AM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-01/2-years-and-counting-inmate-says-medical-delays-still-plague-federal-prison-in-oregon,"Luke Thornhill is scheduled   to be released from an Oregon prison in four years.
He's terrified he might die before then.
He has family waiting for him in Idaho, ""And I'm scared I'm never gonna see them again,"" Thornhill said during multiple calls with NPR from prison.
He's scared because he's been suffering from serious medical issues — including severe abdominal pains, bloody bowel movements and a swollen abdomen — since at least 2022, when he was incarcerated in a different facility. And he says he has not been able to get the treatment that he needs.
""If you looked at my stomach, it bulges out on the right side, like the size of a grapefruit. And it just hurts all the time,"" Thornhill says.
Now, he feels worse than ever, he says. Constant pain makes it difficult even to sleep through the night.
""If I'm not careful with what I eat or drink or careful of how I move then I'm in worse pain and bleeding even worse.""
Thornhill was sentenced to 80 months in federal prison on drug charges in March 2023.
In 2022, while incarcerated in Idaho, he underwent a colonoscopy, during which two polyps were removed.
After Idaho, Thornhill was moved to SeaTac, the federal prison in Seattle, and earlier this year was moved to the federal facility in Sheridan, Ore.
Since he left Idaho, Thornhill says, he hasn't reviewed the biopsy results with any doctors at either SeaTac or Sheridan — and nothing about his situation has changed.
""We're talking about something that I've been dealing with for a year now. I've been literally suffering for the last year. And I've been begging them to give me treatment for this,"" he says. ""Nobody can tell me there isn't something wrong with me.""
The federal Bureau of Prisons said in response to specific questions about Thornhill's complaints that ""For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss any individuals' conditions of confinement, to include health status or medical treatment plans.""


Delays or substandard health care for prisoners in the U.S. carceral system are not uncommon. In 2023, NPR published a report showing that nearly 5,000 federal prisoners died over the past decade from treatable conditions after not getting timely diagnoses or treatment while incarcerated.
Lawmakers have begun to put the U.S. federal prison system under more scrutiny. In late July, President Biden signed the Federal Prison Oversight Act into law, which mandates routine inspections of all federal Bureau of Prison's facilities and the creation of an ombudsman to investigate the welfare and safety of inmates and staff.
The prison at Sheridan, in particular, has been criticized recently for medical delays, and at the end of 2023, investigators with the Justice Department launched an unannounced inspection of the facility.
In May 2024, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General released a report that concluded staffing issues at Sheridan contributed to more than 100 missed inmate medical appointments between January and November 2023 and a backlog of hundreds of lab tests and pending X-ray orders — leading to medical conditions potentially going undiagnosed.
In response, the federal Bureau of Prisons said it made several changes since the inspection — including hiring more staff and making a substantial dent in the number of missed appointments and the testing backlog.
As of May 2024, the backlog of laboratory orders dropped to 44 from 725 and the backlog of pending X-ray orders was 84, down from 274, according to the inspection report. The BOP reported that 89 of 101 appointments had been completed since the OIG inspection.
But Thornhill and at least two other Sheridan inmates that reached out to NPR say they are still in dire need of medical care. Their repeated requests to see a doctor are not being addressed, they say. Thornhill says Sheridan's claims that officials addressed the major backlog of lab tests and X-rays is flat-out wrong.
""The BOP is definitely broken,"" Thornhill says.
During the reporting of this story, NPR reviewed medical records and several requests for medical care that Thornhill sent to prison officials in Idaho and Seattle.
He said that for months he wasn't able to make copies of documents or access his medical file and requests at Sheridan. Late this month, he reported finally getting copies of those records.
And, he told NPR, that despite submitting numerous requests for medical care at Sheridan, he discovered recently that officials there only have one of his requests for medical help on file.
Regarding Thornhill's complaints about access to his medical records, the Bureau of Prisons said inmate medical records are ""available for review upon request by any incarcerated person"" who uses the proper request procedures. The requests should be processed within 30 days, the BOP said.
""All requests and the issuance of records are documented in the individual's medical record. Currently, FCI Sheridan has no request for medical records older than 10 days, before fulfilment,"" the BOP told NPR in a statement.
But Thornhill says that in the past, he has made multiple requests that were not honored.

The OIG and the federal Bureau of Prisons have pointed to severe staffing shortages as a significant contributing factor to ongoing problems with the federally run prison system.
The BOP ""has been transparent that staffing across the agency remains a challenge, as the FBOP is faced with the same worker shortage experienced by employers throughout the country,"" the agency said in a statement to NPR. ""The work to address these challenges is ongoing and includes a robust national recruitment strategy with the assistance of an external contract consultant.""
The agency told NPR in July that approximately 70% of positions in Sheridan's Health Services Department are filled. Correctional services positions, such as guards, are approximately 87% filled.

One of the procedures Thornhill wanted to have done was an X-ray.
After the OIG report, Sheridan said X-ray order backlogs were being addressed. But Thornhill says that isn't the case.
After the Sheridan report was published, Thornhill says he and about 100 other inmates were called to be taken to receive X-rays. Instead, he alleges that corrections staff repeatedly pressured him and other inmates — even some with broken bones — to sign forms refusing those X-rays.
Thornhill claims that officers at the prison made the experience as uncomfortable as possible — handcuffing each prisoner tightly around the wrists, putting them in cramped rooms and buses, serving them frozen meals without warming them up — to discourage them from wanting to undergo the process again. Thornhill believes the reason was to get the official number of X-ray requests down. He says he never signed the forms, but after a couple of months, still has not received an X-ray.
He says that of the couple dozen men who remained to get X-rays, only six or so were able to get the procedure done before staff said the machine was broken.
In response to these claims, the BOP said, ""For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss any individuals' conditions of confinement, but as noted above, policy requires medical treatment which meets community standards and staff misconduct is not tolerated.""


Thornhill's attempts to see a doctor for his medical issues go back to his time at SeaTac. Incarcerated there in 2023, he says he submitted several requests for follow-up medical treatment after his 2022 colonoscopy and as his symptoms appeared to worsen.
While at SeaTac, he was part of a group of inmates who spoke to the Seattle Times in an article published in February of this year about serious delays in medical care at that prison.
It was after this story published that Thornhill was moved to Sheridan.
He says he believes the move was punishment for speaking out about conditions at SeaTac.
In response to questions on Thornhill's claims, the BOP said, ""We cannot speak to this particular case, but FBOP does not tolerate staff misconduct, including retaliation. Consistent with national policy, all allegations of employee misconduct are referred to the FBOP's Office of Internal Affairs"" that are also reviewed by the Office of the Inspector General.
""Allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate action is taken if such allegations are sustained, including the possibility of referral for criminal prosecution when appropriate,"" the BOP said.
Thornhill says his symptoms have continued to worsen while at Sheridan, and that nothing has happened after his numerous requests to see a doctor and have other tests done.
Requests to be seen by a nurse, doctor or dentist are a multistep process. In order to see medical staff at Sheridan, Thornhill says, inmates submit requests through the prison computer system. Inmates also submit a paper ""cop out"" or a physical request to be seen by medical staff.
After putting in the requests, inmates go down for sick-call, held four days a week
The Sheridan Admission and Orientation Handbook states this is ""the most efficient way to obtain an examination by a physician or an outside specialist."" Inmates explain the ""problem to the P.A. or nurse, and they will refer you to a physician, if your condition warrants it.""
For months, Thornhill says, ""No matter how many times I put in to see a doctor, they call me down there and I end up seeing another nurse and she basically tells me she doesn't know what's going on with me and that she'll put me in to see the doctor."" He adds that it's not just him, it's rare for anyone to see an actual doctor and when they do ""it's for basic stuff"" like an ingrown nail.
It's such a problem that Thornhill alleges inmates are turning to each other to get basic drugs for blood pressure or antibiotics — a not uncommon practice in prison.
In response, a BOP spokesman said the agency ""does not comment on the conditions of confinement for any individual or group of individuals in our custody. Nor do we comment on anecdotal allegations.""
The BOP said it ""takes pride in protecting and securing individuals entrusted in our custody"" and makes ""every effort to ensure the physical, medical, and mental safety"" of those individuals.
Sheridan employs two medical doctors and one mid-level provider in the prison's Health Services Department for its 1,539 inmates, according to the agency.
The BOP said in its statement to NPR that ""Sheridan provides onsite medical provider coverage 14-hours per day, including weekends and holidays. The FBOP and FCI Sheridan provides essential medical, dental, and mental health services in a manner consistent with accepted community standards for a correctional environment.""
""All incarcerated individuals have daily access to medical care and appointments, and medical staff conduct daily rounds throughout each facility,"" the agency continued.
""Each patient is independently treated on a case-by-case basis, and treatment is provided as clinically indicated.""
Only after NPR contacted representatives of Sheridan and the Bureau of Prisons about Thornhill's situation did Thornhill report to us in mid-July that he finally saw a doctor and a cardiologist, who both agreed ""something was wrong and ordered more tests,"" he wrote in a letter to his mother shared with NPR.
This development gives Thornhill little confidence.
""I'm trying to be optimistic about it but it's hard when I'm still in the same position I was. Hopefully they actually get me to the hospital to do these tests! I am going to pray about it and hope for the best,"" he wrote to NPR in July.


In late July, Thornhill told NPR that Sheridan was under lockdown. The BOP confirmed that the prison was on ""modified operations"" but declined to provide specific details ""for safety and security reasons.""
As of this week, the BOP confirmed to NPR that, aside from one unit, the prison has returned to normal operations.
For weeks, prison officials seriously curtailed communications and kept inmates in their cells most of the day. Though the lockdown has since been adjusted, Thornhill reports inmates are still only allowed to leave their cells for about 40 minutes a day.
Thornhill's mother, Nancy Richardson, contacted NPR and lawmakers on his behalf   as he's struggled with medical issues since being incarcerated. She says she was only able to speak with him for five minutes every few days during the lockdown.
She's 69 and lives in Idaho and hasn't been able to visit her son since he's been in federal custody. The lockdown made her more fearful for her son and his health.
""He's sick and he's needing medical care, and it's just disheartening to not be able to do one thing about it,"" she says. ""I think people need to know what's going on here.""
At the beginning of August, Thornhill was taken to an emergency room outside the prison via ambulance due to extremely high blood pressure. He has since returned to Sheridan, he and his mother confirmed.
There, he says, he finally received an X-ray of his chest.

President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, pleaded guilty Thursday to tax charges in a surprise move just before jury selection was set to start in his federal criminal trial in Los Angeles.
The last-minute change of plea headed off what would likely have been a painful legal and personal ordeal filled with sordid details of the younger Biden's life when he was addicted to crack cocaine.
The case centered on Biden's failure to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019, even as he spent millions of dollars on what prosecutors described as an “extravagant lifestyle"" replete with escorts, luxury hotels and a sex club membership.
In court Thursday, U.S. district judge Mark Scarsi asked Hunter Biden whether he committed every element of every crime charged in the indictment, to which Biden replied, ""yes.""
Scarsi then asked, count by count, how the president' son pleaded. Biden answered ""guilty"" to each one. The judge accepted the plea and scheduled sentencing for Dec. 16.
The guilty plea comes three months after a jury in Delaware convicted Hunter Biden of federal gun charges. His sentencing in that case is slated for Nov. 13.
Both cases were brought by Justice Department special counsel David Weiss.
In a statement, Biden said he didn't realize the anguish the trial in Delaware would cause his family, and said he would not put them through that again.
""When it became clear to me that the same prosecutors were focused not on justice but on dehumanizing me for my actions during my addiction, there was only one path left for me,"" he said. ""I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment. For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this, and so I have decided to plead guilty.""
The change of plea came as a shock to prosecutors, who only learned of it when Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, announced the decision just minutes before potential jurors were to be called in.
The court ordered a break to allow prosecutors to look at the case law and decide how they wanted to proceed—and whether the judge could accept or reject the plea.
After the break, prosecutor Leo Wise and Lowell sparred over the details of the potential plea. Wise opposed allowing Biden to enter what's known as an Alford plea, an unusual move in which the defendant pleads guilty but maintains his or her innocence.
In the end, Biden entered an open plea, which is a guilty plea without an agreement with the government.


Hunter Biden's two federal criminal prosecutions were once viewed as a possible political liability for President Biden in the middle of a tight 2024 reelection campaign.
Now, with the elder Biden no longer seeking reelection, the potential political impact of his son's legal troubles has faded.
It resurfaces the question, though, of whether Hunter Biden might receive a pardon from his father. The president said after the gun conviction that he wouldn't pardon his son.
On Thursday, the White House press secretary said the president's stance hasn't changed.
""It is still very much a no,"" Karine Jean-Pierre said.


Hunter Biden was facing nine counts in the Los Angeles case: three felony counts for tax evasion and filing false returns, plus six misdemeanor counts.
On Thursday, Wise, the prosecutor, read the 56-page indictment into the record as the factual basis for Biden's guilty plea.
The indictment spells out in detail how Hunter Biden cheated on his taxes over a four-year stretch and instead spent millions ""on an extravagant lifestyle.""
""The defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes,"" according to the indictment.
The period of the alleged offenses corresponds to the time when Hunter Biden was struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine following the death of his brother, Beau Biden.
The indictment also said the president's son claimed personal expenses as business expenses to reduce his tax burden.
The indictment includes a long list of alleged falsely claimed business expenses, including $11,500 for an escort to spend two nights with Hunter Biden; tens of thousands of dollars for luxury hotels during his crack addiction; nearly $20,000 in rent payments for the New York residence of one of his daughters; and some $27,000 to an online pornography website.

A year ago, Hunter Biden appeared on the verge of avoiding trial entirely.
He had a tentative deal with prosecutors under which he would plead guilty to tax charges and enter in a diversion agreement on the gun offenses — which would pause criminal proceedings as long as he met certain conditions. The deal would have allowed him to avoid trial.
But the deal collapsed in front of a federal judge in Delaware who voiced concern about how the agreement was structured. Biden's lawyers and prosecutors were unable to cobble it back together.

RQDBVNVGDC_TUH8P0X6ZMLUU29,The U.S. has seized Venezuelan President Maduro's plane,"By Jackie Northam,","Published September 2, 2024 at 1:09 PM CDT",20240826,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-02/the-u-s-has-seized-venezuelan-president-maduros-plane,"The United States has seized an airplane belonging to Venezuela's hard-line president, Nicolás Maduro, in the Dominican Republic and taken it to Florida, the Justice Department said Monday.
The Justice Department alleges that the Dassault Falcon 900EX aircraft was purchased from a company in Florida for about $13 million by people affiliated with Maduro, through a Caribbean-based shell company, and smuggled out of the U.S.
""Since May 2023, the Dassault Falcon, bearing tail number T7-ESPRT, has flown almost exclusively to and from a military base in Venezuela and has been used for the benefit of Maduro and his representatives, including to transport Maduro on visits to other countries,"" the department said in a statement.
The department said it worked with authorities in the Dominican Republic to seize the plane for violating U.S. sanctions and export controls.
The U.S. has placed numerous sanctions on Venezuelan companies and individuals, including Maduro, for alleged corruption and human rights abuses among other things.
The plane confiscation came a little over a month after Venezuela's contentious presidential election, in which both Maduro and the main opposition declared victory.
Speaking Aug. 1, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that opposition candidate ""Edmundo González Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela’s July 28 presidential election.""
Maduro has accused the U.S. of meddling in Venezuela's internal affairs and said his country's election council declared him the election winner. Maduro's critics point out the election council is loyal to Maduro and has not released total vote tallies.
Last week, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Maduro will remain the South American country's de facto president but that the EU rejects the legitimacy of his reelection claim.

RUNQ569HNC_GB4GTIE7GAO69YR,Alabama traffic fatality the latest linked to Takata air bag inflators,"Alabama Public Radio | By Pat Duggins,","Published September 3, 2024 at 5:46 PM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-09-03/alabama-traffic-fatality-the-latest-linked-to-takata-air-bag-inflators,"Another death has been linked to dangerous Takata air bag inflators by U.S. regulators, the 28th in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the driver was killed in 2018 in Alabama in a Honda vehicle, but gave no further details. It says the death underscores the need for people to replace recalled air bag inflators.
Takata used ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate over time due to high heat and humidity and explode with too much force. That can blow apart a metal canister and send shrapnel into the passenger compartment. More than 400 people in the U.S. have been hurt. Worldwide at least thirty six people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S.
Honda said in a statement that the Alabama death occurred in Etowah County and involved a 2004 Honda Civic. It involved a high speed crash which complicated efforts to definitively determine the cause of death. Honda, the company that used more Takata air bags in its cars than any other automaker, said it has replaced or accounted for 95% of the recalled inflators in its vehicles.
""Honda continues to urge owners of Honda and Acura vehicles affected by the Takata air bag inflator recalls to get their vehicles repaired at an authorized dealership as soon as possible,"" the company statement said.
Honda and Acura owners can check their for recalls at www.recalls.honda.com and www.recalls.acura.com. Owners also can go to nhtsa.com/recalls and key in their vehicle identification or license plate numbers.
Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says many have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata into bankruptcy."
SELIA4U5YE_H8YOZBABBF3JK9L,U.S. accuses Russia of sophisticated influence campaigns against U.S. voters,"By Jude Joffe-Block,","Published September 4, 2024 at 1:18 PM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-04/u-s-accuses-russia-of-sophisticated-influence-campaigns-against-u-s-voters,"The U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday said it disrupted Russian-directed foreign malign influence campaigns it referred to as “Doppelganger,” that sought to spread Russian government propaganda.
The effort was meant to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster pro-Russian policies, and influence voters in the U.S. and elsewhere, the Justice Department said.
Separately, the DOJ accused two Russian employees of RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, of a nearly $10 million scheme to create and distribute content to U.S. audiences while keeping the connection to Russia hidden.
RT worked with an online content creation company in Tennessee, which was directed to contract with U.S. social media influencers to distribute its content on social media platforms including, TikTok, X, Instagram and YouTube. Since November, the company posted more than 2,000 videos that received more than 16 million views on YouTube, according to the indictment.
The link to Russia was never disclosed, the DOJ said.
The two RT employees, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, 31, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27, have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
""The American people are entitled to know when a foreign power is attempting to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to send around its own propaganda,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Wednesday.
The two indictments come as the U.S. has been increasingly warning about Russia’s efforts to influence U.S. voters through a variety of efforts.
As part of the Doppelganger investigation, the DOJ said it seized 32 internet domains used in the effort, and named Russian companies Social Design Agency (SDA), Structura National Technology (Structura), and ANO Dialog as being involved in the effort.
The effort involved Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, including First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Sergei Vladilenovich Kiriyenko, it said.
Garland announced the charges at a meeting of the DOJ's election threats task force, which was set up in 2021 to counter the growing number of threats nationwide against election officials and administrators. He said the investigation remains active.
The Treasury and State Departments have parallel actions on these matters, Garland said.
In a statement on its website ahead of the charges, RT dismissed the findings, joking that their responses included comments like “Ha!” and “2016 called and it wants its clichés back.”
Garland made clear to reporters that he was not amused.
""I'm sure that was much funnier in the original Russian, but for us, it's not funny,"" Garland said. ""This is deadly serious and we are going to treat it accordingly.""
FBI Director Chris Wray said Russia has a long history of meddling in American society, though now there are increasingly sophisticated tools like artificial intelligence to amplify the efforts.
“Whether it's shell companies, fake personas, secret distribution networks, the point is not the message itself,"" Wray said. ""The point is the hidden hand of the Russian government, which deceives Americans into thinking that they're getting information from American sources when in fact it's coming from the Russian government.""


United States intelligence and security officials have been warning for months about Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2024 election, specifically to undermine the Democratic presidential nominee, exploit social divisions, sow distrust in democratic institutions and to erode support for Ukraine.
The U.S. has provided arms to Ukraine to support its war following Russia's invasion in 2022.
“Russia remains the most active foreign threat to our elections,” Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told senators in May at a briefing about election risks.
This is not the first time the U.S. has taken action against those behind the Doppelganger influence campaign.
In March, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Social Design Agency and Structura, as well as their founders, for a network of fake accounts and phony news websites, saying they carried out the campaign ""at the direction of the Russian Presidential Administration.""
The Doppelganger campaign, which was first identified by researchers at EU DisinfoLab in 2022, has impersonated news outlets including The Washington Post and Fox News, and it has posed as NATO, the Polish and Ukrainian governments, the German police and the French Foreign Ministry.
The campaign recently used fake French-language news sites to push claims of corruption at the recent Paris Olympics and to warn of potential violence, according to a Microsoft report.


The Kremlin has long relied on fake social media accounts to sow discord and advance its own interests.
In July, the Justice Department said it disrupted a Russian propaganda campaign that used artificial intelligence tools and relied on fake social media accounts impersonating Americans to spread disinformation in the U.S. and other countries. It said the effort involved an editor at RT.
The Justice Department required RT’s U.S. arm to register as a foreign agent in 2017, after US intelligence officials said it was involved in Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.
The bot farm used AI to create the fake profiles on X, formerly known as Twitter. The accounts posted support for Russia's war in Ukraine and other pro-Kremlin narratives. The effort and the AI software behind it were organized by an editor at RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, the Justice Department alleged. The project was funded by the Kremlin and run by a Russian intelligence officer.
At the time, when asked for comment on the allegations, RT's press office replied: ""Farming is a beloved pastime for millions of Russians.""

SG1PYJQC3O_SONRMXI7Q8V59GX,"The Georgia high school shooting suspect won't face death penalty, judge says","By Jonathan Franklin,","Published September 5, 2024 at 3:13 PM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-05/apalachee-high-school-shooting-suspect-is-charged-with-4-counts-of-murder,"Updated September 06, 2024 at 12:18 PM ET
Days after a shooting killed four people and injured nine others at a Georgia high school, the 14-year-old suspect and his father appeared in separate court hearings to hear the charges against them.
Each hearing lasted under 10 minutes, and both defendants will remain in custody — in different jails — after their lawyers declined to seek bail.
The teenager, Colt Gray, has been charged as an adult with four counts of felony murder in connection with the shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder, Ga., on Wednesday, which left two teachers and two students dead.
He appeared Friday morning in Barrow Superior Court, where Piedmont Judicial Circuit Judge Currie Mingledorff II asked him several basic questions before informing him of his rights. Gray, wearing a green shirt and his face obscured by shaggy blond hair, answered with, “Yes, sir.”
Mingledorff then told Gray that the maximum penalty for each count of felony murder is either death or imprisonment for life, with or without parole. But the judge misspoke, and later called Gray back into the room to correct the record: He would not be eligible for the death penalty if convicted, because he’s under 18.
Gray’s lawyer did not request bond, nor did he enter a plea. The judge has set another hearing for Dec. 4, the Associated Press reports.
A while later, Gray’s father, 54-year-old Colin Gray, appeared in court for his own hearing. He was arrested and charged on Thursday with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder, and eight counts of cruelty to children.
“His charges are directly connected with the actions of his son and allowing him to possess a weapon,"" Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey told reporters Thursday.
The elder Gray, wearing striped jail attire and speaking hoarsely, gave the judge his age and responded when asked that he had finished 11th grade. The judge read him his rights, charges and maximum penalties if convicted, as Gray rocked back and forth in his seat.
Mingledorff said the maximum penalty for each felony murder count is up to 30 years imprisonment, and the maximum penalty for each felony involuntary manslaughter offense is 10 years imprisonment.
The judge said Gray faces a maximum total possible penalty of 180 years imprisonment. His preliminary hearing is also scheduled for Dec. 4.


The GBI has identified those killed as students Christian Angulo, 14, and Mason Schermerhorn, 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53.
The GBI previously said autopsies would be performed on the four victims Thursday.
The nine people wounded in the shooting are all expected to make a full recovery, Barrow County, Ga., Sheriff Jud Smith told reporters Thursday evening.
""And that’s a testament to the response that we had, in my opinion, the response that medical staff had,” Smith said during Thursday's news conference.
Of those injured, eight are students and one is a teacher, the GBI said in an online FAQ. Seven of the nine injured were shot, and tourniquets were used to help the victims.
The suspect was taken into custody at the school.
Investigators have described the gun used in the shooting as an ""AR-style platform weapon,"" but not have publicly determined where the suspect got it. The GBI said Colin Gray ""knowingly allowed his son"" to possess a gun, but declined to release further details citing the investigation in progress.
The GBI said Thursday that the investigation is ""still active & ongoing.”
“This is day 2 of a very complex investigation & the integrity of the case is paramount,” the agency wrote on X. “We ask for the public’s patience as we work to ensure a successful prosecution & justice for the victims.""


In a post on X, the FBI said that in May 2023 it received ""several anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time,"" and that the threats contained photos of guns.
The FBI said the sheriff's office in nearby Jackson County identified ""a possible subject,"" a 13-year-old male, and interviewed him and his father.
""The father stated he had hunting guns in the house, but the subject did not have unsupervised access to them. The subject denied making the threats online,"" the FBI said.
The FBI said local schools were alerted to continue monitoring the subject, but that there were no strong grounds for an arrest or additional law enforcement action. The agency confirmed that the teenager was the one who was taken into custody after Wednesday's shooting.

Smith credited Centegix — an emergency alert technology — for alerting first responders to Wednesday’s shooting.

SGPJHTSB27_DILMNRPJJPAWJFF,AP: Former aide to Alabama Governor Siegelman allegedly involved in effort to siphon votes from Kamala Harris,"Alabama Public Radio | By Pat Duggins,","Published September 1, 2024 at 4:01 PM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-09-01/ap-former-aide-to-alabama-governor-siegelman-involved-in-effort-to-siphon-votes-from-kamala-harris,"In battleground states, a network of Republican political operatives and lawyers is trying to shape the November's election in favor of former President Donald Trump. They're propping up liberal third-party candidates such as Cornel West and Jill Stein in the hopes that those candidates will siphon off votes from Democrat Kamala Harris. The Associated Press reports one key figure is the former Chief of Staff to former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman.
The Associated Press reports how Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina's presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named “Paul” who said he wanted to help. The AP reports that was Paul Hamrick, the man on the other end of the call with Medelius in North Carolina.
Hamrick serves as counsel for the Virginia-based nonprofit People Over Party, which has pushed to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as North Carolina, records show.
In an interview, Hamrick declined to say who else besides him was orchestrating the effort and he would not divulge who was funding it. He vigorously disputed any suggestion that he was a Republican, but acknowledged that he was not a Democrat, either.
His history is complex.
The APR reports Hamrick was chief of staff to former Alabama Governor Siegelman, a one-term Democrat who was booted from office in 2003 and later was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Hamrick was charged alongside his former boss in two separate cases. One was dismissed and he was acquitted in the other.
Though he insists he is not a Republican, Hamrick voted in Alabama's Republican primary in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to state voting records maintained by the political data firm L2. He was tapped briefly in 2011 to work for the Alabama state Senate's Republican majority. And since 2015, according to federal campaign finance disclosures, he has contributed only to GOP causes, including $2,500 to the Alabama Republican Party and $3,300 to Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican who has trafficked in conspiracy theories.
Hamrick denied that he voted in any Republican primaries, suggesting that the voting data was inaccurate.
For years, he was a consultant for Matrix LLC, an Alabama firm known for its hardball approach.
Matrix LLC was part of an effort in Florida to run ""ghost candidates"" against elected officials who had raised the ire of executives for Florida Power & Light, the state's largest utility.
Daniella Levine Cava, the current mayor of Miami-Dade County, was a target. As a county commissioner, Levine Cava had fought with FPL. When she ran for reelection in 2018, Matrix covertly financed a third-party candidate they hoped would siphon enough votes to tip her seat to a Republican challenger, The Miami Herald reported in 2022.
Hamrick was deeply involved. A company he created paid the spoiler candidate a $60,000 salary and rented a $2,300-a-month home for him, according to the newspaper and business filings made in Alabama. Hamrick said the candidate worked for him to help recruit business. Hamrick denied having anything to do with the man's campaign.
Either way, it did not work. Levine Cava was reelected before winning the mayor's seat in 2020.
Now Hamrick is playing a prominent role to place West's name on the ballot in competetive states. Hamrick surfaced in Arizona two weeks ago after a woman told the AP that a document was fraudulently submitted in her name to Arizona's secretary of state in which she purportedly agreed to serve as an elector for West. She said her signature was forged and she never agreed to be an elector.
After the AP published her account, Hamrick said he spoke to the woman's husband, trying to rectify the situation and ""gave some information."" Hamrick declined to say what information was shared. He also tried to persuade another elector who backed out to recommit to West, according to interviews and voicemails.
The next day, with the deadline to qualify for the Arizona ballot just hours away, Brett Johnson, a prominent Republican lawyer, and Amanda Reeve, a former GOP state lawmaker, made house visits to each as they tried to persuade both to sign new paperwork to serve as West electors.
Johnson and Reeve work for Snell & Wilmer, which has done $257,000 worth of business for the Republican National Committee over the past two years, campaign finance disclosures show.
Hamrick declined to comment on the role of Johnson and Reeve. They did not respond to requests for comment.
West did not qualify for the Arizona ballot."
STEOF5SOAI_S25VKSHWBUBE733,Worried about your drink getting spiked? Here are some safety tips,By Jaclyn Diaz,"Published September 5, 2024 at 4:03 AM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-09-05/worried-about-your-drink-getting-spiked-here-are-some-safety-tips,"It’s the beginning of the school year, and many college students are arriving on campuses ready to begin their university journey, make new friends and have some fun. But this exciting new chapter can have a darker side.
College students are considered a high-risk group for drugging — that is, when alcohol or drugs are given to someone without their knowledge or consent. But it’s not just college students at risk for this, according to Suzanne Swan, a professor of women's and gender studies and psychology at the University of South Carolina.
Anyone out enjoying a bar, at a party or a club is at a higher risk in those settings. And drugging doesn't always look like what you might expect. But there are things people can do to help prevent it.


It’s tough to determine how prevalent drugging is because it’s an understudied area, said Swan, who has been digging into the subject in recent years.
Often the terms “date rape drugs” or “roofies” are used to refer to substances people use to spike another’s drink with the goal of sexually assaulting them. But research shows that the intention is not always sex — people may drug a friend’s drink because they think it'll be fun, or they do it as a prank.
Drugging is ultimately an issue of consent, Swan said.
“It’s not OK to touch somebody's body without their permission. It's also not OK to give somebody a drug that they don't know about without their permission,” she said.
Swan led a 2016 study of more than 6,000 college students at three universities to examine the outcomes and motives of drugging. The researchers found that about 1 in 13 people (about 462 students) said they had been drugged — a “pretty significant” finding, she said. And 83 students said they had drugged someone or knew someone who had drugged someone — about 1.4%.
Sex or sexual assault was not always the motive for drugging someone. Other motives included “having fun” and getting others more drunk or high, or getting someone to relax, the study found.
“Most of the people who had been drugged didn't say they were sexually assaulted,"" Swan said. ""So of those people who were drugged, 85% of them said they were not.” But “15% being sexually assaulted is a huge number,” she noted.
It’s a major concern, said Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, the vice president of communications for RAINN, an anti-sexual assault organization.
Generally, more than 50% of college sexual assaults occur August through November, especially for students new to the college campus, Simmons Kaleba said.
An over-inflated sense of safety in a new environment and increased access to alcohol collide, “and I think you have a pretty perfect storm for being taken advantage of by things like drug facilitated sexual assault,” she said.
Ultimately, people may not know for certain that they were drugged, or what they were drugged with.
“Some people said, ‘I can't prove it. All I know is that I only had one drink and it was the drink I usually drink. But I passed out, and I don't usually do that.’ So it's very difficult to prove, unfortunately,” Swan said.


Even though people's minds immediately jump to “roofies” (a common nickname for Rohypnol) when drugging comes up, Swan says she more often sees Xanax and other similar drugs abused for this purpose.
Another extremely common culprit is alcohol alone — as opposed to a drug that's added to a drink.
“We see a lot of overpouring someone’s drink. They think they’re getting a drink with an ounce of alcohol and they’re actually getting two or three. If you’re misleading the person about how much alcohol they’re getting, we would define that as drugging,” Swan said.
Even if someone wanted to overpour their friend's drink or slip them something as a joke, it’s important to remember that is a violation of someone’s body, regardless of the intention, Swan said.
“It may not seem like a big deal to you to drug your friend’s drink, but you don't know how your friend's body might react to this drug. You don't know this person's medical history. You don't know what other medications they might be taking,” she said. “Don't violate that boundary.”
There can be legal penalties for doing so. Depending on the location of the circumstances, someone accused of drugging another person could face charges like assault, infliction of bodily harm (regardless of intent), or misuse of a substance that requires a prescription, Simmons Kaleba said.


Swan’s study from 2016 found that in a lot of cases where a student was drugged, there were fortunately friends of the person there to take care of them, who knew something wasn’t right and helped them get home, potentially preventing some of the worst things from happening, Swan said.
Simmons Kaleba and Swan recommend that everyone be an active, positive bystander while out in these settings.
“If you see somebody tamper with somebody's drink or any kind of substance, speak up. Be that person,” Simmons Kaleba said.
It’s also important to guard your own food and drinks, don't leave them unattended, and watch your friend’s items if they do walk away, she and Swan said.
A lot of the focus tends to be on being alert while drinking alcohol, but anyone drinking water, soda or other nonalcoholic beverages could have their drinks spiked, too, Simmons Kaleba said.
There are several signs that can alert someone to whether they have been drugged, according to RAINN, including: difficulty breathing, feeling drunk despite having little to no alcohol, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision and waking up with little to no memory. If you or someone you know is suspected of being drugged, seek medical help.
Simmons Kaleba added that if you are ever a victim of drugging, ""The first thing to know is you're not at fault. Ever.""

TY8BLYCKKM_UL8ISK8XY2WFN3H,Meet the evangelicals trying to make a case for VP Harris,By Jason DeRose,"Published September 4, 2024 at 4:00 AM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-09-04/meet-the-evangelicals-trying-to-make-a-case-for-vp-harris,"Donald Trump won the support of more than 80% of white evangelicals in 2016 and 2020, but a new group is trying hard to push some of those voters toward Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.
The political action committee Evangelicals for Harris is running a series of digital ads, including one that shows an archival video of the late evangelical preacher Billy Graham, in which he asks, “Have you been to the cross and said, ‘Lord, I have sinned'?”
Those words are juxtaposed with a video of Trump being asked during a public appearance in 2015, “Have you ever asked God for forgiveness?”
Trump responds, “I'm not sure I have. I just, I don't bring God into that picture. I don't.”
Evangelicals for Harris is also running an ad on various digital platforms, including YouTube, that features Kamala Harris speaking about her beliefs. It’s called “Fruits of the Spirit” and includes Harris saying, during a speech, “Faith motivates action. It lifts us up and it gives us purpose.”
In addition to these online ads, the group is working with local activists to hold in-person events in swing states. One of those leaders is self-described evangelical Christian and Milwaukee resident Patricia Ruiz-Cantu.
“Here in Wisconsin,” she says, “we're doing faith rallies. And we bring different congregations together to talk about values and to hear what their concerns are and try to figure out how we can work together.”
Ruiz-Cantu knows that some evangelical voters may disagree with Harris on her abortion stance. But she believes those same voters can be swayed over other issues, deeply rooted in the Christian tradition.
“In the Bible, it talks to us about loving our neighbor like we love ourselves,” she says. “Jesus Christ came for the needy. It says, I'm going to ask you, did you see me hungry and did you feed me and did you see me thirsty? Did you give me water?”


Among Evangelicals for Harris’s key issues are health care, poverty and the environment. The group’s founder, The Rev. Jim Ball, calls these “family values” because they support real families. And he selected those values because the Bible tells him so.
“Jesus was on the side of the vulnerable,” says Ball, who lives in Vienna, Va., outside Washington, D.C. “He was always helping the vulnerable. And so we have a particular concern for the vulnerable in our society. And so we look and say, well, whose policies are more in keeping with protecting the vulnerable and defending the vulnerable?”
For Ball, the answer is Kamala Harris. He has often challenged his evangelical heritage and evangelical siblings on certain issues. He led the Evangelical Environmental Network and is the author of the book Global Warming and the Risen Lord: Christian Discipleship and Climate Change.
Ball says the message of Evangelicals for Harris is resonating with many. He points to the more than 200,000 people who’ve signed up so far to get involved in local rallies and town hall meetings, including some less likely folks.


The Rev. Lee Scott is a Presbyterian minister in Pittsburgh who’s been a registered Republican since he turned 18. “Cast my first vote for George W. Bush,” he says proudly.
But because of Trump and his dominance over the GOP during the last decade, Scott is talking with friends, family and other clergy in his swing state of Pennsylvania about why he’s supporting the Harris-Walz campaign. It’s a nuanced and complicated conversation.
“They've got a ton of policy positions that I personally don't endorse,” says Scott. “We're very far apart on the issue of abortion. But we have to do more than just say ‘abortion bad.’”
Scott says Harris is answering questions that Republicans haven’t in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturning federal abortion rights.
“How are we then going to support new mothers? How are we going to put funding behind that?” he asks. “And that's a part of her [Harris’s] plan. I love that she wants to expand the child tax credit,” which Scott says would help support people who might otherwise choose to end a pregnancy fearing they couldn’t afford a child.


Still, many conservative Christians are pushing back against Evangelicals for Harris. Billy Graham’s son Franklin Graham has questioned the use of his father’s image and words in the Evangelicals for Harris ad. In a posting on X, Graham said that he “appreciated the conservative values and policies of President” Trump and would continue to do so if he were alive today.
Another prominent evangelical leader, Michael Brown, used a recent episode of his popular Line of Fire podcast and radio show to argue the issue of abortion is a deal breaker.
“That one alone because it touches the most innocent, the most vulnerable,” Brown told his listeners. “That one alone because of what the bible says about the shedding of innocent blood and doing anything to harm the little ones.”
For decades, evangelical Christians have focused their political efforts in two main areas: opposition to abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights. But that’s not the whole story, says Democrat and Texas State Representative James Talarico, who’s also working with Evangelicals for Harris.
“When I open my Bible,” says the politician who is also a seminary student enrolled at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary, “I see more than 2,000 verses about economic justice and I see zero about abortion or gay rights.”
To be sure, the message of Evangelicals for Harris – focusing on poverty, healthcare and the environment – won’t resonate with most conservative Christians, admits Talarico. But he argues their pitch doesn’t have to.
“We don't have to win everybody,” he says. “We just have to win enough to win this election.”

UCM90FGE9U_38R5IIHFYG9M4I0,A suspect has been named after 4 people were killed on a train in the Chicago area,By Ayana Archie,"Published September 3, 2024 at 2:49 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-03/4-people-were-killed-on-a-train-in-the-chicago-area-on-labor-day-police-say,"Updated September 04, 2024 at 05:20 AM ET
Police have identified the suspect who is accused of shooting and killing four people on a Chicago-area train, authorities announced Tuesday.
Rhanni Davis, 30, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder after four people were shot across two train cars in Forest Park, Illinois, a village 10 miles west of Chicago.
Police were dispatched to a train station in Forest Park at about 5:30 a.m. after receiving a call that three people were shot. Three people were pronounced dead on the scene, while one was transported to the hospital and died there, Forest Park police said.
The train was in motion on the system’s blue line, and the shooting happened across two cars, police said.
“There is an absolute urgent need to address safety in our communities,"" Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said. ""We should be free to ride the train, to do yard work, gather with friends on a front porch. Public transportation should be a safe space for everyone and we must work together to ensure that every resident feels secure in their daily lives, whether at home, at work, and traveling on our transit systems. No place or time should be off limits because of crime.”
Davis initially escaped from the scene, but was later found through Chicago Transit Authority surveillance video, on the platform of a different station. Police also recovered a 9mm handgun in their possession. The weapon matched the six casings found on the train cars, police said.
Davis makes his first court appearance Wednesday, Foxx said. No motive has been established, authorities said.
“This is an isolated incident, so it can happen anywhere,” Forest Park Police Deputy Chief Christopher Chin said Monday. “Obviously, there’s a little bit more concern because it is on a mass transit system, but understand that there are security measures in place, not only by our local police departments that run along the line, but also CTA, as well.”
Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins said the village’s fire and police departments are dispatched to the train station often. He added that village officials have petitioned to state leadership to allocate more resources to Forest Park for mental health and opioid addiction.
“To the extent that out leaders in Springfield [Illinois] are considering any kind of CTA mass transit reorganization, we would ask them to consider investing additional resources in terms of safety, public safety, law enforcement personnel, what have you, to support a small community like Forest Park that has to respond to two major train lines ending in Forest Park,” he said Monday.
CTA President Dorval Carter said the agency is constantly investing in its security measures, including expanding and upgrading its 30,000-camera system, hiring more security guards and recruiting more volunteer police officers.
The Chicago Police Department provides officers for CTA through its transit unit.
“To our riders, we want you to know that we hear you and we understand your concerns about safety,"" Carter said. ""The men and women of CTA are united in our commitment to make sure we’re doing everything in our power to protect you, our riders, as well as our employees.”
Information on the victims has not been released yet. Three of the victims' next-of-kin have been contacted, police said.

UT6RICZY2G_BJ43FG4NQIGU130,Legal experts want Judge Cannon removed from Trump's Mar-a-Lago documents case,By Greg Allen,"Published September 4, 2024 at 1:54 PM CDT",20240904,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-09-04/legal-experts-want-judge-cannon-removed-from-trumps-mar-a-lago-documents-case,"MIAMI — A retired federal judge is among those asking an appeals court to reassign former President Trump’s indictment on charges of mishandling classified documents case to a new judge.
In documents filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, two groups of legal experts and former government officials say U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon should be removed from the case.
Former federal judge Nancy Gertner and two legal scholars, Stephen Gillers and James Sample say rulings by Judge Cannon and her numerous delays have raised “well-founded concerns that she may be biased against the Government’s case and unable to manage that case impartially.” They’re seeking permission to file an amicus brief.
In July, Judge Cannon dismissed Trump’s indictment on charges he illegally withheld and concealed classified and top-secret documents from federal investigators. In a decision that ran counter to decades of judicial rulings, including by the U.S. Supreme Court, Cannon said the statute under which special counsel Jack Smith was appointed violated the Constitution. Smith is appealing the dismissal.
Gertner and the legal scholars were joined in the motion by the government watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government (CREW). They say if the appeals court overturns Cannon’s ruling, it would be the third time it’s reversed her in “a seemingly straightforward case about a former president’s unauthorized possession of government documents.”
A second group of former government officials and legal scholars has also filed a motion with the 11th Circuit asking for permission to file an amicus brief.
They say Judge Cannon’s ruling ignored the “plain text” of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution which allows the Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. Her dismissal of the charges they say are “in clear defiance of binding Supreme Court precedent and the plain text of Congress’ statutes.” They’re asking the Appeals Court to reverse Judge Cannon’s ruling and to remove her from the case.

And because the river was indeed roaring, we headed back to the top of the hill to record this intimate set.
Son Little had never performed a concert in a field before, but he was completely at ease on the hot hill, waiting patiently while we set up the cameras and microphones. He played a lovely four-song set that radiates vulnerability and affection, starting with “bend yr ear” and “what’s good” (both from his latest album, Like Neptune), and finished the set with two of his bigger hits, “mad about you” and “neve give up.”

XEMSI6O0DR_IOPDCEAQMIATWFT,What can we learn from millions of high school yearbook photos?,By Sofia Shchukina,"Published September 3, 2024 at 5:30 AM CDT",20240903,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-09-03/what-can-we-learn-from-millions-of-high-school-yearbook-photos,"Imagine you’re about to get your high school yearbook picture taken and you really want to stand out. What would you wear to distinguish yourself from your classmates? Would bright pink lipstick, a cartoon print tie, or a blue steel pout do the trick? Perhaps all of those things in combination?
Economists can now answer this question using AI – and not only for you, but for every single person who graduated high school between 1930 and 2010!
In a recent paper titled ""Image(s),"" economists Hans-Joachim Voth and David Yanagizawa-Drott analyzed 14.5 million high school yearbook photos from all over the U.S. Their AI tool categorized each photo based on what people were wearing in it, like “suit”, “necklace”, or “glasses.” The researchers then used the AI outputs to analyze how fashion had changed over time.
Images have been used to study fashion before, but researchers have rarely been able to process so many photos and also classify them by the items of clothing worn in one go. By doing so, Voth and Yanagizawa-Drott have accomplished something no one has before: a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the evolution of style, at least for graduating American high schoolers. The breadth of their data allowed them to document many different trends, some of which we already knew about, but also some that were really quite surprising.


So how did yearbook fashion evolve over time? If you were a yearbook photographer working in the 1950s, you would have taken picture after picture of clean-shaven young men in suits and ties with neatly trimmed hair. Young women were less predictable: many were starting to experiment with jewelry, short haircuts, and low necklines.
Fast-forward to the 1970s, and we land in a completely different fashion era. Young men become more adventurous with their clothing choices. Some grow their hair long, others don bow-ties or necklaces. Many young women opt for long hippie-style hair, and earrings start becoming more popular.
Among the fashion innovators of the time was Steve Jobs, who opted for a tux, bow tie, and long hair for his yearbook photo (yes, his photo was part of the study’s sample!). This look had rarely appeared in yearbook pictures before Jobs, but became popular soon after he wore it.
These fashion insights aren’t entirely novel, but rediscovering them with this new AI tool was important. By confirming things we already suspected to be true, like the fact that most young men opted for similar straight-laced looks for their yearbook photos in the fifties (suit, tie, collared shirt, short hair, no glasses, no jewelry, no facial hair), or the radical shift in fashion during the counterculture movement in the late sixties, Voth and Yanagizawa-Drott were able to show that their AI tool was correctly calibrated. Next, they moved onto documenting undiscovered patterns.
One style trait they studied was individualism: how much each student’s style differed from that of their classmates. They found that, in the thirties, young women were much more likely to dress differently from their peers relative to young men. But over time, this pattern switched. Young men started dressing in ways that made them stand out from their classmates more often, and young women did so less often. By the 2010s, men’s styles were more individualistic than women’s.
The opposite trend happened for persistence, another style trait the economists studied. Persistence measured how similarly each student dressed compared to people who had graduated from their high school 20 years ago. In the thirties, young men were considerably more likely to dress like their dads had for their yearbook photos, but by the 2010s it was young women who were more likely to dress like their moms.
The paper doesn’t explain why these shifts happened because you can’t really infer that from the data. But the authors provided us with some of their guesses. One reason could have been that it became more socially acceptable for men to experiment with fashion, which increased individualism. At the same time, women were entering the labor force in greater numbers and becoming more financially independent, which perhaps made it less important for young women to dress in ways that made them stand out to attract potential partners.
Another interesting discovery was how styles evolved in different regions. In the fifties, individualism and persistence were similar all over the country. That’s not to say that everyone was dressing the same, but rather that high school seniors were just as likely to stand out from their classmates or to dress like their parents did regardless of whether they were from New York, Alabama, or Texas.
But this began to change during the seventies. Generally speaking, high school seniors in the North became much more likely to dress differently from both their classmates and their parents than high school seniors in the South. They were also more likely to be style innovators, wearing looks that no one had seen before. By the nineties, levels of individualism and persistence in the North and South were completely different. These trends seemed to align with the political leanings of the regions (a more liberal North, a more conservative South), though the paper didn’t mention this correlation.

“How is this economics?” is a question you might be wondering. What could fashion trends possibly tell us about the economy?
It turns out that they can tell us a lot. There’s a long tradition of economics turning to fashion analysis going back over a century. Economists have come up with concepts like the “snob effect” (when high demand for a product makes it appear less elite) and a “Veblen good” (when a high price tag makes a product appear prestigious, and therefore more desirable) to explain surprising purchase patterns, and have even created mathematical models to understand how fashion cycles work (for more on Veblen goods, listen to this episode of Planet Money).
In fact, the economic analysis of fashion often falls into a broader subfield of economics called cultural economics, which looks at the relationship between culture and economic outcomes. Since culture is notoriously difficult to define, cultural economists ended up studying everything from fashion and media to technology and institutions to social norms and values like trust and competitiveness.
For instance, one of the most surprising findings in this field came from a study which found that modern gender norms might have been influenced by the adoption of the plow. Plows are heavy and require much more strength to use than other early farming instruments like hoes and digging sticks. So, in societies that used the plow, men had a natural advantage in farmwork. This contributed to a gendered division of labor – men started disproportionately working in the fields while women worked in the home. And this division of labor in turn influenced beliefs about the appropriate roles of men and women in society.
By contrast, this didn’t happen as much in societies which didn’t adopt the plow. Men had no natural advantage in using other farming tools, so everyone there was involved in farmwork. There was no reason to think of work outside the home as “men’s work”, so gender norms regarding work developed differently too. Amazingly, economists found that these historical differences affect gender norms to this day. It turns out that societies that did not adopt the plow still have higher gender equality and higher female labor force participation!

Returning to our original paper, what can we learn from millions of high school yearbook photos? To start, Voth and Yanagizawa-Drott’s paper shows the potential of using images to study how culture changes. Turning photos into a huge dataset that covers the entire country allows us to precisely track where change starts, how it spreads, and which communities resist it. Voth and Yanagizawa-Drott’s analysis gave us a new way of studying the counterculture movement of the sixties, for instance.
But mostly, we’re still just beginning to understand what we can learn from this work. Image(s) provided a proof-of-concept: it showed that it is possible to turn images into data by having AI identify different elements within each picture. And proof-of-concept studies tend to open more doors than they close.
Perhaps future research will be able to connect the stylistic shifts which Voth and Yanagizawa-Drott discovered to specific social, political, or economic developments and arrive at a better understanding of our history. Perhaps there will be commercial interest in such approaches, which could allow fashion brands to learn more about what people are wearing than they were ever able to know before. And it’s also likely that researchers will apply this method to study many other questions in cultural economics and other fields.
One thing is clear, however: as the number of images we see and interact with each day grows exponentially larger (thanks to the usual culprits – social media and the ever-expanding number of screens that we use all the time), our ability to learn from those images will increase too. It remains to be seen what else we might discover.

The strike occurred in the city of Poltava, the capital of the region of the same name, officials said. Poltava is located about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv. The city is on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border.
The strike appeared to be one of the deadliest carried out by Russian forces since the war began more than 900 days ago on Feb. 24, 2022.
""One of the buildings of the (Poltava Military) Institute of Communications was partially destroyed. People found themselves under the rubble. Many were saved,"" Zelenskyy said in a video posted on his Telegram channel.
""All necessary services are involved in the rescue operation,"" he added. He said he had ordered ""a full and prompt investigation"" into what happened. Zelenskyy didn't provide any further details.
The missiles hit shortly after the air raid alert sounded, when many people were on their way to a bomb shelter, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said, describing the strike as ""barbaric.""
Rescue crews and medics saved 25 people, 11 of them dug out from the rubble, a Defense Ministry statement said.
Poltava Gov. Filip Pronin announced three days of mourning starting on Wednesday.
""A great tragedy for Poltava region and entire Ukraine,"" Pronin wrote on his Telegram page. ""The enemy certainly must answer for all (its) crimes against humanity,"" he said.
The strike came on the day that Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Mongolia. There was no indication that his hosts would heed demands to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes.
Zelenskyy repeated his appeal for Ukraine's Western partners to ensure swift delivery of military aid. He has previously chided the U.S. and European countries for being slow to make good on their pledges of help.
He also wants them to ease restrictions on what Ukraine can target on Russian soil with the weapons they provide. Some countries fear that hitting Russia could escalate the war.
""Ukraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage,"" Zelenskyy wrote in English on Telegram.
""Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives,"" he said.

XS6WBM4NPU_9B4QZF11C1T1KKH,A 27-year-old just became queen of New Zealand's Maori,By Rachel Treisman,"Published September 5, 2024 at 1:44 PM CDT",20240905,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-09-05/a-27-year-old-just-became-queen-of-new-zealands-maori,"The Maori of New Zealand anointed a new monarch on Thursday, officially installing 27-year-old Nga Wai Hono i te Po as their second-ever queen.
The ceremony capped off a week of mourning for the previous Maori king, Tuheitia Pootatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died at age 69 after undergoing heart surgery just days after celebrating the 18th anniversary of his own coronation.
Nga Wai Hono i te Po, the new queen, happens to be his youngest child and only daughter. But the role of monarch is not hereditary: The successor is determined by tribal representatives from across the nation.
Leaders announced on Thursday that they had chosen Nga Wai Hono i te Po, making her the eighth Maori monarch and just the second queen. The first was her grandmother, Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, who reigned from 1966 until her death in 2006 (at which point her son became king).
“The new monarch was raised up in a ceremony known as Te Whakawahinga, in front of thousands of people gathered for the tangihanga of Kiingi Tuheitia,” the tribal leaders said in a statement.
A historic bible was placed on Nga Wai Hono i te Po’s head, and a prominent archbishop used sacred oils to “bestow prestige, sacredness, power and spiritual essence” upon her. Then, the visibly emotional queen took a seat on a wooden throne next to her father’s coffin.
The coffin was later paddled — in a traditional canoe flotilla — along the river to Taupiri Mountain, the final resting place of the king and other high-profile Maori, according to CNN.
The ceremonies took place in Tūrangawaewae Marae on the North Island, which is the seat of the Maori King movement.
The political institution developed in the 1850s, when Maori tribes decided to unify under a single sovereign in the face of an influx of British settlers and demand for their land, as well as broader political marginalization.
Today the role of the Maori monarch is largely symbolic. As a former British colony and current member of the British Commonwealth, New Zealand’s official monarch is King Charles.
But the new queen is ascending at a particularly important time: New Zealand’s right-leaning coalition government has faced widespread criticism for dismantling initiatives that benefit indigenous people since taking power last year.
Among other policy changes, it has curbed the use of Maori language in government organizations, closed the Maori Health Authority and rolled back anti-smoking laws (disproportionately hurting the Maori population, which sees higher rates of both smoking and lung cancer).
The late king Tuheitia had urged unity in recent months, including at a January tribal gathering that drew some 10,000 Maori together to discuss how to respond to the government’s plans. His daughter, now the queen, was there by his side.
New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon paid his respects to the king last week, but did not attend the funeral as he is on an official trip to South Korea, the BBC reports. He wished the new queen well in a tweet on Wednesday.
“As Kiingi Tuheitia makes his final journey from Turangawaewae, we reflect on his legacy and look to the future with hope and anticipation,” he wrote. “We welcome the Upoko Ariki, Ngawai hono i te po, who carries forward the mantle of leadership left by her father.”


Nga Wai Hono i te Po had been favored as her father’s successor, but her selection “was not a foregone conclusion,” according to Radio New Zealand.
She became a more recognizable figure in recent years, accompanying the king on official engagements and serving as his official representative on a 2022 visit to London, where she met with then-Prince Charles.
The trip came over a century after a Maori king traveled to England to meet with Queen Victoria, only to be turned away. Nga Wai Hono i te Po was upfront about her mixed feelings given the painful past between the two countries.
“Although I feel excited about meeting the Prince of Wales, a part of me is still reluctant,” she told the media, in the Maori language. “I have a loud mouth, so I need to be careful.”
Nga Wai Hono i te Po earned a bachelor’s degree at the University of Waikato and a master’s degree in Tikanga Maori, generally defined as Maori practices and behaviors, according to 1News.
She has since served as a member on numerous boards, including of the Te Kōhanga Reo National Trust, which is charged with revitalizing the Maori language.
She has long been involved in Kapa Haka, a Maori performing art involving dancing and chanting while standing in rows. She got a job teaching it while in university, and was also part of a Kapa Haka group with which both of her parents had performed, according to Radio New Zealand.
As a student, she told the University of Waikato that Kapa Haka was a huge part of her daily life.
“I walk around my house and I see a taiaha [traditional weapon]. I get into my car and my poi [performance prop] is on the seat,” she said. “I go home to my parents’ house and my little nephew is there and he’s trying to do the Haka. So it is just everywhere. I’ve been brought up in it, I am it.”
Nga Wai Hono i te Po received her chin tattoo — called a moko kauae — at age 19 in 2016, which she said at the time was to acknowledge and support her father’s decade on the throne.
“In the ten years my father has experienced so many things,” she said. “So this is perhaps my gift to him, my moko kauae.”

Several series of explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours. Debris from intercepted missiles and drones fell in every district of Kyiv, injuring three people and damaging two kindergartens, Ukraine's Interior Ministry said. City authorities reported multiple fires.
After more than 900 days of war, the two sides show no sign of letting up in the fight or moving closer to the negotiating table. The two sides are pursuing ambitious ground offensives, with the Ukrainians driving into Russia's Kursk region and the Russian army pushing deeper into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
Both sides are battering each other with regular long-range drone and missile strikes, sometimes launching more than 100 weapons in aerial attacks that suggest they are still pouring resources into weapon production.
Russian air defenses intercepted 158 Ukrainian drones during the night from Saturday to Sunday, including two over Moscow and nine over the surrounding region, the Defense Ministry said.
The U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday that Russian forces accelerated their advance on they key Donetsk stronghold Povkrosk over the past week and are likely within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the city.
Elsewhere along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line there have been no significant changes, it said.
Russia launched 35 missiles of various types and 26 Shahed drones at Ukraine on the night from Sunday to Monday, the Ukrainian air force said. Nine ballistic missiles, 13 cruise missiles and 20 drones were downed, it said.
Residents of the capital hurried into the city's bomb shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said emergency services were called to the Holosiivskyi and Solomianskyi districts. One person was reportedly injured by falling debris in the Shevchenkivskyi district, Klitschko said.
""There will be an answer for everything. The enemy will feel it,"" the head of the presidential office, Andrii Yermak, posted on his Telegram page following the attack.
An explosion also rang out in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, according to Ukrainian media. Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region, confirmed an early morning strike on Kharkiv's Industrialnyi district and said it set a residential building and several others on fire.

ZPNWAHZGCX_EVG0TZH9DWHVTRI,Israeli protesters call for a cease-fire deal after recovery of 6 dead hostages,"By Carrie Kahn,","Published August 31, 2024 at 11:32 PM CDT",20240901,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-08-31/israel-recovers-bodies-of-6-hostages-including-israeli-american-hersh-goldberg-polin,"Updated September 01, 2024 at 16:18 PM ET
Massive crowds protested in Israel on Sunday after the bodies of six more hostages were recovered in Gaza.
Protesters called for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
Histadrut, the largest trade union in Israel, called for a general strike on Monday in protest.
Israel’s military said early Sunday that it had recovered the bodies of six hostages from Gaza, including 23-year-old Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who had become widely known due to his family’s efforts to secure his release, including an appearance at last month’s Democratic National Convention.
Goldberg-Polin’s family released a statement Sunday.
“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh. The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for privacy at this time,” the statement said.
The Israeli military said it located and recovered the six bodies from “an underground tunnel in the Rafah area in the Gaza Strip and returned them to Israeli territory.”
Israel's health ministry said the ""six abductees were murdered by Hamas terrorists in a number of short-range shots"" and that forensic examination showed they were killed in the last few days.
Protesters say it means that a cease-fire deal could have saved them.
More than 100,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Tel Aviv, according to organizers, where people waved Israeli flags and others held signs calling Netanyahu a murderer and a criminal. Many feel Netanyahu is the one holding up a deal.
""Time after time there's a chance to bring them home, and he finds other reasons for it not to happen, so we just have to do something,"" said Ronit Katzenstein-Nahmias.
In a statement from the official forum representing hostage families, the remaining five hostages were identified as Carmel Gat, 40; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Alexander Lobanov, 32; Almog Sarusi, 27; and Ori Danino, 25.
They are some of the youngest hostages that were kidnapped on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants. Five of them were taken from a music festival that day at the Israel-Gaza border. The sixth was taken from a nearby border farm.
President Biden issued a statement late Saturday saying he was “devastated and outraged.”
Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 21 to apply pressure to help bring hostages abducted by militants back home. They had met with world leaders, including the pope.
Biden’s statement said Goldberg-Polin’s parents “have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions.”
“It is as tragic as it is reprehensible. Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages,” Biden’s statement continued.
Goldberg-Polin, a native of Berkeley, Calif., was abducted at a music festival on Oct. 7 during the Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. About 250 hostages were taken by Hamas and other attackers.
The Israeli government estimates there are over 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, with about one-third of them believed to be dead.
Relatives and supporters of the hostages say Netanyahu has not done enough to make a deal with Hamas to secure their release.
Negotiations have stalled for months. Netanyahu insists military pressure is the best strategy despite public disagreement with his top security officials.
Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks has killed more than 40,602 people and injured more than 93,855, according to the Gaza Health Ministry as of Aug. 29.
In a video statement Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel has been ""holding intensive negotiations with the mediator"" in recent days to reach a deal but said Hamas had refused all proposals.
""Whoever murders hostages — does not want a deal,"" he said. ""For our part, we will not relent. The government of Israel is committed, and I am personally committed, to continue striving toward a deal that will return all of our hostages and ensure our security and our existence.""
The head of Israel’s National Unity Party blamed Netanyahu, posting on social media: ""He should protect the abductees and not his coalition controlled by extremists.""
