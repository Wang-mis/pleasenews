Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi says the country's core policy is based on the continuation of support for the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah.
Araqchi made the remarks on Sunday in a meeting with Abdullah Safioddin, the representative of Hezbollah in Iran.
He expressed Iran's support for the resistance front and the legitimate fight of regional nations against the Israeli regime's occupation.
Safioddin, for his part, said Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other officials have extended their congratulations to Araqchi over his appointment as Iran's new foreign minister.
During the meeting, the top Iranian diplomat and Hezbollah representative discussed the latest developments in the region, particularly the resistance front's battle against Israel in Lebanon, and the ongoing incidents in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
In a meeting with Iran's former acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani back in June, Nasrallah expressed his gratitude to Iran for its "steadfast" support for peoples and resistance movements in the region in defiance of sanctions and threats.
