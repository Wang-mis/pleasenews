0V54GP0Y0A_QFM4KYG1V3TWK3M,Cervical Cancer Awareness Month: preventing and eliminating the disease in Alabama,Alabama Public Radio | By Hannah Holcombe,"Published January 22, 2024 at 5:33 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-22/cervical-cancer-awareness-month-preventing-and-eliminating-the-disease-in-alabama,"January is Cervical Cancer Prevention Month, and Alabama is making progress in the first ever statewide action plan to prevent and eliminate the disease. Operation WIPE OUT Cervical Cancer Alabama is an initiative that launched in May 2023 to help educate Alabamians about cervical cancer and prevent the illness through vaccines and screenings.
“Good news: Cervical cancer is preventable; we can actually eliminate cervical cancer. That's what Operation Wipe Out is about,” said Nancy Wright, director of the cancer prevention and control division at the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH).
Alabama is among states with one of the highest mortality rates for cervical cancer. To meet the goals of Operation WIPE OUT Cervical Cancer Alabama, ADPH is taking the following actions to advance its goals:
1) Providing free HPV immunizations through the Vaccines for Children Program at each county health department and various grant-funded vaccine for adults.2) Providing free cervical cancer screenings for women who have a low income and are uninsured at each county health department.3) Providing follow-up colposcopies at county health departments for women who need them.
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of most cervical cancers. To help prevent people in Alabama from getting the illness, Operation Wipe Out is encouraging parents and guardians to have their children vaccinated against HPV. Every child (both boys and girls) can get vaccinated as early as nine years old, but it is recommended that they receive the vaccine at ages 11 or 12 for protection against all types of cancers caused by HPV.
“Every health department in the state can provide that vaccination free of charge to boys and girls under the age of 19,” said Wright. “So really, every child should have access to that vaccination at no cost.”
Children can get vaccinated for not only HPV, but for other immunizations as well through the Vaccines for Children Program. VPC offers free vaccines for children with or without insurance.
In effort to eliminate cervical cancer in Alabama, Operation Wipe Out is encouraging Alabamians to get screened. Wright said people who have HPV are at larger risk for developing cervical cancer. She said getting screened is a key step to catching it early and getting treatment.
“There are no symptoms for the HPV virus, which is one of the reasons it's so dangerous. When you have pre-cancer or pre-cervical cancer, there's no symptoms,” said Wright. “So, I think that's one of the reasons it's so easy for people not to think of the vaccination or screening.”
Wright explained that for those who have been screened and have had abnormal results, the next step would be to make a follow up appointment with the appropriate doctor for further testing or receive treatment. She said although the percentage of people who have abnormal results are low, it is crucial that they make the follow up appointment to.
“For the women that ADPH has been able to screen for cervical cancer, we have found that 20% of them are positive. 20% of the women that we've screened do have the HPV virus, which means it can lead to pre-cancer or full invasive cervical cancer,” she said.
According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is currently no approved test for HPV in men. As a result, there is no recommended routine testing for HPV in men. Wright said the role for boys and men in eliminating cervical cancer is receiving the HPV vaccination as HPV can affect men. She said the virus also causes cancers of the head and neck, as well as penile and anal cancers. Wright explained that the HPV vaccine protects against these cancers as well.

17E13MH5OW_DQITIQ8QLBFOL3E,The UAW endorsed Biden — and panned Republican frontrunner Trump as a 'scab',"By Deepa Shivaram,","Published January 24, 2024 at 2:24 PM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-24/the-uaw-endorsed-biden-and-panned-republican-frontrunner-trump-as-a-scab,"The United Auto Workers endorsed President Biden's reelection campaign on Wednesday in a fiery speech from its president, Shawn Fain. Fain said Biden had earned the nod with his pro-union policies and went on to excoriate former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican race, for his past actions and statements.
Fain showed a highlight reel of Biden walking the picket line outside a General Motors facility in Wayne, Mich., the first time in modern history that a sitting president had done that.
He contrasted Biden's actions with what Trump did during a 40-day strike in 2019, displaying a blank slide to the ballroom of cheering union members. ""He said nothing, he did nothing, not a damn thing, because he doesn't care about the American worker,"" Fain said.
""Donald Trump is a scab,"" Fain said. ""Donald Trump stands against everything we stand for as a union, as a society.""
""So that's a choice we face. It's not about who you like, it's not about your party. It's not this bulls*** about age. It's not about anything but our best shot at taking back power for the working class,"" he said.


In the 2016 election, Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, in part with a message to workers hurt by free trade agreements.
But Biden won those key states in 2020, in part because he made gains among white working class voters — and won a majority of union households. It's a strategy his campaign is seeking to repeat this year, which makes the UAW endorsement key.
While other major U.S. unions were quick to endorse his campaign last year, the UAW — which represents nearly 400,000 members — held back. Fain said that the union's endorsements were ""going to be earned and not freely given.""
Then came the UAW's six-week strike last year with the Big Three automakers, and Biden's full-throated support for the union.
""I was so damn proud to stand on that picket line with you,"" Biden said on Wednesday. ""You made sure the automobile future of the world will be made in America.""
Fain also reminded members how Biden supported a UAW push to save a plant in Belvidere, Ill. ""Instead of talking trash about our union, Joe Biden stood with us, and supported our historic victory to save Belvidere, and save that community,"" Fain said, recalling how Trump in 2008 had blamed unions for the crisis in the auto industry.
Aside from a brief protest from a few audience members who disrupted Biden's speech to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, the crowd seemed to largely back the union's endorsement of Biden.
""I think he's the best we have to represent our interests and the working class's interests,"" said Bob Reynolds, a retiree from Ford's Buffalo Stamping Plant.
While he's concerned about climate change, Reynolds said he is concerned about the speed of the transition to electric vehicles, which the Biden administration has made a top priority. Still, he's optimistic that the cars of the future will be built by UAW workers.
""We're organizing more and more. The union jobs are there if we can organize them,"" he said.

1CZWVBMS2N_S8AE4GNZN5MQTKL,The U.S. identifies the 2 Navy SEALs who went missing off the coast of Somalia,"By Emma Bowman,","Published January 21, 2024 at 7:51 PM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-21/2-navy-seals-who-went-missing-off-somalias-coast-are-dead-the-u-s-military-says,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 6:56 PM ET
The U.S. Navy has released the names of the two Navy SEALs who went missing at sea and are now presumed dead.
The Naval Special Warfare Command on Monday identified the men as Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J. Chambers, 37, and Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram, 27.
The SEALs were reported missing after a nighttime raid of a boat off the coast of Somalia on Jan. 11. U.S. officials said they found parts of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles Iran was supplying to Houthi fighters in Yemen.
""We extend our condolences to Chris and Gage's families, friends, and teammates during this incredibly challenging time. They were exceptional warriors, cherished teammates, and dear friends to many within the Naval Special Warfare community,"" Capt. Blake Chaney, the commander of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, said in a statement.
Chambers and Ingram were both assigned to a West Coast-based Naval Special Warfare unit. Chambers, from Maryland, enlisted in the Navy in 2012. His awards and decorations included a Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Combat ""C,"" three Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medals, an Army Achievement Medal, a Combat Action Ribbon, and other awards, the Navy said.
Ingram, from Texas, enlisted in the Navy in 2019 and his awards and decorations include various personal and unit awards, the Navy said.
During the operation, one of the men fell into the rough waters and a second followed in attempt to rescue him, as NPR previously reported.
Search and rescue operations concluded on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said, with the two SEALs presumed dead. It came after a 10-day search of more than 21,000 square miles, with assistance from Spain and Japan. Efforts have now switched to recovery, CENTCOM said.
The Navy said the incident is still under investigation.
U.S. Army Gen. Michael ""Erik"" Kurilla, who heads Central Command, said in a statement on Sunday: ""We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honor their sacrifice and example. Our prayers are with the SEALs' families, friends, the U.S. Navy, and the entire Special Operations community during this time.""
The Houthis have attacked commercial and military ships off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea for weeks, saying their attacks are a show of support for Palestinians facing Israeli attacks in Gaza. The U.S. has responded with airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen.

1U62J26NQS_2DQ7HW900KHG92O,Much of the U.S. is still in the grip of icy weather that is blamed for 72 deaths,By The Associated Press,"Published January 21, 2024 at 12:05 PM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-21/much-of-the-u-s-is-still-in-the-grip-of-icy-weather-that-is-blamed-for-72-deaths,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 9:19 PM ET
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Subfreezing conditions and treacherous roadways have contributed to dozens of deaths this month across the U.S., where states as far south as Texas and Florida remain gripped by deadly arctic weather Sunday. But the numbing cold is expected to ease up in the coming days.
Nationally, winter storms have claimed at least 72 lives around the U.S. this January, many involving hypothermia or road accidents.
On Sunday, crews in Memphis, Tennessee, continued to work around the clock to find and fix broken pipes that were causing low water pressure throughout the system. Memphis Light, Gas and Water President and CEO Doug McGowen told reporters Sunday afternoon that crews are making progress and he expects most of the 700,000 people the utility services to have water restored over the next 24 hours.
""If we remain on this very positive path, and we are on a positive path, I believe that by Wednesday we will have pressure sufficient for us to take samples of our water system,"" he said. ""Assuming good results, we think that means a Thursday for lifting of the boil water advisory.""
McGowen also asked people to stop dripping their faucets to help build pressure in the system.
Memphis Light, Gas and Water was repairing 10 water main breaks on Sunday afternoon, and McGowen said he expects to see more as the ground continues to thaw. The utility said it previously repaired 41 broken water mains and located more than 4,000 leaks at homes and businesses.
Stop dripping water from your faucets once the temperature rises above freezing. Doing so can put 5 - 10 million gallons of water back into the system increasing water pressure.

Rhodes College, in Memphis, began sending students living there home on Saturday and moving those who could not return home to hotels. The school was planning virtual classes on Monday and Tuesday.
""We ask that you NOT come to campus either day due to the ongoing water situation and the hazards that creates,"" the school announcement said.
Sam Roth is a junior majoring in politics, philosophy and economics who drove back home to Nashville rather than staying in a hotel where he would still be required to boil water.
""Our faucets stopped working, and they said not to use any of the restrooms on our floor, and our showers were not working very well either,"" he said of the situation in his dormitory.
Restaurants and bars were using bottled water to serve customers on Sunday. Some restaurants remained closed, citing the water issue, while others had a modified menu.
Memphis was the largest, but not the only, water system in Tennessee to experience problems from the unusually cold weather. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday night that 28 water systems have issued boil water notices.
In Tipton County, the fire department in Mason warned residents on Saturday to be prepared for a multiday water outage. Fire officials said in a Facebook post that water crews were working at all hours to try to isolate and repair leaks.
The mayor acknowledged in an interview with WMC-TV that the town has had water issues in the past due to a system that ""nobody took care of for a long time"" and is need of updates.
""The whole town has been without water for five days,"" said exasperated Mason resident Christina Ray. The fire department is handing out water throughout the town of 1,300 residents, but is limiting it to one case per day, per household. That's not enough for her family, which was collecting snow to flush the toilets.
""It's hard to cook. It's hard to flush toilets. It's hard to do dishes. We can't wash laundry,"" she said.
With warmer temperatures predicted this week, Ray now says she's faced with another worry: the potential of bursting pipes.
The continued cold weather is also responsible for at least 27 deaths in Tennessee, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
Just south in Mississippi, the state's Emergency Management Agency said Sunday that 11 people have died of causes related to frigid weather since Jan. 14.
Elsewhere, freezing rain, sleet and high wind gusts later Sunday would make traveling in parts of Kansas and Oklahoma particularly treacherous, the National Weather Service said. Wind chills in Iowa made it feel like minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 degrees Celsius) in some parts.

But the end of subzero temperatures — which blasted into the U.S. on Friday — was in sight for parts of the country. The daily high temperatures in Iowa's capital of Des Moines, for example, were expected to stay above freezing starting Monday.
""With no additional replenishment of arctic air from Canada, a steady warm-up is in store for the mid-section of the country,"" the weather service said.
In western New York, Buffalo Bills fans were getting ready for another home playoff game Sunday evening against the Kansas City Chiefs, with temperatures forecast around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 degrees Celsius), winds around 10 mph (16 kph) and a slight chance of snow showers. On Friday and Saturday, hundreds of people showed up at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park to help shovel snow out of the stands for the second week in a row, earning $20 an hour.
The Erie County Sheriff's Office was urging fans Sunday to not throw snowballs in the stadium or trespass on the new stadium construction site.
In Vermont, temperatures in the single digits to low teens didn't stop ice anglers and snowmobilers from their sport, and young ski jumpers braved the cold as they competed in northern New Hampshire. But 23 skiers and snowboarders had to be rescued in frigid temperatures on Saturday after becoming lost in the backcountry in Killington, Vermont, police said.
On the West Coast, more freezing rain was forecast in the Columbia River Gorge and the area was expected to remain near or below freezing through at least Sunday night. Trees and power lines already coated with ice could topple if they get more, the National Weather Service warned.
""Stay safe out there over the next several days as our region tries to thaw out,"" the weather service said. ""Chunks of falling ice will remain a hazard as well.""

1YMS3M41P4_VRMWYCUS6IG507L,Tracking supply and demand in human trafficking: the STANDD initiative Part 1,Alabama Public Radio | By Joe Moody,"Published January 25, 2024 at 5:00 AM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-25/tracking-supply-and-demand-in-human-trafficking-the-standd-initiative-part-1,"Three researchers from The University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Business are using their skills to combat human sex trafficking. They have formed a group called the STANDD initiative standing for Sex Trafficking Analytics for Network Detection and Disruption. The group collaborates with law enforcement at the local and national level to fight what has become an illegal online industry. One member of the team is Dr. Burcu Keskin. She is a professor of operations management and specializes in supply chain networks and the disruption of illicit supply chains. In fact, her work was recently recognized by the university through the prestigious Blackmon Moody award.
Dr. Keskin explained the support she received from local authorities in starting her research. “The West Alabama Human Trafficking Task Force creates seminars, you know, for public to inform them. And I attended one of those seminars. At the same time, National Science Foundation started a call, they had a ‘Dear Colleague’ letter, and they were calling for supply chain optimization, you know, AI, data scientists, computer scientists, anybody from any discipline, to essentially tackle disrupting the illicit operations.”
Dr. Keskin remembered speaking with the chief of police at the time. “He actually talked to me like for a couple of hours for all the problems that they're having and my other colleagues here at University of Alabama, Nick Freeman, and Greg Bott, we established that STANDD initiative not too long after that. We started working on that and started collecting data because there's so much data available, like so many ads…”
The ads Dr. Keskin is referring to are ads relating to sexual services. She mentions the work of her, and her colleagues often involves collecting about 100,000 daily online posts to review for possible human trafficking violations.
Inspector Jessica Wilson is with UAPD and the West Alabama Trafficking Task Force. “…Really, they just reached out to offer however, we can help we want to help…,” she said, “And we didn't really know what that would look like at first and it's really turned out to be a great thing. There are hundreds of ads for commercial sex posted in our city every single day. And that's more than even we as a task force can keep up with but certainly without a taskforce we would be way behind. And so, you know, with every commercial sex ad, there is a potential that this is a victim of human trafficking. And we do our best to be proactive in in responding to those ads and, you know, meeting with these people and determining whether this might be a victim or not and that's part of what the research with STANDD initiative has helped us to be able to do more efficiently.”
Another member of the STANDD initiative is Dr. Nicholas Freeman, an associate professor of operations management. He speaks on the project's humble beginnings. “So, it was barbed wire and duct tape. There was no funding right?” he said. “So, we built the initial kind of, you know, scraping applications and the initial code on those old hammered down machines. We were able to get some seed funds after you know about a year that allowed us to purchase a workstation to where we could do this a little bit more effectively. And recently, as of this July, we've submitted many grants to various agencies, but we did get an award from the National Science Foundation, that's going to be extremely helpful.”
Dr. Freeman explained the purpose of the STANDD initiative, “…we're trying to identify the people that are that are being exploited against their will, and then put the information into the hands of law enforcement nonprofits so that they can you know…we're data people, right? All we can do is help bring this information so that they can be a little bit more effective.”
The third member of the STANDD initiative, Dr. Greg Bott, is also an associate professor at Culverhouse, but brings in a different set of skills as his specialization is management information systems rather than management science. His areas of expertise include cybersecurity and digital forensics. He explains that a lot of this illegal activity is in plain sight. “The vast majority of buying and selling a commercial sex happens on the surface web.” he said. “Site A, B, and C are out there for you to go look at just on any browser from any location without any kind of, you know, hiding or protection or obfuscation. It's just available."" This is where the data collection of the standard initiative comes in finding sites involved in this illegal activity. ""Yeah, so what we do as we write code that will kind of automate your browser so if you were to get the data yourself like this as a normal person, you might bring up the website and highlight all the texts and copy it and then paste it. So, we have a programmatic way to do that. So, we write Python code using some libraries that will automatically load that page and grab the relevant data and download that. And we do that over and over and over again every day 24/7 across multiple sites,"" Bott said, ""We likely have the largest dataset of our kind in the world.”
Dr. Freeman mentions the prevalence of the problem. “The thing is, it's everywhere and that's been probably the most, you know, shocking thing to me is it's everywhere you look…right?... everywhere… We've gone and we've worked with people all across the United States, right? But we do a lot here in Tuscaloosa and what people should realize is that you know, it is definitely going on right around you wherever you are, small town, Alabama, all the way up to you know, the larger cities.” One of the complexities of this issue is in the understanding of the problem itself. “It’s weird. You look at the media, you look at the movie depictions of things,” Dr. Freeman said, “and we kind of had this fanciful idea of what trafficking looks like. It's like, you know, people getting kidnapped, put in cages, and shipped around, we tend to see things it's a little bit more subtle than that, right?”
In part two, we will explore human sex trafficking further by looking at these subtleties and how reality differs from these movie depictions. Links to more information can be found on the STANDD initiative and some of the nonprofits they work with on our website.

33T926BXKR_LV26KLLM72ZSV41,Young voters focus more on issues than candidates in 2024 presidential election,"By Claire Murashima,","Published January 25, 2024 at 4:10 AM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-25/young-voters-focus-more-on-issues-than-candidates-in-2024-presidential-election,"Voters under 30 tend to lean left of center overall and could make a major difference for Democratic candidates. But it's unclear if they will turn out in strong enough numbers to help President Biden win reelection, according to Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, which has conducted in-depth research on what's driving young voters.
Dozens of youths shared their biggest concerns at the ballot box with NPR. Here's what they said:

As campaign season for the 2024 election gets into full swing, many young voters — meaning people under 30 — say they're disillusioned with politics and plan to sit out. However, it remains to be seen whether that will happen.
""What we know from research is that it is really too early to tell exactly how young people would respond, whether by not voting, voting in certain directions and parties or opposing certain parties and candidates,"" Kawashima-Ginsberg told NPR's Leila Fadel.
This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.


Leila Fadel: I wanted to start by asking you about what your research is finding to be the top issues for young voters this election season.
Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg: Young people have always cared deeply about social issues. But this election and before this, too, [they] have actually cared more about the economy, jobs, affordable living, living wage-paying jobs being available to them.
Fadel: How much of an issue is Gaza? I know that a lot of young voters have told us they care about it. Here are some of the answers we heard from young voters about the 2024 presidential election.


Fadel: What does your research say about how much this is going to impact young voters at the polls?
Kawashima-Ginsberg: So what we just heard is actually pretty wide ranging opinions about what should be happening. And our research generally suggests that is the case, meaning that young people are diverse in both their opinions, how politically engaged they are today and in relation to the Israeli-Palestine issues. So what we know from research is that it is really too early to tell exactly how young people would respond, whether by not voting, voting in certain directions and parties or opposing certain parties and candidates. What we are hearing, though we did not exactly ask this question in the survey we fielded in late last year, is that the young people, about 30, 35% are still deciding whom to vote for.
Fadel: We saw an enthusiasm among young voters in 2022, in the midterms, in which we saw Democrats turn some of those seats. But we're also anecdotally hearing some disillusionment with Biden, some disappointment and young people saying they're not going to vote for Biden on principle, even if his competitor is worse in their view. Is this something that your research is showing?


Kawashima-Ginsberg: Young people have not been as enthusiastic supporters of the Biden administration [even] before President Biden was elected. So what's different about Gen Z generation in particular, who's known to be politically active, also very diverse and caring about a variety of social issues, is that when they're disappointed in what the government is doing or what the leaders are showing them, they're willing to take the issue in their own hand and try to intervene, try to get involved sometimes by speaking up by their vote.
But by and large, they have voted more than other generations have as youth, regardless of how disappointed they say they are in the government. So if the past couple of elections' trends hold, young people have been disappointed in the government and their elected leaders, but they voted.

Listen to Morning Edition each day here or on your local member station for more interviews like this.

Fadel: Is there a candidate that young people are turning toward?
Kawashima-Ginsberg: What we know from research is that young people do support issues first and foremost, and do not necessarily show sort of a... (Fadel) party loyalty? (Kawashima-Ginsberg) Yeah, correct.
Young people really want to hear from candidates who understand where they are in life and understand how they would support their priorities. Economy, housing, cost of living are some of the top issues.
But another issue that is not considered a social issue per se but [looms] large on young people's mind, is mental health issues. Almost half of young people named mental health challenges as being part of their daily lives. So understanding where young people are as one of the generations most politically active on one hand, but also struggling mightily with mental health issues and the economy, is a really important point to understand beyond social and controversial issues. Young people are like everybody else. They're trying to get through each day. And I think candidates who can be on their level in understanding how to listen to them are really, really going to win their support.
Fadel: But what young voters did do in 2022 is show that they do have power at the polls through the participation they gave. It was seen as a major reason that Democrats won in battleground states. Are candidates respecting the vote of young people like they should now?
Kawashima-Ginsberg: I think many young people would say they're not respected enough. We hear that in some surveys, too, where young people are really starting to, and have always, to a certain extent, doubted how effective their votes will be, how much they would respond when they elect leaders they think will have their priorities. I think [it] continues to be important that the elected leaders show that they heard their priorities in conversation with the young people so that they can come to an agreement or at least a solution that both parties can say is one step forward.
There's no perfect solution for many issues that young people care about, and there are limits to what governments can do. But what young people have shown is that they are willing to give government and elected leaders a chance by coming out to vote. But if they continue to feel disrespected and unheard, they could, in fact, show that they really need to have that respect by not voting.

372P9NIJYC_D82M4NKEAA9M0Z9,Senate border negotiations forge ahead despite pressure from Trump,"By Lexie Schapitl,","Published January 25, 2024 at 12:20 PM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-25/senate-border-negotiations-forge-ahead-despite-pressure-from-trump,"Updated January 25, 2024 at 3:52 PM ET
A bipartisan deal that would pair assistance to Ukraine and Israel with measures to improve border security is facing serious political threats as negotiators aim to finalize a deal.
The talks seemed on the verge of collapse Wednesday after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested the politics around the agreement have shifted, but negotiators have vowed to forge ahead.
Punchbowl News first reported that McConnell told Republican senators the politics ""have changed"" because former President Trump wants to build his reelection campaign around immigration. ""We don't want to do anything to undermine him,"" McConnell reportedly said.
A spokesperson for the minority leader did not dispute the Punchbowl report when NPR asked for comment.
McConnell's comments deflated hopes that a deal could be made public this week. Negotiators told reporters as early as Monday that they were nearing a final agreement on outstanding issues like parole for asylum seekers.
But McConnell appeared to back away from his comments on Thursday, telling reporters he still supports the talks.
The border agreement has been explicitly tied to security funding for Israel and Ukraine and any failure could threaten chances of Congress passing that aid. President Biden agreed to couple his funding request with border security elements at the behest of Republicans, including McConnell.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Olivia Dalton told reporters Thursday that the White House remains committed to getting deal on border and national security funding.
""The president has been clear, we need action on the border,"" Dalton told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""We've been engaging in good faith, bipartisan negotiations with both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to that end. And we believe that there's no reason that shouldn't continue.""

Still, senators on both sides of the aisle insisted Thursday that the deal is not dead. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead Republican involved in the talks, said negotiations were still moving forward, and that McConnell was acknowledging the ""political realities"" of the situation, but not suggesting the deal be abandoned.
""We started this in October, and it's not October anymore,"" Lankford said. ""You know, it's now January. The end of January. And we're in the middle of a presidential primary season ... that's just a reality.""
Sen. Chris Murphy, the lead Democrat involved in negotiations, said he has not spoken to McConnell about his comments, but reiterated that ""talks are ongoing.""
""I think the Republican conference is going to make a decision in the next 24 hours as to whether they actually want to get something done or whether they want to leave the border a mess for political reasons,"" said Murphy, D-Conn.

While text of an agreement has not yet been released, Trump spoke out against a bipartisan framework last week, writing on his social media site, Truth Social: I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions & Millions of people, many from parts unknown, into our once great, but soon to be great again, Country!""
He added that House Speaker Mike Johnson should only accept a deal that is ""perfect.""
Trump's comments comments were a serious blow to the talks. Significant border provisions were meant to garner Republican support for Ukraine assistance, which the party has increasingly soured on. House Republicans in particular have little appetite for more Ukraine aid, and have been insisting that the Senate take up a border bill they previously passed — without a single Democratic vote — instead of working on a bipartisan one.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who supports aid for Ukraine, stressed that Thursday his state ""can't continue to absorb"" the number of migrants currently crossing the border, which hit a record high of 2.5 million people last year.
""President Trump, you know, obviously he's an important voice but we have a job to do. And we intend to do it,"" Cornyn said. ""Some people are saying, 'well you know, we can't give President Biden a win, because he desperately needs this.' But the magnitude of this problem is so great that this is not going to be all of a sudden fixed here in the next 10 months.""

3ZXN2CWTD0_B2A39ZB0XGV51VP,Exclusive: The Education Department says it will fix its $1.8 billion FAFSA mistake,By Cory Turner,"Published January 23, 2024 at 3:29 PM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-01-23/exclusive-the-education-department-says-it-will-fix-its-1-8-billion-fafsa-mistake,"Updated January 23, 2024 at 5:25 PM ET
Families have a lot of questions right now about how much help they'll get paying for college — questions that financial aid offices can't yet answer.
That's because this year's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is months behind schedule. And to make things really complicated, it includes a mistake that would have cost students $1.8 billion in federal student aid.
We covered the mistake in detail here. In a nutshell: The U.S. Education Department's FAFSA math, for deciding how much aid a student should get, is wrong.
In practice, this mistake would make some students and families appear to have more income than they really do, and that means they would get less aid than they should. And not just federal financial aid but also all sorts of state and school-based aid.
On Tuesday, a department spokesperson confirmed to NPR that the department will fix this mistake in time for the 2024-2025 award year, though the spokesperson could not provide details on how or how quickly the fix will be made. For the first time, the department also gave a sense of just how much federal student aid is at stake: $1.8 billion.
""The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to making higher education possible for more students, including through ensuring students qualify for as much financial aid as possible,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""The polite way to say it is, wow. I mean, I was shocked.""
That's how Brad Barnett, the financial aid director at James Madison University in Virginia, describes learning about the mistake.
""I get that there's complexities in building and programming a new system. OK. But forgetting to put the right numbers into a table that now has created all this consternation and delays really surprised me.""
The FAFSA is new this year because Congress passed a law ordering the Education Department to make sweeping changes. The idea was to make it easier to fill out and to give more lower-income families access to federal aid. Families like Myrna Aguilar's.
""I am a single parent. In addition to my son, my mom lives with us, so we're a multigenerational family, which is awesome,"" Aguilar told NPR.
Aguilar's son, David Thornton, is studying mechanical engineering at Cal Poly Pomona in Southern California, where he just finished his first semester.
""It was fun,"" Thornton says, wearing a hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with ""Cal Poly Pomona College of Engineering."" ""There were a lot of events that I really enjoyed. My classes were very interesting. Stressful, but interesting.""
Thornton got lots of help paying for college, including a $1,500 Pell Grant from the U.S. government. Pell Grants are for lower-income students and don't need to be paid back. That's important because after Thornton filled out the new FAFSA a couple of weeks ago, the Education Department sent him an email with a surprise: Next year, it says, he's going to lose that $1,500 Pell Grant, though it's unclear why.
""That actually is equivalent to an extra mortgage payment,"" Aguilar says. ""That's, you know, inconvenient.""
She insists this won't keep her son from returning to Cal Poly, which he loves. She'll save and fill the gap, if that's what it takes. But she wants to know: Why did this happen?
It could be because of the department's FAFSA mistake. Financial aid experts tell NPR it's difficult at this point to know for certain.
""We're in a situation where we really can't help students or their families,"" says Charles Conn, a top aid administrator at Thornton's university, Cal Poly Pomona. ""They're getting some information from the Department of Ed. We're not.""
Because of this year's big FAFSA overhaul, Conn says, the Education Department is really behind, and it's telling colleges they won't be getting any financial aid data for students like Thornton until the end of this month, at the earliest.
""[That] really cripples our office and our ability to fulfill our role, which is to help students and their families make sense of all of this,"" Conn says. That includes helping Thornton and Aguilar understand what happened to his Pell Grant.

The Education Department says it will fix the FAFSA mistake this year, but it did not clarify how or when. And it's unclear what impact any fix would have on universities' financial aid timelines.
Before the department shared its decision, NPR spoke with a dozen financial aid experts and administrators across the U.S. — at colleges big and small, public and private — to hear how they think the department should manage a potential fix.
""I don't know what the best option is. None of them are good,"" says Karen Krause, the executive director of financial aid for the University of Texas at Arlington.
Option 1: The Education Department can try to fix this quickly, before it sends any student FAFSA data on to colleges.
The problem with that option is that even a quick fix will take time, further delaying the student data that universities need. Without that data, colleges can't even begin to come up with financial aid offers to send to families.
""It's nausea-inducing,"" says Christina Tangalakis, who manages student aid for Glendale Community College, in Glendale, California.
There's also an Option 2, she says, where the fix takes long enough that the department has to go ahead and send colleges data it knows is wrong, with a promise to update the data as soon as it can. That way, colleges can at least give families something, a kind of starting point. But Tangalakis worries that for many lower-income students, those preliminary award letters would be too low.
""How many students will be discouraged by what they see on paper and not even attend?"" Tangalakis says.
We heard this fear a lot.
""Our students absolutely are relying on this,"" says Scott Skaro, the financial aid director at United Tribes Technical College, in North Dakota.
He says tribal colleges will be hit especially hard by this uncertainty because more than 80% of their students qualify for a federal Pell Grant.
""[Students] may just go find some low-paying job that's gonna pay the bills now, and they'll just give up on school,"" Skaro worries.
Robert Muhammad, director of financial aid at Howard University, shares that concern.
""Some students may truly feel defeated and decide not to pursue their education at this time.""
Most of the financial aid experts told NPR that they want the department to hurry up and make this fix now, before any award letters go out.
Is that realistic? Tangalakis, of Glendale Community College, says that shouldn't matter.
""When we were headed to space, Kennedy said we do things because they're hard. This is something hard, but it's necessary.""
Many students have just over three months left before they're expected to commit to a college. But colleges say that in the best case, it will still be weeks before they can begin sending out financial aid offers.
At this point, for families, universities and the Education Department, the clock isn't just ticking. It's roaring.

445EDC99V5_HOUF5QS3FVNQYRF,"10 questions about the New Hampshire primary, including, 'Can anyone beat Trump?'",By Domenico Montanaro,"Published January 22, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-22/10-questions-about-the-new-hampshire-primary-including-can-anyone-beat-trump,"And it all comes down to this.
Former President Donald Trump won the Iowa caucuses in a blowout last week, confirming his dominance with conservatives. Candidates have dropped out and endorsed Trump, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who did so on Sunday.
Almost the entire Republican Party believes Trump will now be the nominee again and is rallying around him, excluding a minority of ex-candidates and his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley.
So New Hampshire, which holds its primary Tuesday, with its moderate voter profile, offers what very likely will be the last, best chance for Haley to show she can beat Trump.
And she might have to win the primary to turn the narrative tide in her favor.
Here's everything you need to know about the New Hampshire primary:

Haley had been gaining ground on Trump in New Hampshire in recent weeks, but Trump continues to lead by double digits in polls — and the most recent ones suggest Haley's momentum may have cooled.
While New Hampshire certainly features a more moderate electorate than Iowa, there may be a ceiling to Haley's potential support. Voters will have their say Tuesday, and New Hampshire has offered surprises before that have turned the tide of presidential elections.
But a Marist poll of New Hampshire voters taken last week is revealing. Two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said Trump should have immunity from criminal prosecution for actions he took while he was president.
The survey underscored, though, Trump's potential general election problems. The poll found that two-thirds of the broader New Hampshire electorate, including independents and Democrats, felt he should not have immunity.

All polling places must be open from at least 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. ET at a minimum, according to the secretary of state's office. Some polling locations have earlier hours or extend theirs, but all polls will be closed by 8 p.m. ET. (You can find hours for each polling location here.)
Because the 221 towns in the state have flexibility in their opening and closing times, a few of the most sparsely populated towns have used that to gain some attention by beginning voting at midnight.
The most famous example of this is Dixville Notch, which gained notoriety because it had predicted the eventual Republican nominee in every election from 1968 to 2012. That was broken in 2016 when it sided with former Ohio Gov. John Kasich over Trump. But the town, which is just 20 miles from the Canadian border, only has a population of 5. The vote in 2016 for Kasich was 3-2.


This is maybe the biggest difference from the Iowa caucuses. Not only is this a state-run primary, rather than party-run caucuses, New Hampshire also allows independents, or undeclared voters, to cast a ballot in either the Republican or Democratic primary.
In addition to being generally a more moderate, suburban and less religious set of Republican voters than in Iowa, undeclared voters make up almost 40% of the state's registered voters.

Even though most of the coverage has centered around the leading Republican candidates, there will be two dozen names that New Hampshire voters will see, including candidates who have already dropped out of the race. (Here's a sample ballot.)
For Democrats, it's a similar number — 21 people, including the likes of Paperboy Love Prince, Vermin Supreme, self-help author Marianne Williamson and Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. Who it won't include is President Biden.
New Hampshire's primary won't be counted in this year's Democratic primary, because the Democratic Party demoted it in favor of South Carolina, which propelled Biden to the 2020 nomination.
There is, however, an active write-in campaign for Biden, which the party establishment has to hope wins. Otherwise, it would be a major black eye for the president.
Phillips, a wealthy former co-owner of Talenti Gelato, and a group supporting him have spent $5 million in ads in New Hampshire, including one employing Big Foot, or at least a man in a Big Foot outfit ... or is it?

Secretary of State David Scanlan is predicting a record turnout of 322,000 for the GOP primary. The Republican turnout record is 282,979 set in 2016. New Hampshire traditionally has been one of the states with the highest participation rates in the country.

Since the beginning of last year, $77.5 million has been spent on campaign ads targeting the state in the GOP primary, according to data compiled by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact and analyzed by NPR, as of Sunday afternoon. More than $10 million of that has come in just the past week — all for a state that allocates 22 delegates, or less than 1% of the total.
The top spender has been Haley and groups supporting her. Team Haley has poured in $30.9 million, almost doubling Trump and his allies, who have spent $15.7 million. A super PAC supporting DeSantis had spent about $8 million in New Hampshire, but Team DeSantis didn't spend anything after his distant second-place Iowa finish, before DeSantis dropped out and endorsed Trump on Sunday.

New Hampshire has voted first in primaries for more than 100 years. People in the state take a particular pride in the kind of retail campaigning and town halls it has traditionally taken to win the state. Of course, Trump has upended those traditions, as he's engaged in far fewer of those kinds of events, but New Hampshire has had a rebellious streak.
It has resurrected the campaigns of candidates thought to be finished in the primary, or solidified a candidate's position. In 2008, Republican John McCain, who had run out of money and was trailing in the polls, did more town halls in New Hampshire than anyone, won there and went on to the Republican nomination.
Bill Clinton's closer-than-expected second-place finish in 1992 led to him being labeled the ""Comeback Kid,"" and he won the nomination. Sixteen years later, Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, was trailing Barack Obama in the polls after his surprise Iowa win. But Hillary Clinton pulled out the victory in New Hampshire. While she didn't win the nomination, her New Hampshire win gave new life to her campaign and led to the long, drawn-out primary fight that ensued.
Plus, on the Republican side, it has been a good predictor of who wins the GOP nomination. Since 1976, in a primary in which an incumbent Republican president wasn't on the ballot, six of the eight New Hampshire winners went on to win the nomination, including the last three. In that same stretch, only three Iowa winners became the nominee — and none of the last three.
It's why former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu used to say about the two early nominating states that ""Iowa picks corn; New Hampshire picks presidents.""

New Hampshire became the first primary in 1920 after Minnesota dropped its primary, and Indiana moved to May. But until 1948, it only voted for delegates to the national convention, not directly for who people wanted to be president, as The Brookings Institution noted in this history of the primary in 2016:
""Until 1948, the New Hampshire primary, like most of the small number of other primaries in the country, listed only the names of locals who wanted to be delegates to the convention on the ballot. But in 1948, Richard F. Upton, speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives decided to make the primary 'more interesting and meaningful ... so there would be a greater turnout at the polls.' He did this by passing a law allowing citizens to vote directly for the presidential candidates.""
It had an almost immediate impact. In 1952, with the Korean War continuing, Democratic President Harry Truman was unpopular and lost the New Hampshire primary. He decided against running for reelection. For Republicans that year, Dwight Eisenhower won and became the party nominee over Robert Taft, who had been seen as the party establishment's choice.
In 1968, during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson's narrow win over Eugene McCarthy was an early barometer of his unpopularity with his party. LBJ decided against running. McCarthy was popular with anti-war Democrats, but he was snubbed at the 1968 Democratic convention. The party selected Hubert Humphrey as its nominee, and that inflamed an already volatile situation in Chicago outside the convention hall between police and protesters.
That had an impact on not just Democratic politics, but the GOP, too. Democrats made changes to open up the primary process. More states gained influence, and New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation status was threatened.
So in 1975, following the 1968 convention, contentious primaries in 1972 and Watergate, New Hampshire passed a law, added to its state constitution, to cement its status as the first primary. It reads, in part:
""The presidential primary election shall be held on the second Tuesday in March or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is 7 days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election ...""
In the 1980s, Iowa and New Hampshire struck a deal allowing Iowa to hold the first caucus and New Hampshire the first primary.

Lots. New Hampshire has been known for tears and dirty tricks.
A couple of examples stand out. It included a hoax letter that actually was planted by Republican Richard Nixon's campaign. It falsely accused a leading Democratic candidate, Edmund Muskie, of using an ethnic slur that led Muskie to (maybe) cry in a public outburst, while also defending his wife, whom a local newspaper accused of liking ""to tell dirty jokes and smoke cigarettes.""
Ooooh.
Tame stuff by today's standards, but it was hot in 1972.
""It changed people's minds about me, of what kind of guy I was,"" Muskie said of the moment. ""They were looking for a strong, steady man, and here I was, weak.""
In 2008, it was the reverse. Hillary Clinton got choked up during an event answering a question from a voter. That gained lots of attention and may have actually turned around her fortunes in the Granite State.


After New Hampshire, it's Nevada, which confusingly is holding a state-run primary on Feb. 6 and a party caucus on Feb. 8.
The party will award its delegates based on the caucus. Trump will be on that ballot, but Haley won't. Haley will be on the primary ballot, but Trump won't.
But Nevada has not been a focus of the candidates. Only about $1 million has been spent there so far.
After that, it's South Carolina on Feb. 24. About $9 million in ads have been run there, far less than Iowa and New Hampshire, and Trump leads by a significant margin in the polls.
South Carolina has a very conservative electorate, and a Trump win there would put Haley in the very awkward position of losing in the state that elected her governor. That will be difficult for her and her campaign to explain away.
If that happens it could mean Trump wraps up the nomination by late March. And then it will be, for anyone not named Trump, as the song goes, all over but the crying.

44L1VA02NM_WD223W8WW4IEJ6B,"Suspect in killing of 8 people near Chicago has died in Texas, police say",By The Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 at 8:00 PM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-22/suspect-in-killing-of-8-people-near-chicago-has-died-in-texas-police-say,"Updated January 23, 2024 at 12:13 AM ET
CHICAGO — A man suspected of shooting and killing eight people in suburban Chicago fatally shot himself after a confrontation with law enforcement officials in Texas, police said late Monday.
Police in Joliet, Ill., said on Facebook that at about 8:30 p.m. Central time 23-year-old Romeo Nance was located by U.S. Marshals near Natalia, Texas, and that Nance shot himself after a confrontation.
The Medina County Sheriff's Office in Texas said on Facebook that the agency received a call about a person suspected in the Chicago killings heading into the county on Interstate 35. A standoff then occurred between Nance and police from multiple agencies at a gas station, where Nance shot himself, the sheriff's office said.
Nance is suspected of fatally shooting eight people at three locations in the Chicago suburbs, sparking a search that left neighbors on edge earlier Monday as police warned he was still on the loose and should be considered ""armed and dangerous.""
Police in Will County in Illinois and Joliet previously said they did not know of a motive for the killings, but said Nance knew the victims. The FBI's fugitive task force had been assisting local police in the search for the suspect, Joliet Police Chief William Evans said.
The victims were found Sunday and Monday at three separate residences, authorities told reporters at a news conference earlier Monday evening.
One of the people killed was found Sunday in a home in Will County. Seven others were found Monday at two homes on the same block in Joliet, located about about 6 miles northwest of the scene police discovered first.
Authorities said they also believe Nance was connected to another shooting in Joliet that wounded a man on Sunday but would not discuss their evidence.
""I've been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I've ever been associated with,"" Evans said during a news conference outside the Joliet homes Monday evening.
Will County Chief Deputy Dan Jungles said during the Monday news conference that deputies had been staking out one of the houses since Sunday evening in case Nance, the suspect in the first fatal shooting they discovered, returned to them. Nance's last known address was one of the homes, police said.
When no one showed, deputies finally went to the door of one of the houses. No one answered so they crossed the street to the other house, which they knew was linked to the first house and found the first bodies. Five bodies were found in one house and two bodies were found in the other.
Jungles said he didn't have any indication yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead. He said that autopsies were pending.
Evans said the victims found Monday in the houses were family members. Asked if the victims were members of the suspect's family, Jungles said he couldn't comment except to say that the suspect knew them.
Teresa Smart lives about a block away from where seven of the victims were found and had said she was worried she and her family wouldn't be able to sleep Monday night.
""This is way too close to home,"" she said, adding that police cars had been blocking streets throughout the neighborhood.
""I keep looking out the window and double checking my doors,"" she said. ""It's super scary.""
Joliet Police said in a Facebook post earlier on Monday afternoon that they were investigating ""multiple"" people found dead and shared Nance's photo and images of a vehicle. Authorities identified the vehicle as a red Toyota Camry.
Earlier Monday, the Will County Sheriff's Office shared images of the same car via Facebook and said it had been seen at the scenes of two separate shootings Sunday afternoon.

6IAXSXETR7_L348VO81N2KE3PZ,Boeing's quality control draws criticism as a whistleblower alleges lapses at factory,By Joel Rose,"Published January 24, 2024 at 2:42 PM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-01-24/boeings-quality-control-draws-criticism-as-a-whistleblower-alleges-lapses-at-factory,"Updated January 24, 2024 at 8:25 PM ET
WASHINGTON — Concerns about quality control at Boeing are mounting, as new revelations from an alleged whistleblower suggest mistakes at the company's factory led to a fuselage panel blowing off an Alaska Airlines jet in midair earlier this month.
No one was seriously injured when the panel known as a door plug blew off at 16,000 feet. But the dramatic incident has renewed questions about Boeing's manufacturing processes, and whether the company is prioritizing speed and profit over safety.
Now a self-described Boeing employee claims to have details about how the door plug on that Boeing 737 Max 9 was improperly installed. Those new details, which were first reported by the Seattle Times, were published in a post on an aviation website last week.
""The reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing's own records,"" wrote the whistleblower, who appears to have access to the company's manufacturing records. ""It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.""
According to the whistleblower's account, four bolts that are supposed to hold the door plug in place ""were not installed when Boeing delivered the plane, our own records reflect this.""
Investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board have already raised the possibility that the bolts were not installed. The NTSB is still investigating the incident. If the whistleblower's description is accurate, investigators may be able to confirm it by looking at Boeing's records.
Boeing declined to comment on the whistleblower allegations, citing the ongoing investigation.
Those allegations came to light just as Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun was visiting Capitol Hill Wednesday, where he is seeking to reassure lawmakers and the public.
""We believe in our airplanes,"" Calhoun told reporters. ""We have confidence in the safety of our airplanes. And that's what all of this is about. We fully understand the gravity.""
NPR has not verified the identity of the whistleblower.
But this person's explanation of problems in the manufacturing process that led to the door plug blowout seem credible to Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Wash.
""It definitely seemed accurate to me,"" said Pierson, who now directs the non-profit Foundation for Aviation Safety. ""And it doesn't surprise me, because this is the kind of stuff that we had seen, I had seen in the past.""
""This is symptomatic of what happens when you rush production,"" Pierson said. ""People are put under this kind of pressure, and they're forced to take shortcuts. And that's where these mistakes are made.""
The Alaska Airlines incident is another major setback for Boeing, which was still working to rebuild public trust after the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.
After the latest Alaska Airlines incident, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded 171 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes with similar door panel configurations.
Regulators at the FAA announced late Wednesday that the grounded aircraft can resume flying after a ""thorough inspection and maintenance process."" But the agency also imposed sweeping jet production restrictions at the company's factories.
Alaska and United Airlines have canceled thousands of flights as they waited for final inspection instructions from regulators. The CEOs of both airlines criticized Boeing in separate interviews on Tuesday.
""I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,"" Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told NBC News. ""I am angry.""
""It's clear to me that we received an airplane from Boeing with a faulty door,"" he said.
That is exactly what the Boeing whistleblower alleges. Their post describes in detail how the door plug was removed for repairs and then replaced at the Boeing factory. The four bolts that hold the door plug in place should have been reattached, the whistleblower writes.
But they were not, the whistleblower says, because of communication problems between employees who work for Boeing and those who work for Spirit AeroSystems, the company that built the fuselage and door panel.
The whistleblower describes the safety inspection process at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton as ""a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen.""
Boeing's 737 factory teams in Renton are scheduled to hold what the company is calling a ""Quality Stand Down"" on Thursday, allowing production to pause for a day so employees can take part in special training sessions.
But it's clear the company will have to do more than that to rebuild its reputation.
Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, met with Calhoun on Wednesday.
""I made it clear that quality engineering and a commitment to safety always have to be the top priority,"" Cantwell said in a statement.
Cantwell says she plans to hold hearings to investigate the root causes of the door plug blowout.
""The American flying public and Boeing line workers deserve a culture of leadership at Boeing that puts safety ahead of profits,"" she said.

6MG7DMAFVT_9ULOGKH1SCWRZL1,How war changed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,Fresh Air | By Dave Davies,"Published January 23, 2024 at 11:05 AM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-01-23/how-war-changed-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy,"Nearly two years into Russia's war in Ukraine, Time correspondent Simon Shuster says Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ""almost unrecognizable"" from the happy-go-lucky, optimistic comedian Shuster first met in 2019.
""There's just a toughness and a certain darkness about him now that really didn't exist before,"" Shuster says of the former sitcom star. ""He's still extremely committed to this war, to winning this war. ... And he's very single minded, almost obsessive, in pursuing that goal.""
Shuster, who has a Russian father and a Ukrainian mother, has been reporting on the region for 17 years and spent months embedded with Zelenskyy's team in Kyiv as the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfolded in February 2022. His new book is The Showman: Inside the Invasion That Shook the World and Made a Leader of Volodymyr Zelensky.
Although the U.S. had warned that a Russian invasion was imminent, Shuster writes that Zelenskyy did not believe that the capital would be attacked. In fact, Shuster says, Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska was ""totally shocked"" by the invasion, and hadn't even packed a suitcase.
From the very beginning, Shuster says Zelenskyy drew on his background as an entertainer to help communicate the Ukrainian plight to a broader audience — even as he worried that the world's attention would eventually fade.
""Often his military tactical decisions were guided by a desire to have these demonstrative victories, something that could really grab the world's attention, whether it's bombing the bridge that connects Russia to Crimea, or various battles ... that maybe were not strategically the most important, but they were dramatic,"" Shuster says.
Shuster says, looking ahead, that Zelenskyy and his team are open to negotiating for peace with Russia, but they are also developing ways to sustain the war — even if Western support declines.
""President Zelenskyy and his team have a clear vision of where this goes next,"" Shuster says. ""They ... are actively developing ways to sustain the fight, not to be pushed into a capitulation or a negotiation that they don't want to participate in, and to continue fighting on their own resources, their own weapons.""


On Zelenskyy's reaction to the destruction and atrocities in Bucha
On a personal level, it was absolutely devastating to him. I think, to an extent, that surprised me; he really takes the suffering of civilians close to the heart. He doesn't see them as some kind of abstract mass, sacrificing for the nation. He really feels the pain of individual victims of this war. So that day when he went to Bucha and he saw the atrocities committed there, hundreds of civilians massacred, some tortured, it was just the worst kinds of scenes you could imagine at war time, he was deeply affected by that emotionally.
He later described it as the worst day of that tragic year. He said it taught him that the devil is not far away, not some figment of our imagination but he's right here on this earth. He said he saw the work of the devil there in Bucha. The next phase, when he sort of took in that pain, he moved on to the next stage of the war. He still had a war to fight. And he invited the media to visit Bucha ... and he began inviting his international partners and allies, Europeans, Americans from all over the world. Every time they made a visit to President Zelenskyy in Kyiv, he encouraged them to visit Bucha, to see it for themselves. ... They saw the atrocities for themselves, and it would encourage them to maintain a much higher level of support when they went back home to their capitals after having seen up close the mass graves and the real evidence of Russian war crimes.
On surprising concessions Zelenskyy was willing to make in negotiations with Russia
They continued the negotiations even after the atrocities were revealed in Bucha — even after many of Zelenskyy's own advisers told him, 'We can't go on with these negotiations. We can't talk to these monsters after what they've done to us.' Zelenskyy would continue insisting that no, even though this is a genocidal war, we need to continue trying to find peace at the negotiating table. So they did offer a series of concessions, very serious ones. One of them, the main one was this idea of permanent neutrality. So Ukraine would agree to give up its ambition of joining the NATO alliance. This was one of the main excuses that Vladimir Putin used to justify this horrific invasion, that he wanted to stop NATO from admitting Ukraine. Not that NATO had any plans to admit Ukraine anytime soon, but this was kind of one of the paranoid risks that Putin pointed to. So Zelenskyy said, alright, if that's what you're afraid of, we will make a formal commitment to remain neutral. He even agreed that any military exercises that involve foreign troops on the territory of Ukraine would not happen without Russian approval, if Russia saw those exercises as a risk. So he was willing to really go far in granting concessions early in the invasion. And those negotiations gradually broke apart. One of the reasons was Bucha and the atrocities uncovered. But I think also what we saw was that in April, there were a series of victories that Ukraine achieved on the battlefield that convinced Zelenskyy that, hey, maybe we should see how far we can push this militarily while we have the momentum. Maybe we don't need to negotiate right now. Maybe we fight first, push the Russians back, and then potentially negotiate from a position of strength.
On the July 2019 phone call between Zelenzkyy and President Trump, which later became the basis of Trump's first impeachment
If you read closely the White House transcriptthat was later released of that phone call, at the end Trump promises to arrange a visit for Zelenskyy to the White House. And it's hard to overstate the importance of that kind of visit for any Ukrainian leader. The United States is by far the most important ally, not only because of relying on U.S. weapons, but also for political support, diplomatic support, financial aid loans. Any incoming Ukrainian president, any Ukrainian president, period, needs to constantly demonstrate the strength of his or her relationship with the United States.
So for Zelenskyy coming in, that was priority number one in the international arena to visit the White House, to sit there with the U.S. president, whoever it may be, and to demonstrate to the people back in Ukraine that, look, under my leadership, this relationship will continue to grow stronger, certainly won't grow weaker. So that was what was going through Zelenskyy's mind for the most part at the time. And when, at the end of that phone call, Trump said, ""OK, sure. Come on down to Washington and we'll arrange this visit,"" they saw that as quite an accomplishment. So when they put down the phone as one of the participants, on the Ukrainian side told me, there was some jubilation in the room on the Ukrainian side, and they actually went to a neighboring room and they had some ice cream to celebrate.
On what lesson Zelenskyy drew from Trump's first impeachment
I talked to a number of the people whose messages wound up projected onto the big screens in the hearing rooms during the impeachment inquiry in Congress. Imagine what that feels like. You're a state official in Ukraine. You're having confidential, classified conversations with your counterparts in the United States. You're assuming that those conversations, text messages, emails are going to remain private. And then you turn on CNN and you see your messages projected onto the screen for the world to see. That was very humiliating. It was very demeaning. In many cases, the U.S. authorities did not consult with the Ukrainians before publishing those communications. So that was quite annoying. One close adviser to Zelenskyy called it a cold shower. That was one of the milder phrases used to describe that experience.
In the middle of the impeachment hearings, I sat down with President Zelenskyy in his office, for one of our interviews that is described in the book, and it was maybe one of the lowest points that I'd seen him. He was at the time preparing also simultaneously for his first sit down negotiations with Vladimir Putin. The goals of those negotiations were to end the separatist conflict in the East and prevent the kind of invasion that we later saw play out across Ukraine. So he had a lot to juggle while he was focused on trying to negotiate with Putin and settle their relations and bring peace, all the American media, and all the international media wanted to talk about was Rudy Giuliani, Hunter Biden and all this stuff. So it was a massive distraction. One quote that stands out from that interview was he said, ""I don't trust anyone at all."" And essentially the lesson to him was: Alliances are flimsy. Everyone just has their national interests, their personal interests. And he felt a deep disillusionment in his belief that he could rely on certain allies, Europeans, Americans. He said everybody just has their interests, and I don't trust anyone at all.

This past week consisted of combat in Gaza advancing farther to the south, chants for a cease-fire that rang through Tel Aviv, and Gaza's communication blackout, which effected many. According to the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian death toll has surpassed 25,000 people since the Oct. 7 attacks, which killed about 1,200 people.
A report from the United Nations found that women and children are the main victims of the conflict. Roughly 1.9 million people have been displaced and ""close to one million are women and girls,"" leaving them to seek shelter in the southern portion of Gaza, where access to food and shelter are sparse.

7PZN8T1EXV_EN6UXB6ZWPLH1KF,No place like home for Haley as she pins her presidential hopes on South Carolina,By Stephen Fowler,"Published January 24, 2024 at 8:26 PM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-24/no-place-like-home-for-haley-as-she-pins-her-presidential-hopes-on-south-carolina,"NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's failure to win Tuesday's New Hampshire primary is not deterring her from continuing her presidential campaign against Donald Trump.
One month out from the South Carolina GOP contest, Haley is seeking to prove to voters and donors that she can be a better option for the party — and in the general election.
In a packed hotel ballroom near the Charleston airport Wednesday night, Haley painted the picture of a Biden-Trump rematch she said most of the country does not want and pledged to provide another choice.
""We could have that, but it's gonna take a lot of courage, courage from every person in this room,"" she said in her first campaign appearance post-New Hampshire.
""Courage for me to run, and courage for every one of you to know: don't complain about what happens in a general election if you don't play in this primary,"" she cautioned.
As the last remaining major challenger to Trump, Haley's speech Wednesday hammered the former president as ""chaos"" for the country — chaos Republicans can't afford to surround themselves with.
""I voted for Donald Trump twice, I was proud to serve America and his administration, I agree with a lot of his policies,"" she said. ""But rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him.""
You don't defeat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos, Haley added, noting another ""hard truth"" for Republicans is that making the changes they want to see can only happen if they win in November.
Her remarks continued to highlight verbal gaffes Trump has made recently as part of her argument for younger politicians, like when he confused her for former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a story at a rally.
""A few days ago, he was going on and on about me, I mean for a while, on and on about why I didn't send in security to the Capitol on Jan. 6,"" she said. ""He said it over and over and over and over again. I mean — somebody's gonna tell him I wasn't there on Jan. 6. I've never been at the Capitol working in a job like that. But I think he was a bit confused and so we'll let that pass.""
The bulk of Haley's stump speech touted a wide range of achievements from her time as governor, like overseeing South Carolina's reputation as the economic development ""beast of the Southeast"" to moving people off of welfare and into the workforce to union busting and criminal justice reforms.

Haley supporters at her rally spoke of a strong, conservative leader with governing experience who also has the advantage of being decades younger than many of America's top politicians, a conversation some said needs to happen sooner than later.
""I think the American people need to get sick of two elderly white males being our only choice,"" Marie Barber from Mt. Pleasant said. ""I think [it would take] the Republican Party saying, 'OK, it's time for somebody other than an 80-year-old white male to run the country.'""
Barber said Haley is primed to reach left-leaning voters who may be unhappy with Biden, and worries that Trump's personality won't do the same, calling him a ""tough sell"" because of his personality. She added that some people in her circle would consider voting third party if Trump were the nominee.
Sarah Ferrillo said Haley was a fantastic governor with the right combination of executive and international relations experience from her time as United Nations Ambassador, but said she didn't know what could be done to convince more primary voters to support Haley over Trump's bad publicity.
""I don't know from a political standpoint what you need to do or what you need to say to get people to stop and turn and listen, because right now, they're responding to the loudest person in the room,"" she said. ""How can you be the loudest without being the bad publicity?""
Both women said they would vote for Trump if he were the nominee because they could not support Biden.

Therein lies the challenge for Haley's campaign in the coming month — moderate and independent voters that pulled her closer to Trump in New Hampshire are not as prevalent in the next slate of contests, including South Carolina's very conservative electorate.
Recent polls show Haley far behind Trump in her home state, and the former president has touted a slew of endorsements from local South Carolina legislators, current Gov. Henry McMaster and Sen. Tim Scott in a show of force meant to push her out of the race.
But Haley is forging ahead.
Haley said Wednesday her campaign brought in a million dollars from more than 200,000 donors from every state in the day since the New Hampshire primary, and several more rallies are planned across the Palmetto State in the coming days.
In many ways, Haley's post-New Hampshire message aims to serve as a preemptive ""I told you so"" to Republicans if Trump loses in November, while also pushing back on assertions that the primary race is over, blasting ""political elites"" that say Trump should have the nomination already.
""We've only had two states that have voted, we've got 48 more that deserve to vote,"" she said. ""A presidential candidate has to get 1,215 delegates: Donald Trump has 32 and I have 17. So we are not going to sit there and just give up. We're going to sit there and we're going to fight because Americans deserve better than what they have in these two options. And we're going to give it to them.""
On paper, the delegates earned from Iowa and New Hampshire represent a tiny fraction of the 1,215 needed to secure the Republican nomination, and a memo from Haley's campaign Tuesday outlined a focus on being competitive in contests through Super Tuesday on March 5, where more than a dozen contests will take place worth nearly 900 delegates.
But for now, Haley trails in national and state-level polls and runs the risk of not earning delegates in some states, falling further behind Trump and potentially delaying his victory until later this spring.

84P9JD516G_38NZT0VR224RENZ,The West Bank economy has been hammered by war,By Frank Langfitt,"Published January 24, 2024 at 4:01 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-01-24/the-west-bank-economy-has-been-hammered-by-war,"RAMALLAH, West Bank — Muattaz Qatanani used to commute from Gaza to work each day in Israel, where he built bomb shelters — the kind that Israelis use to seek refuge from Hamas rocket attacks.
""I used to make 450 shekels a day,"" he says — about $130 at the time. But after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel began its assault on Gaza, Qatanani fled to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He says he hasn't been able to find decent-paying work since.
""Maybe I get a job once a week to wash stairs, to wash windows — that's how I survive,"" says Qatanani, 41, who has a family back in Gaza. Now he makes about $40 a day — when he can find work.
More than three months into Israel's war in Gaza, the economy of the West Bank is reeling. Many fear the economic pain could lead to even more violence in the territory, which is a bit smaller than Delaware and home to some 3 million Palestinians.
After the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which Israel says killed about 1,200 people, Israel banned some 100,000 Palestinian laborers in the West Bank from crossing the border to work in Israel. The country cited security concerns.
This has been a huge financial blow to the West Bank. Wages of cross-border workers account for $5.5 billion a year, about one-third of the combined economy of the West Bank and Gaza, according to theWorld Bank.
In addition, Israel and the Palestinian Authority are in a dispute over tax money that Israel collects for the West Bank and Gaza. As a result, the Palestinian Authority, which oversees parts of the West Bank, has had to cut the wages of its 143,000 workers. They received no pay in October, half-pay in November and close to 80% in December, says Manal Farhan, the Palestinian Authority's deputy minister for the national economy.
""This time, it's the worst,"" says Farhan, ""the worst hit for our economy since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.""
The Palestinian Authority was established in 1994.
Stroll through the streets of Ramallah these days, and the war's economic impact seems to be everywhere. Baha Tamimi, who runs a gold shop in the heart of the city, says 4 out of 5 people who visit now don't want to buy gold — they want to sell it.
""A woman took off her wedding ring to help her husband pay the bills and buy vegetables — this happened right in front of me,"" Tamimi recalls, as video of people pulling bodies from the rubble in Gaza plays on the shop's TV.
More than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel invaded Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.
Nearby, Joudeh Said is cutting a piece of wood in his carpentry shop. He says he has one or two jobs these days, but no one has much money to pay.
""They give me a check, and then the check bounces, and then I have to chase them,"" he says.
Since the war began, Said says, customers owe him $32,000, which is a lot of money in the West Bank. Per capita gross domestic product in the territory is just $4,500 a year, according to the World Bank. Across the border in Israel, it is nearly $55,000.
In addition to the economic impact that the war in Gaza is having, Israeli soldiers are killing more and more Palestinians in the West Bank. The United Nations says the Israeli military has killed about 350 people in the West Bank since Oct. 7. The Israelis say they are rooting out militants.
Samir Anati, who co-owns the carpentry shop, says if the economy continues to slide, violence will only grow.
""For sure,"" he says. ""I have children to feed. What can I do? I work now and get them food. I may not be able to tomorrow.""
""So it is not me who will go for an intifada,"" or uprising, Anati continues. ""My children will.""
Samir Hulileh, a leading economist and businessman, worries about the impact on public workers if they are not paid. He's especially concerned about the Palestinian Authority maintaining the loyalty of its security forces, who are supposed to maintain law and order in the areas that the Palestinian Authority oversees.
""You are telling people who have their Kalashnikovs with them, 'I will not spend money on you,'"" warns Hulileh, who adds that other groups, including Hamas, could recruit them. ""You are opening up your security forces in the West Bank for options.""
Khalil Shikaki, an academic and pollster who runs the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah, is not as concerned about the security forces. But he does worry that the West Bank's battered economy is just one more ingredient in an already combustible brew.
Shikaki notes that since the start of the war, Hamas' popularity in the West Bank has more than tripled — from 12% to 42%, according to his polls. In addition, some Israeli settlers in the West Bank continue to attack Palestinians, and an increasing number of Palestinians feel they have no diplomatic alternative to violence.
""The West Bank is currently boiling,"" says Shikaki, ""just waiting for the spark that could eventually lead to a major explosion.""

8UQ2VBN6TX_BUBVTKCUQW640D9,U.N. chief calls for continued Palestinian aid after some countries halted funding,"By Geoff Brumfiel,","Published January 26, 2024 at 1:17 PM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-26/u-n-agency-in-gaza-fires-employees-over-alleged-involvement-in-oct-7-attack,"Updated January 27, 2024 at 10:55 PM ET
TEL AVIV, Israel — The secretary-general of the United Nations has called on countries to continue funding the main agency that provides aid to Palestinians in Gaza, following allegations that some of its employees were involved in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that killed some 1,200 people in Israel.
The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, fired multiple employees over the allegations. In response to the claims, several donor countries have joined the U.S. — the agency's biggest donor — in pausing funding.
Speaking on Sunday, Antonio Guterres warned the UNRWA would be forced to scale back aid to more than 2 million Palestinians as soon as February if funding stops. The Gaza strip is in the grip of a severe humanitarian crisis, with a quarter of the population facing starvation.
""The abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences,"" Guterres said in a statement.
""But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations for humanitarian workers, should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,"" he added.
Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees, said in a statement on Friday: ""The Israeli Authorities have provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the horrific attacks on Israel on 7 October"".
""To protect the Agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay.""
Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for ""an urgent investigation by UNRWA regarding the involvement of its employees in the terrorist events of 10/7.""
""It is important that UNRWA conduct a thorough internal inspection regarding the activities of Hamas and other terrorist elements in its ranks in order to ensure that the organization's humanitarian activities are not abused,"" it said in a statement.
Neither Israel nor the United Nations immediately provided further details on the allegations against the UNRWA employees.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Thursday to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres about the current allegations of U.N. workers' involvement in the Oct. 7 attack and urged a thorough and swift investigation.
Twelve UNRWA employees were allegedly involved, according to the U.S. State Department, which also said it has temporarily paused additional funding for the U.N. agency ""while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them.""
In his statement, UNRWA's Lazzarini called the allegations against the agency employees ""shocking.""
""More than 2 million people in Gaza depend on lifesaving assistance that the Agency has been providing since the war began,"" he said. ""Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world.""
Several countries have joined the U.S. in halting funding to the U.N. agency, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy.
Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that while the UNRWA does vital, life-saving work,"" the country will pause its disbursement of recent funding.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said in a post on social media that it suspended funding to the UNRWA, adding that it remains committed to humanitarian assistance to Palestinians as well as protecting Israel's security.
Canada's international development minister Ahmed Hussen said the country had paused additional funding while UNRWA investigates the allegations.
UNRWA plays a critical role in supporting Palestinians fleeing the war in Gaza. The agency estimates that up to 1.9 million people are sheltering in or near its facilities, which include schools and aid warehouses. UNRWA also has been coordinating convoys of food and medical supplies into Gaza.
Facilities run by the agency have repeatedly come under fire in the war. Most recently, on Jan. 24, a building inside UNRWA's training center in Khan Younis was struck by shells. The agency said that the building housed some 800 displaced people and that at least 13 people were killed and 56 injured in the incident.
Israel's military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), has denied involvement in that incident. ""After an examination of our operational systems, the IDF has currently ruled out that this incident is a result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF. A thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is underway,"" it said in a statement.
Heavy fighting in Khan Younis has killed and wounded dozens of people in recent days, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It estimates that over 26,000 people have died in Gaza since the war began. This total includes both combatants and civilians. The ministry says the majority of those who have been killed are women and children.
In a statement on Saturday, UNRWA's Lazzarini saidthat nine countries had suspended their funding, decisions that he said threaten the agency's humanitarian work across the region.
""It is shocking to see a suspension of funds to the Agency in reaction to allegations against a small group of staff, especially given the immediate action that UNRWA took by terminating their contracts and asking for a transparent independent investigation,"" he said.

8ZGDUG9EFU_K41XAHFN0B7MGH3,Much of the U.S. is still in the grip of icy weather that is blamed for 72 deaths,By The Associated Press,"Published January 21, 2024 at 12:05 PM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-21/much-of-the-u-s-is-still-in-the-grip-of-icy-weather-that-is-blamed-for-69-deaths,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 9:19 PM ET
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Subfreezing conditions and treacherous roadways have contributed to dozens of deaths this month across the U.S., where states as far south as Texas and Florida remain gripped by deadly arctic weather Sunday. But the numbing cold is expected to ease up in the coming days.
Nationally, winter storms have claimed at least 72 lives around the U.S. this January, many involving hypothermia or road accidents.
On Sunday, crews in Memphis, Tennessee, continued to work around the clock to find and fix broken pipes that were causing low water pressure throughout the system. Memphis Light, Gas and Water President and CEO Doug McGowen told reporters Sunday afternoon that crews are making progress and he expects most of the 700,000 people the utility services to have water restored over the next 24 hours.
""If we remain on this very positive path, and we are on a positive path, I believe that by Wednesday we will have pressure sufficient for us to take samples of our water system,"" he said. ""Assuming good results, we think that means a Thursday for lifting of the boil water advisory.""
McGowen also asked people to stop dripping their faucets to help build pressure in the system.
Memphis Light, Gas and Water was repairing 10 water main breaks on Sunday afternoon, and McGowen said he expects to see more as the ground continues to thaw. The utility said it previously repaired 41 broken water mains and located more than 4,000 leaks at homes and businesses.
Stop dripping water from your faucets once the temperature rises above freezing. Doing so can put 5 - 10 million gallons of water back into the system increasing water pressure.

Rhodes College, in Memphis, began sending students living there home on Saturday and moving those who could not return home to hotels. The school was planning virtual classes on Monday and Tuesday.
""We ask that you NOT come to campus either day due to the ongoing water situation and the hazards that creates,"" the school announcement said.
Sam Roth is a junior majoring in politics, philosophy and economics who drove back home to Nashville rather than staying in a hotel where he would still be required to boil water.
""Our faucets stopped working, and they said not to use any of the restrooms on our floor, and our showers were not working very well either,"" he said of the situation in his dormitory.
Restaurants and bars were using bottled water to serve customers on Sunday. Some restaurants remained closed, citing the water issue, while others had a modified menu.
Memphis was the largest, but not the only, water system in Tennessee to experience problems from the unusually cold weather. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday night that 28 water systems have issued boil water notices.
In Tipton County, the fire department in Mason warned residents on Saturday to be prepared for a multiday water outage. Fire officials said in a Facebook post that water crews were working at all hours to try to isolate and repair leaks.
The mayor acknowledged in an interview with WMC-TV that the town has had water issues in the past due to a system that ""nobody took care of for a long time"" and is need of updates.
""The whole town has been without water for five days,"" said exasperated Mason resident Christina Ray. The fire department is handing out water throughout the town of 1,300 residents, but is limiting it to one case per day, per household. That's not enough for her family, which was collecting snow to flush the toilets.
""It's hard to cook. It's hard to flush toilets. It's hard to do dishes. We can't wash laundry,"" she said.
With warmer temperatures predicted this week, Ray now says she's faced with another worry: the potential of bursting pipes.
The continued cold weather is also responsible for at least 27 deaths in Tennessee, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
Just south in Mississippi, the state's Emergency Management Agency said Sunday that 11 people have died of causes related to frigid weather since Jan. 14.
Elsewhere, freezing rain, sleet and high wind gusts later Sunday would make traveling in parts of Kansas and Oklahoma particularly treacherous, the National Weather Service said. Wind chills in Iowa made it feel like minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 degrees Celsius) in some parts.

But the end of subzero temperatures — which blasted into the U.S. on Friday — was in sight for parts of the country. The daily high temperatures in Iowa's capital of Des Moines, for example, were expected to stay above freezing starting Monday.
""With no additional replenishment of arctic air from Canada, a steady warm-up is in store for the mid-section of the country,"" the weather service said.
In western New York, Buffalo Bills fans were getting ready for another home playoff game Sunday evening against the Kansas City Chiefs, with temperatures forecast around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 degrees Celsius), winds around 10 mph (16 kph) and a slight chance of snow showers. On Friday and Saturday, hundreds of people showed up at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park to help shovel snow out of the stands for the second week in a row, earning $20 an hour.
The Erie County Sheriff's Office was urging fans Sunday to not throw snowballs in the stadium or trespass on the new stadium construction site.
In Vermont, temperatures in the single digits to low teens didn't stop ice anglers and snowmobilers from their sport, and young ski jumpers braved the cold as they competed in northern New Hampshire. But 23 skiers and snowboarders had to be rescued in frigid temperatures on Saturday after becoming lost in the backcountry in Killington, Vermont, police said.
On the West Coast, more freezing rain was forecast in the Columbia River Gorge and the area was expected to remain near or below freezing through at least Sunday night. Trees and power lines already coated with ice could topple if they get more, the National Weather Service warned.
""Stay safe out there over the next several days as our region tries to thaw out,"" the weather service said. ""Chunks of falling ice will remain a hazard as well.""

9IAYS7WTGQ_NSAYU1JMLM070LR,"Takeaways from the Oscar nominations: heavy hitters rewarded, plus some surprises",By Linda Holmes,"Published January 23, 2024 at 10:06 AM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-01-23/takeaways-from-the-oscar-nominations-heavy-hitters-rewarded-plus-some-surprises,"The Oscar nominations were announced Tuesday morning, and most of the heavy hitters were richly rewarded. A man was nominated for playing a doll; a woman was nominated for playing a baby (sort of). Ten pictures will vie to be considered best. Let's talk about what happened.
All hail Oppenheimer. Whether Christopher Nolan is your speed or not, the Academy loves him. Oppenheimer, his drama about the man who developed the atomic bomb, led all films with 13 nominations in both what are sometimes considered ""major"" categories (like best picture, best director, best actor and adapted screenplay) and ""technical"" categories (like sound, production design, and visual effects). It's not a record; a couple of other films, including Titanic, have received 14. Still, it's a very big total. In another year, Poor Things' 11 nominations orKillers of the Flower Moon's 10 might have led the nominations. But not up against this kind of — forgive the phrase — explosive acclaim.
A couple of contenders came up empty or nearly so. There were a lot of films that elbowed their way into big nominations; that's what you get when you start with 10 best picture nominees. But both Origin, the latest film from director Ava DuVernay, and All of Us Strangers, the love story starring Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal, were left out of the nominations. The Color Purplemusical adaptation was nominated only for Danielle Brooks' supporting performance — a richly deserved nod, by the way.
A lot of the acting nominees are first-timers. There are 10 first-time acting nominees: Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction), Colman Domingo (Rustin), America Ferrera (Barbie), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon), Sandra Hüller (Anatomy of a Fall), Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers) and Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction). They're a fascinating mix of familiar good actors who you might be surprised are first-timers (Blunt, Domingo, Wright, Murphy), folks who did great work on television before they got much recognition in film (Ferrera, Brown, Brooks), and people who probably feel like relative newcomers to a lot of Oscar voters even though they are emphatically not (Gladstone, Randolph, Hüller).
One woman director is in, a couple of others are out. French filmmaker Justine Triet was nominated for best director for Anatomy of a Fall, the devastating story of a woman suspected of being responsible for the death of her husband. But both Greta Gerwig, who directed the much-nominated Barbie,and Celine Song, who directed the beautiful best picture nominee Past Lives,were left out of the category. Both their lead actresses, Margot Robbie and Greta Lee, went without nominations in that category, too.
Barbenheimer turned out fine for everybody. It's funny to look back now and remember that the showdown between Barbie and Oppenheimer, because they opened the same weekend, was ever treated as any kind of either-or competition that would have a single victor. They both made a ton of money, though Barbie made more; they both received a bunch of Oscar nominations, though Oppenheimer received more. (Barbie had eight, including one for Ryan Gosling's extraordinarily silly supporting work as Ken. More true comedy nominations, please!) They were very different kinds of ""event"" pictures we could stand to have more of: well-made, surprising, vibrant and memorable, in completely different ways.
International films continue to perform well. In 2018, Alfonso Cuarón's Roma was only the fifth non-English-language film to ever be nominated for both best international film and best picture. But just since then, there have been four more: Parasite, Drive My Car, All Quiet on the Western Front and now The Zone of Interest, the disturbing study of a family living happily just outside the walls of Auschwitz, where the father is commandant. The short version? There's no longer any reason to suspect that a film with subtitles won't be nominated for best picture, which is a great development.
John Williams and Thelma Schoonmaker set (or keep extending) records. Williams, who has written much of the most beloved rousing movie music of the last 60 or so years, received his 54th nomination for the score of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. It's more nominations than any other living person has. And Schoonmaker, longtime collaborator of Martin Scorsese, became the most nominated editor ever when she was recognized for the ninth time, for his film Killers of the Flower Moon. (She's won for Raging Bull, The Aviator and The Departed.) Both Williams and Schoonmaker are examples of essential collaborators without whom celebrated directors could not do their work, whether they're making tragic epics or swashbuckling adventures.

A4VVEDL2ZU_DLAK1B2BX6LJDXN,Dozens of people killed as Israel intensifies offensive in southern Gaza's Khan Younis,By Hadeel Al-Shalchi,"Published January 23, 2024 at 10:00 AM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-23/dozens-of-people-killed-as-israel-intensifies-offensive-in-southern-gazas-khan-younis,"Israeli forces have intensified their offensive in Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. Gazan health officials said that dozens of people have been killed in the fighting, and the United Nations said a hospital was struck, cutting off access to already limited medical care.
Earlier in the war between Hamas and Israel, the city swelled with thousands of displaced people from northern Gaza. People are now being forced to flee even farther south.
""The situation [in Khan Younis] is worse than you can imagine,"" Tareq, a man who fled the fighting, told NPR in Rafah on the border with Egypt. He refused to give his last name out of fear about his safety.
""There was targeted bombing and tanks, and it took us all by surprise. No one told us to leave the area, we woke up and found the tanks in front of our houses,"" he said. ""I saw dead people on the ground, and the ambulances weren't able to reach anyone to save them because of the shooting.""
The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it has encircled the city, where it says many Hamas leaders are based. The army also said that it had located and dismantled dozens of Hamas tunnels and other underground infrastructure outside Khan Younis.
Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the U.N. relief agency that provides aid to Palestinians, told NPR that one of its training centers in Khan Younis was struck, killing at least six people. She said the training center served as a shelter for 30,000 people.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli shelling and gunfire from drones targeted its Khan Younis headquarters, which also serves as a shelter.   It said people were injured in the strikes but did not specify how many. It also said that Israeli troops had encircled their ambulance headquarters, impeding medical transport.
A spokesman for the Israeli armyissued a statement on X for residents of Khan Younis to evacuate a number of neighborhoods. But it's unclear how effective such messaging is as a result of the communications blackout. Israel's military also has said because of the dense civilian population in Khan Younis its operations will be ""precise.""
Zaher Sahloul, president of MedGlobal, a nonprofit organization that provides emergency health services in Gaza, said that the number of evacuees from Khan Younis during the current fighting was shocking.
""The road was full of cars where you have mattresses and luggage on top of the cars fleeing from the Khan Younis area, using all means of transportation including carriages pulled by donkeys and horses,"" he said. ""If you see the pictures of the 1948 Nakba it is the same thing, the same families, same faces, same scenes of desperation, of depression, of anxiety on the faces of children and women and elderly."" He referred to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the establishment of Israel.
While the United States said it urged Israel to scale down its offensive in Gaza, Israel has continued to strike targets, forcing Palestinians to flee. More than 85% of people in Gaza have been forced out of their homes, according to the United Nations.
Gaza's health ministry said Israel's assault has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, the majority of which are women and children. The assault is a reaction to the Oct. 7 attack in Israel during which Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped roughly 250 others.

AR2XOAGHNK_56OULBTAGRI5UYM,"Alabama calls nitrogen execution method 'humane,' but critics raise doubts",Alabama Public Radio | By Associated Press,"Published January 23, 2024 at 7:15 AM CST",20240116,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-23/alabama-calls-nitrogen-execution-method-humane-but-critics-raise-doubts,"Alabama, unless stopped by the courts, intends to strap inmate Kenneth Eugene Smith to a gurney and use a gas mask to replace breathable air with nitrogen, depriving him of oxygen needed to stay alive, on Thursday in the nation's first execution attempt with the method.
The Alabama attorney general's office told federal appeals court judges last week that nitrogen hypoxia is ""the most painless and humane method of execution known to man."" But what exactly Smith, 58, will feel after the warden switches on the gas is unknown, some doctors and critics say.
""What effect the condemned person will feel from the nitrogen gas itself, no one knows,"" Dr. Jeffrey Keller, president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, wrote in an email. ""This has never been done before. It is an experimental procedure.""
Keller, who was not involved in developing the Alabama protocol, said the plan is to ""eliminate all of the oxygen from the air"" that Smith is breathing by replacing it with nitrogen.
""Since the condemned person will not be breathing any oxygen, he will die,"" Keller said. ""It is little different than putting a plastic bag over one's head.""
The state of Alabama has predicted in federal court filings that the nitrogen gas will ""cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes.""
The state plans to place a ""full facepiece supplied air respirator"" over Smith's face. The nitrogen would be administered for at least 15 minutes or ""five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,"" according to the state protocol.
The execution would be the first attempt to use a new method since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. Some states are exploring new methods as lethal injection drugs have been difficult to find.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable euthanasia method for most mammals because the anoxic environment ""is distressing."" And experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture.
Dr. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist who as one of four professionals who filed the U.N. complaint that led to the warning, said Smith is at risk for seizures and choking to death on his own vomit. He said any leak under the mask could prolong the execution.
""A leak will do two things. It will potentially endanger people around. … Air could then get under the mask as well,"" Zivot said. ""And so the execution could be prolonged or maybe he might never die, he just could get injured.""
Much of what is recorded about death from nitrogen comes from industrial accidents — where leaks or cannister mix-ups have killed people — and from suicide attempts. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found 80 people were killed by nitrogen asphyxiation between 1992 and 2002.
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife. Prosecutors said the men were paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett, 45, on behalf of her husband, who wanted to collect on insurance. The coroner testified Sennett was stabbed repeatedly. Her husband killed himself when he became a suspect. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted, was executed in 2010.
The victim's son, Charles Sennett Jr., said in an interview with WAAY-TV that Smith ""has to pay for what he's done."" He and other family members plan to witness the execution.
""And some of these people out there say, 'Well, he doesn't need to suffer like that.' Well, he didn't ask Mama how to suffer?"" the son told the station. ""They just did it. They stabbed her — multiple times.""
Smith's initial conviction was overturned. He was convicted again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge sentenced Smith to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury's sentencing decision in death penalty cases.
Smith is one of few people to survive a prior execution attempt. The state attempted a lethal injection in 2022, but the prison system called it off before the drugs were administered because the staff had difficulty connecting the two required intravenous lines.
Smith's attorneys are asking courts to block the nitrogen execution, arguing that its unconstitutional for the state to make a second attempt to execute him and that the state's plan violates the ban on cruel and unusual punishment and at least merits more scrutiny before it is used.
""It's indefensible for Alabama officials to simply dismiss the very real risks this untested method presents and experiment on a man who has already survived one execution attempt,"" Robin M. Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said.
The Alabama attorney general's office noted that Smith, when previously fighting lethal injection, had suggested nitrogen as an alternative execution method. Courts require inmates challenging their execution method to suggest an alternative method.
""Now that the State is prepared to give Smith what he asked for, he objects,"" the attorney general's office said in a Monday statement.
The inmate's spiritual adviser said Smith is afraid of what is about to happen to him.
""Presently, Kenny is sickened, deeply pained and horrified at the nitrogen hypoxia experiment that is to come,"" the Rev. Jeff Hood, a death penalty opponent, said. ""Despite the darkness that has descended, he tries very hard to fill every second he might have left with as much love as he can muster.""
Several protests are planned in the state. A group of faith leaders delivered a petition to the state's governor on Monday asking her to halt the execution. ""Prisoners are not guinea pigs,"" the Rev. Shane Isner of First Christian Church said on the Capitol steps.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey told The Associated Press last week that the state was ready to proceed.
""Execution by that method was passed in 2018,"" Ivey said. ""The attorney general's office and the Department of Corrections has assured us that all the protocols are in place, and we will carry out that law."""
AVCEXBYZ01_2G6UFALY2CMPWJB,'It felt like my head burst': Survivors recount attack on U.N. facility,"By Hadeel Al-Shalchi,","Published January 26, 2024 at 5:49 AM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-26/it-felt-like-my-head-burst-survivors-recount-attack-on-u-n-facility,"RAFAH, the Gaza Strip — People injured at a United Nations facility in the Gaza city of Khan Younis that was hit by shells earlier this week are recounting harrowing stories of the attack.
The U.N. said 13 people were killed and 56 injured in the strike. The building, which is part of a training complex run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNRWA, was sheltering 800 people.
Nahed Tanteesh, who was displaced to the center three months ago, said he was struck under his left eye with a piece of shrapnel. He said he was on the floor playing with his 4-month-old grandchild after morning prayers when he was surprised with shooting pain.
""It felt like my head burst with a pipe and I was bleeding from the nose,"" he said.
Tanteesh was evacuated to a medical facility in Rafah after leaving through a safe corridor from the center.
The Israeli military said in a statement that the attack was not from an Israeli aerial or artillery strike, and that they were examining whether it could have come from Hamas.
Israeli troops said on Tuesday that they had encircled Khan Younis and were battling some of Hamas' toughest fighters.
Nahed Tanteesh's son, Abdullah, said they were asleep early in the morning when they were awoken suddenly by loud booms and shooting.
""For six or seven hours there was shooting and explosions, it was unbelievable,"" he told NPR. ""We were under fire for four days, praying the entire time, lying on the ground.""
Abdullah Tanteesh said that he carried his bleeding father while running around the center to look for help. He eventually brought his father to the center's administration office.
""There was a person in charge of security there, with U.N. armor, and we begged, please help us!"" he said. ""But they told us, 'We are just like you, we are trapped like you and can't go anywhere.'""
He said he was able to finally leave the facility to find help through what he called a so-called safety corridor.
Abdullah Tanteesh also said that he has witnessed the funeral of at least 10 people.
""I saw a woman with her head cut off, and another with insides exposed,"" he said. ""They took the bodies to a warehouse in the center, wrapped them in blankets, we prayed, and they just dug up a hole in the ground and put them all in there together.""
Thomas White, the director of the UNRWA's mission in Gaza, said in a statement on Wednesday that the deteriorating safety conditions in Khan Younis are the result of a consistent failure of international humanitarian law, and called for the hostilities to stop.

AWUKWXMJP4_NO7QHWE19REASV9,'We don't want to be first place.' Wyoming tries to address high gun suicide rates,By Kirk Siegler,"Published January 23, 2024 at 4:30 AM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-23/we-dont-want-to-be-first-place-wyoming-tries-to-address-high-gun-suicide-rates,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Shortly after Christina Williams' fiancé died last spring, her three daughters came to her crying. They said they missed their dad. It got to be too much for her.
""I couldn't handle my grief or my girls' grief at the same time,"" Williams says.
She made a plan, as grief counselors call it, to take her life that day. But by chance, a couple of hours later, while stopped at a traffic light on Dell Range Boulevard in Cheyenne, she saw a sign for LIV Health, a newly opened mental health urgent care clinic.
She decided to drive in right then. Without an appointment, she was seen immediately by a crisis clinician and a psychiatric nurse practitioner.
One of the first questions that crisis clinician Sarai Guerrero-Vasquez asked Williams when she first came in is now an increasingly normal standard across Wyoming: Where are the guns stored at home?
""I always assure them, 'I'm just a social worker — I'm not going to go into your house and take anything,'"" Guerrero-Vasquez says. ""I just want to make sure that you stay safe, and if that means having a family member secure them for a little bit until you go through this bump, life will resume.""
Williams had already given hers to her best friend. Soon after her visit to LIV Health, she agreed to check herself into the hospital and has since been doing better — getting regular counseling and help managing medications. But Guerrero-Vasquez says some patients resist getting more treatment because they're afraid their guns will be confiscated.
This is the reality of suicide prevention work in a state with one of the highest gun ownership rates in the United States. For most of the last decade, Wyoming has also had one of the highest suicide rates and, specifically, high gun suicide rates. Firearms are used in roughly 75% of suicides in the Cowboy State, compared with just over 50% nationally.
In conservative Wyoming, it was long seen as taboo to draw a link between guns and suicide.
But survivors and those who work in prevention say there are signs that this is finally changing, with gun shops increasingly talking about safe storage of firearms, and mental health professionals talking more with patients about the risks of easy access to guns during a mental health crisis.


There are a lot of theories behind why Wyoming, alongside several of its neighbors in the Mountain West, has had perennially high suicide rates. It's the least populated state in the nation, and there are huge gaps in care. People have to drive long distances on roads that often close for blizzards or wind. There has also long been a stigma around getting help: that ""cowboy up"" mentality of getting through the tough times.
But those who work on the front lines of suicide prevention say there's another, bigger elephant in the room. And that's all the guns and easy access to them.
""One of the challenging aspects of working in the Rocky Mountain region is just the availability and accessibility of firearms,"" says Brittany Wardle, a prevention officer at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center. ""Some days it feels very overwhelming because you think, 'If we didn't have firearms to worry about, what would suicide look like here?'""
But gun control in Wyoming is widely seen as being off the table. It's also unlikely the state will expand Medicaid anytime soon, which experts say could increase mental health services.
Still, those who work in suicide prevention see some incremental signs of progress. Wyoming now has a locally staffed988 suicide hotline. Gov. Mark Gordon has been holding high-profile suicide prevention forums in communities, garnering press attention. And efforts to expand mental health care to underserved places — such as the new urgent care clinic in Cheyenne — could serve as a model for other communities.
LIV Health has seen a 171% increase in patients since last year. Similar clinics have been popping up around the country since 2020. In rural America, it can take months to get a regular appointment with a mental health specialist, and providers say people in crisis need help immediately.

In the urgent care clinic's lobby, next to the requisite doctor's office magazines, LIV Health CEO Emily Loos restocks a basket full of free gun safety locks every couple of weeks. Clinic staff members stress the importance of safely storing guns or giving them up temporarily in a time of crisis.
""If we're worried about impulsivity, [we say] you can put the key somewhere up high where you really have to work to get to it,"" Loos says. ""If they're hesitant to give up their firearm, we'll talk about making it harder to access within the home.""
Even though Wyoming has remained at or near the top in the nation for per capita suicides, B.J. Ayers is at least encouraged that folks are finally talking openly about keeping guns away from people in a moment of crisis.
It's something she knows all too well. The Cheyenne mother lost two sons to suicide more than a decade ago. Both shot themselves.
""I mean, at what point do we say enough is enough?"" Ayers says. ""We need to talk about it. We need to get the resources out to the people that are in crisis.""
Unlike, say, intentional drug overdoses, suicide by firearm is almost always lethal. After her sons' deaths, Ayers, who is 62 and works as an insurance agent, channeled her grief into action, starting a suicide prevention foundation.
""It's very disheartening when we stay up there,"" she says, of her state's ranking on guns and suicide. ""We don't want to be first place in this.""

In blue America, the reflexive response to gun violence is often a move to restrict access to firearms. With gun control a nonstarter here, prevention workers like Lauren SinClair of the Department of Veterans Affairs talk instead about creating time and space between a person in crisis and a gun.
One recent week, she had logged hundreds of miles in her Toyota hybrid minivan crisscrossing southern Wyoming visiting local gun shops and advocating for safe storage — where a customer can bring their guns in and store them temporarily in a safe, no questions asked.
At an unannounced drop-in at Frontier Arms & Supply in Cheyenne, she explained to counter staff: ""Maybe their teenager is in crisis or they themselves were just saying, 'Hey, I'm not in the right space to have my firearm at home with me right now. Can you hold that?'""
She was pleased to learn that the shop was already offering this service and getting willing participants. SinClair lost her mother to suicide by firearm when she was a little girl. She says that for too long, suicide prevention and guns were completely siloed from one another in Wyoming.
""They can coexist together: mental health professionals talking about firearms, firearms professionals talking about mental health,"" SinClair says. ""Those can exist together, and I think for too long there was hesitancy.""
It's not yet clear how many gun shops are offering safe storage in Wyoming. But it's now more common for salespeople to hand out safety locks with purchases and to have taken suicide prevention trainings known as QPR classes — question, persuade, refer.

On the outskirts of the wind-swept town of Laramie is Gold Spur Outfitters, a specialty gun retailer popular with local college students. Behind the store and warehouse floor is a huge metal vault. On closer inspection, it's a secure room, not unlike a large safe.
Co-owner Lloyd Baker incorporated safe storage into his business model when he opened three years ago, after seeing so many fellow veterans battling mental health challenges.
""Something like this is not going to solve all the problems. But it's a start,"" Baker says. ""We're not here to judge. We're not here to point fingers. We're here to reduce the stigma, first off, around firearm storage and mental health.""
Baker is working with the new Firearms Research Centeracross town at the University of Wyoming to turn this into a model statewide. He's frustrated with what he sees as the gridlock in American politics: Many liberals default to gun control, and most conservatives just say no to anything.
""We can provide tools to the people who do suicide prevention,"" Baker says. ""There are other options than going through state or federal government to try to fix a local problem. Maybe we can do something locally.""
He's referring to the alternative to red flag laws, which have been effective in blue states, including next door in Colorado, where a judge can temporarily remove guns during a mental health crisis. In a rural culture where there's often deep mistrust in government, Baker says, gun owners — including some of his most loyal customers — tend to have better relationships with their local dealers.
Still, despite all the work underway, Wyoming was expected to finish out 2023 at or near the top in the nation for suicides.
It's frustrating to survivors like Kari Cochran who are turning their grief into action.
In Rock Springs, she lost her 18-year-old son last year to suicide. He had battled mental health challenges his entire life and shot himself after going missing in February.
""He left the house. He talked about buying a gun. At that point, I didn't think he had access,"" Cochran says.
Cochran, a local hairdresser, was elected to her local school board recently in part on a platform of increasing mental health access for students. She says she'll work as hard as she can to ensure that no other family has to endure the pain hers is going through.
""It's a system problem that just is going to continue to repeat itself until we show kids and talk to kids openly. I mean, guns aren't going away,"" she says.
If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or be in crisis, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.

D2EI1GKZW5_MCH5AUMGDFVQQFM,Hangout Festival organizers: Get tickets now,Alabama Public Radio | By Isabella Cornelius,"Published January 24, 2024 at 4:05 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-24/hangout-festival-organizers-get-tickets-now,"Lana Del Rey, Renee Rapp, hemlocke springs and more are making their debut at the iconic Gulf Shores music festival this year. Hangout Music Festival organizers say anyone looking to “hang out” in 2024 needs to grab tickets or a pass now as they are going quickly.
Hangout Fest is one of Alabama’s largest music festivals, held on the third weekend of May. The festival has changed significantly from its first lineup of jam-bands and bluegrass pickers. The event has since boasted lineups of notable pop artists for many years, surviving the COVID-19 pandemic that spelled the death of many other similar events.
Organizers say Hangout’s impact on the state of Alabama is significant, being estimated around $60 million. They say the location of the festival, directly on the beach, is a large part of this impact.
“We have people [who] travel from all 50 states. Last year, 37 different countries to come to this event,” said Reeves Price, the festival’s producer for 2024. “Quite a large percentage of them stay in the area before or after the event to see what the area has to offer. It’s the only event of its kind in Alabama, and it’s something to be proud of.”
Reeves said in addition to the artists featured this year, there are many other attractions. This includes art installations, lounge areas and smaller stages with DJs and other performers. Organizers say one area is styled as a New Orleans-like piano bar, while another, named “Monster Beach Club,” is described as a “nightclub environment on the beach.” Hangout event staff say it’s important to offer attendees more than just tunes.
“We know that a music festival is more than just music,” said Reeves. “There’s all sorts of little things that we sprinkle into the events that make it special. [It] gives you places to go and things to do between the performances.”
Organizers say while the beach will have plenty to offer on its own, many attendees will be there to see their favorite artists. Lana Del Rey, Cage the Elephant and Dominic Fike are set to make their belated debut. This follows the festival’s cancellation in 2020. Other newcomers include pop-punk darlings All Time Low, glam-synth artist Chappel Roan and the alternative rapper Flyana Boss.
“The capacity of the event is 40,000 a day, and we sell out every year. We’re selling tickets faster than we have in many years,” said Reeves. “I'd encourage folks to take a look at the lineup and buy their tickets if they want to be there because they might not be available for that long.”
Hangout Music Festival begins on May 17. Tickets and VIP passes are currently on sale. Click here to see the full lineup."

E9HEHVIVRW_I7224JDENFLMRV3,Trump testifies in the E. Jean Carroll trial,By Ximena Bustillo,"Published January 25, 2024 at 1:50 PM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-25/trump-testifies-in-the-e-jean-carroll-trial,"Updated January 25, 2024 at 3:25 PM ET
Former President Donald Trump, in brief testimony Thursday in the defamation trial brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, insisted that his previous recorded statement about the allegations was true and that he did not intend to harm her.
""100 percent,"" he said when asked if he stood by his deposition in which he called Carroll a liar.
Asked by Alina Habba, his lawyer, if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, Trump said: ""I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.""
Carroll sued Trump for calling her a liar when she accused him of sexually assaulting her. This is her second lawsuit against him.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has already ruled Trump is liable for defamation but a jury must decide how much he owes her.
Trump's appearance in the New York courtroom comes just days after he won the New Hampshire primary and became the prohibitive GOP front-runner. The case is one of several involving Trump, who is also awaiting a verdict in a civil trial that could result in him paying at least $250 million to New York state for his business practices, which have been deemed by a judge to be fraudulent. He could also be prohibited from doing business in the state where he made his name as a real estate mogul. In all, Trump faces 91 charges in federal and state trials, ranging from the ones in New York to those at the federal level related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Closing arguments in the Carroll case are set for Friday.

In 2019, Carroll, an advice columnist and freelance writer, accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. The accusation, which was detailed in her book, was first previewed in a New York magazine article. After the article published, Trump issued two statements in response to reporters, including one in which he outright denied her claim and said she was ""not my type.""
Carroll then sued Trump for defamation, arguing that his comments ruined her reputation as a trusted source in the media and resulted in a slew of insults and threatening messages, emails and comments to her social media accounts.
At the time, then-Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr blocked the lawsuit, arguing that Trump's comments were made in his official capacity as president. This caused the lawsuit to be stuck in court for several years.
In 2022, Carroll sued Trump again, this time for sexual assault and for another instance of defamation. This went to trial in 2023 — after Trump left the White House — where a jury found Trump liable for both assault and defamation; Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million.
Also in 2023, Biden's Justice Department reversed course and allowed the first lawsuit on defamation to move forward. In part because of the 2023 decision that had found Trump liable for assault, Judge Kaplan ruled that defamation also happened in 2019 and that Trump is also liable.
Due to that ruling, the only thing this jury has to decide is how much money Trump owes Carroll, which could be higher than before.

A bipartisan deal that would pair assistance to Ukraine and Israel with measures to improve border security is facing serious political threats as negotiators aim to finalize a deal.
The talks seemed on the verge of collapse Wednesday after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested the politics around the agreement have shifted, but negotiators have vowed to forge ahead.
Punchbowl News first reported that McConnell told Republican senators the politics ""have changed"" because former President Trump wants to build his reelection campaign around immigration. ""We don't want to do anything to undermine him,"" McConnell reportedly said.
A spokesperson for the minority leader did not dispute the Punchbowl report when NPR asked for comment.
McConnell's comments deflated hopes that a deal could be made public this week. Negotiators told reporters as early as Monday that they were nearing a final agreement on outstanding issues like parole for asylum seekers.
But McConnell appeared to back away from his comments on Thursday, telling reporters he still supports the talks.
The border agreement has been explicitly tied to security funding for Israel and Ukraine and any failure could threaten chances of Congress passing that aid. President Biden agreed to couple his funding request with border security elements at the behest of Republicans, including McConnell.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Olivia Dalton told reporters Thursday that the White House remains committed to getting deal on border and national security funding.
""The president has been clear, we need action on the border,"" Dalton told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""We've been engaging in good faith, bipartisan negotiations with both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to that end. And we believe that there's no reason that shouldn't continue.""

Still, senators on both sides of the aisle insisted Thursday that the deal is not dead. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead Republican involved in the talks, said negotiations were still moving forward, and that McConnell was acknowledging the ""political realities"" of the situation, but not suggesting the deal be abandoned.
""We started this in October, and it's not October anymore,"" Lankford said. ""You know, it's now January. The end of January. And we're in the middle of a presidential primary season ... that's just a reality.""
Sen. Chris Murphy, the lead Democrat involved in negotiations, said he has not spoken to McConnell about his comments, but reiterated that ""talks are ongoing.""
""I think the Republican conference is going to make a decision in the next 24 hours as to whether they actually want to get something done or whether they want to leave the border a mess for political reasons,"" said Murphy, D-Conn.

While text of an agreement has not yet been released, Trump spoke out against a bipartisan framework last week, writing on his social media site, Truth Social: I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions & Millions of people, many from parts unknown, into our once great, but soon to be great again, Country!""
He added that House Speaker Mike Johnson should only accept a deal that is ""perfect.""
Trump's comments comments were a serious blow to the talks. Significant border provisions were meant to garner Republican support for Ukraine assistance, which the party has increasingly soured on. House Republicans in particular have little appetite for more Ukraine aid, and have been insisting that the Senate take up a border bill they previously passed — without a single Democratic vote — instead of working on a bipartisan one.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who supports aid for Ukraine, stressed that Thursday his state ""can't continue to absorb"" the number of migrants currently crossing the border, which hit a record high of 2.5 million people last year.
""President Trump, you know, obviously he's an important voice but we have a job to do. And we intend to do it,"" Cornyn said. ""Some people are saying, 'well you know, we can't give President Biden a win, because he desperately needs this.' But the magnitude of this problem is so great that this is not going to be all of a sudden fixed here in the next 10 months.""

F8GLFNIR45_6CO5BNDTOII139Y,"That giant extinct shark, Megalodon? Maybe it wasn't so mega",By Ari Daniel,"Published January 26, 2024 at 4:20 AM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-26/that-giant-extinct-shark-megalodon-maybe-it-wasnt-so-mega,"The megalodon went extinct 3.6 million years ago, and is thought to be the largest shark that ever swam the Earth. But there's debate over what it looked like. Most scientists have described it as a bigger version of today's great white shark, a depiction that has informed its appearance on the silver screen like in the 2018 film ""The Meg.""
A research team now suggests the giant shark may have been more slender than scientists thought, according to a new publication in Palaeontologia Electronica. If that's true, it would alter our understanding of how it behaved in its ancient environment — and what mark it may have left on the ocean ecosystem of today.
""As one of the largest carnivores that ever existed,"" explains Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University, ""deciphering the biology of Megalodon is critical to understand the role large carnivores play in the context of the evolution of marine ecosystems and how its extinction influenced the development of the present-day ocean.""

Phillip Sternes grew up outside of Chicago. There wasn't a drop of salt water in sight. But he remembers he was five or six when he first encountered Megalodon in the movie ""Jaws.""
""I watched it over and over on a videotape countless times,"" he recalls. ""There's actually a scene where Chief Brody's flipping through the book and then he sees a picture of the Megalodon.""
Sternes began to devour books on sharks and he watched Shark Week religiously. It was only a matter of time before he became a shark researcher himself. He's currently a PhD student at the University of California, Riverside. When Sternes was getting into the field, he learned that what Megalodon looked like was an unresolved question. The problem was the lack of fossil evidence — just a smattering of scales and vertebrae, and tons of teeth. Nothing more.
""You literally will pick every single detail you can out from that limited fossil evidence to try to figure out what the heck did the shark look like,"" says Sternes.
For years, researchers assumed that Megalodon was just a bigger version of the modern-day great white — a predatory shark at the top of its food chain with large serrated triangular teeth.
In the 1990s, a team calculated the relationship between the largest vertebra of a great white shark and its total length. ""Basically, if you found a great white [shark's] vertebra,"" says Sternes, ""you could plug it into that equation and you can predict the length of the shark just from the vertebra. Simple.""
Researchers applied the same logic to a vertebra from the most complete Megalodon fossil there is. The result was that the specimen would have been some 30 feet — double or triple the length of a typical great white.
But then, a couple years ago, a different group lined those same vertebrae up to make a computer model of Megalodon. The spine alone measured about 36 feet and the animal some 52 feet.
Sternes and his colleagues smelled something... fishy.
""So I'm like, 'OK, there's a huge discrepancy going on right there,'"" he says. ""The spine is longer than what was originally predicted for the total length of the shark itself.""
A great white shark is big and bulky, says Sternes. So if Megalodon were that long, he's doubtful its spine could have supported a great white's thicker body shape. ""You got to think about swimming,"" he says, ""structural support underwater, just maintaining the actual body shape, because everything rides on the spine.""
Sternes and his colleagues concluded that Megalodon must have been more slender. This means it would have still been a fearsome predator, but it would have had a longer digestive canal and cruised more slowly ""with occasional 'burst swimming' for capturing prey,"" says Shimada. That would have allowed the giant shark to process its food for a longer period of time and absorb additional nutrients.

Jack Cooper says the new publication doesn't supply sufficient evidence to support a more svelte Megalodon. He's a graduate student in paleobiology at Swansea University in the UK. He's part of that other group that measured the spine and came up with the longer estimate of Megalodon's length.
Cooper says the new publication presents an argument his group already considered. ""It does reaffirm that we would need to find a complete skeleton to know for sure what Megalodon looks like,"" he says. ""But if you're going to present an alternative hypothesis, you should use a lot of statistical work to try to make your case.""
And that's something he says this paper doesn't do.
Cooper agrees this is an important riddle to solve, once more fossil evidence becomes available. That's because Megalodon likely kept its most essential organs warmer than the surrounding seawater, which would have allowed it to swim further and faster.
Knowing its size and body shape tells us how much it likely had to eat to maintain such a lifestyle. ""And that can tell us quite a lot about what made it vulnerable to extinction about 3 million years ago,"" says Cooper.
At the end of Megalodon's reign, sea levels were changing, ruining coastal habitats. This would have meant less food, possibly contributing to the giant shark's extinction. Cooper says the reasons behind Megalodon's vanishing could help us respond to the plight of today's sharks, many of which are endangered on a planet again in flux.

FCDJLMIL96_USKQJYUXFU7QRKS,Mardi Gras in Mobile,Alabama Public Radio | By Joe Moody,"Published January 25, 2024 at 5:00 AM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-25/mardi-gras-in-mobile,"It is the Mardi Gras season in Alabama and Mobile has already started celebrating. The City of Mobile started celebrating the holiday when the city was founded in 1702. Fat Tuesday will be on February 13th which which means Joe Cain Day will be celebrated in Mobile on February 11th. This is an important day of celebration for Mobilians. Judi Gulledge is the executive director of the Mobile Carnival Association. She explains the significance of the man. “He is the person who was responsible for revitalizing Mardi Gras after the Civil War,"" she said, ""and so, he plays a real prominent role in our Carnival celebrations here. As a matter of fact, we have an entire day. The Sunday before Fat Tuesday is called Joe Cain Day.”
Many outside of Alabama think of New Orleans when they think of Mardi Gras. Even though Mobile and New Orleans are sister cities, there are many differences in its celebrations.
""First of all, Mobile is much smaller and family oriented and, therefore, when you come to our parades here you're going to find a very safe and family friendly environment. It's not uncommon along the streets to see everyone from the youngest of the young, babies in strollers, all the way up to folks in their 80s and 90s hanging on the barricades all clamoring for these trinkets and toys that people are throwing off,"" Gulledge said.
Gulledge said another difference is that the individual mystic organizations actually fund their own parades in Mobile and that they are built new each year. ""Immediately after Mardi Gras is over, they will take their floats back to the barn, they will tear them down, they will come up with a theme for the next year and they start immediately building them back,"" Gulledge said. ""If you come to to see a parade in Mobile, what you're going to see is it's really like a pageant unfolding. It's a play. So, there's going to be a title float which announces the title of that particular parade. And then the floats that follow it will make that title come to life and so it tells a story.""
The Mobile Carnival Association runs the Mobile Carnival Museum in downtown Mobile which acts as a resource for all things Mardi Gras related in the City of Mobile. More information on the museum can be found here."
FQYDGOPH5G_57AD2HATVOEC2MK,Why Vice President Harris went to Wisconsin today to talk about abortion,By Deepa Shivaram,"Published January 22, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-22/why-vice-president-harris-is-going-to-wisconsin-today-to-talk-about-abortion,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 3:05 PM ET
Vice President Harris marked the 51st anniversary of landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade on Tuesday by kicking off a tour to draw attention to new restrictions on abortion, laying the blame for them at the feet of former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race to become the Republican candidate for November's election.
""The former president handpicked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. It is a decision he brags about,"" Harris said in a fiery campaign-style speech. ""How dare he!""
One in three women of reproductive age live in states with abortion bans, Harris said. The post-Roe restrictions are an issue that Democrats hope will fire up voters for the presidential election.
Since the court's Dobbs decision ended Roe, voters have turned out in record numbers in states like Michigan and Kansas to support measures to protect reproductive rights with new laws. It's that energy that Harris is hoping to tap into as she reaches out to voters ahead of the election this year — an election where swing states like Arizona and Nevada may also have ballot initiatives on abortion rights.
""Momentum is on our side,"" Harris said. ""Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, the people of America have voted for freedom.""


Harris plans to hit about five places during the next two months to highlight this issue, including states that have enshrined protections for abortion since the Supreme Court rolled back abortion rights in 2022, states that have restricted access, and states that have threatened to restrict access.
The vice president's team picked Wisconsin's Waukesha County to launch the tour. The politically important state illustrates how people's lives were affected when Roe was struck down.
Wisconsin effectively banned abortion, reverting to a law written in 1849. For about 15 months, there were no legal abortions available in the state.
""In a state whose motto is, 'Forward,' these extremists are trying to take us backward — but we're not having that,"" Harris said.
Wisconsin is also a key swing state that Democrats want to win in November. Former President Donald Trump carried Waukesha County — a suburb of Milwaukee — in 2016 and 2020. But Democrats have made a series of inroads there.
Mini Timmaraju, who leads the organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said voters will keep paying attention to the issue of abortion rights because of how high-stakes it has become for women's health.
""We've had multiple, high-profile abortion access and Dobbs-related crisis stories,"" Timmaraju said. ""Unfortunately, the story's not going away and therefore the saliency of the issue isn't going away.""

On Tuesday, Harris and Biden will appear together at a campaign rally in Northern Virginia, along with their spouses, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff.
The event is counterprogramming for the Republican primary in New Hampshire. The Biden campaign is seeking to draw attention to what Trump and other Republicans have said about abortion, which is one of the most difficult issues Republicans will face with voters.
Democrats in Virginia campaigned on the issue of reproductive rights last year, during state-level elections, and won back control of the state legislature.
It's a rare for Biden to headline an event on reproductive care. While the president has a long voting record of supporting Roe, he has expressed that he personally is opposed to abortion.
""I happen to be a practicing Catholic. I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right,"" Biden said at a fundraiser last June.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, one of the co-chairs of Biden's reelection campaign, said in an interview that aired Sunday that it would help if Biden talked more about abortion rights.
""I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting. And I think he has said that. To use maybe more, you know, blunt language, maybe that would be helpful,"" Whitmer said.

Biden's campaign is featuring the issue in advertising this week with a spot that tells the story of an OB-GYN who had to leave Texas with her family to seek an abortion for a planned pregnancy that put her life at risk. In the ad, Dr. Austin Dennard explicitly blames Trump for his role in overturning abortion rights.
The campaign says the ad will run on channels like HGTV, Bravo, Food Network and Hallmark in an effort to reach suburban women and younger voters, who are critical voting blocs for Democrats.
""This ad serves as a sobering reminder to women across the country of the devastating legacy of Donald Trump's presidency – and a warning of his plans, if elected, to take this anti-abortion crusade even further,"" Biden's campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez said in a statement.

H1BZC40WJZ_ZSVAUQ62532COEU,5 takeaways from the New Hampshire primary,By Domenico Montanaro,"Published January 24, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-24/5-takeaways-from-the-new-hampshire-primary,"Donald Trump beat Nikki Haley by a significant margin in New Hampshire — 11 points — despite nearly half the electorate being comprised of independent voters. Haley won 6 in 10 independents Tuesday, but lost three-quarters of Republicans.
It's hard to see another state favorable enough to Haley to give her the opportunity to dislodge Trump as the likely nominee. But Haley is vowing to continue on.
Loading...
Here are five takeaways from the New Hampshire results:

Haley said Tuesday night that she's forging ahead.
""New Hampshire is first in the nation; it is not last in the nation,"" Haley said. ""This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.""
She argued that she has increased in her support and that there are lots of other states still to vote. That's all true, but the road ahead doesn't look well paved for her.
The next contest is Nevada (Feb. 8), where she isn't even on the party caucus ballot. That means Trump is going to gobble up the delegates — and attention — there. (Haley is on a state-run primary ballot two days earlier that does not award delegates, and Trump isn't on that one.)
Then it's South Carolina (Feb. 24). Haley said she's looking toward that. She's scheduled a campaign rally in her home state Wednesday night and has begun spending money on ads there. But South Carolina looks more like Iowa than New Hampshire. And it will be hard for Haley to explain away a loss in the state where she was governor.

In addition to the long odds because of the party demographics Haley faces, there's also the issue of time. South Carolina isn't for another month.
Is Haley going to be able to hold onto the resources it requires for her to stay on the air in a significant way for that length of time? Can she maintain her loose coalition, even as the party moves increasingly toward rallying around Trump.
Even Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who has been lukewarm on Trump since the former president left the White House, came out and endorsed Trump Tuesday night.
What's more, Trump and his allies are vowing to go after Haley even harder than they already have — and Trump has already promoted a ""birther"" conspiracy theory against her, falsely accusing her of being ineligible to be president.
Trump called Haley an ""imposter"" Tuesday night and added, ""I don't get too angry. I get even.""
The Republican Party right now is a party of one, and if Haley wants a future in it — say, to be considered for vice president or to climb into the good graces of the Trump-loving GOP base and run for president in 2028 — Haley is going to have to think hard about her next steps.

Haley has made central to her campaign the idea that she is the candidate who has the best chance of beating President Biden. And there's certainly evidence that she would be a stronger general-election candidate than Trump.
A recent CBS News poll, for example, found Haley at 53% and beating Biden by 8 points. Trump was within the margin of error with Biden, up 2.
But Republican voters aren't buying it.
In both Iowa and New Hampshire, voters who said beating Biden is their top priority in a candidate sided more with Trump.
They certainly have reason to believe Trump can beat Biden. Multiple swing-state polls — to this point — have shown Trump beating Biden. Does that mean it will hold up? There's a lot of time and money to be spent over the next 10 months framing the political argument against both men.

Trump has been running against Biden since he got into the race in November 2022. Through this primary, in which he has maintained massive leads, he's called for the party to unify around him — and most are falling in line.
Short of something extraordinary taking place in the next month to change that, the country is in for a Biden-Trump rematch, and the party apparatuses are preparing for that.
""Tonight's results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the GOP nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,"" Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.
Biden himself won as a write-in candidate in the Democratic primary (that didn't count) Tuesday night over Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who found, like another Democrat, there just weren't enough Deaniacs in New Hampshire.

Trump and Biden are both unpopular and were each the oldest president to serve when they were in office.
Biden's age (81) is a bigger liability than Trump's (77), according to polls, but majorities of Americans say both are too old to be president.
Majorities of Americans have also told pollsters they would rather not see a rematch between the two men.
And yet here we are on the precipice of exactly that because their parties' voters in these early states are saying that's what they do want.
It will be acrimonious and contentious — and what was the most likely outcome all along.

A 'pathbreaking' new model",By Nurith Aizenman,"Published January 22, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-22/if-you-donate-dna-what-should-scientists-give-in-return-a-pathbreaking-new-model,"Anthropologist Carla Handley is sitting cross-legged in a mud-walled house in a Kenyan village called Merti. She's meeting with a man dressed in a flowing blue robe and a woven cap of red and white. His name is Wario Bala and he's a member of Kenya's Borana ethnic group, a nomadic people who raise cattle across Kenya's northern regions.
Handley introduces herself, then adds that she's ""known locally as Chaltu Jillo Hanti"" – the Borana language name bestowed on her by elders in the community. An interpreter translates and Bala laughs approvingly.
Then Handley points to a poster she's brought with pictures on it.
""You see here we have this small brush?"" she says. Bala – who never went to school and doesn't know how to read – peers closely at the picture and nods.
""So do you remember in 2017,"" continues Handley, ""when I was here, I was using a brush to rub the inside of people's cheeks? This was the brush I used.""
Handley, a research associate with Arizona State University, is doing this presentation to fulfill a promise she made seven years ago, when she teamed up with some geneticists at her university for a study requiring the collection of DNA samples from nearly 600 people.
Back then, says Handley, the elders in the community had made a request that's almost never demanded of researchers: ""They said, 'We will only allow this if you promise to return and tell us what it is that you found.' ""
Handley readily agreed. But getting the money to do so proved even more complicated than she first imagined. It's only in the last several months – through a new project funded by a branch of the United States National Institutes of Health that focuses on ethics in research – that Handley has been able to make good on her commitment.
The project isn't just about providing Handley's study subjects with the results of her work. Handley and a collaborator are using that effort as a test case to launch a broader re-think of what Handley calls ""some deep ethical questions that should be asked."" Essentially, what do researchers owe their human subjects when they collect DNA for studies – and all the more so when the participants are from some of the world's most marginalized communities?
To find out, Handley surveyed members of the Borana and three other nomadic peoples in northern Kenya and is now analyzing their views on a host of issues: Should researchers compensate people who participate in studies – and if so, what form should that compensation take? If future researchers want to use stored samples for a new inquiry, do they need to go back to the people who donated their DNA to get their consent? And to what extent do people think they ought to be kept informed about the results?
When it comes to explaining findings, Handley has also come up with a new, picture-based method. She's assessing its effectiveness in hopes of providing a model for how researchers can meaningfully involve study participants who've never had the opportunity to learn to read – let alone get a grounding in biological concepts such as DNA.
Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at New York University, says Handley's effort is ""pathbreaking.""
It's a moral principle, says Caplan, that ""subjects have the right to know the results of research. ""If we think of study subjects not so much as objects, but as partners that we're going to work with, then I think we really have to make a sustained effort.""
Yet, says Caplan, historically ""there's been a lack of appreciation for the duty to return findings to subjects around the world – rich and poor alike.""
For instance, he notes, a 2019 study found that among clinical trials between 2014 and 2015, only about 25% had provided participants with summaries of the findings using language meant to be understandable to someone who is not a scientist.
This has started to change over the last several years, adds Caplan, as a growing number of government officials and scientists in wealthy countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have started to show interest in finding ways to inform study participants in their countries about the results.
But Caplan, who is leading one of those efforts, says Handley's project is the first he's heard of that is attempting to reach people in communities as remote and impoverished as the nomadic peoples of rural Kenya. So her work could offer useful insights for reaching traditionally ignored and underserved populations everywhere.
""There can be lots of strategies to get it done,"" he says. ""I think this work is showing the way.""

How did an anthropologist like Handley find herself at the cutting edge of a movement to reconsider the ethics of genetics research?
It began with her quest to answer a longstanding question in evolutionary anthropology and biology: Why do we humans cooperate with each other on such a massive scale — with people well beyond our families, or even extended families? This trait, so different from the behavior of even primates with whom we share recent ancestry, is arguably one of the secrets to our success as a species, notes Handley.
""Because of this level of cooperation within our species, we've been able to fill every niche on earth and exploit it to great effect,"" she says. ""So what has made this happen?""
One possibility is what's called ""cultural selection theory."" The idea is that as humans developed different cultural arrangements, the cultures that did best – and therefore lasted through time – were those with strong norms requiring people to help out fellow members of the culture, even as they competed against people from outside cultures.
Handley and a collaborator had already provided important evidence for that theory through an anthropological study they published in the journal Nature. It found that the Borana — and three other neighboring nomadic peoples — were very willing to share precious resources like water and grazing land with strangers within their own ethnic group. But when it came to members of the other groups, says Handley, ""The level of cooperation really drops off, because you've identified them as culturally distinct from you, and so you want to make sure that that border is maintained.""
But Handley and her collaborator had still wanted to rule out another possibility: Maybe people were favoring members of their own culture because they're simply more likely to be biologically related to them — in other words maybe this just boils down to people's evolutionary instinct to pass on their genes.
Hence the effort to collect those cheek swabs and compare the DNA in the samples from each group. Handley's finding: the genetic explanation does not hold.
These four nomadic groups may have different languages, religions and styles of dress, ""but there is a high level of genetic relatedness between them,"" she says. What's more, the best predictor of how genetically related two individuals are to each other is not which ethnic group they belong to but how close they live to each other.

The team published their results in the American Journal of Biological Anthropology in April of 2022. But sharing the findings with the study participants required Handley to get more creative.
Tracking down the study subjects was going to be time-consuming and expensive. And when it comes to the typical research grant, she says, ""there is nothing that allows for money to be kept aside for the purposes of dissemination. That goes for genetics projects, that goes for anthropology projects – for all kinds of research that is conducted within human populations.""
Still, Handley, who has built her career on studying the nomadic peoples of northern Kenya, felt a kind of sacred responsibility to keep her word. ""These are communities and people that I've had relationships with for so many years,"" she says.
She also found herself quickly coming around to the idea that reporting back to study subjects is important on principle.
""Being self-determined, having autonomy over your own data, how it's consumed, how it's presented, how the rest of the world views your community – I mean, everybody should have that right,"" she says.
But all the more so, she adds, when it comes to people in remote, low-income regions.
The rest of us, she notes, ""have every kind of platform available to us. You can go on social media – you can complain or raise different perspectives. But people in these kinds of communities in northern Kenya don't have that access. People are not literate. If you publish a paper in Science or Nature they're not going to read how we as Western researchers are representing their communities and their genetic information.""
Caplan, the bioethicist at New York University, says a similar sentiment is also starting to drive a change in wealthy countries.
""A lot of clinical trials just recruit upper class white people – or they may only recruit people in countries that are relatively wealthy, ignoring for medical or social science purposes vast populations,"" he says. So ""there's been a lot of discussion about, 'How do we get a more representative group of people?' Well, one way to do that is to make the subjects feel that they're partnering with you – that they're working with you. Not that you're the researcher, the big Kahuna, and they're just out there as some kind of fish to be looked at swimming in the ocean.""
Caplan notes that the British government has announced plans to require medical researchers to either provide their study results to participants ""in a suitable format,"" or explicitly explain why that's not feasible. And, adds Caplan, he's ""not surprised,"" that it was the U.S. National Institutes of Health that finally provided Handley with the funding she needed for her project.

Once Handley finally got that support, she confronted the next challenge – coming up with a way to actually explain the study's results to people who had never even heard of DNA.
Then it hit her: ""One thing that is ubiquitous across these groups is the use of beautiful, elaborate beading that women, and some men as well, wear in necklaces,"" says Handley. ""Different groups have different coloration of their beads – different styles.""
And in many ways the beads offer an excellent analogy to DNA. ""You can line up different strings of beads and have the varying colors to show the differences in the DNA between groups. And so it's something that I just thought, 'Okay, this is something that everyone can understand.' ""
Which brings us back to Handley's meeting with Wario Bala in the mud-walled house. After explaining that inside the cheek samples were tiny things called ""cells,"" which contained something even tinier called ""DNA,"" Handley points to two pictures on the poster: A woman in the traditional attire of the Turkana people and another woman dressed as a member of Bala's group, the Borana.
Handley takes out two beaded necklaces and places one on top of each figure. ""So these black beads are a representation of the DNA that is common to all of us as human beings. We all share these black beads,"" she says. ""But then we can see some small colored beads – like this red one, this blue, this yellow, and this orange,"" she says. ""This represents the DNA that is a little bit different between us.""
She begins comparing the two necklaces – bead by bead. ""You see this one - first [bead] is orange, on this one the first one is yellow. Different,"" she says. Next up: ""Red. Yellow. Different."" Then Handley gets to the third bead in each strand. ""Red, Red. Same.""
As she continues the analysis for each of the different ethnic groups and subgroups pictured on the poster, Bala leans in ever closer.
""Thank you,"" he says, when the presentation has concluded. ""This is knowledge that we have been passing on through speech. But now you have written it down.""
Handley says other participants have expressed more surprise at how much genetic material they share with members of the other ethnic groups. ""Just sort of a light bulb moment of, 'Oh my goodness, I had no idea that I was competing or fighting with essentially my brother.' ""
In an interview with NPR, another participant, Hussein Dida, says he was surprised to see how much DNA Black Africans shared even with white people.
""I knew that the white and the Black we're all human beings, of course,"" he says. But I thought there is no way we have anything shared with them. Now I've noticed that we share almost everything – just only small differences between us.""
Handley says responses like this upend a widespread assumption that people without formal education who are struggling with poverty wouldn't be all that interested in big picture questions about humankind. ""People are curious about the world. They're curious about themselves,"" says Handley. ""And even I – working there for a long time – didn't give people enough credit for the amount of curiosity there was.""
Indeed another study participant, a middle-aged woman who asked to remain anonymous because she feared that relatives might disapprove of her choice to provide a cheek swab, says she thinks it's important for researchers to continue using her DNA for further studies.
But they need to keep her informed, she adds. After all, she says, ""What I gave is a part of my body.""

IV07469AD1_I9LCPFZ3JHOYAUL,"Suspect in killing of 8 people near Chicago has died in Texas, police say",By The Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 at 8:00 PM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-22/suspect-in-killing-of-8-people-near-chicago-fatally-shot-himself-in-texas-police-say,"Updated January 23, 2024 at 12:13 AM ET
CHICAGO — A man suspected of shooting and killing eight people in suburban Chicago fatally shot himself after a confrontation with law enforcement officials in Texas, police said late Monday.
Police in Joliet, Ill., said on Facebook that at about 8:30 p.m. Central time 23-year-old Romeo Nance was located by U.S. Marshals near Natalia, Texas, and that Nance shot himself after a confrontation.
The Medina County Sheriff's Office in Texas said on Facebook that the agency received a call about a person suspected in the Chicago killings heading into the county on Interstate 35. A standoff then occurred between Nance and police from multiple agencies at a gas station, where Nance shot himself, the sheriff's office said.
Nance is suspected of fatally shooting eight people at three locations in the Chicago suburbs, sparking a search that left neighbors on edge earlier Monday as police warned he was still on the loose and should be considered ""armed and dangerous.""
Police in Will County in Illinois and Joliet previously said they did not know of a motive for the killings, but said Nance knew the victims. The FBI's fugitive task force had been assisting local police in the search for the suspect, Joliet Police Chief William Evans said.
The victims were found Sunday and Monday at three separate residences, authorities told reporters at a news conference earlier Monday evening.
One of the people killed was found Sunday in a home in Will County. Seven others were found Monday at two homes on the same block in Joliet, located about about 6 miles northwest of the scene police discovered first.
Authorities said they also believe Nance was connected to another shooting in Joliet that wounded a man on Sunday but would not discuss their evidence.
""I've been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I've ever been associated with,"" Evans said during a news conference outside the Joliet homes Monday evening.
Will County Chief Deputy Dan Jungles said during the Monday news conference that deputies had been staking out one of the houses since Sunday evening in case Nance, the suspect in the first fatal shooting they discovered, returned to them. Nance's last known address was one of the homes, police said.
When no one showed, deputies finally went to the door of one of the houses. No one answered so they crossed the street to the other house, which they knew was linked to the first house and found the first bodies. Five bodies were found in one house and two bodies were found in the other.
Jungles said he didn't have any indication yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead. He said that autopsies were pending.
Evans said the victims found Monday in the houses were family members. Asked if the victims were members of the suspect's family, Jungles said he couldn't comment except to say that the suspect knew them.
Teresa Smart lives about a block away from where seven of the victims were found and had said she was worried she and her family wouldn't be able to sleep Monday night.
""This is way too close to home,"" she said, adding that police cars had been blocking streets throughout the neighborhood.
""I keep looking out the window and double checking my doors,"" she said. ""It's super scary.""
Joliet Police said in a Facebook post earlier on Monday afternoon that they were investigating ""multiple"" people found dead and shared Nance's photo and images of a vehicle. Authorities identified the vehicle as a red Toyota Camry.
Earlier Monday, the Will County Sheriff's Office shared images of the same car via Facebook and said it had been seen at the scenes of two separate shootings Sunday afternoon.

JHNIZVZL6B_87DGXIJ1KGISVDG,A growing wave of local governments are erasing billions in medical debts,By Yuki Noguchi,"Published January 23, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-23/nyc-joins-a-growing-wave-of-local-governments-erasing-residents-medical-debt,"This week, New York City pledged to pay down $2 billion worth of residents' medical debt. In doing so, it has come around to an innovation that started in with local governments in the Midwest, and is ridding millions of Americans of health care debt.
The idea emerged a couple of years ago in Cook County, Ill., home to Chicago and surrounding towns. Toni Preckwinkle, president of the county board of commissioners, says two staffers came to her with a bold proposal: The county could spend a portion of its federal pandemic rescue funds to relieve residents' medical debt.
The result: In 2022, Cook County became the first local government to partner with RIP Medical Debt, a nonprofit group that uses private donor funds to buy up and pay off health care debts.
RIP's model turns debt collection on its head: Normally, debt collectors buy unpaid bills to then try to collect the owed funds. RIP identifies unpaid hospital bills owed by people making up to four times the federal poverty level, then buys that debt on secondary markets or directly from hospitals at a small fraction of the original value. Instead of trying to collect, RIP forgives it — so it simply disappears for the patients who owe.
In the Chicago area, as it is across the country, medical debt is an ongoing problem, creating mental and financial strain that can follow patients for years. An estimated100 million people in the country carry some form of health care debt.
Preckwinkle says the RIP Medical Debt model dovetailed nicely with Cook County's health care mission. For nearly two centuries, it has funded its own hospital and health system, Cook County Health, in part to provide care to all residents, regardless of income.
""We have a legacy commitment to delivering quality health care to people without regard to their ability to pay,"" Preckwinkle says.
She says that health care mission eats up nearly half of the county's $9.3 billion annual budget. The county is now in the process of spending $12 million — a tiny portion of its budget — to ultimately retire $1 billion worth of hospital bills for residents.
In the year and a half since Cook County announced its program, seven other local governments have followed suit, including Akron, Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio, New Orleans, Wayne County, Mich., Washington, D.C., and now New York City, which announced its commitment Monday.
In comments at the announcement, New York's mayor Eric Adams noted that medical debt disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities who are more likely to be uninsured or under-insured. For the city's low income residents, he said, ""taking on medical debt isn't a choice.""
""Working class families often have to choose between paying their medical bills or some of the basic essentials that they need to go through life,"" he said.
RIP is in talks with 30 additional municipalities and states, including Connecticut, New Jersey and Michigan.
Typically, RIP can retire at least $100 worth of debt for every $1 of government funds, so the local initiatives could end up wiping out several billions in medical debt. The software selects eligible patients who remain anonymous, so it's hard to know what the impact of eliminating that debt might be across a community, or for the families that benefit.

Amber Clapsaddle says having the city of Toledo eliminate a $1,500 medical bill from three years ago has given her hope.
In the past, Clapsaddle says she looked down on those who didn't pay their bills. ""I was like, 'I'll never do that,' and I judged people really hard,"" she says.
Then, several years ago, her entire family of five each got sick with various ailments, requiring numerous surgeries, ultrasounds, and diagnostic tests. She had insurance, but she and her husband, a warehouse worker, couldn't meet the $6,000 deductible. Clapsaddle, a social worker, realized why medical debt is such a prevalent problem: ""It just takes one bill, one bad insurance plan, just one extra diagnosis to have it all fall apart.""
When Toledo's program with RIP forgave some of her family's medical debt two months ago, she cried with joy and relief. She says that motivated her to negotiate with doctors' offices and her insurance company, to try to prevent herself from getting into debt again. ""It's the spark that lights the fire of getting out of medical debt.""
Debt forgiveness is an unusual solution for local governments. But more are taking on medical debt. That's in part because local governments had access to federal pandemic rescue funds through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and RIP Medical Debt offered a quick and easy fix to distribute those funds to those most burdened by medical expenses.
Nationally, medical debt is shown to disproportionately affect people of color and people who earn less. It also contributes to a vicious health cycle, discouraging many patients from seeking preventative or follow-up care, leading to worse and more expensive outcomes.
Cook County's Preckwinkle says the pandemic only deepened racial and income gaps that affect peoples' access to health care.
""I always talk about the fact that medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States,"" she says.

The idea of forgiving medical debt enjoys broad political support, says Allison Sesso, CEO of RIP Medical Debt, perhaps because the issue affects people of all political stripes. She says a recent survey by RIP shows its bipartisan appeal. ""84% of people agreed that it is the responsibility of government to ensure health care is affordable, and that position is held by people on the left and the right.""
Sesso admits debt is only one of many factors contributing to unequal access to health care, and as hospital costs continue to rise, new debts are also piling up perhaps faster than her group is able to retire it. She says RIP hopes to retire $2.5 billion worth of unpaid medical bills through various government initiatives this year, but that's a drop in the bucket of the $195 billion estimated medical debt held by Americans.
""I'm under no illusions,"" Sesso says. ""I don't think what I'm doing is the solution to getting rid of medical debt, writ large."" Medical debt is being created at high rates, she argues, and more policies — such as protecting consumers and strengthening insurance coverage — are needed to prevent medical debt at the source.
The enduring benefit of the recent local government initiatives is that they have helped draw more attention to the problem, raising its profile in useful ways, she says.
""I think the issue of medical debt is becoming a priority, local governments are talking about it,"" she says, and that is leading to other conversations about what else they can do to get more eligible families insured through Medicaid, or through the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace, for example.
It is also inspiring programs like one recently adopted by Milwaukee County, Wis., which is urging more hospitals and health systems to use credit reports to screen and automatically enroll eligible patients in financial assistance programs. These programs already exist to help reduce medical expenses for patients making up to three times the poverty level, but often patients are unaware or not told to apply for them.
By automating the process, as many as 50% more patients may receive free or reduced-cost care, so they have a better chance of avoiding incurring medical debt in the first place, says Shawn Rolland, a member of Milwaukee County's board of supervisors.
""Why make it more difficult than necessary to get enrolled? Because ultimately this will make it more likely that they'll come back for preventative care.""

K1DEIR7OOU_MOPAT0VZJIMHPGP,Why Vice President Harris went to Wisconsin today to talk about abortion,By Deepa Shivaram,"Published January 22, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-22/why-vice-president-harris-is-going-to-wisconsin-today-to-talk-about-abortion,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 3:05 PM ET
Vice President Harris marked the 51st anniversary of landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade on Tuesday by kicking off a tour to draw attention to new restrictions on abortion, laying the blame for them at the feet of former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the race to become the Republican candidate for November's election.
""The former president handpicked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. It is a decision he brags about,"" Harris said in a fiery campaign-style speech. ""How dare he!""
One in three women of reproductive age live in states with abortion bans, Harris said. The post-Roe restrictions are an issue that Democrats hope will fire up voters for the presidential election.
Since the court's Dobbs decision ended Roe, voters have turned out in record numbers in states like Michigan and Kansas to support measures to protect reproductive rights with new laws. It's that energy that Harris is hoping to tap into as she reaches out to voters ahead of the election this year — an election where swing states like Arizona and Nevada may also have ballot initiatives on abortion rights.
""Momentum is on our side,"" Harris said. ""Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, the people of America have voted for freedom.""


Harris plans to hit about five places during the next two months to highlight this issue, including states that have enshrined protections for abortion since the Supreme Court rolled back abortion rights in 2022, states that have restricted access, and states that have threatened to restrict access.
The vice president's team picked Wisconsin's Waukesha County to launch the tour. The politically important state illustrates how people's lives were affected when Roe was struck down.
Wisconsin effectively banned abortion, reverting to a law written in 1849. For about 15 months, there were no legal abortions available in the state.
""In a state whose motto is, 'Forward,' these extremists are trying to take us backward — but we're not having that,"" Harris said.
Wisconsin is also a key swing state that Democrats want to win in November. Former President Donald Trump carried Waukesha County — a suburb of Milwaukee — in 2016 and 2020. But Democrats have made a series of inroads there.
Mini Timmaraju, who leads the organization Reproductive Freedom for All, said voters will keep paying attention to the issue of abortion rights because of how high-stakes it has become for women's health.
""We've had multiple, high-profile abortion access and Dobbs-related crisis stories,"" Timmaraju said. ""Unfortunately, the story's not going away and therefore the saliency of the issue isn't going away.""

On Tuesday, Harris and Biden will appear together at a campaign rally in Northern Virginia, along with their spouses, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff.
The event is counterprogramming for the Republican primary in New Hampshire. The Biden campaign is seeking to draw attention to what Trump and other Republicans have said about abortion, which is one of the most difficult issues Republicans will face with voters.
Democrats in Virginia campaigned on the issue of reproductive rights last year, during state-level elections, and won back control of the state legislature.
It's a rare for Biden to headline an event on reproductive care. While the president has a long voting record of supporting Roe, he has expressed that he personally is opposed to abortion.
""I happen to be a practicing Catholic. I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right,"" Biden said at a fundraiser last June.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, one of the co-chairs of Biden's reelection campaign, said in an interview that aired Sunday that it would help if Biden talked more about abortion rights.
""I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting. And I think he has said that. To use maybe more, you know, blunt language, maybe that would be helpful,"" Whitmer said.

Biden's campaign is featuring the issue in advertising this week with a spot that tells the story of an OB-GYN who had to leave Texas with her family to seek an abortion for a planned pregnancy that put her life at risk. In the ad, Dr. Austin Dennard explicitly blames Trump for his role in overturning abortion rights.
The campaign says the ad will run on channels like HGTV, Bravo, Food Network and Hallmark in an effort to reach suburban women and younger voters, who are critical voting blocs for Democrats.
""This ad serves as a sobering reminder to women across the country of the devastating legacy of Donald Trump's presidency – and a warning of his plans, if elected, to take this anti-abortion crusade even further,"" Biden's campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez said in a statement.

KRVMN7Y1RX_9DLPHTMMCBH76HU,"Ron DeSantis ends his struggling presidential bid before New Hampshire, following Alabama GOP Debate","Alabama Public Radio | By Pat Duggins,","Published January 21, 2024 at 4:26 PM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-21/ron-desantis-ends-his-struggling-presidential-bid-before-new-hampshire,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign—ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump. Alabama Public Radio sought analysis on his political future following the GOP Presidential debate in Tuscaloosa.
The decision leaves Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. This is the scenario Trump's foes in the GOP have long sought, raising the stakes for this week's contest as the party's last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.
Alabama Public Radio covered the Tuscaloosa debate where DeSantis faced off with Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. CNN conducted a follow up debate in Iowa after the event in Alabama but declined to hold a second telecast in New Hampshire. APR spoke with University of Alabama Political Communications Professor A.J. Bauer before DeSantis decided to end his campaign. We asked about whether the Florida Governor and Nikki Haley were trying to pave the way for future campaigns in 2028.
“I hope we have a 2028. I think if Trump gets reelected, that's a question mark. Right,” Bauer asked. “And so I think that, obviously, Haley and DeSantis are young, they both hypothetically have long careers ahead of them, whether they decide to run for president again, or some other office is up to them. I think that one of my big question marks for journalists who keep or outlets that keep running these debates is why are we giving free media to the future political careers of Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, because we're certainly not educating voters in terms of this current election because the voters have already made up their minds.”
But as some Trump critics cheered DeSantis’ decision to endorse Trump — and attacked Haley — in an exit video he posted on social media.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone, through forced smiles.
He continued: ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
Haley fired back during a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as DeSantis announced his decision.
""He ran a great race, he's been a good governor, and we wish him well,"" she told a room packed with supporters and media. ""Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady left.""
DeSantis' decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa, marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Trump's supremacy in the Republican Party.
He entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $130 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses — which he had vowed to win — by 30 percentage points to Trump.
DeSantis' allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.
The Florida governor notified top donors and supporters of his decision through a series of phone conversations and text messages between senior campaign officials to top donors and supporters on Sunday afternoon, according to two people who received such communications. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversations.
DeSantis had returned to Florida by then after a rollercoaster weekend that included stops in New Hampshire and then South Carolina ahead of another scheduled stop in New Hampshire Sunday evening that was ultimately canceled. The campaign also canceled a series of national television experiences earlier in the day, blaming the cancelation on a miscommunication with DeSantis' super PAC.
DeSantis was physically worn after spending weeks on the campaign with little, if any, time off, even as he stormed across frigid Iowa and New Hampshire, often without a winter coat.
He ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Trump given his popularity in the party, despite the deeply personal feud between them.
""While I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,"" said DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida's governor, which ends in January 2027.
The endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for DeSantis, whom Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.
For Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staffers, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy. Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.
DeSantis' team joined Trump in attacking Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape. Some doubt Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head match up between Trump, would benefit from DeSantis' decision.
""She will not be the nominee,"" key DeSantis supporter House member Chip Roy, R-Texas, told AP. ""She will not be the president of the United States.""
Trump had already shifted his focus to Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after DeSantis' announcement, the former president's campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Haley to win New Hampshire.
""Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire — there are only two options,"" wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.
""Option A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,"" they wrote. ""Option B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARRASSED in her home state of South Carolina,"" which votes on February 24.
""Now, for some important advice,"" they continued. ""Choose wisely.""
Trump himself addressed DeSantis' departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.
""We just got some word that one of our opponents, very capable person, is dropping out of the race — Ron DeSantis. And Ron is dropping out and, in doing so, he endorsed us,"" Trump said to cheers, before a ""Trump!"" chant broke out in the room of volunteers.
Asked if he would be using the name ""Ron DeSanctimonious"": ""I said that name is officially retired,"" he said to loud cheers.
At roughly the same time not far away, DeSantis' dejected supporters gathered privately in the Manchester restaurant where he had been scheduled to speak.
House member James Spillane, of Deerfield, said he had initially backed Trump, switched to DeSantis and will now vote for Trump.
""I had a suspicion this morning, and I had talked to some friends of mine saying the way I was hearing things shake out, I thought this was going to happen, and I was right,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, DeSantis is not going to be able to make it forward, however, in the future, hopefully we can have a viable way forward in 2028."""
MV9UFX16ME_V0G6SHVGCEYINKZ,"MAGA or moderate? New Hampshire Republicans decide for their state, and the party",By Franco Ordoñez,"Published January 23, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-23/maga-or-moderate-new-hampshire-republicans-decide-for-their-state-and-the-party,"MANCHESTER, N.H. – When New Hampshire voters head to the polls Tuesday, they will not only be picking a nominee.
Their choice between former President Donald Trump and his former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, will also send a big signal about their feelings on the future of the party.
Luke Rose, a 26-year-old casino dealer, was bowling with co-workers at Yankee Lanes, a downtown Manchester bowling alley. Between turns, he described the way he views the conflict as being between what he calls the ""MAGA idealism"" of Trump and traditional conservative values of Haley.
He's convinced Trump's way will win out.
""The message that will be sent [on Tuesday] is that Trump has officially been chosen. He's the one,"" Rose predicted. ""And beyond that, we have to prepare ourselves, whether we like it or not, for a MAGA America or a Biden America.""
The tightening race has thrown a spotlight on the identity crisis within the Republican party and the debate between populism and small-government conservatism.
Ever since Donald Trump rode down the escalator in Trump Tower, the Republican party has been struggling to figure out what it stood for.
The more establishment, anti-Trump, forces within the party have long been clamoring for this choice, said Alex Conant, who helped lead Senator Marco Rubio's presidential campaign in 2016.
The choice is between Trump who is the embodiment of the new wave of conservative populism and Haley who more represents the limited government wing of the party that also supports strong foreign policy.
Conant acknowledges the party has already moved so far away from its traditional values since Trump's rise.
""The New Hampshire primary is the last hurdle for Donald Trump to demonstrate that the Republican Party is a populist party now,"" Conant said. ""And that the limited government, traditional conservatives that Nikki Haley represents do not have any real power within the party.""
The Trump campaign says there was never any doubt whose party it is.
Jason Miller, a senior advisor on the campaign says Trump has not only unified the base behind him, but he's also brought in new coalition of voters and expanded the party.
""What President Trump has done to show that the populism and working class Americans now side with the Republican Party,"" Miller said.
Phil Palker says he's one of those Americans. The 59-year-transportation worker, and former Coast Guard navigator, says Trump changed the party and he evolved with the former president.
Trump connects with voters like him in a way that no other politicians have before, Palker said.
""You know, I was pretty stagnant Republican,"" he said. ""But ever since Donald Trump started running in 2015, I think his message is revealing to who the party is.""

But in days that followed, Blackstock felt worse; it would take two more E.R. visits before she was diagnosed with appendicitis. Because it took so long for the diagnosis, her appendix ruptured, requiring emergency surgery, followed by a painful recovery that sent her back to the hospital. Later Blackstock was left to wonder: Would her treatment have been different if she weren't Black?
""It really took a few years of processing what had happened for me to recognize that it may have been because I was a young Black woman that this diagnosis got missed,"" Blackstock says.
Blackstock is the founder and CEO of Advancing Health Equity. In her new book, Legacy: A Black Physician Reckons With Racism In Medicine, she explores systemic inequity in health care, tracing its origins back to the beginnings of Western medicine and to her own experiences as a medical student and doctor.
In March 2020, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Blackstock was one of the first medical professionals to raise the alarm that the virus was having a disproportionate impact on minority communities.
""For years, we've been talking about the Black maternal mortality crisis. But in terms of COVID's impact on Black communities, that conversation had not started yet,"" Blackstock says. ""So I wrote my first op-ed on what I was worried about would happen to our communities from COVID within the first two weeks – before the end of March.""
But Blackstock is optimistic about the next generation of Black medical students, who she says are pushing for changes to the existing system.
""With the killing of Mr. George Floyd and Ms. Breonna Taylor ... a lot of medical schools received demand letters from their Black students about what those students thought we should be learning,"" Blackstock says. ""I would say medical schools are on their way. They have a tremendous amount of work to do.""



On her mother, Dr. Dale Gloria Blackstock, who died of leukemia at age 47
My mother was a brilliant woman. She was amazing. She was a trailblazer in her own right. She grew up in central Brooklyn. She had a single mom, she had five siblings, and they grew up in public assistance and so life was always very, very difficult for her. She was the first person in her family to graduate from college and then go on to Harvard Medical School, which is something that she never even probably had thought of as a little girl. But I celebrate her and I celebrate her accomplishments. But I also recognize how both racism and poverty makes the road so much harder, and that there were other brilliant, brilliant children that she grew up with that I'm sure also could have made it to Harvard Medical School and beyond, but did not because of the practices and policies that we have in place that chronically deprive our communities of the resources that they need.
On always wanting to be a doctor because of her mom
This is what happens when you have the most loving mother who is also incredibly well respected by her patients and by her colleagues. So it was sort of like, I think both Oni and I looked at her and said, you know what? We want to be just like her. We also want to be a doctor. And I think also, we were surrounded by Black women physicians: Our pediatrician, all of my mother's friends, on our block we had other Black women physicians. So it was a reality to me. ...
I'm getting a little emotional, but this book is also an opportunity to give her a voice to people who may not have heard of her or have met her. I always say that when people meet [my twin sister] Oni and me that they're meeting our mother, because this woman literally poured blood, sweat and tears into us. I think because she had grown up in poverty, because she was the first to go to college and med school, she wanted a very different life for us than she had for herself. And sometimes I worry. I remember when we turned 18, she said, ""I'm so tired,"" and I don't know if she may have been in the early stages of her illness then, but she said, ""I am so tired. I put so much into you both.""
On how students in medical school are often taught that there is an essential biological difference between Black and white bodies — and how that teaching impacts care
That is sort of the take home-message we get. We're taught that there are different normal values for kidney functions, that Black patients have a certain set of normal values than non-Black patients. We're told that about lung function; that there's a difference between Black patients and non-Black patients. And this isn't something that is necessarily recent. A lot of these beliefs are centuries or decades old. ...
So often you would read a textbook and it would say that the risk factor for diabetes or the risk factor for high blood pressure is race. Race cannot be a risk factor because it's a social construct. What is the factor is racism or the impact of the practices and policies of systemic racism on our communities and on our health. ... A lot of these studies have come out more recently to show that that so-called ""race correction"" factor that is used for kidney function has actually led to a delay in Black patients being referred to for specialty kidney care. Also, it's led to delays in putting them on kidney transplant lists. So it's compromised their care even further. They have not gotten the health care that they need for this chronic and potentially deadly disease. It almost compounds the everyday racism that they face, that there are these beliefs that are inherent within the health care system that prevent them from getting the resources that they need.
On the 1910 Flexner Report, which closed most of the historically Black medical schools in the U.S.
The Flexner Report was a report that was commissioned by the American Medical Association and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation. And essentially they commissioned an educational specialist named Abraham Flexner to go around to the 155 medical schools in the United States and in Canada, and to essentially standardize them, compare them to the standards of Western European medical schools. And so, of course, the Black medical schools, because of the legacy of slavery and the lack of wealth and resources, did not have the resources to remain open. So, essentially, Flexner recommended that five out of seven of those Black medical schools be closed and they were closed, leaving Howard and Meharry. ...
In a study that came out in 2020, in the Journal of American Medical Association, it was estimated that those five schools, if they had remained open, would have trained between 25,000 and 35,000 Black physicians. When I read that, I started crying because that is such a large number of health professionals that could have cared for hundreds of thousands, probably even millions of Black patients, who could have mentored medical students, who could have done research in our communities. And so it is a tremendous loss when you think about the closure of those schools. But it also makes sense when you look at the percentages today of Black physicians. We are less than 6% of all physicians in the U.S. – and that is one of the reasons.
On how the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against affirmative action may impact Black medical students
I compare it to the Flexner Report. So you have a policy that impacts schools, led to the closure of schools, led to that tremendous number of Black physicians not being educated, essentially eras[ing] them. And I thought about the recent SCOTUS decision, it's going to affect academic medical centers, it's going to affect medical schools, and, I think that, long term, if it's going to affect the diversity within medical schools, then we know that ultimately [it] will affect the number of Black physicians. And we are actually more likely to go back to our own communities to care for patients. We are more likely to work in underserved areas. ... We may not see it for generations, but I think that SCOTUS's decision is going to have a long-term impact on Black health, if medical schools and other higher-education institutions are not able to ... have legal workarounds to address those changes in race conscious admissions.
On tangible ways to improve the system
Academic medical centers and medical schools ... need to work on focusing on how to train students and residents to adequately and competently care for a diverse patient population. That is your priority, whether it's in terms of developing curriculum that is focusing on anti-racism, or making sure your faculty understand how to teach in a way that really respects the honor and dignity of all the students that they're teaching and the patients that they're going to serve, or even to policymakers, making them understand that health is in all policies. ... So I tasked different groups, even white health professionals. I said, this is not just our problem. This is not just the problem of your Black colleagues. This is not just the problem of your Black patients. They are dying prematurely. It is up to you also to speak up. It's also up to you, to us to work on behalf of our communities. I think ultimately every health professional would say I want the best for my patients, right? But that is not happening.

PBAF9VYS6S_C2IUU7QWMQZQH7U,"'Hot droughts' are becoming more common in the arid West, new study finds",By Nathan Rott,"Published January 26, 2024 at 4:31 AM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-26/hot-droughts-are-becoming-more-common-in-the-arid-west-new-study-finds,"Take a period of limited rainfall. Add heat. And you have what scientists call a 'hot drought' – dry conditions made more intense by the evaporative power of hotter temperatures.
A new study, published in the journal Science Advances, Wednesday, finds that hot droughts have become more prevalent and severe across the western U.S. as a result of human-caused climate change.
""The frequency of compound warm and dry summers particularly in the last 20 years is unprecedented,"" said Karen King, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
For much of the last 20 years, western North America has been in the grips of a megadrought that's strained crop producers and ecosystems, city planners and water managers. Scientists believe it to be the driest period in the region in at least 1,200 years. They reached that determination, in part, by studying the rings of trees collected from thousands of sites across the Western U.S.
Cross-sections or cores of trees, both living and dead, can offer scientists windows into climate conditions of the past. Dark scars can denote wildfires. Pale rings can indicate insect outbreaks. ""Narrow rings [mean] less water,"" said King, a dendrochronologist, who specialized in tree ring dating. ""Fatter rings, more water.""
Scientists have looked at tree ring widths to understand how much water was in the soil at a given time. King and fellow researchers did something different. They wanted to investigate the density of individual rings to get a picture of historical temperatures. In hotter years, trees build denser cell walls to protect their water.
King collected samples of tree species from mountain ranges around the West, road-tripping from the Sierra Nevada to British Columbia to the southern Rockies. She and her co-authors used those samples and others to reconstruct a history of summer temperatures in the West over the last 500 years.
The tree rings showed that the first two decades of this century were the hottest the southwestern U.S., the Pacific Northwest and parts of Texas and Mexico had experienced during that time. Last year was the hottest year on record globally.
By combining that temperature data with another tree-ring-sourced dataset looking at soil moisture, the researchers showed that today's hotter temperatures – sent soaring by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities – have made the current western megadrought different from its predecessors.
It also suggests that future droughts will be exacerbated by higher temperatures, particularly in the Great Plains, home to one of the world's largest aquifers, and the Colorado River Basin, the source of water for some 40 million people.
""As model simulations show that climate change is projected to substantially increase the severity and occurrence of compound drought and heatwaves across many regions of the world by the end of the 21st century,"" the authors wrote. ""It is clear that anthropogenic drying has only just begun.""

PMMCX5S8K9_XW1NYHC7FVKIAXC,The nitrogen gas execution of an Alabama inmate prompts an international response.,"Alabama Public Radio | By Pat Duggins,","Published January 26, 2024 at 6:00 AM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-26/the-nitrogen-gas-execution-of-an-alabama-inmate-prompts-an-international-response,"The European Union and the U.N. Human Rights Office are expressing regret over the death of convicted killer Kenneth Smith. The EU called the first ever use of nitrogen gas ""particularly cruel."" The U.N. says the death penalty does not deter crime. APR news may be asked to explain to news listeners in eastern Europe how Alabama administers capitol punishment. The news website Dnevnik in Bulgaria’s capitol city of Sofia contacted APR and asked for our input.
The 27-nation European Union and the Geneva-based U.N. rights office say the death penalty violates the right to life. Kenneth Eugene Smith was put to death in Alabama on with pure nitrogen gas, a first-of-its-kind execution that placed the United States at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment. Smith appeared to shake and convulse before being pronounced dead at an Alabama prison after breathing the gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation.
""He was writhing and clearly suffering,"" Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office, said at a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva. ""Rather than looking for novel, untested methods to execute people, let's just bring an end to the death penalty. This is an anachronism that doesn't belong in the 21st century.""
She said the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk, had written to authorities in Alabama about the issue, and said his office will continue to speak out and use ""every tool in our toolbox"" to prevent other states from doing so.
It was the first time a new execution method has been used in the U.S. since 1982, when lethal injections were introduced and later became the most common method.
""According to leading experts, this method is a particularly cruel and unusual punishment,"" the diplomatic service of the EU said in a statement. It also expressed concern that the number of executions in the U.S. increased last year.
""Twenty-four people were executed in five states despite a steady, overall decline of the use of capital punishment in the U.S. since 2020,"" it said. ""We call for states that maintain the death penalty to implement a moratorium and move towards abolition, in line with the worldwide trend."""
PZPCK9BUPO_8TLMFHIOOA3BJ5P,"The FAA lays out a path for Boeing 737 Max 9 to fly again, but new concerns surface",By Joel Rose,"Published January 24, 2024 at 7:18 PM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-01-24/the-faa-lays-out-a-path-for-boeing-737-max-9-to-fly-again-but-new-concerns-surface,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration says Boeing's grounded 737 Max 9 jets can begin flying again after a ""thorough inspection and maintenance process."" But the agency also imposed sweeping jet production restrictions at the company's factories.
It's been nearly three weeks since federal regulators took 171 Boeing aircraft out of service after part of the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines jet blew out at 16,000 feet after departing the Portland International Airport.
""We grounded the Boeing 737-9 MAX within hours of the incident over Portland and made clear this aircraft would not go back into service until it was safe,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement late Wednesday. ""The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase.""
The FAA's announcement comes amid growing questions about quality control at the Boeing factory where the 737 was assembled.
An apparent Boeing whistleblower says that mistakes inside the aerospace giant's plant in Renton, Wash. were likely to blame for the incident. The self-described Boeing employee alleges that four key bolts that are supposed to hold the door in place were never reinstalled after maintenance work before the jet left the factory.
The FAA announcement did not mention those allegations. But the agency has its own concerns about Boeing's production and manufacturing processes.
""This won't be back to business as usual for Boeing,"" Whitaker said, announcing that the FAA would not grant any requests from Boeing to expand production of the Max aircraft, ""until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved.""
The production cap applies to Max 8 and 9 (which are in use around the world) as well as the upcoming smaller Max 7 and larger Max 10 variants. Critics say Boeing has been rushing production to clear a lengthy backlog of orders following a previous grounding of the Max aircraft following a pair of fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 which killed a total of 346 people. Those crashes were blamed on a faulty flight control system on the new planes.
Boeing declined to comment on the whistleblower allegations, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators at the NTSB had previously raised the possibility that the bolts on the door plug panel were not properly installed.
Following the FAA's announcement, Boeing said it would work with regulators and airlines to get the grounded planes back in the air.
""We will continue to cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA and follow their direction as we take action to strengthen safety and quality at Boeing,"" said a statement from Boeing spokesperson Jessica Kowal. ""We will also work closely with our airline customers as they complete the required inspection procedures to safely return their 737-9 airplanes to service.""
United and Alaska Airlines have both been forced to cancel thousands of flights while waiting for this final inspection guidance from regulators and Boeing. On Tuesday, the CEOs of both companies were sharply critical of Boeing in separate interviews.
In a letter to United employees on Wednesday, chief operating officer Toby Enqvist said the company would begin the process of inspecting its fleet of 79 grounded jets.
""We are preparing aircraft to return to scheduled service beginning on Sunday,"" Enqvist said. ""We will only return each MAX 9 aircraft to service once this thorough inspection process is complete.""
Alaska Airlines says the first of its Max 9 aircraft will return to passenger service on Friday.

R9D3AIQ07M_UW1PY2Z3OYD8E7N,Israel says 24 soldiers were killed on its deadliest single day during war in Gaza,By Becky Sullivan,"Published January 23, 2024 at 1:00 PM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-23/israel-says-24-soldiers-were-killed-on-its-deadliest-single-day-during-war-in-gaza,"TEL AVIV, Israel — Twenty-one Israeli reserve soldiers died in a single incident Monday in which two buildings exploded and collapsed on soldiers operating inside after Hamas fired at a nearby tank, the Israeli military said Tuesday.
Another three Israeli soldiers were killed Monday while fighting in southern Gaza, the military said, bringing the day's death toll to 24, the highest number of deaths in a single day for Israel during its war with Hamas.
In total, 221 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion of Gaza in October, according to the military.
""We share in the sorrow of their families for the heavy loss and know that the pain is unbearable,"" said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military's chief of staff. ""On this day, we feel the great and painful cost of war, but that which we are fighting is necessary and justified.""

The deadly incident Monday afternoon occurred near the Gaza-Israel border, where a group of Israeli reservists was ""removing structures and terrorist infrastructure,"" military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement Tuesday.
As a group of soldiers operated inside and around a pair of buildings that had been laid with explosives, militants fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a nearby tank, Hagari said.
""The explosion of the structures was most likely from explosives laid by our forces, which were about to be used for demolishing terror infrastructure and buildings in the area,"" he said. ""Simultaneously, there was an explosion that resulted in the collapse of two two-story structures, while most of the force was inside them and nearby.""
""This war has a very painful and heavy price,"" Hagari added.
Additional soldiers were injured in the collapse.
The military wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its forces destroyed a building and a tank guarding the area.
The conflict has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza, health officials there say. The toll includes both combatants and civilians, the majority of whom are women and children.
Calling Monday ""one of the most difficult days"" since the war began, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military was carrying out a ""thorough inquiry"" into the incident.

The news of Monday's deaths comes as sentiment in Israel about the war is shifting. A small but growing minority of Israelis are speaking out against the war, and thousands participated in a protest in Tel Aviv over the weekend calling for Netanyahu to leave office.
At a funeral Tuesday in the Kiryat Shaul military cemetery outside Tel Aviv, hundreds of people stood in the pouring rain to mourn Ilay Levy, a 24-year-old captain who was killed Monday.
His sister Ori, dressed in military uniform, said in her eulogy that she had enlisted in the army on Monday, hours before she learned her brother had been killed.
""Two days ago, when we spoke on the phone for the last time, you told me, 'Ori, I can't wait to see you in uniform.' So here I am in uniform,"" she said, as her mother wept.
Of the hundreds who attended the funeral, many knew Levy as a family member, friend or fellow soldier. Others had no relation but attended the funeral as a show of support for Levy's family.
Opinions were split about the direction of the war, though funeralgoers were united in their grief over its cost.
""I think we are in a war of no choice,"" said Rami Sherman. ""We want to live here, to stay here. There are a lot of mistakes and problems, but our only way to survive in the crazy world of the Middle East is to stay united.""
Abigail Shir, 24, was a schoolmate of Levy's. ""On the one hand, I still think Hamas needs to be destroyed. But sometimes, I question how the war cabinet is doing, like if they make good decisions for us,"" she said.
""There is a quote in Israel that says, 'It is good to die for our country.' I don't feel like this anymore,"" she added. ""Is it good to die for a country that's not functioning, that celebrates the hate between us?""

ROQBA35UXG_0L830PFJBOR5PVA,New study finds high number of Long COVID cases in Alabama,Alabama Public Radio | By Andrea Tinker,"Published January 22, 2024 at 5:37 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-22/new-study-finds-high-number-of-long-covid-cases-in-alabama,"A new study from Help Advisor shows that Alabama has the third highest number of Long COVID reports in the country. The World Health Organization defines Long COVID as “the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least two months with no other explanation.”
According to the report, nearly 32% of Alabamians who tested positive for COVID-19 experience have also Long COVID symptoms. Christian Worstell, the author of the report, said finding the cause of Long COVID is difficult.
“It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what causes Long COVID. Even the experts aren't entirely sure,” he explained. “It is believed that people who have experienced a more severe case of COVID-19 might develop Long COVID symptoms. Those who had an underlying condition, some sort of respiratory condition that was there prior to the infection, might manifest itself into Long COVID symptoms,” Worstell continued. “Those who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine might be more vulnerable to Long COVID. So, [it’s] difficult to really put your hand on what might it be.”
The report from Help Advisor also found that nearly 34% of those Alabama residents affected by Long COVID report that the symptoms have reduced their ability to carry out daily activities. Worstell said the symptoms can come and go for those affected.
“One of the interesting things is that for a lot of these Long COVID sufferers, sometimes the symptoms will disappear for maybe a week or two at a time, but then they come right back. It seems like the symptoms kind of go dormant and then reappear. So, it may not be necessarily three consecutive months of symptoms. It might be kind of off and on,” Worstell said.
He also said Long COVID can make daily life unpredictable because of the irregularity of when the symptoms begin and end.
“If your symptoms disappear for a week, and you think that you're on the mend, and you're back to normal, and then the next week you get hit with it again… [it] certainly adds a lot of unpredictability into kind of your day-to-day life,” Worstell said.
The report also found that 40% of Alabama residents aged 40-54 who previously had COVID experienced long COVID. The highest percentage of any age group, including those 65 and older.
“40 to 54 age group is one that's very active. Those are people [who] are in the workforce [and] are the ones that often have kids in the household [and] are the ones that are out and about in the community a lot more,” Worstell said. “Those that are 65 and older, they might be retired. They no longer have kids in the house. They're maybe not getting as exposed as someone in a little bit younger demographic. So, I think maybe just the amount of person-to-person close contact [the] 40 to 54 age group have and their day-to-day life is probably contributing to the spread of COVID, and therefore, the long symptoms of it,” he continued.
According to the study, women seem to be more affected by long COVID. 35% of female respondents from Alabama who were previously infected with COVID have experienced symptoms of COVID that persisted for three months or longer. That’s in comparison to 26% of men. Worstell said researchers are unsure what factors are contributing to COVID affecting women more than me.
Worstell said the high rates of people experiencing Long COVID is an indication to him that the pandemic is not over.
“You're talking about something that takes a while to appear and manifest itself and then only then can you begin studying it and unpacking it and auditing that,” he said. “So, I still hear the term ‘post pandemic,’ or you hear people say, ‘We're done with COVID.’ I don't know that we are necessarily,” Worstell continued. “Obviously, we're no longer in the thick of it anymore, but there's still a lot of people [who] are still suffering from this sort of stuff,” he said.

RQB05D4EE9_5AZMM8UQA73GP6R,"Raped, pregnant and in an abortion ban state? Researchers gauge how often it happens",By Selena Simmons-Duffin,"Published January 24, 2024 at 10:02 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-24/raped-pregnant-and-in-an-abortion-ban-state-researchers-gauge-how-often-it-happens,"As an abortion provider in Montana, Dr. Samuel Dickman has seen patients routinely who tell him they became pregnant after a rape. His sense was the patients who were telling him were only a fraction of the true number. ""There are certainly far more survivors of rape who become pregnant as a result, who — for totally understandable reasons — don't want to disclose that fact to a medical provider that they just met.""
Dickman used to live and practice in Texas, and he began to wonder about patients who became pregnant due to rape in states where abortion is no longer an option. (He is also the medical director of Planned Parenthood Montana and a plaintiff in several lawsuits challenging abortion restrictions in Montana.)
He and a group of colleagues have arrived at an answer. They estimate in a research letter published Wednesday in JAMA Internal Medicine that 64,565 pregnancies have been caused by rape in the 14 states where abortion is banned.
The figure, while an estimate that may spark some debate, is an important data point since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Supreme Court decision overturned the federal guarantee of abortion rights. While there once was political consensus that abortion should be permitted in cases of rape, that has changed. Few states with total bans on abortion have exceptions for rape. Those that have exceptions require victims to report the rape to authorities, something that research shows happens only in a small fraction of sexual assaults.

To arrive at the figure of nearly 65,000 rape-caused pregnancies, researchers first estimated the number of rapes that occurred in the states with abortion bans, while those bans were in effect — time periods that vary state-to-state.
""We used the best available research and data that we're aware of to come up with the fraction of women of reproductive age who are survivors of — and the terminology here is horrible — completed vaginal rape,"" Dickman explains. ""The foundation was a survey that the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] conducted that we think is probably the most accurate estimate of not just the sexual assaults that were reported to law enforcement, but also those that weren't reported to law enforcement.""
They then used Bureau of Justice Statistics data on criminal victimization and FBI Uniform Crime Reports to assess the number of vaginal rapes of women, ages 15-45, that happened in those 14 states while abortion bans were in effect. The number they arrived at is approximately 520,000 rapes.
Finally, they calculated that 12.5% of those assaults would result in a pregnancy, based on CDC data. ""These are hard numbers to come up with — there's no kind of systematic collection at the level of health care providers to be able to answer this question of what's the pregnancy rate among people who have been victims of a completed vaginal rape,"" Dickman acknowledges. ""This is kind of the best we could do.""
Their total estimate of pregnancies due to rape in states with abortion bans is 64,565.
Dickman, who is also a researcher at the City University of New York, says he and his colleagues were shocked at the numbers their calculations yielded.
""I was horrified,"" he says. ""Sexual assault is incredibly common — I knew that in a general sense. But to be confronted with these estimates that are so high in states where there's no meaningful abortion access? It's hard to comprehend.""
""Part of why we do research is because when I think about the individual patients, it's too much,"" he says.
Certainly not all of the people who become pregnant due to rape want an abortion, observes Dr. Rachel Perry, a professor of OB-GYN at the University of California, Irvine who was not involved in the study. ""We do know that those who become pregnant after rape are more likely to choose abortion than to continue their pregnancies,"" she says. That would suggest there have been tens of thousands of Americans who wanted an abortion after a rape and had no meaningful access.
In Perry's view, the methods that Dickman and his colleagues used to come up with their estimate were appropriate, given the lack of concrete data on sexual assault and pregnancy. ""Seeing these numbers makes us realize that — even if they aren't exact — it is a huge problem,"" she says.

Samantha Hansen has been an outspoken rape survivor for years, but only recently shared that she became pregnant as a result of the attack. She was a college student at Brigham Young University in 2014, when she was watching Netflix with someone she considered a friend.
""I went into the other room to go pop popcorn,"" she recalls. ""It's my belief that he slipped something into my Coca-Cola, because when I came back and started sipping my Coke, it wasn't too long before I couldn't move a single muscle.""
She doesn't remember the details of the rape. ""The rest of the night is bits and pieces of flashes — and me trying to fight to regain control of my limbs.""
The next day, she took a long shower. ""Then I went through my apartment — anything that was touched that night went in a garbage bag, which then went in the dumpster outside of my apartment,"" she says. Then she took the emergency contraception pill called Plan B. Like many rape survivors, she didn't go to the doctor or report the incident to law enforcement; she just tried to pretend it never happened. In the following weeks, she couldn't sleep, she lost weight, and her grades fell.
Weeks later, she noticed she'd missed her period, and a pregnancy test came back positive, despite having taken Plan B. She went to Planned Parenthood to talk through her options and wrestled with the decision. She had decided to continue the pregnancy but ended up having a miscarriage.
Hansen still lives in Utah. She has written about why she thinks abortion bans without rape exceptions harm rape survivors. Last year, she spoke out against a state bill that would have required rape survivors to file a police report to have access to abortion.
""Having had my autonomy stripped of me that night that I was raped, having the ability to make that choice of — can I take back control of my body and either keep or abort? — was so, so pivotal to my healing,"" she explains.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a few key cases of abortion after rape have become flashpoints. A 10-year-old from Ohio who received an abortion after rape was the center of a political firestorm in Indiana soon after the Dobbs decision. And Hadley Duvall, who was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant when she was 12, appeared in a campaign ad for Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. That ad has been credited with helping Beshear win reelection.
Polling consistently shows that most Americans think that someone who is raped and becomes pregnant should have legal access to an abortion. Duvall is now working with Kentucky lawmakers to add a rape exception to that state's abortion ban.
Yet rape exceptions for abortion laws have fallen out of favor among anti-abortion rights groups, and the majority of states with abortion bans do not include such an exception. Students for Life is an anti-abortion rights group that strongly opposes rape exceptions. In a blog post, the group explains, ""SFLA opposes rape and incest exceptions because we understand that a child is no less worthy of life based upon how they were conceived.""
In a practical sense, abortions after rape would also be difficult to obtain in states that have abortion bans if all clinics providing abortions have closed, which is the case in multiple states.
Samantha Hansen in Utah says she's glad researchers worked to quantify the number of pregnancies from rape in states where abortion is banned.
She says the 65,000 estimate may surprise some people. ""I'm not surprised,"" Hansen says. ""If anything, I'm over here going — it's probably higher.""

Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, died Monday after battling prostate cancer. He was 62. The King Center in Atlanta, which Dexter King served as chairman, said the younger son of the civil rights icon died at his home in Malibu, California. His wife, Leah Weber King, said in a statement that he died ""peacefully in his sleep.""
The third of the Kings' four children, Dexter King was named for the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where his father served as a pastor when the Montgomery bus boycott launched him to national prominence in the wake of the 1955 arrest of Rosa Parks.
Dexter King was just 7 years old when his father was assassinated in April 1968 while supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee.
""He turned that pain into activism, however, and dedicated his life to advancing the dream Martin and Coretta Scott King had for their children"" and others, the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement. He said Dexter King ""left us far too soon.""
Dexter King described the impact his father's killing had on his childhood, and the rest of his life, in a 2004 memoir, ""Growing Up King.""
""Ever since I was seven, I've felt I must be formal,"" he wrote, adding: ""Formality, seriousness, certitude — all these are difficult poses to maintain, even if you're a person with perfect equilibrium, with all the drama life throws at you.""
As an adult, Dexter King bore such a striking resemblance to his famous father that he was cast to portray him in a 2002 TV move about Parks starring Angela Bassett.
He also worked to protect the King family's intellectual property. In addition to serving as chairman of the King Center, he was also president of the King estate.
Dexter King and his siblings, who shared control of the family estate, didn't always agree on how to uphold their parents' legacy.
In one particularly bitter disagreement, the siblings ended up in court after Dexter King and his brother in 2014 sought to sell the Nobel Peace Prize their father was awarded in 1964 along with the civil rights leader's traveling Bible used by President Barack Obama for his second inauguration. Bernice King said she found the notion unthinkable.
The King siblings settled the dispute in 2016 after former President Jimmy Carter served as a mediator. The items were turned over to the brothers, but other terms of the settlement were kept confidential.
Decades earlier, Dexter King made headlines when he publicly declared that he believed James Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty in 1969 to murdering his father, was innocent. They met in 1997 at a Nashville prison amid an unsuccessful push by King family members to have Ray stand trial, hoping the case would reveal evidence of a broader conspiracy.
When Ray said during their prison meeting that he wasn't the killer, Dexter King replied: ""I believe you and my family believes you."" But Ray never got a trial. He died from liver failure the following year.
Dexter King is survived by his wife as well as his older brother, Martin Luther King III; his younger sister, the Rev. Bernice A. King; and a teenage niece, Yolanda Renee King.
Coretta Scott King died in 2006, followed by the Kings' oldest child, Yolanda Denise King, in 2007.
""Words cannot express the heart break I feel from losing another sibling,"" Bernice King said in a statement.
Martin Luther King III said: ""The sudden shock is devastating. It is hard to have the right words at a moment like this. We ask for your prayers at this time for the entire King family.""
A memorial service will be announced later, the King Center said. The family planned a news conference Tuesday in Atlanta."
SZ5PJEUFSP_V8GONTV3259LXIA,"After seeming to bribe Senate hopeful Kari Lake not to run, Arizona GOP chair resigns",KJZZ | By Ben Giles,"Published January 24, 2024 at 3:16 PM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-24/after-seeming-to-bribe-senate-hopeful-kari-lake-not-to-run-arizona-gop-chair-resigns,"The head of the Arizona Republican Party resigned Wednesday following the release of a surreptitiously recorded conversation of him seemingly trying to bribe Kari Lake to stay out of this year's U.S. Senate race.
A 10-minute audio recording, published by the Daily Mail of London on Tuesday, revealed a conversation between Lake, a Trump loyalist who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Arizona in 2022, and Arizona Republican Party Chair Jeff DeWit. In it, DeWit appears to offers Lake various deals — to be put on a company payroll, or financial compensation — in exchange for taking ""a pause for a couple of years"" from running for public office.
""There are very powerful people who want to keep you out, and what they're willing to do is put their money where their mouth is in a big way,"" DeWit said.
It's not illegal, or unheard of, for top party officials to attempt to clear the field of unfavorable candidates in order to pave the way for a preferred alternative. In the audio recording, DeWit raised concerns about Lake's ability to fundraise enough money to win the U.S. Senate race, as well as former President Donald Trump's ability to win another election — and by association, Lake's own electability.
""I'm not even sure Trump can win again,"" DeWit said. ""I don't know that he can win.""
But DeWit also appeared well aware of the optics of attempting to buy off Lake, a MAGA firebrand with a national profile. In the recording, he repeatedly cast himself as a messenger for powerful people ""back East"" and asked for Lake's discretion.
""This conversation never happened,"" DeWit said.
""If you say no, which is fine, it's your choice, don't tell people,"" he added.
In a statement released Wednesday, DeWit accused Lake of being the Daily Mail's unidentified source. He denied he attempted to bribe Lake, and instead characterized the conversation as ""an open, unguarded exchange between friends"" that Lake recorded in a violation of his trust.
DeWit also said the audio recording provided to the Daily Mail was ""selectively edited."" By his own characterization, DeWit was advising Lake to postpone her U.S. Senate campaign and instead focus on running for governor again in 2026.
""It was a suggestion made in good faith, believing it could benefit both her future prospects and the party's overall strategy,"" DeWit said. ""The release of our conversation by Lake confirms a disturbing tendency to exploit private interactions for personal gain.""
DeWit went on to raise concerns that Lake may have a trove of secret recordings from conversations with other GOP officials, including Trump.
""I question how effective a United States Senator can be when they cannot be trusted to engage in private and confidential conversations,"" he said.
Lake made it clear she has more recordings of conversations with DeWit — in his statement, DeWit said Lake issued an ultimatum for him to resign Wednesday or ""face the release of new, more damaging recordings.""
A spokesperson for Lake's U.S. Senate campaign could not immediately be reached for comment. Lake, who has denied that she was the Daily Mail's source, publicly called for DeWit's resignation on Tuesday, telling KTAR that the audio was ""reprehensible.""
The leak of the conversation, which the Daily Mail reported took place in March 2023, comes ahead of a crucial juncture for the Arizona Republican Party. Trump will headline a fundraising rally for the Arizona GOP on Friday, the eve of the party's annual organizing meeting on Saturday.
The party will now have to choose a successor for DeWit, whosetenure as party chair has been marred by financial struggles following repeated statewide losses for the Republican Party under the previous chair, Kelli Ward.
Lake is the leading candidate to win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona, having already secured Trump's endorsement when she announced her candidacy last fall. Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego is vying for his own party's nomination, while it remains unclear if incumbent Sen. Krysten Sinema — a former Democrat turned independent — will run for reelection.

T0X0YZEL24_G1ZCZIPKUH33JCL,Generous gift helps Mobile youth drum corps,Alabama Public Radio | By Lynn Oldshue,"Published January 25, 2024 at 4:05 AM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-25/generous-gift-helps-mobile-youth-drum-corps,"Alabama Public Radio reported last year on the Magnolia Breeze Youth Ensemble. The all-inclusive therapeutic band plays in Mardi Gras parades in the Mobile area. Here’s a follow-up...
Musician Chris Spies and his wife Heather heard APR’s story (from early 2023) and wanted to help. The couple started Wynterfest music festival in memory of Chris’ brother Wynter Banes, a local drummer who passed away in 2021. Spies says they donated proceeds from the festival to buy new drums for Magnolia Breeze in Wynter’s name.
“When they saw these drums and started playing them, everybody knew this was something he really would've enjoyed being a part of,” said Spies. “And he had a disabled daughter that he adopted when he got married.
A disabled kids marching band with drums is the most Wynter thing ever to help them out. When I found out they were having to borrow stuff, it just all seemed perfect.
Band director LaDarral Bell says the donation means a lot to the young artists.
“That love offering, I mean, it just means everything because the children couldn't afford to buy those instruments on their own,” said Bell. “It has been a struggle just to get some of the kids uniforms.
Bell created the Magnolia Breeze Youth Ensemble when she realized students with disabilities were being turned away from traditional bands, and therapeutic activities were hard to find in Mobile. She chose drumline since drums were the only instrument she played. Sarah Fair is the drum major for Magnolia Breeze. The ensemble was once one of her favorite parts of Mardi Gras parades, but she had never touched an instrument and didn’t think she could join. Then a friend invited her to a practice. Sarah signed up and learned how to play the drums. Now she leads the band
“I literally love Mardi Gras, but being in it is a whole different thing,” Fair told APR in 2023. “I take it on with a lot of pride. I take on Mardi Gras when I hit the streets and put on that red. This is my show now. It's me and my band, and we are the stars. And it feels like a blessing for real. Not a lot of people are as fortunate as we are to be in a band like this.”
Now, the Magnolia Breeze drumline and dancers march at parades and events throughout the year, but Mardi Gras is their favorite. Their uniform colors are red, black, and white, representing love and music. Donor Chris Spies says their next goal is raising money for the Magnolia Breeze to march at Universal Studios."
TZYYLMEIDG_W9V5SV9I61USB9M,Alabama plans to carry out first nitrogen gas execution. What are the risks?,Alabama Public Radio | By Associated Press,"Published January 22, 2024 at 7:15 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-22/alabama-plans-to-carry-out-first-nitrogen-gas-execution-what-are-the-risks,"Alabama is preparing to use a new method of execution: nitrogen gas. Kenneth Eugene Smith, who survived the state's previous attempt to put him to death by lethal injection in 2022, is scheduled to be put to death Thursday by nitrogen hypoxia. If carried out, it would the first new method of execution since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
The state maintains that nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness quickly but critics have likened the never-used method of execution to human experimentation.
WHAT IS NITROGEN HYPOXIA?
Nitrogen hypoxia execution would cause death by forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen, depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.
HAS IT EVER BEEN USED?
No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state — along with Oklahoma and Mississippi — to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find.
HOW IS IT SUPPOSED TO WORK?
Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, makes up 78% of the air inhaled by humans and is harmless when breathed with proper levels of oxygen.
The theory behind nitrogen hypoxia is that changing the composition of the air to 100% nitrogen will cause Smith to lose consciousness and then die from lack of oxygen.
Much of what is recorded in medical journals about death from nitrogen exposure comes from industrial accidents — where nitrogen leaks or mix-ups have killed workers — and suicide attempts.
WHAT DOES THE STATE PLAN TO DO?
After Smith is strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber, the state said in a court filing that it will place a ""NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator"" — a type of mask typically used in industrial settings to deliver life-preserving oxygen — over Smith's face.
The warden will then read the death warrant and ask Smith if he has any last words before activating ""the nitrogen hypoxia system"" from another room. The nitrogen gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or ""five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,"" according to the state protocol.
The state heavily redacted sections of the protocol related to the storage and testing of the gas system.
The Alabama attorney general's office told a federal judge that the nitrogen gas will ""cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes.""
WHAT ARE THE CRITICISMS?
Smith's attorneys say the state is seeking to make him the ""test subject"" for a novel execution method.
They have argued that the mask the state plans to use is not air tight and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, possibly leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council earlier this month cautioned that, in their view, the execution method would violate the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia can be an acceptable method of euthanasia under certain conditions for pigs but not for other mammals because it creates an ""anoxic environment that is distressing for some species.""
IS THIS THE SAME AS THE GAS CHAMBER?
Not exactly. Some states previously used hydrogen cyanide gas, a lethal gas, for executions. The last prisoner to be executed in a U.S. gas chamber was Walter LaGrand, the second of two German brothers sentenced to death for killing a bank manager in 1982 in southern Arizona. It took LaGrand 18 minutes to die in 1999.
WHO IS THE INMATE?
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife. Prosecutors said Smith and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect insurance money.
Alabama attempted to execute Smith in 2022 by lethal injection. He was strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber being prepared for lethal injection, but the state called off the lethal injection when execution team members had difficulty connecting the second of two required intravenous lines to Smith's veins. Smith was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours, according to his lawyers, as he waited to see if the execution would go forward.
ARE THERE LEGAL CHALLENGES?
The question of whether the execution can proceed will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Friday in Smith's request to block the execution. After the court rules, either side could appeal.
Smith has argued that the state's proposed procedures violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He has also argued that Alabama violated his due process rights by scheduling the execution when he has pending appeals and that the face mask will interfere with is ability to pray.
In a separate case, Smith is arguing it would violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment for the state to make a second attempt to execute him after he already survived one execution attempt. Lawyers for Smith on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to consider that question.
WHAT IS POTENTIALLY AT STAKE?
Lethal injection is the most commonly used execution method in the United States, but death penalty states have struggled at times to obtain the needed drugs or encountered other problems in connecting intravenous lines.
If the Alabama execution goes forward, other states may seek to start to using nitrogen gas.
If the execution is blocked by the court or botched, it could halt or slow the pursuit of nitrogen gas as an alternative execution method."
U6LVQZ1OHI_6AP96TTQI0NGE1P,NPR names tech executive Katherine Maher to lead in turbulent era,By David Folkenflik,"Published January 24, 2024 at 11:03 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-01-24/npr-names-tech-executive-katherine-maher-to-lead-in-turbulent-era,"NPR has selected former Wikimedia Foundation chief Katherine Maher to lead the network through an era of declining broadcast listenership, financial uncertainty and technological turbulence.
In an interview ahead of the announcement of her appointment, Maher said her experience at the foundation underscores the importance of NPR's mission to serve the public independently of commercial interest. ""There is a strong alignment in both of those organizations around integrity and autonomy,"" Maher said.
Maher said she intends to build on the fierce loyalty instilled in many listeners for NPR's news programs and everything else. (She said she cringes at the word ""content."")
And Maher said she will work to expand the pool of people who experience that deep attachment.
""It's about matching need and delight so people have a real desire to keep coming back, to engage with what it is that we offer,"" Maher said.
The appointment of Maher, 40, as NPR's 12th permanent chief executive and president represents an embrace of a generational shift, with firm roots in the digital age. She has sought to promote the free flow of information as a tool of expanding democracy in her work in tech and international affairs. She started her career in finance.
Maher has never worked directly in journalism or at a news organization. That stands in contrast to many of her predecessors at NPR, including current CEO John Lansing, and her freshly appointed counterparts at CNN and the Washington Post.
NPR board chair Jennifer Ferro, who led the search committee, said Maher offers visionary corporate leadership and proven fundraising strengths. And she cited Maher's ability to serve as a forceful ambassador for the network, including to the hundreds of public radio member stations and on their behalf.
""NPR is a powerhouse, and it needs to be more ubiquitous,"" says Ferro, the president of public radio station KCRW in Santa Monica, Calif. ""We need to build that brand up.""
Ferro says the network, which is a nonprofit corporation, needs a proven leader who will commit to the position for an extended tenure. (With Maher, NPR has cycled through 10 permanent and acting chiefs in the past 20 years.)
And Ferro notes that Maher worked to help shape Wikipedia into a trusted organization that shares similar values with NPR, such as broad access to information and democracy.
Maher will start at NPR in late March.

In the interview, Maher said she was first exposed to NPR because her parents listened in the car – and it helped determine the course of her life.
As a Connecticut high schooler in 2000, Maher recalled, she was intrigued by the peace summit involving top Israeli and Palestinian leaders that had been convened by then President Bill Clinton. But she couldn't find out enough from teachers to satisfy her interest.
Listening to longtime NPR foreign correspondent Deborah Amos' dispatches from the Middle East transfixed Maher. After graduation, she moved to Cairo to study Arabic. She also spent time in Syria and other countries throughout the region.
""I've seen what it means ... when people fight for their rights, for access to information, for self-determination,"" Maher said. ""I don't think I would be sitting here with you today if it weren't for my driveway moment, which is that drive to school every day.""
She joined the Wikimedia Foundation's communications team in 2014 and became its CEO two years later. There, Maher built up a significant endowment — $140 million — to support Wikipedia's promise to ""unlock the world's knowledge.""
Maher said she learned at Wikimedia the power of massive, small-scale support.
""A huge amount of people [were] giving $2 to $3 in support of that mission. And that allowed for us to make decisions about what we cared about, that were not always in step with what the market would care about,"" Maher said. ""And it allowed us to resist external pressure when we need to do so. It allowed for us to be able to fight for our values, even if they were not going to immediately return on new audience growth.""
After leaving Wikimedia in 2021, Maher joined a bevy of boards because, she said, she wanted to learn more about governance. She has resigned from an advisory board at the U.S. State Department to take the NPR job. She said she intends to keep serving on the boards of the nonprofit Consumer Reports and the Signal Foundation, which supports the secure messaging app relied upon by journalists and dissidents abroad.

With layoffs and podcast cancellations brought on by a projected revenue shortfall, 2023 was a rough year for NPR. Lansing announced last fall he would be stepping down early, months ahead of the end of his five-year contract, but would stay until a successor was named. He cited a desire to travel with his wife while his daughter was studying abroad.
Yet Lansing had a string of seeming successes, building the network's priorities around what he called its ""North Star"": making sure NPR's program and staff better reflected the full texture of America. From the time of his arrival in fall 2019, Lansing argued that reflected both a moral and a strategic imperative.
NPR has become notably more diverse. More than 4 out of every 10 staffers are not white. Sixteen percent are Black — a higher proportion than the percent in the U.S. population.
Even as the music publication Pitchforkhas vanished — folded into GQ magazine by its corporate owners — NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts and its music podcasts have emerged as more vital than ever among artists and millions of listeners and viewers.
NPR's tentpole programs, Morning Edition and All Things Considered, are the nation's top two radio news and talk broadcast shows. It is the country's third-biggest producer of podcasts. During Lansing's tenure, NPR earned its first Pulitzer Prize for ""No Compromise,"" a collaboration with member stations.

Despite its recent achievements, NPR's audiences have declined and its financial standing has faltered in the past two years. The network suffered a sharp and unexpected drop in podcasting revenues driven by fears of an economic collapse that has not materialized. It was compelled to lay off 10% of its staff. NPR canceled four podcasts. Lansing's candor enabled trust that he had built with top officials at NPR's largest union to endure.
In that financial crisis, which Lansing termed ""existential,"" NPR did not stand alone. It turned out the network was on the front end of a media recession that has tripped up many of its peers; The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times ultimately reduced their ranks by an even higher proportion. The L.A. Times newsroom has shrunk by a third over the past eight months.
The pressures helped fuel turnover at NPR's top ranks: NPR's chief operating officer, finance officer, human resources officer and top programming executive have left over the past eight months. Not all have been replaced.
Lansing said the network is now on a firm financial footing.
Lansing, now 66, arrived at NPR with a rich history in media and journalism, having arisen through local television newsrooms to lead Scripps' cable television channels and websites. He later led the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the government outfit that oversees federally funded international broadcasters such as the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and others.

In October, Maher stepped in to become chief executive of the Web Summit — think of it as a tech-heavy Davos – at which tech entrepreneurs, investors and thought leaders meet in Portugal.
Web Summit's founder had stepped down over outcry about his remarks about Israel after the Hamas attacks.
On the podcast Masters of Scale, Maher said she saw that as a moment of crisis.
""The biggest distinction that I was looking at was, is this a company in crisis or is this a company going through a crisis? I've seen both, and I've worked in both. And the latter is, you enter into something that has fairly solid bones, and it's about: how do you steer through that moment?""
Maher does not consider NPR as an institution in crisis. Rather, she says, she sees challenges and opportunities.
""I recognize that coming in there will be both a need to move relatively quickly to ensure that the organization has all of its pieces in place and also a need to be thoughtful about how to do that,"" she said.
Among Maher's most critical tasks will be hiring a chief content officer over the newsroom, podcasts and other programming. NPR's top news executive, Edith Chapin, currently holds the content position on an interim basis.
Even so, Maher visibly blanched at the word ""content,"" calling it ""an empty vessel."" She suggested she would figure out another title ""that speaks more deeply to our mission.""

U9HK602S47_NED858YUTV7IIXZ,'Fiddler on the Roof' director Norman Jewison dies at 97,By Fred Wasser,"Published January 22, 2024 at 3:53 PM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/arts-life/2024-01-22/fiddler-on-the-roof-director-norman-jewison-dies-at-97,"From the race drama In the Heat of the Night to the musical Fiddler on the Roof, Canadian-born director Norman Jewison defied categorization. He has died at the age of 97.
Jewison started his career in television. He was producing and directing a TV special when he caught the attention of actor Tony Curtis. ""You do nice work, kid,"" Curtis recalled in his 2005 autobiography. ""When are you gonna make a movie?"" Not long after that encounter, Jewison directed Curtis in the 1962 comedy 40 Pounds of Trouble. Other comedies followed, with Doris Day, James Garner and Rock Hudson. Those were all studio assignments, but Jewison soon started making his own films, including 1965's The Cincinnati Kid, starring Steve McQueen, and a 1966 spoof of Cold War politics called The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!, starring Alan Arkin.
Jewison was born in Toronto and served in the Canadian navy during World War II. As he told NPR in 2011, he was on leave toward the end of the war — only 18 years old and in uniform — when he got on a bus in Memphis, Tenn.:
""It was a hot, hot day, and I saw a window open at the back so I headed to the back of the bus. And I sat down with my bag and by the open window. The bus driver looked at me, and I could see his face in the mirror. He says, 'Are you trying to be funny, sailor?' He says, 'Can't you read the sign?' And there was a little sign and it said, 'Colored people to the rear.' ""
Jewison looked around and saw that he was the only white passenger in the back. ""I was just a kid, but I was kind of shocked,"" he said. ""I thought, well, the only thing I could do is get off the bus."" It was his first experience with racial prejudice and, he says, it laid the groundwork for 1967's In the Heat of the Night. That film starred Rod Steiger as small town Mississippi police chief and Sidney Poitier as a visitor to the town who is accused of murder. It won five Oscars, including Best Picture.
Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin remembers seeing In the Heat of the Night when it first came out. He says, ""This film caught lightning in a bottle... By casting Poitier and Steiger as adversaries who have to work together, have to find some way to work together in a Southern town, it just set things up so perfectly for character development against a backdrop that certainly all Americans could relate to.""
Jewison followed In the Heat of the Night with the 1968 hit thriller The Thomas Crown Affair, starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, but his biggest hit came in 1971 with Fiddler on the Roof. By then, Jewison had a successful track record. Still, when United Artists approached him to direct Fiddler on the Roof, it took Jewison a minute to figure out why.
""I've got a strange name,"" he said in his 2011 NPR interview. ""Jewison. If you look at it closely, it kind of looks like I'm the son of a Jew. And I thought, Oh, my God. They think I'm Jewish. What am I going to do? Because how can you direct Fiddler on the Roof if you're not Jewish? So, I guess I have to tell them.""
He got the job anyway, and the film won three Oscars. It was as different from any of Jewison's previous films as it could be. Leonard Maltin says that's what makes Jewison worth remembering.
""You can't easily pigeonhole Norman Jewison because he didn't want to be pigeonholed,"" Maltin says. ""There is no one identifiable Norman Jewison kind of film. The same man who made [the romantic comedy] Moonstruck made Fiddler on the Roof and The Thomas Crown Affair and a couple of good Doris Day movies back in the '60s and [the World War II drama] A Soldier's Story. Those are all Norman Jewison films.""

UMMUJOZT22_RCUDT3FOFH0PC90,Deadline approaching for Alabama college students to apply for ocean exploration internships,Alabama Public Radio | By APR Staff,"Published January 26, 2024 at 4:05 AM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-26/deadline-approaching-for-alabama-college-students-to-apply-for-ocean-exploration-internships,"Internship opportunity deadlines for Alabama college students interested in ocean exploration through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are fast approaching. NOAA Ocean Exploration, a federal program dedicated to exploring the deep ocean, is offering paid internship opportunities this summer for current college students and recent graduates through its Explorer-in-Training Program.
The curriculum is billed to equip the next generation of ocean explorers with an understanding of the marine environment and the necessary skills to meet demands of the ocean exploration workforce.
“The NOAA is very important… They're watching the weather and satellite observations,” said Mark Berte, the executive director of the Alabama Coastal Foundation. “They also oversee our fisheries. So, it’s a very important part of our federal government.”
The Explorer-in-Training program offers multiple internships themes for interns to take part in reflecting NOAA’s expertise, work products and services. According to the organization’s website, these themes are designed to be interdisciplinary and reflect the office’s main focus areas while providing training in critical ocean exploration mission fields. Available 2024 themes include:
Ocean Mapping (offshore, expedition-based, 2 to 4-week internship):
· With less than 25% of the world ocean’s seafloor mapped to modern standards, seafloor mapping is a national and international priority. Contributing to seafloor mapping efforts on NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer is an integral part of NOAA Ocean Exploration’s mission, providing critical bathymetric data needed to achieve a baseline understanding of previously unexplored areas.
· As part of the team conducting mapping operations, Explorers-in-Training will be directly responsible for making sure that incoming data accurately represents the true seafloor. This includes monitoring data acquisition, defining instrument and sound speed processing settings, and cleaning raw data with support from experienced ocean mappers.
· Beyond seafloor mapping, Explorers-in-Training will also gain tangible skills in the use of geographic information system (GIS) software and data management, as well as learning what it’s like to live aboard a research vessel for multiple weeks out at sea and work with a team of colleagues from all different backgrounds.
NOAA advises that applicants for this opportunity should have a strong interest in oceanography, GIS, and/or ocean mapping. The 2024 field season will take place in the central Pacific Ocean and will require travel to Hawaii. The offered stipend is $208 per day plus travel reimbursement.
Ocean Exploration Science & Technology (shore-based, 10-week internships):
· Exploration often leads to discoveries that highlight areas, features, resources, and/or processes that are new to ocean science and need further study.
· To accomplish these discoveries, NOAA Ocean Exploration promotes the innovative use of existing technologies while investing in new technologies that will help to better understand deepwater areas and more effectively target future research efforts.
· Explorers-in-Training will gain understanding of ocean exploration technologies and tangible skills in the application of these technologies to the office’s scientific priorities.
There are three projects available for Summer 2024 in this internship theme. They include underwater cultural heritage and maritime archaeology, photogrammetry data processing and historic preservation and lastly, emerging technologies in the deep ocean. More details can be found here. The offered stiped for each project is a $6,000 honorarium.
There are four requirements that applicants must meet to be eligible for the 2024 Explorer-in-Training application:
· U.S. citizenship
· Currently enrolled students (undergraduate or graduate) or recent graduates who completed their degree programs the previous year; must be enrolled in or have received a degree from an accredited academic institution.
· Degree, major, or intent to major in a field relevant to NOAA Ocean Exploration’s mission; these can include, but are not limited to: science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, social sciences, communications, education, and/or ocean policy/management
· Willingness to learn and follow NOAA Ocean Exploration’s office and shipboard standard operating procedures.
This year, the Explorer-in-Training Program will feature two internship options: (a) 2 to 4-week expedition-based opportunities and (b) 10-week opportunities.
Applicants only apply to one internship program (i.e., any one of the 10-week internships or the 2 to 4-week ocean mapping internship). The application requirements are as follows:
· Submission of online application form

UNC3WPLSE9_C9OFRTARLJIYN96,Supreme Court sides with Biden administration in Texas border razor-wire case,By Washington desk,"Published January 22, 2024 at 2:10 PM CST",20240123,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-22/supreme-court-sides-with-biden-administration-in-texas-border-razor-wire-case,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 3:17 PM ET
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote, granted the Biden administration's request to vacate the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals' injunction in a case involving razor wire placed along Texas' border with Mexico.
The move paves the way for federal officials to remove the wire.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
Texas has maintained that it needs to act on the border because the federal government has failed to stem the tide of migrants crossing from Mexico.
Gov. Greg Abbott launched a controversial state-led, border security effort called""Operation Lone Star"" in 2021. Since then, Texas has installed razor wire, afloating barrier in the Rio Grande, and added thousands of Texas state troopers and National Guard soldiers to patrol parts of the state's 1,254 mile long border with Mexico.
Earlier this month, the Biden administration turned to the Supreme Courtover the installation of razor wire on the northern banks of the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass. That came after the state sued the administration in October, claiming federal agents were destroying state property and preventing Texas National Guard and Department of Public Safety officers from securing the border.
A federal judge ruled in the Biden administration's favor, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals later decided the judge misunderstood a law that spells out what the federal government can be sued for.
On Monday, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, allowing federal agents to cut through portions of the wire if they deem it necessary.

UNVJWH6AM1_2IE8RMP1Z74TF08,New Hampshire may be Nikki Haley's last chance to keep presidential hopes alive,"By Tamara Keith,","Published January 22, 2024 at 4:00 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-22/new-hampshire-may-be-nikki-haleys-last-chance-to-keep-presidential-hopes-alive,"Tuesday's New Hampshire primary could be one of the last chances for a truly competitive race for the Republican nomination. Although it is only the second primary in a months-long nominating process, Nikki Haley is now the only major candidate left challenging former President Donald Trump.
""It's now one fella and one lady left,"" Haley said Sunday, telling her supporters Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had dropped out.
A couple of days earlier at Grill 603 in Milford, N.H., the former South Carolina governor delivered her now-familiar pitch that she is the most electable Republican in the race.
""If you look there was a poll that came out today: Trump is down by 7 points,"" she said, pausing long enough for the crowd to begin to clap. But she had to clarify. ""Well, this is against Joe Biden, by the way. Trump is down by 7 points. And I beat Biden.""
It's not clear which poll she was referring to, though she was talking about a hypothetical general election result and not the primary. There aren't any public polls showing her ahead of Trump in New Hampshire. At multiple daily events in the leadup to the primary, Haley has tried to connect one on one with potential supporters, including 10-year-old Hadley Craig.
After some small talk about how fifth grade is going (good) and Craig's favorite subject (P.E.), Haley turned serious.
""You know what, it's all about being strong, all right?"" Haley told Hadley. ""And when you feel those scary feelings inside, just push through it.""
That message has a lot in common with how Haley is conducting her campaign.
""I have told you from the very beginning and been very consistent: I said I wanted to be strong in Iowa. I feel like we did that,"" Haley snapped back at reporters when asked about her path to victory.
Rather than predicting victory in the Granite State, Haley is going with a less concrete metric of success.
""We want to be stronger in New Hampshire. We're gonna do that,"" she said. ""We won't know what stronger is until the numbers come in.""
""And then I want to be stronger than that in South Carolina.""

New Hampshire represents Haley's best and possibly last chance for a truly strong performance against Trump. Independent voters in the state are allowed to vote in the GOP primary and the electorate is more moderate and less MAGA.
Case in point is Hadley's dad, Tyler Craig, a software executive from Amherst, N.H.
""I one hundred percent think that she has a shot,"" said Craig about Haley.
That is, he said, ""If enough Republicans and independents get a sense of sanity back and are less interested in drama and just pettiness. We're tired of pettiness. And that's what Nikki Haley would take away from where we are today.""
Craig, a Republican, insists that he likes Haley as a candidate — and not just because he's anti-Trump.
But Warren Witherell is one of plenty of people at Haley's events who fall into the latter category.
""I really feel that somebody has to stop Trump and she's a likely candidate,"" said Witherell, a retired engineer from Keene.
Turn on a TV in New Hampshire, and you'll see the state's popular Republican governor, Chris Sununu, making that argument on repeat.
🚨 SFA Fund, Inc. released a new ad titled, ""Watching,"" featuring Governor Chris Sununu and his wholehearted endorsement of Nikki Haley. Since the race has narrowed to a two-person contest, Haley is the only candidate who can project American strength amidst the chaos of Joe… pic.twitter.com/8JCiZKNPzo
""And now we have a chance to reset the election for our entire country,"" he says. ""Nikki is the only one who can beat Donald Trump to move America forward.""
That is among the $31 million in ads Haley and her allied super PACs have run in New Hampshire — more than $5 million of it in the past week, according to an NPR analysis of data from the tracking firm Ad Impact. Trump and his allies have spent about half as much.

As she closes out her campaign in New Hampshire, Haley is imploring voters to give her a chance to prevent a Biden-Trump rematch few in America seem to really want.
""Do you want to be scared in November or not?"" she asks in a call and response near the end of her stump speech. ""Do you want your kids to be proud in November or not? Then let's do it.""
Teacher Julie Lemieux is backing Haley in the primary but worries she doesn't have much of a chance outside of moderate New Hampshire.
""Well, look at what happened in Iowa,"" she said, of Haley's third place finish.
She doesn't want to vote for Trump — she thinks he's too far on the right — but Lemieux can't see herself voting for Biden.
""It seems like it's going down party lines if it's gonna be Biden or Trump,"" she said. ""And I don't think anyone feels that great about those choices. But this is what we got. But maybe not.""
Even if winning New Hampshire weren't a reach, Ben Ginsberg, a retired Republican attorney who is a leading expert on the nominating process, says the deck is already stacked against her.
""This race is effectively over,"" he explained of the delegate math. ""I mean, even if Nikki Haley can win in New Hampshire, she'll still have a real uphill slog. And she'll have to win, absolutely have to win her home state of South Carolina at the end of February.""
And right now she's trailing badly in polls of South Carolina voters.
Ginsberg says no Republican candidate has won the nomination without their home state. But Haley insists she knows how to win in South Carolina and will have plenty of time to build up momentum. Trump is angling to knock her out before she ever gets that chance. He's already saying it's time to unify the Republican Party: behind the front runner, of course.

UP5782I66I_PBZORE2VG2FI3TQ,The colonoscopies were free but the 'surgical trays' came with $600 price tags,"Kaiser Health News | By Samantha Liss,","Published January 25, 2024 at 4:01 AM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-25/the-colonoscopies-were-free-but-the-surgical-trays-came-with-600-price-tags,"Chantal Panozzo and her husband followed their primary care doctors' orders last year after they both turned 45, now the recommended age to start screening for colorectal cancer. They scheduled their first routine colonoscopies a few months apart.
Panozzo said she was excited to get a colonoscopy, of all things, because it meant free care. The couple run a business out of their suburban home near Chicago and purchase coverage costing more than $1,400 each month for their family of four on the state's health insurance exchange, which was created by the Affordable Care Act.
By law, preventive services — including routine colonoscopies — are available at zero cost to patients. So Panozzo said she expected their screenings would be fully covered.
""This was our chance to get our free preventative care,"" she said.
Their results came back normal, she said.
Then the bills came.
The patients: Chantal Panozzo, who uses her maiden name professionally, now 46, and Brian Opyd, 45, are covered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois.
Medical services: Two routine colonoscopies (one for him, one for her), as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for patients beginning at age 45.
Service provider: Illinois Gastroenterology Group in Hinsdale. The practice is part of the private equity-backed GI Alliance, which has more than 800 gastroenterologists working in 15 states, including Florida, Missouri, and Texas.
Total bill: For each colonoscopy, the gastroenterology group charged $2,034 before any insurance discounts or reductions. After discounts, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois said it was responsible for paying $395.18 for Brian's screening and $389.24 for Chantal's.
But apart from the screening costs, the total included a $600 charge for each patient — though initial insurance documents did not identify what the charge was for. This left Chantal and Brian each with a $250 bill, the amount allowed by BCBS of Illinois, which was applied to their deductibles.
What gives: Panozzo and her husband's experience exposes a loophole in the law meant to guarantee zero-cost preventive services: Health care providers may bill how they choose as long as they abide by their contracts with insurance — including for whatever goods or services they choose to list, and in ways that could leave patients with unexpected bills for ""free"" care.
After their screenings, Panozzo said she and her husband each saw the same strange $600 charge from the Illinois Gastroenterology Group on their insurance explanation of benefits statements. Bills from the gastroenterology group explained these charges were for ""surgical supplies."" Her insurer eventually told her the codes were for ""surgical trays.""
At first, she was confused, Panozzo said: Why were they receiving any bills at all?
The Affordable Care Act requires preventive care services to be fully covered without any cost sharing imposed on patients — procedures such as colonoscopies, mammograms, and cervical cancer checks.
Policymakers included this hallmark protection because, for many patients, cost can deter them from seeking care. A KFF poll in 2022 found that roughly 4 in 10 adults skipped or postponed care they needed due to cost concerns.
Under the law, though, it is the insurer's responsibility to make preventive care available at zero-cost to patients. Providers may exploit this loophole, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
""The insurance company is supposed to pay the full claim, but there is no requirement on the provider to code the claim correctly,"" Corlette said.
In this case, BCBS of Illinois covered the full cost of the screenings the couple received, according to its own documents. But those documents also showed that each patient was on the hook for a portion of their separate, $600 charges.
Panozzo thought a phone call with her insurer, BCBS of Illinois, would quickly fix the mistake. But she said she spent most of her time on hold and could not get an answer as to why the colonoscopy came with a separate charge for supplies. She said she learned in later communications with her insurer that the $600 was specifically for ""surgical trays.""
BCBS of Illinois declined to comment despite receiving a waiver authorizing the insurer to discuss the case.
Panozzo said that she called the gastroenterology practice and was told by a billing representative that the extra charge was part of an arrangement the practice has with BCBS: She recalled being told that the practice was accustomed to keying in a billing code for ""surgical trays"" in lieu of a separate fee, which was described to Panozzo as a ""use cost"" for the doctor's office.
""I was getting a different story from any person I talked to,"" Panozzo said.
She said she was stuck in ""no man's land,"" with each side telling her the other was responsible for removing the charge.
The resolution: Panozzo went wide with her objections, contesting the total $500 they owed by filing appeals with her insurer; lodging a complaint with the Illinois Department of Insurance; and writing to her elected officials, warning that Illinois consumers were being ""taken advantage of"" and ""ripped off.""
Ultimately, BCBS approved both appeals, saying neither Panozzo nor her husband was expected to pay the charges.
An administrative employee reached by phone at the Illinois Gastroenterology Group location where the couple was treated said they could not comment and directed KFF Health News to contact an executive with GI Alliance, the national group that manages the practice. Neither the executive nor media relations representatives responded to multiple requests for comment.
Panozzo said that, in the past, she would have paid the bill to avoid wasting time haggling with the doctor, insurer, or both. But getting hit with the same bill twice? That was too much for her to accept, she said.
""If change is ever going to happen, I need to stop accepting some of these bills that I knew were potentially incorrect,"" Panozzo said.
The takeaway: Medical providers have broad leeway to determine how they bill for care, including by deciding how to identify what goods or services were provided. This means patients may get stuck with charges for unfamiliar or downright bizarre things.
And because the law doesn't address how providers bill patients for preventive services, odd charges can crop up even for care that should be fully covered.
Research also shows private equity ownership, which has been increasing in specialties like gastroenterology, can lead to higher costs for patients, as well as lower quality care.
For patients, ""under federal law, there is no recourse,"" Corlette said.
State regulatory bodies may go after these providers for billing patients for covered services, but that can be a mixed bag, Corlette said.
Insurers should crack down on this kind of practice with the providers participating in their networks, Corlette said. Otherwise, patients are stuck in the middle, left to contest what should be ""free"" care — and at the mercy of the insurance appeals process.
Health plans may not catch billing oddities — after all, for a major insurer, a charge of $600 may not be worth investigating. That leaves patients ultimately responsible for keeping track of what they're being asked to pay — and speaking up if something seems suspicious.
Panozzo said the experience left her feeling defeated, exhausted, and distrustful of America's health care system.
Having lived abroad with her family for almost 10 years, she said, ""I could function in a health care system in German better than I could here in English.""

V4DXVJICJQ_LF1FRAZL0C938MV,A top U.N. court says Gaza genocide is 'plausible' but does not order cease-fire,By Fatima Al-Kassab,"Published January 26, 2024 at 7:58 AM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-26/a-top-u-n-court-says-gaza-genocide-is-plausible-but-does-not-order-cease-fire,"Updated January 26, 2024 at 2:38 PM ET
LONDON — The International Court of Justice has found it is ""plausible"" that Israel has committed acts that violate the Genocide Convention. In a provisional order delivered by the court's president, Joan Donoghue, the court said Israel must ensure ""with immediate effect"" that its forces not commit any of the acts prohibited by the convention.
Donoghue said the court cannot make a final determination right now on whether Israel is guilty of genocide. But she said that given the deteriorating situation in Gaza, the court has jurisdiction to order measures to protect Gaza's population from further risk of genocide.
Donoghue outlined the provisional measures and how each judge voted. The court voted 15-2 on the order that Israel must take all measures in its power to stop anything in relation to genocide in Gaza. By 16 votes to 1, the court voted that Israel needs to take all measures within its powers to prevent and punish those involved with inciting genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Also by a 16-1 vote, the court said that Israel must take ""immediate and effective"" measures to ensure the provision of urgently needed humanitarian aid and basic services.
The court also ordered Israel to take effective measures to prevent destruction and ensure preservation of any evidence related to the charge of genocide. The court gave Israel 30 days to report back on measures taken.
In a video released by his office after the court's decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ""Like every country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself. The vile attempt to deny Israel this fundamental right is blatant discrimination against the Jewish state, and it was justly rejected. ... We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people.""
Before delivering the decision, Donoghue read statements from Israeli officials that she said made South Africa's case plausible. She also gave a bleak assessment of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.
""In the Court's view, the facts and circumstances mentioned above are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible. This is the case with respect to the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts,"" the court decision said.
The Palestinian Authority's Foreign Ministry issued a statement welcoming the ruling, thanking South Africa and saying, ""The ICJ judges assessed the facts and the law. They ruled in favor of humanity and international law. ... No state is above the law.""
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an address, ""The Palestinian people's cries for justice have been heeded by an eminent organ of the United Nations.""
Since former President Nelson Mandela's administration, South Africa has long supported the Palestinian cause, saying it sees echoes of apartheid in the situation between the Israelis and Palestinians.
""We, as South Africans, will not be passive bystanders and watch the crimes that were visited upon us being perpetrated elsewhere,"" Ramaphosa said Friday. He noted the ICJ affirmed South Africa's right to take Israel to court, ""even though it is not a party to the conflict in Gaza.""
South Africa brought the genocide complaint to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, in December. During two days of hearings from both sides this month, South Africa asked the court to issue provisional measures that would require Israel to immediately halt its assault on Gaza.
Friday's provisional order from the ICJ is not a verdict on South Africa's allegation of genocide — that judgment is not expected for years. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide and has called it ""baseless.""
Although the court's ruling is legally binding, it is not enforceable. ""Nobody will stop us — not The Hague,"" Netanyahu said in a speech after hearings earlier this month, before Friday's ruling.
However, this order may put pressure on Israel's allies and military backers — including the U.S., which on Friday reiterated its position that the genocide allegations are ""unfounded.""
In a statement, the State Department said, ""We have consistently made clear that Israel must take all possible steps to minimize civilian harm, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and address dehumanizing rhetoric.""
The statement said it noted that ""the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a cease-fire in its ruling and that it called for the unconditional, immediate release of all hostages being held by Hamas.""
This is only the second time a state has tried to litigate a charge of genocide against another. In 2019, Gambia took Myanmar to the ICJ, accusing it of a genocide against the Rohingya. In that case, the court approved emergency measures to protect Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority, which Myanmar ignored.

Two weeks ago, in nearly three hours of testimony, lawyers and experts on behalf of South Africa presented evidence arguing that Israel's bombardment of the Gaza strip — which has now continued for more than 100 days — has gone beyond a war on Hamas and become a war on all 2 million Palestinians besieged in the Gaza Strip.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 26,000 people — approximately 1% of the prewar population — according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's offensive is in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
""This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life,"" South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the court of Israel's military campaign.
Hassim presented a list of alleged ""genocidal acts"" that she accused Israel of perpetrating against Palestinians in Gaza. This included what she called the ""mass"" and indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians, food blockades and the wholesale destruction of Gaza's health care system and infrastructure.
Hassim said the Israeli military dropped 2,000-pound bombs onto areas declared safe by Israel, including refugee camps.
As a result, she said, more than 1,800 families in Gaza have lost multiple family members and 85% of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to flee their homes.
""It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared, not even newborn babies. The scale of Palestinian child killings in Gaza is such that United Nations chiefs have described it as 'a graveyard for children,'"" Hassim said.
""Entire multigenerational families will be obliterated,"" Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, an Irish lawyer who is supporting South Africa's legal team, told the court. She warned that yet more children would be orphaned by what she called ""Israel's genocidal assault on the Palestinian population in Gaza.""
She said that Israel's actions in Gaza have led to the need for a new term, ""WCNSF: wounded child, no surviving family.""
Hassim told the court that ""genocides are never declared in advance"" but that Israel's actions over the past three months showed a ""systematic pattern of conduct"" that, she argued, was enough proof of genocidal intent.
The South African legal team also argued that genocidal intent is shown not only in the way in which Israel has conducted its campaign in Gaza but also in comments made by Israeli officials and leaders, including Netanyahu, the prime minister.
Another lawyer in the South African delegation, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, pointed to a comment that Netanyahu made in late October, when he urged Israeli soldiers to ""remember what Amalek has done to you."" Ngcukaitobi said that this was a reference to a biblical command calling for the destruction of an entire group.
""The destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza is articulated state policy,"" Ngcukaitobi added.

Israel in turn accused South Africa of presenting a ""profoundly distorted"" view of hostilities, arguing that its view was ""barely distinguishable"" from that of Hamas.
Israel presented its defense at the ICJ a day after the court heard South Africa's case. In Israel's opening statement, lawyer Tal Becker said that Hamas was to blame — directly or indirectly — for Palestinian civilian deaths.
Becker called South Africa's application to the court to issue a provisional measure ordering a cease-fire an ""unconscionable request"" that ""seeks to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself.""
The Israeli presentation acknowledged the suffering of civilians in Gaza but insisted Israel had no genocidal intent. The high civilian death toll, Israel argued, was the consequence of Hamas waging war among noncombatants.
Becker told the court that it was ""impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza without appreciating the nature of the threat that Israel is facing.""
""If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated against Israel,"" he said, referring to the stated goal of Hamas to destroy the Jewish state.

V7Z1OL9C8Y_LRW7MCLK8XX6W4L,"Union membership grew last year, but only 10% of U.S. workers belong to a union",By Andrea Hsu,"Published January 23, 2024 at 10:30 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/business-education/2024-01-23/union-membership-grew-last-year-but-only-10-of-u-s-workers-belong-to-a-union,"Amid a burst of enthusiasm and energy amid high-profile strikes, labor unions added 139,000 members last year.
But the overall numbers tell a different story.
Due to rapid growth in nonunion jobs in 2023, the share of U.S. workers who are union members actually fell slightly, according to new numbers from the Labor Department.
Just 10% of the U.S. workforce belonged to unions in 2023, down from 10.1% in 2022. That's the lowest in Labor Department records dating back to 1983.

The gains in union membership in 2023 were driven entirely by workers under the age of 45, says Heidi Shierholz, president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
""I think that does point to a shift that may be a more lasting shift... in interest and popularity of unions,"" says Shierholz.
Union membership has seen a steady decline over decades. In the 1950s, about a third of the private sector workforce was unionized, according to the White House. In 2023, only 6% of private sector workers belonged to unions.
While union membership remains far more common among public sector workers, Shierholz notes that public sector unions lost members in 2023, while unions in the private sector grew.


The United Auto Workers, fresh off wins at the bargaining table, is hoping to recover some of the steep losses in union auto jobs over the decades with organizing pushes at foreign-owned auto plants in the South and at Tesla in California.
It won't be easy. Already, the UAW says workers handing out union flyers and t-shirts have faced harassment, leading the union to file unfair labor practice charges with federal labor authorities.
Labor organizing drives at Amazon and Starbucks illustrate how long and difficult a process unionizing can be. Since big union election wins in 2022, both campaigns have been mired in legal battles.
Shierholz says weaknesses in labor law are responsible for the significant gap between the number of workers who are represented by unions and those who want to be represented by unions but aren't.
""That gap is labor law not truly protecting workers' right to organize,"" she says, noting that employers face little more than a slap on the wrist for violating that right.

Unions do appear to be winning public sentiment. Support for labor unions remains near a 60-year high, according to Gallup, with 67% of respondents ""approving"" of labor unions in 2023.
Six in 10 respondents said they believe unions help rather than hurt the U.S. economy, a record high.
But while 17% of respondents told Gallup they're ""highly interested"" in joining a union, six in 10 said they are ""not interested at all,"" perhaps contributing to the lack of growth in union membership.
Among workers who are already members of a union, appreciation for that membership is on the rise. In 2023, five in 10 rated their union membership as ""extremely important,"" up from four in 10 the year before.
Gallup predicts that deeper commitment among union members combined with strong public support will likely strengthen unions for the foreseeable future.

During two days of hearings from both sides this month, South Africa asked the court to issue provisional measures that would require Israel to immediately halt its assault on Gaza.
Friday's provisional order from the ICJ is not a verdict on South Africa's allegation of genocide — that judgment is not expected for years. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide and has called it ""baseless.""
Although the court's ruling is legally binding, it is not enforceable. ""Nobody will stop us — not The Hague,"" Netanyahu said in a speech after hearings earlier this month, before Friday's ruling.
However, this order may put pressure on Israel's allies and military backers — including the U.S., which on Friday reiterated its position that the genocide allegations are ""unfounded.""
In a statement, the State Department said, ""We have consistently made clear that Israel must take all possible steps to minimize civilian harm, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and address dehumanizing rhetoric.""
The statement said it noted that ""the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a cease-fire in its ruling and that it called for the unconditional, immediate release of all hostages being held by Hamas.""
This is only the second time a state has tried to litigate a charge of genocide against another. In 2019, Gambia took Myanmar to the ICJ, accusing it of a genocide against the Rohingya. In that case, the court approved emergency measures to protect Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority, which Myanmar ignored.

Two weeks ago, in nearly three hours of testimony, lawyers and experts on behalf of South Africa presented evidence arguing that Israel's bombardment of the Gaza strip — which has now continued for more than 100 days — has gone beyond a war on Hamas and become a war on all 2 million Palestinians besieged in the Gaza Strip.
Israel's bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 26,000 people — approximately 1% of the prewar population — according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's offensive is in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
""This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life,"" South African lawyer Adila Hassim told the court of Israel's military campaign.
Hassim presented a list of alleged ""genocidal acts"" that she accused Israel of perpetrating against Palestinians in Gaza. This included what she called the ""mass"" and indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians, food blockades and the wholesale destruction of Gaza's health care system and infrastructure.
Hassim said the Israeli military dropped 2,000-pound bombs onto areas declared safe by Israel, including refugee camps.
As a result, she said, more than 1,800 families in Gaza have lost multiple family members and 85% of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to flee their homes.
""It is inflicted deliberately. No one is spared, not even newborn babies. The scale of Palestinian child killings in Gaza is such that United Nations chiefs have described it as 'a graveyard for children,'"" Hassim said.
""Entire multigenerational families will be obliterated,"" Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, an Irish lawyer who is supporting South Africa's legal team, told the court. She warned that yet more children would be orphaned by what she called ""Israel's genocidal assault on the Palestinian population in Gaza.""
She said that Israel's actions in Gaza have led to the need for a new term, ""WCNSF: wounded child, no surviving family.""
Hassim told the court that ""genocides are never declared in advance"" but that Israel's actions over the past three months showed a ""systematic pattern of conduct"" that, she argued, was enough proof of genocidal intent.
The South African legal team also argued that genocidal intent is shown not only in the way in which Israel has conducted its campaign in Gaza but also in comments made by Israeli officials and leaders, including Netanyahu, the prime minister.
Another lawyer in the South African delegation, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, pointed to a comment that Netanyahu made in late October, when he urged Israeli soldiers to ""remember what Amalek has done to you."" Ngcukaitobi said that this was a reference to a biblical command calling for the destruction of an entire group.
""The destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza is articulated state policy,"" Ngcukaitobi added.

Israel in turn accused South Africa of presenting a ""profoundly distorted"" view of hostilities, arguing that its view was ""barely distinguishable"" from that of Hamas.
Israel presented its defense at the ICJ a day after the court heard South Africa's case. In Israel's opening statement, lawyer Tal Becker said that Hamas was to blame — directly or indirectly — for Palestinian civilian deaths.
Becker called South Africa's application to the court to issue a provisional measure ordering a cease-fire an ""unconscionable request"" that ""seeks to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself.""
The Israeli presentation acknowledged the suffering of civilians in Gaza but insisted Israel had no genocidal intent. The high civilian death toll, Israel argued, was the consequence of Hamas waging war among noncombatants.
Becker told the court that it was ""impossible to understand the armed conflict in Gaza without appreciating the nature of the threat that Israel is facing.""
""If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated against Israel,"" he said, referring to the stated goal of Hamas to destroy the Jewish state.

XJ0A83GQKQ_UJALYWEP8ODGBP1,Ex-Trump adviser Peter Navarro sentenced to 4 months for contempt of Congress,By Ryan Lucas,"Published January 25, 2024 at 11:51 AM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/politics-government/2024-01-25/ex-trump-adviser-peter-navarro-sentenced-to-4-months-for-contempt-of-congress,"Former Trump White House official Peter Navarro was sentenced Thursday to four months in prison for contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack.
Navarro, who served as a trade adviser in the Trump administration, was convicted in September of two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents and testimony related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
He is the second former Trump insider to be convicted and sentenced for contempt of Congress. Steve Bannon was found guilty in 2022 of the same charges and sentenced to four months in prison. Bannon has appealed his conviction.
""You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution. You are not,"" Judge Amit Mehta told Navarro as he announced the sentence. ""You have received every process you are due. Every process.""
""Your obligation as an American is to cooperate with Congress, to provide them with the information they were seeking,"" Mehta added. ""They have a job to do, and you made it harder. It's really that simple. It wasn't a kangaroo court. The public could see that.""
In addition to the four-month sentence, Mehta also ordered Navarro to pay a $9,500 fine.
Prosecutors had asked the court for a six-month sentence.
At Thursday's hearing, prosecutor John Crabb argued that Navarro ""believes he is above the law.""
""The defendant brazenly defied Congress,"" Crabb said. ""The behavior cannot be countenanced.""
The defense, which has argued that executive privilege shielded Navarro from having to testify or produce documents to the committee, had asked for probation. They are expected to appeal his conviction.
Navarro was not expected to speak at his sentencing, but ultimately did—against his attorneys wishes.
He told the court that when he received the congressional subpoena he had ""an honest belief that the [executive] privilege had been invoked.""
He said the House committee should have either called former President Donald Trump or his attorneys to confirm it, or the panel should have told Navarro that there was a dispute about executive privilege.
""If they wanted the information, one phone call. That's it. We wouldn't be here,"" Navarro said. ""And if the lesson of this proceeding going forward is get a letter, get a lawyer, there's no need for this harsh punishment.""
His attorney, Stanley Woodward, echoed that point, saying: ""He need not be punished to prove a point. He acted the way he did because he thought he was duty-bound to do it.""
""Forever more, presidential advisers will see this case as an advertisement of what not to do,"" Woodward added.
Ahead of trial, Judge Mehta denied Navarro's executive privilege line of defense, ruling that Navarro had not established that Trump directed Navarro not to cooperate or invoked executive privilege.
Mehta reiterated that point Thursday, saying that Navarro presented no evidence to confirm that Trump had invoked the privilege regarding Navarro.
At last year's trial, the jury heard testimony from just three witnesses, none of them for the defense.

XP7XWIE2VY_1MFLX4TPJGHCZ5M,"In Washington state, pharmacists are poised to start prescribing abortion drugs",By Patrick Adams,"Published January 22, 2024 at 10:31 AM CST",20240122,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/science-health/2024-01-22/in-washington-state-pharmacists-are-poised-to-start-prescribing-abortion-drugs,"Over the past several months, a handful of community pharmacies in states where abortion remains legal have begun to take advantage of a new rule that allows them to fill prescriptions for the abortion pill mifepristone. Prior to the rule change, which was finalized last January by the Food and Drug Administration, pregnant people had to get the drug directly from their doctor or by mail if using telemedicine, depending on the laws in their state.
Reproductive health experts have said relaxing that requirement could help ease the growing burden on abortion clinics in states where abortion is legal. And perhaps nowhere is the potential for that greater than in Washington state, where efforts are underway to open up access to medication abortion in a radical new way: by training pharmacists not only to dispense abortion pills but also to prescribe them to their walk-in patients.
""We think this could have a huge impact in our state,"" says Don Downing, a professor emeritus of clinical pharmacy at the University of Washington in Seattle. Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of abortions in the U.S.
Last spring, Downing and colleagues launched the Pharmacy Abortion Access Project to provide community pharmacists in Washington with training on screening for medication abortion eligibility, prescribing abortion pills, and dispensing them from their brick-and-mortar stores — a streamlined model of care that currently exists nowhere else in the United States.
""This is about meeting women where they are,"" says Downing, adding that close to 90% of Americans live within 5 miles of a community pharmacy and that patients visit their pharmacist almost twice as frequently as they visit their primary care physician. ""We do believe this can serve as a model for other states.""
And it may be more than a matter of physical access. Pharmacists are consistently rated among the most trusted health care providers, he says. ""So we think there may be people — possibly many people — for whom it's too frightening, too stigmatizing to go to a doctor but who, as we've seen over the years, are very comfortable coming to us.""
There are 10 pharmacists in the first cohort, and Downing expects them to start prescribing in the next few weeks. But word is spreading, he says. More and more calls are coming in. And Downing frequently finds himself explaining how a law passed more than 40 years ago first opened the way for this model, by making it possible for pharmacists in Washington to prescribe any FDA-approved drug.

In 1979, Washington became the first state in the nation to enact legislation allowing for the formation of collaborative practice agreements, or CPAs. Under the agreements, a licensed prescriber such as a physician or a nurse practitioner can delegate to a pharmacist the authority to prescribe a given drug and administer it to patients.
This step opened the way for pharmacists to expand their scope of practice in Washington — and Downing has spent his career working to expand it further.
As a doctoral student in the mid-1970s, Downing was part of a growing push led by the Indian Health Service to use pharmacists to reach underserved communities. Concerned about the low immunization rates among Native Americans long neglected by the federal government, he helped Native activists in Seattle build the country's first urban tribal clinic. After graduating, he went to work with other tribes, serving as a pharmacist medical provider on reservations throughout the region.
Those experiences opened Downing's eyes to the vast inequities in access to basic health services — and the untapped potential for pharmacists to help close that gap. In the early 1990s, he and colleague Jackie Gardner, a professor of epidemiology at UW, began training community pharmacists to administer flu shots and other vaccines, leading to the launch of the first formalized training program in 1994. Today, pharmacists in all 50 states routinely administer vaccines.
Following that success, Downing, Gardner and other colleagues at UW partnered with the nonprofit PATH to develop the nation's first pharmacist-provided emergency contraception program. At the time, women who needed emergency contraception had to schedule a doctor's appointment, which often meant taking time off from work or school, finding transportation and arranging for child care. ""We knew there was unmet demand,"" says Downing. ""But we had no idea how much.""
When the pilot project started in 1998, they had hoped to reach about 1,500 women, he says, ""and we thought we were being optimistic."" By the end of the following year, they'd enrolled close to 12,000, with pharmacists in Washington writing more prescriptions for emergency contraception in a single month than the state's doctors had written in the previous year.
Emergency contraception is now over-the-counter, but having pharmacists prescribe it was an important step, says Elisa Wells, a co-founder of the abortion rights group Plan C, who helped start the project while working at PATH. ""And for something like emergency contraception, where there's a clock ticking — and this is true for abortion as well — that convenience is crucial.""
Downing also worked for years to get pharmacists reimbursed for these clinical services by insurers. Finally, in 2015, Washington's Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law making Washington the first state in the nation to formally recognize pharmacists as medical providers and require that they not be excluded from health insurance provider networks.
""That allowed pharmacists in Washington to function at the full extent of their licensure and training,"" said Jenny Arnold, chief executive officer of the Washington State Pharmacy Association, noting that pharmacists today typically complete a doctorate degree and many go on to do residencies. ""There's a lot more they can do than just make sure the patient gets the right meds in the bottle.""
And yet in many states, she says, pharmacists are still greatly underutilized. While all states now allow pharmacists to enter into a collaborative practice agreement, most limit pharmacists' prescriptive authority to certain patients, circumstances or types of drugs. Washington's law governing CPAs is one of the broadest and most flexible, allowing the clinicians themselves to decide what to prescribe and to whom.
In Washington, nearly every pharmacist is signed onto a CPA, says Arnold. In addition to prescribing contraceptives and giving flu shots, many pharmacists have long played a lead role in managing chronic conditions — everything from heart disease and hypertension to diabetes, depression and pain. ""Pharmacists are very integrated into their communities,"" she says. ""They're open on evenings, weekends and holidays, and oftentimes you don't need an appointment to see one.""

That doesn't mean every pharmacist in Washington is going to start prescribing abortion pills, Arnold says.
For one, many say they lack sufficient knowledge of medication abortion, which is not covered by pharmacy school curricula. That's where Downing's training program fills a gap, guiding pharmacists through a ""no-test"" protocol designed for evaluating patients remotely, without the need for ultrasound, pelvic exam or bloodwork. The protocol includes guidelines for appropriate patient selection, treatment regimen and follow-up care, and it excludes patients with symptoms of, or risk factors for, ectopic pregnancy.
The largest U.S. study of no-test screening for medication abortion to date found it to be safe and effective, with outcomes similar to those for patients who received in-person care.
There are several administrative hurdles, too — both for the pharmacist and the pharmacy that employs them.
While the FDA now allows retail pharmacies to dispense mifepristone, it also requires those pharmacies to undergo a new certification process. Currently, just one pharmacy in Washington is known to have been certified. But major pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens say they continue to work through the required steps. A spokesperson for Walgreens told NPR that the company is ""finalizing the certification process to dispense mifepristone"" and ""expects to begin dispensing soon, consistent with federal and state laws.""
To become certified, a pharmacy must meet a number of regulations related to record-keeping, adverse-event reporting and more. Pharmacies must also appoint a representative to ensure mifepristone is distributed in compliance with the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies program, or REMS, the stringent set of rules by which the agency regulates certain drugs.
Among them is the requirement that doctors and other health care providers —including pharmacists — who wish to prescribe mifepristone first register with one of the two licensed manufacturers.
That requirement has long been a significant barrier for primary care physicians, particularly those who work for religiously affiliated health systems. Indeed, though they've been capable of prescribing mifepristone since its approval in 2000, just a small fraction of family physicians and other clinicians currently offer medication abortion.
In Washington state, most primary care is provided by Catholic-owned or federally funded clinics — and for both of these, ""the REMS makes it very difficult for a provider to 'register' to prescribe,"" says Emily Godfrey, a professor of family medicine and of obstetrics and gynecology at UW and the principal investigator for Access, Delivered, a project that helps primary care providers integrate telehealth medication abortion into their clinical practice. ""And of course, pharmacists at these institutions would face the same hurdles.""

Nevertheless, interest in pharmacist-led provision of medication abortion appears to be growing, and not only in Washington. A bill pending in the New York State Assembly would grant pharmacists the authority to provide abortion medications under a ""standing order"" or non-patient specific prescription — the same way pharmacists administer vaccines and dispense naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal drug.
And in California, researchers at the University of California, San Diego recently reported the results of a proof-of-concept pilot study in which a pair of pharmacists safely and effectively provided medication abortions under the study protocol.
""We want pharmacists to be able to practice in the current environment, but we also want to train them to be ready for what's coming five years from now,"" in terms of expanded scope of practice, says Sally Rafie, the founder of Birth Control Pharmacist and a co-author of the study. Last spring, Rafie and colleagues published the results of a survey study of more than 900 pharmacists and pharmacy students in California that found that 75% ""would be willing to prescribe abortion medications to their pharmacy clients if allowed by law.""
A limited number of pharmacists in California may already be legally allowed to prescribe mifepristone if they've gotten an advanced practice certification. Rafie says she's hopeful that in the future the state may establish a pathway for all pharmacists to prescribe the drug.


Meanwhile, a serious legal challenge to the FDA's nearly 25-year-old approval of mifepristone continues to threaten access to the drug across the country.
The Supreme Court is considering whether the FDA may be required to roll back changes it had made in recent years to make the drug more accessible, including allowing it to be sent through the mail and prescribed by health care providers who are not physicians.
Until the Supreme Court issues a decision later this year, mifepristone remains available under the current rules.
""Medication abortion is extremely safe and extremely effective,"" said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and a chair of the Society of Family Planning's #WeCount project, an ongoing tally of abortions in the U.S.
In October, Upadhyay and colleagues reported that despite abortion bans in 14 states and new limits imposed in seven others, the past year saw a slight uptick in abortions across the country, with major increases in states where abortion remains legal.
""All of the moves made to shore up access in the legal states — things like expanding insurance coverage of abortion, more protections for providers and building up the telehealth infrastructure — are having a real impact,"" she says. Pharmacist prescribing of mifepristone puts the drug a step closer to over-the-counter, she adds. ""It's one stop. And to be able to get your medication the same day, to not have to wait for it to come in the mail — that is huge.""

XXJZ82GTNE_UH34NVCH0I0OZVH,Alabama’s nitrogen hypoxia execution plan considered experimental,"Alabama Public Radio | By Pat Duggins,","Published January 24, 2024 at 4:15 AM CST",20240124,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-24/alabamas-nitrogen-hypoxia-execution-plan-considered-experimental,"Alabama is just over a day away from the first ever execution using nitrogen gas. Kenneth Eugene Smith is on death row for the murder for hire of a preacher’s wife in 1988. The State wants to use a face mask on the inmate to pump in nitrogen until he dies of suffocation. Alabama claims the process is painless. The non-profit, non-partisan, criminal justice journalism organization The Marshall Project calls it experimental. Staff writer spokesman Maurice Chammah says tests on animals are a concern…
“We know that rats who have been exposed to nitrogen are often shown really kind of having really adverse reaction really panicking, and kind of flipping out in various ways,” Chammah said. “We also know that some people who have had nitrogen, you know, affect them will vomit, will start to fix the eight may even go into a seizure or, you know, a coma, persistent vegetative state.”
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife. Prosecutors said the men were paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett, 45, on behalf of her husband, who wanted to collect on insurance. The coroner testified Sennett was stabbed repeatedly. Her husband killed himself when he became a suspect. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted, was executed in 2010. Smith's initial conviction was overturned. He was convicted again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge sentenced Smith to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury's sentencing decision in death penalty cases. APR covered this issue in its national award winning investigation “…and justice for all.”
Smith is one of few people to survive a prior execution attempt. The state attempted a lethal injection in 2022, but the prison system called it off before the drugs were administered because the staff had difficulty connecting the two required intravenous lines. Maurice Chammah, staff writer with The Marshall Project, says no one knows if nitrogen hypoxia is cruel and unusual because it’s never been done before.
“I mean, the lawyers on both sides of the case have argued about how the risks make it cruel, unusual. But the nature of execution methods like this is that before they're tested, you kind of can't know what will go wrong, you can just speculate the likelihood of things going wrong,” Chammah contends.
The execution would be the first attempt to use a new method since lethal injection was introduced in 1982. Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. Some states are exploring new methods as lethal injection drugs have been difficult to find.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable euthanasia method for most mammals because the anoxic environment ""is distressing."" And experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture."
ZJ7GXF5ZXE_V8Z5WTCXPWL7IBI,Voting begins in tiny Tuvalu in election that reverberates from China to Australia,By The Associated Press,"Published January 25, 2024 at 10:50 PM CST",20240126,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/2024-01-25/voting-begins-in-tiny-tuvalu-in-election-that-reverberates-from-china-to-australia,"SYDNEY — Voting started Friday in the tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, in a national election that could reverberate from China to Australia.
With just over 11,500 people, Tuvalu is one of the smallest nations in the world, but the election for the 16-seat parliament was being closely watched. After the vote count, parliamentary negotiations will form a new government and elect the prime minister. Polls opened at 8 a.m. and were to close at 4 p.m.
Prime Minister Kausea Natano is running again, but even reelection to parliament won't guarantee him the top post.
Finance Minister Seve Paeniu is challenging him, and opposition leader Enele Sopoaga is hoping to again be prime minister, after losing out to Natano after the 2019 election.
The elections come as China, the United States and others wrangle for influence in the strategically crucial region.
Tuvalu, a British colony until 1978, is one of only 12 countries that have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own territory.
But China has been pushing those Taiwan allies to switch their alliance. Natano has so far rebuffed Beijing, but that could change after this election. Nauru, another small Pacific nation, recently switched its support from Taiwan to China.
Paeniu has said he wants to review Tuvalu's relationships with both Taiwan and China.
Global warming is another big issue, as Tuvalu's low-lying atolls routinely flood.
A proposed security treaty between Tuvalu and Australia could also hang in the balance. The treaty commits Australia to help Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, health pandemics and military aggression. The treaty gives also Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country, including China.
Debate on the treaty has been divisive and it has yet to be ratified. Sopoaga has said he would reject it.

ZN9MIEUSCS_NGC5RBEC2RQHLJX,U.S. Supreme Court rejects stay for Alabama inmate facing nation’s first execution by nitrogen gas,"Alabama Public Radio | By Pat Duggins,","Published January 24, 2024 at 3:16 PM CST",20240125,apr.org,https://www.apr.org/news/2024-01-24/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-stay-for-alabama-inmate-facing-nations-first-execution-by-nitrogen-gas,"An Alabama inmate remains scheduled to be the first person in the United States to be put to death with nitrogen gas. The U.S. Supreme Court is rejecting a request for a stay of execution for Kenneth Eugene Smith. Prior to this decision, his attorneys were hoping for a last-minute reprieve from federal courts in his bid to halt the death sentence from being carried out.
Alabama intends to execute Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, by the never-used method of nitrogen hypoxia. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Smith's request for a stay, rejecting his argument that it would be unconstitutional for the state to attempt a second execution after a failed lethal injection in 2022. The decision settles the first of Smith's two legal efforts to halt his execution.
Smith also has asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the execution from going forward. The 11th Circuit is weighing Smith's appeal of a federal judge's January 10th decision to let the execution go forward. Whatever the court decides, it is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Smith's lawyers argued that the state is trying to make him the test subject for an experimental execution method. They argued the state's plan, which uses a gas mask, puts him at risk for choking on his own vomit or a prolonged and painful death.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find. If Smith's execution by nitrogen hypoxia is carried out, it will be the first new execution method used in the United States since lethal injection was first used in 1982.
On Tuesday, the 11th Circuit asked a federal judge to review new information submitted by Smith that he was consistently vomiting ahead of the execution, heightening the risk of complications. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. ruled Wednesday that the new information would not change his decision to let the execution proceed.
Without a court-ordered stay in place, Alabama is proceeding with plans to carry out the execution.
The execution method involves putting a respirator-type face mask over the nose and mouth to replace breathable air with nitrogen, causing death from lack of oxygen. Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, but no state has attempted to use it so far.
The Alabama attorney general's office and Smith's lawyer in oral arguments before the 11th Circuit presented diverging accounts of the humaneness and risks execution by nitrogen hypoxia.
Smith's attorneys said it is riddled with unknowns and potential problems in violation of a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
""This is the first time this will ever be attempted. There is no data on exactly what's going to happen and how this will go forward,"" attorney Robert Grass told the court.
Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour had urged the judges to let the execution proceed, saying that ""Alabama has adopted the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.""
The state predicted in court filings that the gas will cause an inmate to lose consciousness within seconds and cause death within minutes. Critics of the untested method say the state can't predict what will happen and what Smith will feel after the warden switches on the gas is unknown.
Alabama previously tried to execute Smith by lethal injection in 2022 but called it off before the drugs were administered because authorities were unable to connect the two intravenous lines to his veins. Smith's attorneys said he was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours.
Smith is one of two men convicted in the murder-for-hire slaying of a preacher's wife in 1988 that rocked a small north Alabama community. Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance.
Sennett, 45, was found dead March 18, 1988, in her home in Colbert County with eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner. Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr., killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect, according to court documents. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the slaying, was executed in 2010."
