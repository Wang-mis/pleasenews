Press Statement  Matthew Miller, Department Spokesperson  September 3, 2024
The United States joins a broad range of international partners in strongly condemning the unjustified arrest warrant issued in Venezuela for Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez Urrutia. GonzÃ¡lez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuela's July 28 presidential election, and this arbitrary and politically motivated action is a low point in NicolÃ¡s Maduro's ruthless pursuit of his political opponents following his attempts to steal the July 28 presidential election.
Maduro and his representatives cannot indefinitely suppress the legitimate aspirations of the Venezuelan people and maintain power by force. The will of the people and their rights must be respected. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of those who have been unjustly detained. The path forward should be a peaceful, transparent, and inclusive democratic transition process that puts the well-being of Venezuelans at its center.
