0HJI6EAB3X_QPHHREKFFH38SVP,"Report on sex abuse in Germany’s Protestant Church documents at least 2,225 victims",By KIRSTEN GRIESHABER,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/germany-protestant-church-sex-abuse-report-fecaf184161354e43f18811b58539f8d,"BERLIN (AP) — At least 1,259 people working for the Protestant Church of Germany have committed sexual abuse in the last decades and at least 2,225 victims were affected by the abuse according to an independent report published Thursday.
The numbers are based on the study of documents and files from the regional churches and the Lutherans’ diaconal relief and social welfare organization, known as Diakonie.
However, the authors said they were not able to analyze the personnel files of all pastors and deacons within the church, but primarily disciplinary files. They estimated that the real number of perpetrators is much higher, with nearly 3,500 people who have committed sexual abuse, German news agency dpa reported.
“It’s the tip of the tip of the iceberg,” said Martin Wazlawik from Hannover University, who coordinated the study on sexualized violence in the Protestant Church in Germany.
The church commissioned the study in 2020 and financed it with 3.6 million euros ($3.92 million), with the goal of analyzing structures within the church that promote violence and abuse of power. As an umbrella organization of 20 regional churches, the EKD represents 19.2 million Protestant Christians in Germany.

At the presentation of the study in Hannover, the head of the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany, also known as EKD, apologized to the victims “wholeheartedly.”
“As an institution, we have also been guilty of countless crimes against countless people,” Hamburg Bishop Kirsten Fehrs said, adding that she was “deeply shocked” by the overall picture presented by the study.
“Ever since I have been dealing with this topic, I have been sincerely shaken by the abysmal violence that has been inflicted on so many people in our church,” Fehrs said, adding that the church would accept the results of the study “with humility.”
This report comes several years after Germany’s Catholic Church published staggering numbers on sexual abuse by its clergy.
In 2018, a church-commissioned report concluded that at least 3,677 people were abused by Catholic clergy in Germany between 1946 and 2014. More than half the victims were 13 or younger, and nearly a third served as altar boys."
0RBZKZ6VRU_JWWLGXVFW2U1DKP,Judge in a bribery case against Honolulu’s former top prosecutor is suddenly recusing himself,By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/honolulu-prosecutor-bribery-judge-85edd160b28b85f72d8634a79b2e08d4,"HONOLULU (AP) — A month before the start of a bribery trial against Honolulu’s former top prosecutor, the judge who has been presiding over the case since 2022 unexpectedly recused himself.
U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright issued an order Wednesday morning recusing himself in the case against former Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro.
Jury selection was scheduled to begin next month in one of Hawaii’s most anticipated criminal trials.
Seabright has presided over the case since a U.S. grand jury indicted Kaneshiro and four others in 2022, alleging that employees of an engineering and architectural firm bribed the prosecutor with campaign donations in exchange for Kaneshiro’s prosecution of a former company employee.
Seabright’s order doesn’t explain his recusal.

All five have pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the City and County of Honolulu and one count of conspiracy to intimidate the former employee to prevent her from exercising her rights by filing a civil rights lawsuit against the firm. The first count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, the second count 10 years.
The indictment alleges that Mitsunaga & Associates employees, along with an attorney listed as an unindicted co-conspirator, contributed more than $45,000 to Kaneshiro’s reelection campaigns between October 2012 and October 2016.
They allegedly got family members, business partners, employees and contractors to donate as well to get around individual campaign contribution limits.
The former employee targeted with prosecution had been a project architect at Mitsunaga & Associates for 15 years when she was fired without explanation on the same day she expressed disagreement with claims the CEO made against her, court documents said.
Kaneshiro’s office prosecuted the architect, whom court documents identify only as L.J.M., but a judge dismissed the case in 2017 for lack of probable cause.
Kaneshiro took a leave of absence as Honolulu’s prosecuting attorney in March 2019 after he became a target of the federal investigation. He didn’t run for reelection in 2020, and his term expired in January 2021.
Kaneshiro’s defense attorney, Birney Bervar, declined to comment on the recusal.
Alexander Silvert, a retired federal defender not involved in the case, said a judge stepping away from a case like this is highly unusual, especially given how long Seabright has been on it.
“This is a high publicity case for Hawaii, given that it was the city and county’s lead prosecutor,” Silvert said.
The unexpected move could mean there was a conflict of interest that Seabright recently learned about or there is a personal issue, Silvert said.
A woman who answered the phone in his chambers said, “He’s not providing any comment,” and hung up.
“We have no comment on this,” Lucy Carrillo, clerk of court of the Hawaii district, said in response to an email from The Associated Press asking if the judge could comment.
A nominee of President George W. Bush who has been on the bench since 2005, Seabright previously spent nearly two decades as a federal prosecutor, including overseeing white collar and organized crime cases in the U.S. attorney’s office in Hawaii.
This story has been corrected to show it was Silvert, not Seabright who suggested there could be a conflict of interest."
0U2IEVWF21_AC6M689N69131QB,Lawsuit seeks to protect dolphins if flood-control spillway is used near New Orleans,By EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/dolpins-gulf-of-mexico-mississippi-river-6ca9973cabf8ac1a8853c158795522c6,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Opening a spillway as a flood-control measure in 2019 sent polluted fresh water from the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico and killed bottlenose dolphins that live in saltwater, according to a new lawsuit.
Several local governments and business groups on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, calling themselves the Mississippi Sound Coalition, filed the federal lawsuit Monday against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The lawsuit argues that the Marine Mammal Protection Act requires federal agencies, including the Corps of Engineers, to obtain a U.S. Department of Commerce permit when their actions may disrupt the behavioral patterns of an animal such as the bottlenose dolphin.
“The massive volumes of polluted fresh water diverted through the Bonnet Carré Spillway and into the Mississippi Sound caused direct and indirect mortality of resident bottlenose dolphins,” the lawsuit says. “Many of the dolphins that did survive developed extremely painful and debilitating skin lesions.”
The lawsuit seeks a court order that would require the Corps of Engineers to comply with any obligation to obtain a permit before any further opening of the Bonnet Carré Spillway.

The Associated Press sent an email Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Justice, which represents the Corps of Engineers, seeking a response to the lawsuit. A spokesperson said the department declined to comment.
The Bonnet Carré Spillway is upriver from New Orleans. Opening the spillway diverts Mississippi River water to Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne, after which it flows to the Mississippi Sound in the Gulf of Mexico.
When the river is high, opening the spillway eases pressure on the levees that protect New Orleans.
However, opening the spillway also carries pollutants and nutrients into the Mississippi Sound and reduces salinity. The result can be damage to oyster, fish and crab habitats, and algae blooms that affect marine life and beaches.
Mississippi Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has said the Corps of Engineers ignored its own procedures in opening Bonnet Carré Spillway in 2019, causing an environmental and economic disaster.
Robert Wiygul, one of the attorneys representing the Mississippi Sound Coalition, said the group and Mississippi leaders have no conflict with protecting New Orleans.
“We do have a conflict with the Corps of Engineers and the Corps’ position that the Mississippi Sound and our dolphins have to be sacrificed to prevent flooding,” Wiygul said in a statement Wednesday. “We need to look for alternatives that can protect everyone’s interests, but the Corps refuses to even discuss them. The Mississippi Sound Coalition is working on win-win solutions that protect everyone.”
The new lawsuit is similar to one that some of the same coastal Mississippi governments and business groups filed in 2019 against the Corps of Engineers. The earlier lawsuit said the corps was required to consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service before opening the spillway.
In January 2023, U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola Jr. of Gulfport, Mississippi, ruled in favor of those who sued. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling in June."
0XT9CKR65O_YFDI6RNYHHYYMT9,Biden wins New Hampshire primary through a write-in effort after declining to campaign there,By WILL WEISSERT,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-new-hampshire-democrats-writein-campaign-597a1208e5a8696a3f6b794a91b9fb00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden won New Hampshire’s largely symbolic Democratic primary on Tuesday, prevailing in an unusual write-in effort after he refused to campaign or appear on the state ballot.
Biden easily bested two longshot challengers, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson, who were on the ballot along with a host of little-known names. His victory in a race he was not formally contesting essentially cements the president’s grasp on the Democratic nomination for a second term.
What to know about New Hampshire’s primary
The New Hampshire race will likely not count toward amassing delegates for the presidential nomination after Democrats in the state bucked a Biden-championed revamp of the primary calendar that placed South Carolina at the fore of the Democratic race for the White House.
Biden championed changing Democratic Party rules to put South Carolina first on Feb. 3, arguing that Black Democrats, the party’s most reliable base of support, and other voters of color needed to play a larger, earlier role in the primary. But Biden also won South Carolina’s primary in 2020, reviving his campaign after a blowout loss in New Hampshire, whose electorate is whiter and older than the rest of the nation.

New Hampshire Democrats rebelled against the new plan and pushed ahead with a primary on Tuesday, alongside the state’s Republicans. The Democratic National Committee has said that the contest won’t award delegates that ultimately select the nominee as a result of the rules violation.
Biden shunned the primary as a result, but his allies organized hundreds of volunteers — and got help from a super PAC — to spread the word that New Hampshire Democrats could still write in his name.
“I want to thank all those who wrote my name in this evening in New Hampshire,” Biden said in a statement. “It was a historic demonstration of commitment to our democratic process.”
He went on to appeal to independent and anti-Trump Republicans “who share our commitment to core values of our nation — our Democracy, our personal freedoms, an economy that gives everyone a fair shot — to join us as Americans” and back his campaign.
The contest was overshadowed by the Republican primary, where former President Donald Trump followed up his win last week in Iowa with another victory to prove that he has seized control of his party’s nomination over his last remaining challenger, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley.
New Hampshire allows unaffiliated voters to participate in either party’s primary."
11O3VH3E2P_85VD8C0I4J3UVPE,France fines Amazon $35 million for ‘excessively intrusive’ monitoring of warehouse staff,_,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/amazon-fine-monitoring-workers-privacy-france-d503314234ccacb366e2afaa49d097b1,"PARIS (AP) — France’s privacy watchdog said Tuesday that it slapped Amazon ‘s French warehouse business with a 32 million euro fine ($35 million) for using an “excessively intrusive system” to monitor worker performance and activity.
The French Data Protection Authority, also known by its acronym CNIL, said the system allowed managers at Amazon France Logistique to track employees so closely that it resulted in multiple breaches of the European Union’s stringent privacy rules, called the General Data Protection Regulation.
“We strongly disagree with the CNIL’s conclusions, which are factually incorrect, and we reserve the right to file an appeal,” Amazon said. “Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.”
The watchdog’s investigation focused on Amazon employees’ use of handheld barcode scanners to track packages at various points as they move through the warehouse, such as putting them in crates or packing them for delivery.
Seattle-based Amazon uses the system to manage its business and meet performance targets, but the regulator said it’s different from traditional methods for monitoring worker activity and puts them under “close surveillance” and “continuous pressure.”
The watchdog said the scanner, known as a “stow machine gun,” allows the company to monitor employees to the “nearest second” because they signal an error if items are scanned too quickly — in less than 1.25 seconds.
The system is used to measure employee productivity as well as “periods of inactivity,” but under EU privacy rules, “it was illegal to set up a system measuring work interruptions with such accuracy, potentially requiring employees to justify every break or interruption,” the watchdog said.
The CNIL also chastised Amazon for keeping employee data for too long, saying it didn’t need “every detail of the data” generated by the scanners from the past month because real-time data and weekly statistics were enough."
16I3N60Z2F_9NGWZ9ASJ0FY0F8,US Supreme Court won’t overrule federal judges’ order to redraw Detroit legislative seats,By JOEY CAPPELLETTI,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-detroit-legislature-districts-5bcbf12b5f4883ac82180cfeae09b345,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request from Michigan’s redistricting commission to overrule an order to redraw 13 Detroit-area seats in the Legislature, a decision that will likely make the legislative maps more competitive.
The redistricting commission had asked the high court to overrule a December ruling by a three-judge federal appeals court panel that Michigan’s legislative maps were illegally influenced by race when drawn in 2021. The panel ruled that although nearly 80% of Detroit residents are Black, the Black voting age population in the 13 Detroit-area districts mostly ranges from 35% to 45%, with one being as low as 19%.
The panel ordered that the seven state House districts have their boundaries redrawn for the 2024 election, and it set a later deadline for the six state Senate districts because the senators’ terms don’t expire until 2026.
A drafted state House map is due by Feb. 2 and a final deadline is March 29.
The Supreme Court did not explain its decision in the order released Monday. Attorneys for the commission did immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

John Bursch, an attorney for the Detroit voters who sued the commission, said they were “very pleased” by the order. Bursch said the commission could still appeal, but he called the Supreme Court’s order “a strong indicator that such an appeal will likely fail.”
Although it’s unknown how the new maps will be drawn, there would likely be an increase in the number of “Detroit-focused” districts that would be solidly Democratic, said David Dulio, a political science professor at Oakland University in Michigan. That would likely affect districts in the suburbs, which would become more competitive as a result, he said.
“You could see these districts, or even a subset of them, really be where the fight for control of the state House is,” Dulio said.
The office of Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had supported the commission’s request to the Supreme Court in recent days. It wrote in a filing that the Democrat was concerned about having new district lines in place by the August primary.
“My commitment to maintaining fair and secure elections remains steadfast, and I look forward to working with our clerks in the months ahead to ensure everyone is ready and prepared to administer safe and accessible elections this year,” Benson said in a statement Monday.
Michigan Democrats were able to flip the state House and Senate in 2022 while retaining the governor’s office, giving them full control of state government for the first time in 40 years. The party’s success had been attributed, in part, to legislative maps that were redrawn in 2021 by an Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.
State lawmakers drew the boundaries for Michigan’s seats in Congress and the Legislature until voters in 2018 created an independent commission to handle the once-a-decade job. The commission’s first maps were produced for the 2022 election.
Experts repeatedly told the redistricting commission in 2021 that certain percentages regarding race were necessary to comply with federal law. The appeals court judges disagreed, though.
“The record here shows overwhelmingly — indeed, inescapably — that the commission drew the boundaries of plaintiffs’ districts predominantly on the basis of race. We hold that those districts were drawn in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution,” Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote.
The redistricting process had reduced the number of majority-minority districts in the Legislature from 15 to five, according to the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University.
The 2022 midterms, the first election since redistricting, saw the number of Black lawmakers in the Legislature reduced from 20 to 17. Detroit, which is predominantly Black, was left without Black representation in Congress for the first time since the early 1950s."
1L2U18H64M_JQ6678DDH9F8C5U,"New Jersey already protects abortion rights. Now Democrats want to cover out-of-pocket costs, too",By MIKE CATALINI,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-costs-new-jersey-bf37cd99e38c6b37cf01b2a9fb5ae164,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Dawn Ericksen was struggling with an opioid addiction a dozen years ago when she got pregnant and realized she couldn’t keep herself safe, much less a baby. Working part-time, she couldn’t afford the hundreds of dollars she would need for an abortion and had to turn to a trusted friend to help cover the costs.
Ericksen, a 43-year-old attorney from southern New Jersey who has been sober for 10 years, is now speaking out about her experience because she thinks women’s voices need to be heard.
“I knew it was the right choice for me. But at the same time, that doesn’t mean I want to shout it from the rooftops and tell everybody, hey, I’m in a tough position,” she said. “It wasn’t easy to kind of come hat in hand, so to speak, and say ‘This is something I need help with.’ It’s a very vulnerable place to be.”
Experiences like Ericksen’s are at the center of a renewed effort by New Jersey’s Democratic-led Legislature and governor, Phil Murphy, to bar women from having to pay out-of-pocket costs to get an abortion. New Jersey is among a group of Democratic-led states that are moving to reduce the barriers to abortion, even as many conservative states have been severely restricting a woman’s right to end her pregnancy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
New Jersey and nine other states require health insurers to cover abortion services, but it is the only state among that group that doesn’t bar out-of-pocket costs, according to KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. In the governor’s annual address this month, Murphy called for an end to such costs.

The issue, according to proponents of the measure, is that even women with insurance coverage might not reach their deductible, which vary but often exceed $1,000. An abortion’s cost depends on several factors, including whether it’s medication-induced or surgical. A medication abortion typically costs $600-$800, while a surgical procedure could cost up to $2,000, according to Planned Parenthood.
“We don’t want those having to make the decision between paying for groceries or having the care that they need,” said Kaitlyn Wojtowicz, an executive with Planned Parenthood Action of New Jersey, which supports the legislation.
The second-term governor is pushing for the legislation after his party expanded its majority in the Legislature and in a presidential year in which Democrats hope that the abortion issue will buoy their candidates nationwide. It also coincides with a yearslong effort to expand abortion services in the state, as Democratic officials sought to blunt the impact of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe.
New Jersey has already enshrined abortion rights as law, increased funding for abortion services and required regulated health insurance plans to cover the procedure.
“New Jersey will always be a safe haven for reproductive freedom. Period,” Murphy told lawmakers recently. “I am asking you to join me in doing more to protect reproductive rights.”
Despite Democrats having full control of the state government, the bill’s prospects are unknown. The legislative session just began, and lawmakers will soon turn their attention to the state budget. The leaders of both legislative chambers support abortion rights, but it’s unknown how much passing the law would cost, how it would be funded and whether it could cause insurance premiums to rise.
California, for instance, eliminated insurance charges such as co-payments and deductibles in 2022 and the measure was expected to increase insurance premiums.
Teresa Ruiz, the New Jersey Senate’s majority leader, spoke passionately about expanding access to abortion. She also raised a practical point about the measure and said it’s likely to come in the context of a broader budget discussion.
“My daughter, who is 7, has less body autonomy in this country than my mother has had in her lifetime,” Ruiz said.
Legislative Republicans viewed the governor’s proposal skeptically. Assembly Minority Leader John DiMaio said his party is focused on “pocketbook issues” that affect all residents, and GOP state Sen. Declan O’Scanlon called it a “red herring” issue because the law protects abortion in the state.
Ericksen, who described her path to sobriety as a slow and laborious journey, said she would ask lawmakers to consider not just the financial costs of ending out-of-pocket fees, but how it could help everyone.
“When we support vulnerable populations, our whole state benefits,” she said."
1U295ZDTC8_VAKRF88OYAS3V5R,A US congressional delegation affirms bipartisan support for Taiwan in first visit since election,By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-china-us-delegation-election-6a0c75f36e9e407003215a8b26d078aa,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A bipartisan delegation from the United States Congress reaffirmed support for Taiwan during a visit Thursday following its election of a new president. The delegation’s visit is the first by U.S. lawmakers to the island since the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third-straight term in the Jan. 13 election.
China, America’s chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring the self-governed island under its control. Beijing strongly condemned Lai Ching-te’s election and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage with the island’s government — a practice that’s been in place since outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016.
“The support of the United States for Taiwan is firm. It’s real, and it is 100% bipartisan,” U.S. Representative Mario Díaz Balart said.
Balart, a Florida Republican, was joined by California Democrat Ami Bera. “In the 21st century, there’s no place for aggressive action. We have to learn to live together, to trade together, to work together, to solve problems together,” Bera said.
At a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan with the country’s president-elect, U.S. Democratic Congressman from California Ami Bera says the relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan is important.

“Just know that we are proud of the people of Taiwan. We are proud of the relationship, and as strong as that relationship has always been. That is assured. It will even be stronger,” Balart said.
“So, we look forward to working together to continue to protect the peace, prosperity (and) the future of Taiwan. It’s up to people of Taiwan,” Bera said.
President-elect Lai thanked the visiting co-chairs of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus for their visit, saying that “today’s Taiwan is a Taiwan of the world.”
Lai also touched on continued military assistance from the U.S. and a proposed agreement to avoid mutual taxation of companies.
Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan. In 2022, it responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile launches and a simulated blockade of Taiwan. It views visits by foreign government officials as a recognition of the island’s sovereignty.
President Joe Biden, seeking to calm that complaint, insists there’s no change in America’s longstanding “one-China” policy, which recognizes Beijing as representing China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taiwan.
At a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan with the country’s president-elect, Republican Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart says he’s part of a delegation from the U.S. House of Representatives.
Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island has the ability to defend itself. That has translated into a heavy reliance by Taiwan on U.S. military hardware and a law saying that Washington must treat threats against the island as a matter of “grave concern.”
China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and harass Taiwan, with 18 planes and six ships operating near the island in the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Thursday. Three Chinese balloons were recorded as crossing the island, although it remains unclear whether they have a military or intelligence gathering purpose,
“We understand the pressures and the type of coercion of the Chinese Communist Party, and yet the Taiwanese people spoke loud and clear,” Balart said at a late Thursday news conference. “Taiwan is a beacon of hope and of life and of freedom and of democracy and it is such a direct contrast to what we’re seeing coming from the Communist Party of China.”
Bera said Taiwan’s future “should not be dictated by any external power. But the future of Taiwan is up to the people of Taiwan.”
The U.S. does not want to change the status quo between China and Taiwan, but “we have to respond to external pressures and others that potentially are changing that status quo,” Bera said. “It’s about seeking peace, prosperity and the right to your own future.”"
1VVDNHQ79P_EV4H7W18X1HQ5D2,Rifts within Israel resurface as war in Gaza drags on. Some want elections now,By TIA GOLDENBERG,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-war-netanyahu-gaza-elections-2cf0f1325dafbd07e7bf075b373a6358,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Ever since Israel was attacked on Oct. 7, a main Israeli highway has been flanked by billboards preaching national unity and a ubiquitous wartime slogan: “Together we will win.”
But lately those billboards have been replaced with a starkly different message: a call for immediate elections.
The mood of the Israeli public is shifting after more than 100 days of war in Gaza – and the catalyst is a rift over the polarizing leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Israelis stunned by the brutal Hamas attack initially put aside their differences and rallied behind the war effort. Now old divisions that could alter the course of the war are reemerging.
As the death toll among Israeli soldiers keeps rising, and with dozens of hostages still in Gaza and Hamas still standing, more Israelis are vocally pushing back against Netanyahu and his government. The public is also increasingly divided over whether the military can simultaneously achieve Netanyahu’s stated goals of destroying Hamas and freeing all the hostages.

“The Israeli public is rediscovering its political tribalism,” said Nadav Eyal, a commentator for the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. “It inherently limits the decision-making process when you don’t enjoy the public’s trust.”
Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving leader, still heads a coalition that is clinging to power despite the criticism. But opponents say he lacks a clear vision for how to get Israel out of Gaza. They believe political and personal motivations are clouding his decision-making.
The prime minister’s opponents say he is beholden to ultranationalist supporters in Parliament, many of whom have called for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza or for Israel to resettle the area. And they point to corruption charges hanging over him as evidence that it is in his self-interest to drag out the war.
Netanyahu says he has the country’s best interests in mind and that he will answer tough questions about Oct. 7 — when more than 1,200 were killed and some 250 were taken hostage — after the war ends.
The blistering war has already killed more than 25,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, and it has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe because of widespread destruction and displacement, and limited supplies of food, water and medicines. International criticism has prompted a trial at the U.N. world court over claims that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a charge it vehemently denies.
Netanyahu, who has so far sidestepped accountability for Israel’s military and intelligence failures on Oct. 7, vowed once again on Tuesday to continue fighting “until absolute victory,” even after 24 soldiers were killed the previous day, the deadliest since the war began. He says fierce military pressure is what led to the first hostage release deal in late November and is key to bringing about another.
However, several hostages have died or been killed in captivity, including three mistakenly shot by Israeli troops. The families of hostages in Gaza say time is running out and that another cease-fire deal is needed urgently.
“When the prime minister says ‘absolute victory,’ ’war until 2025,’ he knows that if that’s the case the hostages will die and return in coffins,” said Eyal Ben Reuven, a reserve Israeli general. “A long war in enemy territory is not a good thing.”
While military experts say Israel has made gains in Gaza, these can be harder to grasp for a public still reeling from Hamas’ attack. What the public sees most clearly are mounting soldier casualties, rockets being launched into Israel — although fewer than at the start of the war — and dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
The internal criticism gained a prominent voice last week.
Gadi Eisenkot, a member of the influential War Cabinet and a former military chief whose son and nephew were killed in the war, told the prominent Israeli news show “Uvda” that only a negotiated deal could free the remaining hostages.
That was a direct challenge to Netanyahu’s claim that sustained military force is the best way. Eisenkot also called for elections to be held soon to restore the public’s trust.
Before the war, Netanyahu presided over a period of political turmoil that included five elections in less than four years. Each one was a referendum on Netanyahu’s fitness to serve while on trial for corruption.
The nation became even more fractured last year when Netanyahu and his religious-nationalist government launched a judicial overhaul plan that sparked unprecedented protests. Opponents said the plan, if enacted, would be a fatal blow to the country’s democratic fundamentals; scores of military reservists vowed not to serve, leading top defense officials to warn that Israel’s security was at risk.
Netanyahu’s critics say Hamas’ attack and Israel’s failure to foresee or promptly contain it was a direct result of the divisions sowed by Netanyahu and his government. Polls show his coalition would not be reelected if elections were held today.
For the growing chorus of voices who oppose the government, patience is wearing thin.
A protest calling for elections last week drew thousands in Tel Aviv, the biggest anti-government rally since the war began.
A group of 170 former commanders and other senior defense officials signed a letter earlier this month calling for elections now. Some of the same commanders were outspoken opponents of Netanyahu’s overhaul, an indication of how the divisions over the war have in many ways settled along the same fault lines as the disagreements over the legal changes.
A recent poll of Jewish voters by the Israel Democracy Institute found that just 10% of respondents from Israel’s left wing believe Israel has had large success toward toppling Hamas. The number among the pro-Netanyahu right wing was 35%. The poll interviewed 756 people and had a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points.
Those who oppose elections say they would tear open the old divisions.
“The very discussion of elections will stop the military momentum, present every strategic decision as a political ploy and put the legitimacy of the fighting in question,” Eithan Orkibi, a professor at Ariel University in the occupied West Bank, wrote in the conservative newspaper Israel Hayom.
But public anger, often embodied by the families of those killed or abducted on Oct. 7, is growing.
At a recent protest outside the Knesset, or parliament, one man who said his brother was killed in the Hamas attack was caught on video being dragged away by police as he yelled: “I won’t despair until this whole government gets the hell out of here.” He wore a black T-shirt bearing the word “Elections!” in yellow.
The mother of a soldier who was taken hostage and then died in unclear circumstances while in captivity has waged a public battle against the government. She inscribed on his tombstone that her son was “kidnapped, abandoned and sacrificed in Gaza by the government of failure.”
The families of hostages have also stepped up their campaigns to free their loved ones. They have held protests outside Netanyahu’s private residence, barged in on a parliamentary committee session and blocked a highway in recent days.
“Right now, the most urgent thing — and there is nothing more urgent — is to return the hostages alive,” said Gil Dickmann, whose cousin is being held in Gaza.
Yaacov Godo blames the government and Netanyahu for the death of his son, Tom, who was killed in his home in front of his family during Hamas’ attack. He has camped outside of the Knesset since early November in protest.
“It’ll take time, but I believe the day is not far off where we will topple the government,” said Godo."
1WOMO83R7W_PD2H7YRBYYP106E,"Turkey investigates 8 bodies that washed up on its Mediterranean coast, including at a resort",By SUZAN FRASER,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-bodies-mediterranean-coast-investigation-ec52f6a65fd2d77e60d32ac513a32c68,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Authorities in Turkey are investigating eight bodies that washed up in the Mediterranean province of Antalya, including two found Monday on a beach in the vacation resort of Serik.
The Antalya governor’s office said one body is assumed to be a Turkish citizen who was reported missing. Authorities believe the seven other bodies discovered over the past week may be migrants from a boat that went missing off the coast near the Syria-Lebanon border last month on its way to Cyprus.
An estimated 90 people were on board the boat that disappeared on Dec. 11, the governor’s office said, citing information provided by the Lebanese embassy in Turkey.
An evaluation of currents, winds and waves indicates that the victims may have been dragged toward the Antalya coastline, the office said in a statement.
In Lebanon, a lawyer who follows migrants’ cases, Mohammed Sablouh, said the boat left northern Lebanon with about 85 people on board, including 30 children.

Sablouh said contact was lost with another boat that left Lebanon on Thursday with about 50 or 60 people on board.
Saadeddine Shatila, executive director of the Cedar Center for Legal Studies, a Lebanon-based human rights non-profit, said his group had been able to identify 76 of the passengers on the boat that went missing on Dec. 11. All of them were Syrians, in addition to the Lebanese captain.
Some of the Syrians had been living in Lebanon for years as refugees and others had come recently from Syria to Lebanon, intending to reach Europe by sea, Shatila said. The smugglers’ going rate for passage from Lebanon to Cyprus is $3,500, he said.
The price tag of passage has increased, as has the demand for the journey, over the past few years after Lebanon has fallen into a prolonged economic crisis. Syria’s economic situation has also worsened, in addition to the ongoing impacts of the country’s nearly 13-year-long civil war.
Shatila said he hopes DNA tests will identify the remains of some of the missing boat’s passengers and bring some closure to their families. He called for international authorities to renew search efforts for the boat and for European countries to open more legal pathways for migration so that people do not resort to the dangerous sea journey.
“People are leaving irregularly by these boats because they don’t have another solution,” he said.
On Monday, hotel staff found the two bodies 500 meters (about 1,600 feet) apart on the beach used by guests, the private Demiroren News Agency reported.
The other bodies were found in resorts near the town of Manavgat and on the coast near Antalya city.

27LCCC87DI_WADF3TRQM67IH1L,Cyprus sees Russian bank deposits plunge as government seeks to clean up its financial image,By MENELAOS HADJICOSTIS,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-russia-sanctions-evasion-fd6ad076f6439d3bee8c0252dcd7d7b8,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus has made headway in weaning itself off Russian cash and business as it tries to clean up its image, according to official figures, while a visiting team of U.S. officials is helping the government look at cases of alleged violations of sanctions against Russia.
According to figures obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, Russian deposits held in Cypriot banks fell 76% from 2014 to 2022, while Ukrainian deposits shrank by 67%. The number of Russian clients using Cypriot banks dropped 82% in the same period, while Ukrainian clients fell by 54%.
For years, Cyprus was known as an ask-few-questions jurisdiction whose banks welcomed money from wealthy depositors, despite their shady connections. It was especially popular with Russia’s wealthy oligarchs.
But that began to change following a 2013 financial crisis that brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, who took office in March last year, is vowing to enforce sanctions related to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. He says the country is committed to “being on the right side of history,” condemning Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.
According to the same figures, Cypriot banks severed business ties with nearly 60,000 customers — mostly Russian and Ukrainian nationals — between 2014 and 2022, while some 126,000 accounts have been suspended, amounting to approximately 40 billion euros ($43.5 billion).

Local media recently reported that several large Russian-owned companies registered in Cyprus have transferred their headquarters abroad owing to the scrutiny. It’s unclear which and how many of these companies have moved out of the country. Numerous AP requests for information from Cypriot authorities went unanswered.
Speaking after addressing the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Tuesday, Christodoulides said Cyprus has fully implemented all European Union sanctions against Russia and challenged reporters to look through an EU report detailing which bloc members aren’t implementing them.
“I stand boldly before you and admit that mistakes were made,” Christodoulides said, referring to allegations of money laundering that had long dogged the island nation as well as a now-defunct investment-for-citizenship program that unlawfully issued passports to Russians and others.
“All this is now history for Cyprus … Mistakes have been made in the past and the first who paid for these mistakes were the Cyprus Republic and the Cypriot people themselves,” Christodoulides said.
Meanwhile, a team of experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice is assisting Cypriot investigators with cases involving so-called “enablers” — lawyers and accountants who allegedly acted to help conceal the assets of sanctioned Russians and Russian-owned companies.
The invitation to the U.S. experts “is further evidence of the enhanced cooperation with our international partners on sanctions compliance to target those who have enabled sanctioned Russia oligarchs to hide their assets,” government spokesman Constantinos Letymbiotis told the AP.
Letymbiotis said that departing Russian bank deposits are offset by newly arriving international businesses. In 2022, more than 1,600 international companies registered in Cyprus – mostly in tech — including 47 multi-nationals.
He said in all, those companies helped create 36,854 direct and indirect jobs, up 42% from 2021."
2Z2T21NYLK_IG8EENGJEW1EI6V,South Korea grants extension to truth commission as investigators examine foreign adoption cases,By KIM TONG-HYUNG,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-truth-commission-adoptions-dictatorships-69fa079a6dda51d4a3102546613035c0,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s presidential office said Monday it approved a request by the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission for a one-year extension after investigators sought more time to examine human rights violations linked to past military governments, including the widespread falsifying of child origins that fueled a foreign adoption boom in the 1970s and ‘80s.
In granting the request for an extension through May 2025, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol acknowledged the need to “restore the honor of those who were unjustly victimized during our past history and those who sacrificed for the sake of the country,” said Hwang Sang Moo, senior secretary for civil and social affairs.
Commission chair Kim Kwang-dong is expected to announce the extension after a meeting of commissioners on Tuesday. While Kim had the nominal authority to extend the mandate by up to a year, the decision depended on the consent of the government, which would have to approve its budget.
Kim last month said a one-year extension beyond May 26 of this year was crucial because investigators are struggling to handle the thousands of cases.
Kim highlighted the investigation into the cases of 367 Korean adoptees from Europe, the United States and Australia who suspect their biological origins were manipulated to facilitate their adoptions. Some have asked the commission to look into abuse they say they experienced at South Korean orphanages or under the care of their foreign adopters.

The commission has completed investigations into about half of the 20,000 cases it accepted, which include cases involving Japan’s violent suppression of Korean independence activists during its 1910-45 rule of the Korean Peninsula and civilian massacres before and after the 1950-53 Korean War.
About 200,000 South Koreans were adopted to the West in the past six decades, creating what’s believed to be the world’s largest diaspora of adoptees.
Most were placed with white parents in the U.S. and Europe during the 1970s and ’80s. South Korea’s then-military governments were focused on economic growth and saw adoptions as a tool to reduce the number of mouths to feed, erase the “social problem” of unwed mothers and deepen ties with the democratic West.
Most adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans found on the streets, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified. That practice often made their roots difficult or impossible to trace. South Korea’s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for the problems surrounding past adoptions, which have drawn growing international awareness. Denmark’s only overseas adoption agency said this month it is “winding down” its facilitation of international adoptions from several countries, and Sweden’s only adoption agency last year said it was halting adoptions from South Korea.
South Korea’s commission has been interviewing adoptees who have applied for investigation and examining government records and paperwork produced by South Korean adoption agencies.
While the commission has yet to announce any findings, investigators have said it was clear that records of many adoptees had been manipulated, including falsely describing them as orphans or faking their identities.
Modeled after the South African commission established in the 1990s to expose apartheid-era injustices, South Korea launched its Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2006 to investigate past human rights violations, including civilian massacres during the 1950-53 Korean War, in an effort that continued until 2010.
Following the passing of a law that allowed for more investigations, the commission was re-launched in December 2020 under South Korea’s former liberal government, with a focus on cases that occurred during the country’s military dictatorships from the 1960s to 1980s.
In a landmark report in August 2022, the commission found Seoul’s past military governments responsible for atrocities committed at Brothers Home, a state-funded “vagrants’ facility” where thousands were enslaved and abused until the late 1980s.
The hundreds of deaths, rapes and beatings at Brothers were documented by an Associated Press report in 2016 based on hundreds of exclusive documents and dozens of interviews with officials and former detainees. It showed that the abuse was much more vicious and widespread than previously known. In a follow-up report in 2019, the AP found that foreign adoptions were part of Brothers’ massive profit-seeking enterprise. The adoptees investigated by the commission include at least one former inmate of Brothers."
34A13EHK4E_90TJNHRP4V0QRX6,"‘Honored to have your back, and you have mine': Biden endorsed by United Auto Workers in election","By TOM KRISHER, FATIMA HUSSEIN and DARLENE SUPERVILLE",_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/biden-auto-workers-endorsement-trump-election-ef4b26cd00fc67c4915f22e54b885866,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden picked up an endorsement from the United Auto Workers union Wednesday, an important boost to the Democratic president’s reelection bid as he pushes to sway blue-collar workers his way in critical auto-making swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin.
“I’m honored to have your back and you have mine,” Biden said to the cheering crowd. “That’s the deal.”
Biden spoke as the union closed out a three-day gathering in Washington to chart its political priorities. The event follows Tuesday’s primary vote in New Hampshire, where Republican front-runner Donald Trump cemented his hold on core Republican voters with a victory and Biden scored a write-in win.
Biden has long billed himself as the most labor-friendly leader in American history, and went so far as to turn up on a picket line with union workers at a GM parts warehouse in the Detroit area during a strike last fall.
The president is hoping to cut into the advantage that Trump has enjoyed with white voters who don’t have a college degree. Labor experts said that the UAW usually endorses candidates later as it has a mix of Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated voters.

“The days of working people being dealt out of a deal are over in this country as long as I’m president,” Biden told the crowd. “I want to say to all of you thank you, thank you. I could not be more proud.”
Union president Shawn Fain had demurred even earlier this week, but on Wednesday said Biden had earned the endorsement, contrasting what he said was the president’s obvious support with Trump’s trash talk and anti-union stance.
“He heard the call and he stood up and he showed up,” Fain said of Biden’s historic picket line appearance.
But when UAW went on strike against GM in 2019, Trump, then president, was silent. “He said nothing. He did nothing. Not a damn thing because he doesn’t care about the American worker,” Fain said.
Fain called Trump a “scab,” a derogatory term for workers who cross union picket lines and work during a strike.
“This November we can stand up and elect someone who stands with us and supports our cause, or we can elect someone who will divide us and fight us every step of the way. That’s what this choice is about,” Fain said.
Among union members, support for Biden has varied from enthusiastic to uncertainty about whether to even vote come Election Day.
Caroline Loveless, a Waterloo, Iowa, resident and retired UAW member, said she would enthusiastically vote for Biden, recalling his appearance on a picket line during last fall’s strike. She said his appearance should remind union members that Biden is on their side.
“I hope they don’t get amnesia,” Loveless said, “come Election Day.”
William Louis, of Groton, Connecticut, another member, said that while he is “fed up with politicians” he will reluctantly vote for Biden, though he said the president had not fully earned members’ vote given the current state of the economy.
Louis said Biden would get his vote because Trump, the likely Republican nominee, “was a terrible president.”
Leo Carrillo, a member from Kansas City, said Biden’s appearance on the picket line showed that “he was there for us,” and helped him to decide to vote for Biden in November.
“For me it meant a lot” that a sitting president would show that level of solidarity to autoworkers, Carrillo said. “But there’s more work to be done,” he said, pointing to the PRO Act — proposed legislation that would make it easier to unionize on a federal level. The legislation advanced to the U.S. Senate but does not have enough support to survive in case of a filibuster.
Biden could run into dissent, however, over his support for Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza. Some younger members of the union were less enthusiastic about the president for that reason, and there were scattered protests during his speech.
Johannah King-Slutzky, a Columbia University graduate student and member of the student workers union within the UAW, was one of several attendees who chanted “ceasefire now” during Fain’s afternoon speech Monday. The union called for a ceasefire in Gaza in December.
“Right now he’s done nothing to earn my vote,” King-Slutzky said, because “he has not acted with urgency to stop the genocide in Gaza.”
Fain, the first UAW president directly elected by members, took office after a huge bribery and embezzlement scandal that ended with two union presidents serving prison time. So he’s making sure to follow union procedures on the endorsement and show that members made the decision, even though there’s no way the UAW would have backed Trump, said Brian Rothenberg, a former union spokesman.
The UAW, with roughly 380,000 members, is normally one of the last unions to endorse presidential candidates, Rothenberg said. For example, the union didn’t endorse Biden in 2020 until April 21.
In a November interview with The Associated Press, Fain made clear that he personally supports Biden, as he railed against Trump.
Fain pointed to Biden’s trip to the GM parts warehouse, which is believed to be the first time a sitting president appeared with union picketers.
About that same time, Trump held a rally at a nonunion auto parts maker near Detroit, which Fain said was odd. Biden’s administration also supported the union’s bid to persuade Stellantis to reopen a shuttered plant in Belvidere, Illinois, and joined Fain in the city 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Chicago to celebrate its reopening, Fain said.
Internal UAW polling typically shows that in the spring and early summer, 30% of members support the GOP, 30% support Democrats and the remaining 40% swing between parties, he said. By Election Day, members and UAW retirees usually vote 60% Democratic, said Rothenberg, now a public relations consultant in Columbus, Ohio.
The endorsement may also sway nonunion blue-collar white males, who have been voting more for Republicans than in the past, Rothenberg said.

35T7N9XIHI_W72LLEGW3XSB6F1,Filipino fisherman to China’s coast guard on disputed shoal: `This is Philippine territory. Go away’,By JIM GOMEZ,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-philippines-disputed-scarborough-shoal-south-china-sea-13cf6ee1b11136ae79c949cd8e7237a0,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Filipino fishing boat captain protested on Tuesday the Chinese coast guard’s aggression in the disputed South China Sea, where he asserted that Chinese officers drove him and his men away from a disputed shoal and ordered them to dump their catch in the sea.
The face-to-face confrontation on Jan. 12, which Joely Saligan and his men reported to Manila’s coast guard after returning from the voyage, is testing efforts by China and the Philippines to deescalate tensions around a potential Asian flashpoint.
At a Jan. 17 meeting in Shanghai, Beijing and Manila agreed to take steps to ease tensions after a year of high-seas confrontations between their ships in one of the world’s busiest seas. The hostilities have sparked fears of a major armed conflict that could involve Washington, Manila’s longtime treaty ally.
The fishermen, led by Saligan, reported to the Philippine coast guard that Chinese coast guard personnel drove them away from the disputed Scarborough Shoal off the northwestern Philippines and ordered them to dump their catch of fish and seashells.
The confrontation happened on a coral outcrop that juts out of the sea like an islet at low tide. Saligan and his men took a dinghy from their mother boat and went to collect seashells and fish for food. However, they said five Chinese coast guard personnel, three of them armed with steel batons, followed by boat, landed on the islet and ordered the fishermen to leave immediately.

One Chinese officer tried to confiscate the cellphone of a Filipino fisherman, who pushed away the officer’s hand. Both sides were documenting the confrontation with video cameras or cellphones, Saligan said.
“This is Philippine territory. Go away,” Saligan said he told the Chinese coast guard personnel. The Chinese did not speak and used hand gestures, he said.
“They looked angry. They wanted us to return our catch to the sea,” Saligan told a group of journalists in Manila. “That’s inhuman because that was food which people should not be deprived of.”
Saligan said he decided to dump some of their seashells and fish in the sea and returned to his mother boat, the F/V Vhrayle, to prevent the dispute from escalating.
Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Saligan’s statements. In past disputes over the Scarborough Shoal, Beijing has asserted China’s sovereignty and the right to defend the fishing atoll from encroachments.
Philippine coast guard spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said the written statements and video submitted by Saligan and his men have been validated as accurate by the coast guard. A report will be submitted to a multi-agency government group dealing with the territorial disputes for possible actions, including the filing of a new diplomatic protest against China.
“Those actions were really illegal and the harassment that they did to our Filipino fishermen were unacceptable,” Tarriela said in a briefing.
The Philippine coast guard remained confident, however, that the agreement by China and the Philippines to lower tensions would “have a positive impact” and foster a peaceful resolution of the disputes, Tarriela said.
Chinese and Philippine coast guard ships engaged in a series of alarmingly tense hostilities last year mostly off the Second Thomas Shoal, another hotly contested area in the South China Sea. The Philippine government protested the Chinese coast guard’s use of water cannon, a military-grade laser and dangerous blocking maneuvers that had caused minor collisions off the Philippine-occupied shoal.
The United States has warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea. China has repeatedly warned of unspecified circumstances if the U.S. and its allies continue to meddle in the disputes.
China took control of the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 after a standoff between Chinese and Philippine ships, prompting Manila to bring the dispute to international arbitration. A United Nations-backed tribunal ruled in 2016 that China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea on historical grounds were invalid and that Beijing had violated the right of Filipinos to fish in the shoal.
China refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected its outcome and continues to defy it.

3AA1Z66GD2_UTVT56BAQG2GGLQ,China says it’s working to de-escalate tensions in the Red Sea that have upended global trade,_,_,20230124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-red-sea-tensions-global-trade-houthis-shipping-4f398a2e9d4143cd10ee729bda129be2,"BEIJING (AP) — China, the world’s biggest exporter, says it is deeply concerned about tensions in the Red Sea that have upended global trade by forcing many shippers to avoid the Suez Canal.
China has been in “close communication with all parties concerned and making positive efforts to de-escalate” the situation in which Iran-backed Houthi rebels have attacked international ships with missiles, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing on Wednesday.
“China calls for a halt to the harassment and attacks on civilian ships and urges all relevant parties to avoid fanning flames in the area and jointly ensure the safety and security of the route in the Red Sea,” Wang said.
Since November, the Iranian-backed Houthis have launched at least 34 attacks on shipping through the waterways leading up to Egypt’s Suez Canal, a vital route for energy and cargo coming from Asia and the Middle East onward to Europe.
The Houthis, a Shiite rebel group that has held Yemen’s capital Sanaa since 2014 and been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s exiled government since 2015, link their attacks to the Israel-Hamas war. However, the ships they’ve targeted increasingly have tenuous links to Israel — or none at all.

“We are deeply concerned about the recent escalation of the Red Sea situation. The Red Sea is an important international trade route for goods and energy,” Wang said.
Wang also referenced the Gaza conflict, linking it to the Red Sea tensions, saying, “The priority now is to end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible to avoid further escalation and prevent the situation from getting out of control.”
“China is willing to work with all parties to cool down the situation and maintain security and stability in the Red Sea,” Wang said.
China exported more than $3.5 trillion in goods in 2022, the last year for which figures were available. That was about $1.5 trillion more than the United States, the world’s No. 2 exporter.
Who are the Houthis?The Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have sharply escalated their attacks in the Red Sea.
Some of the world’s largest container shipping companies and oil giant BP have been sending vessels on longer journeys around Africa that bypass the Red Sea. In response to the growing impact on global trade, the United States and a host of other nations have created a new force to protect ships.
At least 90% of the container ships that had been going through the Suez Canal are now rerouting around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, according to Drewry, a maritime research consultancy.
The cost to ship a standard 40-foot container from China to northern Europe has jumped from $1,500 to $4,000, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany. But that is still far from the $14,000 seen during the pandemic.
The delays contributed to a 1.3% decline in world trade in December, reflecting goods stuck on ships rather than being offloaded in port.
The U.S. and its allies have been striking targets Washington has said are involved in the attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria and were threatening U.S. military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
China has maintained close ties with Iran, largely based on investment and oil imports, and last year hosted talks resulting in the restoration of Tehran’s diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia.
While seeking a peace-making role in the Middle East, Beijing has shied away from committing to any particular side, diminishing its credibility in the eyes of critics.
Wang said China believed the United Nations Security Council “has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen and calls for a genuine respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Red Sea coastal countries, including Yemen.”"

(AP) — The girlfriend of a man suspected of fatally shooting seven relatives and an eighth person last weekend in a Chicago suburb has been charged with obstruction for allegedly trying to prevent her boyfriend’s apprehension, police said.
Kyleigh Cleveland-Singleton, 21, of Joliet appeared Thursday morning in a Will County courtroom where she was ordered to be placed on home confinement with electronic monitoring.
She was being represented by a public defender. The Associated Press left a phone message Thursday seeking comment from the public defender’s office.
Singleton’s next court appearance has been scheduled for Feb. 8.
Cleveland-Singleton was charged after the Will County State’s Attorney Office reviewed information provided by detectives who interviewed her Monday, Joliet police said.

Joliet police said Cleveland-Singleton agreed to be questioned by police Monday after she was identified as the girlfriend and mother of the 3-year-old son of shooting suspect Romeo Nance, 23, who fatally shot himself Monday during a confrontation with law enforcement in Texas.
After police questioned Cleveland-Singleton, “detectives believed that she made statements in order to prevent the apprehension of the suspect and obstruct this investigation,” Joliet police said in a news release posted on Facebook. The news release did not include what statements she allegedly made.
Officers found Cleveland-Singleton at a home in Plainfield, about 14 miles (23 kilometers) northwest of Joliet, after detectives learned Nance’s young son might be with his mother and grandmother at a home there, police said.
The eight people who police said Nance fatally shot over the weekend were found Sunday and Monday, according to authorities. No motive has yet been provided.
Seven of the victims were found Sunday in two homes in Joliet and were identified as Nance’s mother, Tamaeka Nance, 47; his brother Joshua Nance, 31; sister Alexandria Nance, 20; two younger sisters, ages 16 and 14; aunt Christine Esters, 38; and uncle William Esters II, 35.
Another man, 28-year-old Toyosi Bakare, was fatally shot outside an apartment building. Police said Nance is believed to have randomly fired at him and also another man, who was wounded in the leg on a residential street, after killing his family members.
Nance fatally shot himself Monday evening after U.S. Marshals located him near Natalia, Texas, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of San Antonio and more than 1,000 miles (1,690 kilometers) from Joliet, police said.
Sheriff Randy Brown of Medina County, Texas, said he believes Nance was trying to reach Mexico, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometers) south of Natalia along Interstate 35."
3I186PMV7W_GZJG8HASZOOEC7S,"Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota’s lone congressman, runs for governor",By JACK DURA,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-kelly-armstrong-doug-burgum-1e7ff3704685e75847eecafe5d4072a3,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota’s sole U.S. House member announced his candidacy on Tuesday for governor of the sparsely populated state, the day after Gov. Doug Burgum said he won’t seek a third term.
Republican Rep. Kelly Armstrong is the first to formally announce a campaign in what is expected to be a competitive race among Republicans for the party’s nomination. The state GOP will endorse a ticket in April, but candidates can run in the June primary, when voters will decide who advances to the November general election. Republicans have held the governor’s office since 1992.
Armstrong, an attorney and former state GOP chairman, was first elected to the House in 2018 after serving six years in the state Senate.
“The short answer is I want to get home and start working — I miss people. I miss my friends. I miss my neighbors. I miss being in North Dakota, I really do,” Armstrong said in an interview. “Serving the state in Congress has been an absolute, the greatest privilege of my life, but I really want to come home. I miss my friends in the Legislature. I miss the people who are more interested in solving problems than finding some mediocre social media fame.”
North Dakota, population 784,000, is at a crossroads of how to continue to grow and diversify its economy, with workforce challenges and agricultural and energy issues facing the state, Armstrong said. He cited his knowledge of the state and federal government and background in the private sector, including oil and agriculture, helping him “advocate for and advance the things that are important for North Dakota.”

North Dakota’s governor is elected on a joint ticket with a lieutenant governor, who presides over the state Senate and is first in line to the governor’s seat. Armstrong said he hasn’t made decision about a running mate, but he will “take a lot of advice from a lot of people about the best way to approach it.”
His announcement also opens up the state’s sole House seat. Republican former state Rep. Rick Becker and Democrat Trygve Hammer, a military veteran, previously announced runs.
Armstrong won reelection to a third term in 2022 with over 62% of the vote against independent Cara Mund, an attorney and former Miss America. His House assignments include vice chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Burgum, who ended his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in December, endorsed former President Donald Trump for a second term. Hours after he announced he won’t seek a third term, he campaigned for Trump with former Republican presidential rivals in New Hampshire. Trump has praised Burgum, leading to speculation about a possible role for Burgum in a potential second Trump administration; Burgum has called that talk hypothetical.
Republicans control North Dakota’s Legislature and hold every statewide office and congressional seat. A Democrat hasn’t won a statewide election since 2012.

(AP) — The body of a man missing for weeks has been found stuffed inside the chimney of the Georgia house he was renting.
Bibb County sheriff’s deputies tell local news outlets that the body of Anthony Rumplik, 43, who had been missing since late December was found Friday, wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in the chimney of a house in Macon.
Rumplik’s roommate said he noticed a ladder leaning up against the house on Friday, climbed the ladder and saw a blanket in the chimney.
The condition of the body indicates Rumplik had been dead several weeks, Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones said.
Rumplik’s family from Ohio had recently visited Macon to search for him. His sister Marlo Rumplik said she last heard from Anthony Rumplik on Dec. 28. She said Rumplik ended up in Macon after his motorcycle broke down there on a trip to Florida last year.

Rumplik’s Macon landlord had reported him missing after finding the door to his rental house open and concluding it was suspicious.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation will conduct an autopsy. Deputies say they continue to investigate the case.
At the time of the search, Marlo Rumplik had criticized the sheriff’s department for not doing enough to look for her brother, saying they regarded him as “just another drug addict.”
Marlo Rumplik said her brother was schizophrenic and suffered from kidney failure. She said he had been homeless for a time in Macon and repeatedly hospitalized."
3MP7QDV83D_KYWKG6BSI07TZJK,Judge orders the unsealing of divorce case of Trump special prosecutor in Georgia accused of affair,By KATE BRUMBACK and ALANNA DURKIN RICHER,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/fani-willis-nathan-wade-affair-allegations-trump-e6cce17e3a4cd967e447620e2c1222ba,"MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered court records to be made public in the divorce involving a special prosecutor hired in the election case against Donald Trump and others and accused of having an affair with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
The newly unsealed court records, however, didn’t include any references to the affair allegations that have roiled the case that charges Trump and 18 allies of working to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state.
The judge ordered the unsealing of the divorce case involving special prosecutor Nathan Wade after a request brought by a defense attorney who alleges an inappropriate relationship between Willis and Wade. The judge also put off a final decision on whether Willis will have to sit for questioning in the divorce case, but delayed her deposition that had been scheduled for Tuesday.
Willis has defended her hiring of Wade, who has little prosecutorial experience, and has not directly denied a romantic relationship. She has accused Wade’s estranged wife of trying to obstruct her criminal election interference case against Trump and others by seeking to question her in the couple’s divorce proceedings.
The affair allegations threaten to taint the prosecution, with the Republican primary front-runner and others seizing on the claims to attack the case and Wade’s qualifications as a prosecutor. Trump has pleaded not guilty, denied any wrongdoing and called the charges politically motivated.

Willis was served with the subpoena to sit for a deposition in the divorce case the day that defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant, who represents former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman, filed a motion earlier this month alleging the romantic relationship between Willis and Wade.
Documents filed in court show Wade bought plane tickets in Willis’ name, and Joycelyn Wade’s lawyer has argued there “appears to be no reasonable explanation for their travels apart from a romantic relationship.” Joycelyn’s Wade’s lawyer, Andrea Dyer Hastings, told the judge on Monday that they believe Willis has some “unique personal knowledge” related to the divorce case and should be subject to questioning.
“She’s trying to hide under the shield of her position,” Hastings said of Willis.
Cinque Axam, a lawyer for Willis, said the issue before the court is how to divide the marital assets, and the determination of how that should be done has nothing to do with Willis, who doesn’t share any accounts with Nathan Wade and doesn’t determine how he spends money.
During a brief hearing in the Cobb County Superior Court, Judge Henry Thompson said he can’t rule on whether Willis should have to sit for a deposition in the divorce case until after Wade himself is questioned later this month. In ruling that court documents in the divorce case must be made public, he said a previous judge improperly ordered the case to be sealed without holding a hearing.
Joycelyn Wade’s lawyer wrote in court papers filed Friday that Nathan Wade has taken trips to San Francisco and Napa Valley, Florida, Belize, Panama and Australia and has take
n Caribbean cruises since filing for divorce and that Willis “was an intended travel partner for at least some of these trips as indicated by flights he purchased for her to accompany him.”
The filing includes credit card statements that show Nathan Wade — after he had been hired as special prosecutor — bought plane tickets in October 2022 for him and Willis to travel to Miami and bought tickets in April to San Francisco in their names.
It’s one of four cases Trump is facing as he vies to return to the White House. Prosecutors are using a statute normally associated with mobsters to accuse the former president, lawyers and other aides of a “criminal enterprise” to keep him in power. Four people have already pleaded guilty in the Georgia election case after reaching deals with prosecutors. The remaining 15, including Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, have pleaded not guilty.

Karim Berthé, a senior official at the government’s National Geology and Mining Directorate, confirmed the details to The Associated Press and called it an accident.
There were around 100 people in the mine at the time of the collapse, according to Abdoulaye Pona, president of the Mali Chamber of Mines, who was at the scene.
The cause of the collapse, which happened in Kangaba district in the southwestern Koulikoro region on Friday, was under investigation. It was first reported on Tuesday in a Ministry of Mines statement that estimated “several” miners dead.
Such tragedies are common in Mali, Africa’s No. 3 gold producer. Artisanal miners — small-scale, informal ones — are often accused of ignoring safety measures, especially in remote areas.

“The state must bring order to this artisanal mining sector to avoid these kinds of accidents in the future,” Berthé said.
The Ministry of Mines statement “deeply regretted” the collapse, and urged miners and communities living near mining sites to “comply with safety requirements.”
In recent years, there have been concerns that profits from unregulated mining in northern Mali could benefit extremists active in that part of the country.
The region of this latest collapse, however, is far to the south of that and closer to the capital, Bamako.
“Gold is by far Mali’s most important export, comprising more than 80% of total exports in 2021,” according to the International Trade Administration with the U.S. Department of Commerce. It says more than 2 million people, or more than 10% of Mali’s population, depend on the mining sector for income.
Artisanal gold mining is estimated to produce around 30 tons of gold a year, and represents 6% of Mali’s annual gold production.
The Ministry of Mines has estimated that the country has 800 tons in gold deposits. The country also has an estimated 2 million gold miners operating in around 300 artisanal mining sites, Pona said."

(AP) — Kristina Karamo, a failed secretary of state candidate who was elected as the Michigan Republican Party’s chair last February, was “properly removed” from the position earlier this month by party members, according to an initial review done by the Republican National Committee.
The Republican National Committee, or RNC, said their determination was not final and could change depending on additional information. It came in a letter sent Wednesday by RNC attorneys to both Karamo and former Congressman Pete Hoekstra, who was elected as the new chair by a group of Michigan GOP members.
“Based upon its initial review, it appears to the Counsel’s office that Ms. Karamo was properly removed in accordance with the MI GOP bylaws,” read the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.
While RNC members are expected to meet following a Jan. 30 winter meeting to make further recommendations, the dispute over the Michigan GOP chair position will likely play out in court in the months to come.
The latest development in a months long dispute over the state party’s leadership comes about a month before the state holds its presidential primary and in a year where Michigan Republicans are desperate to win back some power after historic losses in 2022.

Republicans are hoping to win an open U.S. Senate seat next year in addition to multiple competitive House races. Control of the Michigan House, which is currently deadlocked at 54-54 after two seats were vacated by Democrats, will also be up for grabs this year.
Earlier this month, close to half of the Michigan GOP’s voting members came together to vote Karamo out as chair, citing fundraising woes and months of infighting. Eight of the state party’s 13 congressional district chairs had called on Karamo to resign and her own co-chair, Malinda Pego, aided the effort to remove her.
The group then voted to elect Hoekstra as the party’s new chair. Hoekstra served as a U.S. representative from 1993 until 2011 and acted as the United States ambassador to the Netherlands under former President Donald Trump.
Karamo, an election conspiracist who refused to accept the results of her 14 percentage point loss in the 2022 secretary of state race, has claimed the Jan. 6 vote to remove her as chair was “illegitimate” and “illegal.” She sent cease and desist letters last week to Hoekstra and other opponents alleging defamation of character and trademark infringement.
The RNC had been reviewing the legitimacy of the vote to remove Karamo ahead of a RNC winter meeting in Las Vegas on Jan. 30. Voting members, which includes state party chairs, are invited to the meeting.
While both Karamo and Hoekstra will be invited to the winter meeting as guests, neither will be credentialed as Michigan GOP chair, according to the letter sent by RNC’s general counsel Michael Whatley and chief counsel Matthew Raymer.
Following the meeting, RNC members will “work quickly” to review the dispute and make a recommendation, the letter reads.
Karamo’s general counsel, Dan Hartman, responded to the RNC’s letter in a statement Thursday, calling their opinion “irrelevant.”
“Lawyers signing a letter does not communicate anything other than their opinion. Therefore, while the letter is authentic, I do not care,” Hartman said in the statement, adding that they will continue with “business as usual.”
Hoekstra said in a statement that he was “pleased” to see the RNC’s letter and that his focus now is to “ensure that we continue to put together an operation that will deliver the state of Michigan for Donald Trump.”
Trump won Michigan in 2016 before now-President Joe Biden won it in the 2020 race.
Michigan’s GOP presidential primary Feb. 27 will award 16 of the state’s 55 delegates. The remaining 39 delegates will be allocated during a March 2 convention hosted by the state party."

3TXDCW02QM_VB7ADH29F39ZLER,The WEF’s chairman did not confess that a ‘political revolution’ is destroying his agenda,By MELISSA GOLDIN,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-klaus-schwab-admits-great-reset-865444185576,"CLAIM: World Economic Forum executive chairman Klaus Schwab admitted that his plan for a “Great Reset” is being destroyed by a “political revolution” against the idea.
AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. An article by a website known to publish misinformation misrepresented a speech Schwab gave on the future of governments worldwide at a 2017 conference in Dubai, three years before the WEF introduced the idea of The Great Reset. In reality, Schwab spoke about the need to develop new systems of government to reflect contemporary perspectives and what such systems could entail.
THE FACTS: Social media users are sharing a screenshot of a baseless article titled: “Klaus Schwab Admits ‘Political Revolution’ Against The ‘Great Reset’ Is Destroying His Agenda.”
One Instagram post that shared the screenshot reads: “We are the revolution!” It had received more than 2,700 likes as of Friday.
The article comes from a website called The People’s Voice, which was previously known as NewsPunch. The site has published numerous stories based on fabricated information, often about Schwab and the WEF.

The article provides no evidence to support its claim.
Yann Zopf, a WEF spokesperson, called it “a complete misrepresentation of the speech by Professor Schwab from 2017.”
“His words are taken out of context and misinterpreted to fuel absolute baseless conspiracy theories in order to discredit the important work that the World Economic Forum does on serious global challenges,” Zopf wrote in an email to The Associated Press.
Zopf also pointed out that the WEF’s 2024 Global Risks Report “found misinformation and disinformation to be the top risk for the world in the next two years” and that “unfortunately, more and more organizations are seeing a rise in fake news.”
The Great Reset is a broad proposal set out by the WEF in 2020 to reimagine social and economic systems. It has stoked a number of baseless conspiracy theories online.
As supposed proof of Schwab’s alleged admission, the People’s Voice article includes a clip from Schwab’s address at the 2017 World Governments Summit in which he says: “You have this anti-system movement — what we are seeing is a revolution against the system. So fixing the present system is not enough.”
Schwab then describes libertarianism as an “anti-system” that involves dismantling “everything which creates some kind of influence of government into private lives.”
At no point in his speech does Schwab admit that a “political revolution” is destroying The Great Reset initiative, which would not even be launched for another three years.
He speaks instead about how some governments have faced a backlash from people who feel globalization is not working to their advantage while others have chosen to re-erect walls, leading to “a world which is more anchored in yesterday and a world which probably is characterized by fragility and hostility.”
As an alternative, Schwab suggests that governments should instead develop new systems that are “in line with the new world which is unfolding.” For example, prioritizing both individual well-being and societal advancement.

The 75-year-old monarch was admitted to the London Clinic, where the Princess of Wales, his daughter-in-law, is recovering from abdominal surgery, Buckingham Palace said Friday. The king, who entered the hospital with Camilla at his side, visited Kate at the clinic after he arrived.
“He’s doing well, thank you,” Camilla told people inside the hospital. She left the hospital at 3:10 p.m. and appeared to be in good spirits.
Charles, who ascended the throne 16 months ago, was diagnosed with the benign condition on Jan. 17 after he experienced undisclosed symptoms. He canceled engagements and was urged to rest ahead of the procedure. which had concluded by Friday afternoon.
AP correspondent Rica Ann Garcia reports on King Charles III’s operation.

“The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment,’’ the palace said. “His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week.″
The king decided to announce the surgery in advance in an effort to encourage other men to have their prostates checked in line with public health advice.
The palace said the king was “delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.’’
The prostate is a small gland that surrounds the urethra — the tube that carries urine out of the body. An enlarged prostate can put pressure on the urethra and make it more difficult to urinate.
Britain’s National Health Service recommends that men see their doctors if they notice any problems with, or changes in, their usual pattern of urination. Surgery is usually only recommended when a patient experiences moderate to severe symptoms that don’t respond to medicine.
Benign prostate enlargement is common in men over age 50, and normally it isn’t a serious health threat, the NHS says.
“The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for men with an enlarged prostate than it is for men without an enlarged prostate,” the agency says on its website.
News of the king’s treatment came amid a flurry of royal medical news over the past 10 days.
The Princess of Wales’ office at Kensington Palace said the princess underwent planned abdominal surgery on Jan. 16 for an undisclosed condition. 16. The palace didn’t provide further details but said her condition wasn’t cancerous.
The 42-year-old princess, formerly Kate Middleton, is the wife of Prince William, the heir to the throne. She is on day 11 of her hospital stay and is expected to remain in the hospital for up to two weeks, the palace says.
Though she is physically active and has generally experienced good health, Kate was hospitalized with severe morning sickness when she was pregnant.
Soon after Kate was hospitalized last week, the Duchess of York was diagnosed with a malignant skin cancer that was discovered during treatment for breast cancer. The melanoma was found after several moles were removed while she was undergoing reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy.
The duchess, 64, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew and the mother of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, was once a favorite target of Britain’s tabloids. The former Sarah Ferguson, often called by her nickname, “Fergie,” has written a number of children’s books, as well as a historical romance for adults.
While it is somewhat unusual for members of the royal family to release details about their health, the announcements about Charles and Kate’s conditions were seen as a way to avoid speculation because appearances would have to be postponed or canceled.
William also postponed a number of engagements to be able to support Kate and their three children during the time she’s hospitalized and after.
Stories about the health of Britain’s senior royals have been in the news repeatedly in recent years.
Speculation about the health of the late Queen Elizabeth II increased during the last months of her 70-year reign as undisclosed “mobility issues” limited her public appearances. After that, focus switched to Charles, who ascended the throne at an age when most of his contemporaries were long retired."

Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows concluded that Trump didn’t meet ballot qualifications under the insurrection clause in the U.S. Constitution, but a judge put that decision on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision on the similar case in Colorado.
In a unanimous decision on Wednesday, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court dismissed Bellows’ appeal of the order requiring her to await the U.S. Supreme Court decision before withdrawing, modifying or upholding her decision to keep Trump off the primary ballot on Super Tuesday.
“The Secretary of State suggests that there is irreparable harm because a delay in certainty about whether Trump’s name should appear on the primary ballot will result in voter confusion. This uncertainty is, however, precisely what guides our decision not to undertake immediate appellate review in this particular case,” the court said.
Bellows’ decision in December that Trump was ineligible made her the first election official to ban the Republican front-runner from the ballot under the 14th Amendment. In Colorado, the state supreme court reached the same conclusion.

The timelines are tight as Maine’s March 5 primary approaches. The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments on the Colorado case on Feb. 8, and Maine has already begun mailing overseas ballots.
The nation’s highest court has never ruled on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. Some legal scholars say the post-Civil War clause applies to Trump for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election and encouraging his backers to storm the U.S. Capitol after he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
Trump contends Bellows should have recused herself, and that she was biased against him. Trump said her actions disenfranchised voters in Maine, and were part of a broader effort to keep him off the ballot.
Bellows, who was elected by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, said she was bound by state law to make a determination after several residents challenged Trump’s right to be on the primary ballot. She put her decision on Trump’s ballot eligibility on hold pending judicial proceedings, and vowed that she would abide by a court’s ultimate ruling."
48Y5BFY0W5_8Z0TDO11RMZUXFX,A child dies after being rescued off Cyprus with 59 other Syrian migrants,_,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-syria-migrants-boat-children-lebanon-738b0d871a1885086ea42aecb3f499b3,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — One of the five children who were hospitalized in Cyprus after being rescued from a rickety boat carrying 60 Syrian migrants has died, officials said Thursday.
The migrants, who were rescued early Wednesday by Cyprus police, apparently ran out of food and water after the boat had engine trouble during a six-day voyage from Lebanon, officials said.
The child suffered a heart attack and couldn’t be revived, Health Services spokesperson Charalambos Charilaou told the Cypriot state broadcaster.
Charilaou said two other children, aged 3 and 5, remain in intensive care at a hospital in the Cypriot capital. Two other minors are also being treated at a hospital, but their condition isn’t as serious.
Two adults were also hospitalized, with leg fractures. The remaining Syrians were transferred to a migrant reception center on the capital’s outskirts.

Cyprus government spokesman Constantinos Letymbiotis expressed the country’s collective shock at the little girl’s death and wished for the speedy recovery of the other two girls in intensive care.
“There’s a very dark aspect to the migration issue, horrible criminal people smuggling rings that take advantage of your fellow human beings,” Letymbiotis said.
A Cyprus court on Thursday ordered a 47-year-old man into custody for eight days on suspicion of driving the boat and belonging to the smuggling ring that organized the trip. He also faces a manslaughter charge in connection with the girl’s death.
The boat had departed Lebanon with insufficient fuel and lacking GPS or any other navigational aid, not even a compass, police said according to the state broadcaster.
Alerted by a passing ship, police found the migrants about 55 kilometers (35 miles) off the island nation’s southeastern tip.
Authorities said the boat left from Lebanon on Jan. 18. Lebanon’s coast is about 168 kilometers (105 miles) from Cyprus.
Mohammed Sablouh, a Lebanese lawyer who follows migrant issues in his country, said the migrants were in bad shape because they hadn’t eaten for days.
Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides urged Lebanon’s government on Wednesday to take action to curb departures of migrants “because we know that these are Syrians who come here from Lebanon.”
Although overall migrant arrivals in Cyprus have significantly declined, those coming by sea almost quadrupled from 937 in 2022 to 3,889 in 2023, with almost all being Syrian, according to official interior ministry numbers.
Cypriot Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou said Thursday he would again call on the European Union to re-evaluate the safety of certain parts of Syria so that the migrants can be repatriated. He would also urge the EU to form a unit composed of European police, Lebanese and Cypriot officials to patrol Lebanon’s border.

That was the G-rated version of the line he’s been delivering in recent months. Occasionally, Shapiro just comes out and says it: “Get s—— done.”
The phrase has become the governing philosophy and brand of Shapiro, a freshman governor considered a rising star in the Democratic Party and among a handful of governors who are building their national profiles and positioning themselves for a 2028 run for the White House.
The S-word was part of comedian George Carlin ’s “The Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV” routine that got him arrested at a show in Milwaukee in 1972 and led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1978 upholding the government’s authority to sanction radio stations for broadcasting offensive language.

Now?
Shapiro debuted the S-word slogan last June in Philadelphia when he announced the reopening of a section of Interstate 95 that had collapsed 12 days earlier in a tractor-trailer accident.
He has since hauled out the phrase during a few other speeches, usually substituting “stuff.” He is using the initials “GSD” to title his latest statewide media tour and on his website to tout his accomplishments. His social media team also has used the phrase online in videos.
Shapiro isn’t the kind of norm-breaking politician who might be expected to cuss in public.
The 50-year-old son of a physician and former state lawmaker, county commissioner and state attorney general is generally considered a relatively buttoned-down politician who carefully controls his messaging. Neither is he known for casually cussing in private.
Shapiro has long held the philosophy that government should get stuff done for people, and the saying was used frequently between campaign staff and Shapiro in the 2022 campaign, his press secretary, Manuel Bonder, said.
Neither the campaign nor the governor’s office have workshopped the slogan or focus-grouped it to see what sort of public reception it might get, Bonder said.
“It’s something that’s representative of how the governor feels about governing and leading and trying to make government work more efficiently and getting things done for people,” Bonder said. “It’s something that is based off of that philosophy.”
Regardless, the saying has prompted some eye rolls from the insiders who hear it the most.
“When I first heard it, I thought it was unseemly for a governor, but I guess I’m getting used to it,” said state Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon. “I still cringe. You just don’t hear that from a public official too often. Are we lowering the bar now? I guess that bar can be lowered.”
It’s also evinced grumbling that Shapiro is taking credit for stuff that lawmakers had labored over long before he took office a year ago.
“With all due respect governor, we got this s(asterisk)(asterisk)t done before your tenure,” state Sen, Kristin Phillips-Hill, R-York, wrote in response to a post by Shapiro on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The saying is not necessarily original.
In 2012, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown abruptly used the expression during a news conference declaring his support for a multibillion-dollar water project.
Swearing by politicians also isn’t necessarily new, although it is increasingly breaking free from taboos.
It began picking up in earnest some seven or eight years ago, likely coinciding with the growing use of social media that let academics better measure the use of language, said Benjamin Bergen, a professor of cognitive science at the University of California-San Diego who studies language, including profanity.
Donald Trump — labeled the “profanity president” in a 2019 New York Times headline for his use of obscenities during speeches or rallies — had a lot to do with breaking down the staid ways in which politicians communicate, said Jennifer Mercieca, a professor of communication and journalism at Texas A&M who studies political rhetoric.
Still, Mercieca couldn’t think of another politician who had adopted a slogan with a swear word.
“It’s probably the new normal now to expect that politicians post-Trump are going to be more freewheeling under the guise of authenticity and say things they think would be said in a way that people would say themselves,” Mercieca said.
One of Shapiro’s fellow Pennsylvania Democrats, U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, cussed routinely on social media while on his way to winning the Senate seat in 2022. Still, Fetterman — known for his blunt and irreverent talk — generally confined his profanities to his writings on social media when describing his disdain for, say, Pennsylvania’s relatively low minimum wage.
There is some academic research on the effects of politicians swearing.
It shows that, in general, people judge politicians who swear the way they judge anyone else who swears, Bergen said. It largely hinges on the appropriateness of the context, he said.
“On the positive side, people tend to judge politicians who swear as being more authentic or truthful,” Bergen said. “On the negative side, they tend to judge them as being more out of control, less aware of or conforming to social norms.”
In any case, attitudes toward the S-word have changed in the last few decades, and it has lost much of its punch as a cuss word, Bergen said.
The word may be taboo with, say, older adults, but Bergen asks his freshmen class every year to rank cuss words, and “s——” barely registers anymore.
“It’s as offensive as ‘loser,’” Bergen said.

4HRMBFKLKI_BE8OBYJQ6MPI9Z2,Kenya’s high court rules that deploying the nation’s police officers to Haiti is unconstitutional,By TOM ODULA,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/kenya-haiti-gang-violence-deployment-7eecfbf8a1d2cdd8e9d5892fa623087e,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya’s high court on Friday blocked the United Nations-backed deployment of Kenyan police officers to Haiti to help the Caribbean country bring gang violence under control.
Kenya’s parliament passed a motion in November allowing the deployment of 1,000 officers to lead a multinational force in Haiti. But Judge Chacha Mwita said Kenya’s National Security Council, which is led by the president, does not have the authority to deploy regular police outside the country.
“It is not contested that there is no reciprocal arrangement between Kenya and Haiti and for that reason, there can be no deployment of police to that country,” Mwita said.
The judge said Kenya’s offer was noble but needed to be carried out in accordance with the constitution.
Mwita made the ruling in response to an application from Thirdway Alliance Party leader Ekuru Aukot, who argued that the government’s plan to send the officers to Haiti was illegal.

Kenyan government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura said it will appeal the decision.
U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric noted the government’s announcement that it will appeal and said: “The need for this multinational force authorized by the (Security) Council remains extremely high.”
“It was the Kenyan authorities that stepped forward … and we thank them for doing so when so many countries are not stepping forward,” Dujarric said. “We need urgent action, we need urgent funding, and we hope that member states will continue to do their part and then some.”
The decision was considered by many to be a blow to Haiti, which first requested the immediate deployment of a foreign armed force in October 2022.
“This is terrible news for Haitians,” said Diego Da Rin of the International Crisis Group. “The vast majority of the population was waiting for external help to assist the police regain some control of the capital and the areas most affected by violence.”
Mercy Corps Country Director for Haiti, Laurent Uwumuremyi, supported the High Court’s decision saying that previous international peacekeeping missions — such as the U.N. mission MINUSTAH that was deployed there 2004-2017 — and international interventions have had disastrous consequences for Haiti.
“Solutions for Haiti, including those to bolster the Haitian National Police and the army to tamp down violence and return some semblance of security, should be led by Haitians,” Uwumuremyi said.
He said another international intervention might inadvertently worsen the situation, exposing more people to violence.
“It is critical that any intervention is done to restore stability, respects human rights and humanitarian laws, and does not jeopardize or hinder aid operations or worsen the violence,” he said.
An unprecedented surge in gang violence is plaguing Haiti, with the number of victims killed, injured and kidnapped more than doubling in 2023, the U.N. secretary-general’s special envoy for the country said Thursday.
“I cannot overstress the severity of the situation in Haiti, where multiple protracted crises have reached a critical point,” envoy Maria Isabel Salvador told the U.N. Security Council.
She said the 8,400 victims of gang violence documented by her office last year — 122% more than in 2022 — were mainly targeted by gangs in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince.
Some 300 gangs control an estimated 80% of the capital and accounted for 83% of last year’s killings and injuries, Salvador said. She said they have expanded north into the Artibonite region, considered Haiti’s food basket, and south of the capital, where “gangs conducted large-scale attacks to control key zones” and systematically use sexual violence to exert control.
Guy Philippe, a former rebel leader in Haiti, implored Kenyans in a video message this week not to allow their police or military be deployed to Haiti.
Philippe said the Haitian people view Kenyans as their fellow African brothers but if the police were deployed to the Caribbean, Kenya’s people would become the “enemies” of Haitians because they would be seen as supporting an illegitimate government.
“We have a government here in Haiti that has no legitimacy, no one loves them. This government is helping gangs, killing innocent people, kidnapping and serving the interest of imperialism,” he said.
Philippe served nine years in a United States prison following a guilty plea to a money laundering charge. He is best known for leading a 2004 rebellion against former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and masterminding attacks on police stations.
Earlier in January, his supporters launched protests that paralyzed some cities across Haiti as they demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry.
Kenyan authorities told The Associated Press in December that the first group of about 300 officers was expected to arrive in Haiti by February. Kenya’s contribution would eventually rise to 1,000 officers at the head of a 3,000-strong multinational force.
Burundi, Chad, Senegal, Jamaica and Belize also have pledged troops for the mission.

4J9Z4Z2GIB_MKCISX4ZZYJLLK9,"Turkey’s parliament approves Sweden’s NATO membership, lifting a key hurdle",By SUZAN FRASER,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-sweden-nato-kurdish-militants-quran-ff81aa2d36160428d766579963f97fce,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish legislators on Tuesday endorsed Sweden’s membership in NATO, lifting a major hurdle on the previously nonaligned country’s entry into the military alliance.
Lawmakers ratified Sweden’s accession protocol 287 to 55, with ruling party members saying the Nordic country’s tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also previously has linked the ratification to Turkey’s desire to buy fighter jets from the U.S.
The ratification comes into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which was expected to be swift.
Hungary then becomes the only NATO ally not to have ratified Sweden’s accession.
“Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In Washington, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed the news, saying having Sweden in the alliance will make it “safer and stronger.”

NATO-member Turkey had been delaying Sweden’s membership for more than a year, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups that Ankara regards as security threats. It sought concessions from Stockholm, including moves to counter militants.
Turkey also had been angered by a series of demonstrations by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, in Sweden as well as Quran-burning protests that roiled Muslim countries.
Sweden in the past was a “center in Europe” for the PKK, Fuat Oktay, a senior legislator in Erdogan’s governing party and the head of the foreign affairs committee, told parliament.
But since then, Sweden has amended its anti-terrorism laws, curbed the PKK’s financial activities, convicted a terrorism suspect and extradited another, and lifted restrictions on arms sales to Turkey, Oktay said.
“PKK-affiliated circles no longer find a comfortable room for maneuver in Sweden as they did in the past,” Oktay said, explaining why the ruling party was now supporting Stockholm’s bid.
Sweden pledged deeper cooperation with Turkey on counterterrorism, as well as support for Turkey’s ambition to revive its EU membership bid.
Last month, parliament’s foreign affairs committee gave its consent to Sweden’s bid in the first stage of the legislative process, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent its accession protocol to lawmakers for approval.
Turkey’s main opposition party also supported Sweden’s membership in the alliance but a center-right party and the country’s pro-Kurdish party were among parties that opposed it.
“Sweden’s steps concerning its extradition of wanted criminals or the fight against terrorism have remained limited and insufficient,” Musavat Dervisoglu, a legislator from the Good Party told parliament.
Erdogan has linked ratification of Sweden’s NATO membership to the U.S. Congress’ approval of a Turkish request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and kits to modernize Turkey’s existing fleet. He has also urged Canada and other NATO allies to lift arms embargoes on Turkey.
Koray Aydin, another Good Party legislator, had urged parliament to hold out on ratifying Sweden’s accession until the F-16 sales and the modernization kits were approved in Washington, saying Turkey would lose an important bargaining chip.
U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration never formally tied the sale of the F-16s to Turkey’s ratification of Sweden’s NATO membership. However, numerous influential members of Congress had said they would not support the sale unless and until Turkey signed off on Sweden’s accession to the alliance.
U.S. administration officials say they expect relatively quick action on the F-16 sale after the ratification.
Sullivan, the U.S. national security advisor, said after Tuesday’s vote that Sweden’s accession to the alliance has been a priority for Biden.
“Sweden is a strong, capable defense partner. Sweden joining NATO is in the national security interests of the United States, and will make the Alliance safer and stronger,” he said.
Sweden and Finland abandoned their traditional positions of military nonalignment to seek protection under NATO’s security umbrella, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming NATO’s 31st member, after Turkey’s parliament ratified the Nordic country’s bid.

Hungary has also stalled Sweden’s bid, alleging that Swedish politicians have told “blatant lies” about the condition of Hungary’s democracy. Hungary has said it would not be the last to approve accession, although it was not clear when the Hungarian parliament intends to hold a vote.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced Tuesday that he sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to discuss Sweden’s entry into NATO.
NATO requires the unanimous approval of all existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary were the only countries that have been holding out, frustrating other NATO allies who had been pressing for Sweden and Finland’s swift accession.

4WCVVK9YJX_WS8XIVRSDKUQH7D,Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda migration bill suffers a blow in Britain’s Parliament,By JILL LAWLESS,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/uk-rwanda-migrants-plan-house-of-lords-a0787ecb4a3d5da640c80d188d2c3f0b,"LONDON (AP) — The upper house of Britain’s Parliament has urged the Conservative government not to ratify a migration treaty with Rwanda. It’s a largely symbolic move, but signals more opposition to come for the stalled and contentious plan to send some asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to the African nation.
The House of Lords voted by 214 to 171 on Monday evening to delay the treaty that paves the way for the deportation plan. The treaty and an accompanying bill are the pillars of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s bid to overcome a block on the deportations by the U.K. Supreme Court.
Members of the Lords, who are appointed rather than elected, backed a motion saying Parliament should not ratify the pact until ministers can show Rwanda is safe.
John Kerr, a former diplomat who sits in the Lords, said the Rwanda plan was “incompatible with our responsibilities” under international human rights law.
“The considerations of international law and national reputation ... convince me that it wouldn’t be right to ratify this treaty at any time,” he said.

The vote has little practical impact, because the House of Lords can’t block an international treaty, and the government says it will not delay. However, ignoring the demand could later be used against the government in a legal challenge.
Lawmakers in the House of Commons approved the bill last week, but only after 60 members of Sunak’s governing Conservatives rebelled in an effort to make the legislation tougher.
Monday’s vote indicates the strength of opposition in the House of Lords. Many there want to water down the bill — and, unlike in the Commons, the governing Conservatives do not have a majority of seats.
The Lords will begin debating the bill next week. Ultimately the upper house can delay and amend legislation but can’t overrule the elected Commons.
The Rwanda policy is key to Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” bringing unauthorized migrants to the U.K. across the English Channel from France. Sunak argues that deporting unauthorized asylum-seekers will deter people from making risky journeys across the English Channel and break the business model of people-smuggling gangs.
London and Kigali made a deal almost two years ago under which migrants who reach Britain across the Channel would be sent to Rwanda, where they would stay permanently. Britain has paid Rwanda at least 240 million pounds ($305 million) under the agreement, but no one has yet been sent to the East African country.
Human rights groups have criticized the plan as inhumane and unworkable. After it was challenged in British courts, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled in November that the policy was illegal because Rwanda isn’t a safe country for refugees.
In response to the court ruling, Britain and Rwanda signed a treaty pledging to strengthen protections for migrants. Sunak’s government argues the treaty allows it to pass a law declaring Rwanda a safe destination.
If approved by Parliament, the law would allow the government to “disapply” sections of U.K. human rights law when it comes to Rwanda-related asylum claims and make it harder to challenge the deportations in court."
56A4BY723E_EE5CD13OR5ZEO5G,2 US-flagged ships with cargo for US Defense Department come under attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels,By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-ship-attacks-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ef0b83ef2a7ca8c727288b50037287e5,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Two American-flagged ships carrying cargo for the U.S. Defense and State departments came under attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Wednesday, officials said, with the U.S. Navy intercepting some of the incoming fire.
The attacks on the container ships Maersk Detroit and Maersk Chesapeake further raise the stakes of the group’s ongoing attacks on shipping through the vital Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The U.S. and the United Kingdom have launched multiple rounds of airstrikes seeking to stop the attacks.
Meanwhile, Qatar, one of the world’s top exporters of liquified natural gas, warned that its deliveries were affected by ongoing Houthi attacks over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Danish shipper Maersk, in a statement to The Associated Press, identified two of its vessels affected by the attacks as the U.S.-flagged container ships Maersk Detroit and Maersk Chesapeake. It said the U.S. Navy was accompanying its ships at the time.
“While en route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the U.S. Navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles,” Maersk said. “The crew, ship, and cargo are safe and unharmed. The U.S. Navy has turned both ships around and is escorting them back to the Gulf of Aden.”

Maersk said both vessels carried cargo belonging to the U.S. Defense and State Departments, as well as other government agencies, meaning they were “afforded the protection of the U.S. Navy for passage through the strait.”
The ships were operated by Maersk Line, a U.S. subsidiary of Maersk that is “suspending transits in the region until further notice,” the company said.
The U.S. military’s Central Command in an online statement blamed the Houthis for the attack, saying they fired “three anti-ship ballistic missiles.”
“One missile impacted in the sea,” the statement said. “The two other missiles were successfully engaged and shot down by the USS Gravely,” an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.
Central Command did not respond to further questions from the AP.
The Houthis, who have been launching attacks on ships since November over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, later claimed the attacks in a prerecorded statement by their military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree. He vowed the Houthis would continue their attacks.
Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.
The U.S. and the U.K. have launched rounds of airstrikes targeting suspected missile storage and launch sites used by the Houthis in their attacks. The rebels now say they’ll target American and British ships as well.
Meanwhile, Qatar announced its shipments of liquified natural gas had been affected by the Houthi attacks. Previous shipments had been delayed previously before heading through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.
Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Hamas and Israel, has yet to see any of its ships attacked, however. A statement from its state-owned QatarEnergy producer said that its “production continues uninterrupted, and our commitment to ensuring the reliable supply of LNG to our customers remains unwavering.”
“While the ongoing developments in the Red Sea area may impact the scheduling of some deliveries as they take alternative routes, LNG shipments from Qatar are being managed with our valued buyers,” the statement said.
The statement suggests QatarEnergy’s cargos now are traveling around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, likely adding time to their trips."
5BWAJFWC8B_YDCPFA18E9LN81O,A landslide of contaminated soil threatens environmental disaster in Denmark. Who pays to stop it?,By JAN M. OLSEN,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/denmark-landslide-contaminated-soil-environment-04a82267b8ef4c3928220950fe05407a,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Authorities in Denmark are working against the clock to stop a slow-moving landslide of contaminated soil from reaching a nearby water source as public officials and the company that operated the site argue over who should pay for the massive cleanup.
The 75-meter (250-foot) -tall heap of dirt at the Nordic Waste reprocessing plant south of the town of Randers in northwestern Denmark contains some 3 million cubic meters (100 million cubic feet) of soil contaminated with heavy metals and oil products. It is moving at a pace of up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) per hour toward a stream connected to the Baltic Sea via the Randers Fjord.
The landslide started Dec. 10. Nine days later, Nordic Waste gave up on getting it under control, leaving the task up to the Randers Municipality, which has been rerouting the stream by laying pipes allowing it to pass the site safely.
Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said Friday that authorities are working on extending those pipes and that a sheet pile wall is being constructed, along with several basins for the contaminated water.
Water from rain and melting snow are the biggest problems, Heunicke said. In the past week, western Denmark has seen huge amounts of snow and rain.

“It’s about separating the polluted water from the clean water,” he told a news conference, adding that the work is “enormously difficult.”
On Monday, a report by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, or GEUS, said the continuous deposit of soil on top of a sloping clay pit at Nordic Waste was the main cause for the landslide. GEUS added that there had been landslides in the region since 2021.
United Shipping and Trading Company, or USTC, which is behind Nordic Waste, earlier blamed the landslide on climatic conditions beyond its control. The area “has been exposed to enormous amounts of rain, as 2023 has been the wettest year ever in Denmark. This has resulted in a natural disaster of a caliber never before seen in Denmark,” it said.
It is still unclear who will have to pay for the cleanup. Nordic Waste was declared bankrupt earlier this week after the Danish Environmental Protection Agency ordered it to provide security of more than 200 million kroner ($29.2 million) to prevent an environmental disaster.
Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who visited the site Monday, said it would be unfair if Danish taxpayers had to pay.
Nina Østergaard Borris, Nordic Waste’s CEO, said it would take up five years to restore the site, and it could potentially cost billions of kroner. She said the situation “is far more serious than anyone could have imagined, and the task of saving the area is far greater than what Nordic Waste or USTC can handle.”
The case has started a debate about whether Nordic Waste has a moral responsibility to pay. The government has lashed out at Denmark’s sixth-richest man, Torben Østergaard-Nielsen, who is behind USTC, for not paying."
5C6R0YCI9Q_U4RD9A0ERHHOZE5,Proud Boys member sentenced to 6 years in prison for Capitol riot role after berating judge,By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/marc-bru-sentencing-capitol-riot-proud-boys-b5b07bfef5942c73c14f0da6edef1517,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A man who stormed the U.S. Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members was sentenced on Wednesday to six years in prison after he berated and insulted the judge who punished him.
Marc Bru repeatedly interrupted Chief Judge James Boasberg before he handed down the sentence, calling him a “clown” and a “fraud” presiding over a “kangaroo court.” The judge warned Bru that he could be kicked out of the courtroom if he continued to disrupt the proceedings.
“You can give me 100 years and I’d do it all over again,” said Bru, who was handcuffed and shackled.
“That’s the definition of no remorse in my book,” the judge said.
Prosecutors described Bru as one of the least remorseful rioters who assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They say Bru planned for an armed insurrection — a “January 6 2.0” attack — to take over the government in Portland, Oregon, several weeks after the deadly riot in Washington, D.C.

“He wanted a repeat of January 6, only he implied this time would be more violent,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing ahead of his sentencing.
Bru has been representing himself with an attorney on standby. He has spewed anti-government rhetoric that appears to be inspired by the sovereign citizen movement. At the start of the hearing, Bru demanded that the judge and a prosecutor turn over five years of their financial records.
The judge gave him a 10-minute break to confer with his standby lawyer before the hearing resumed with more interruptions.
“I don’t accept any of your terms and conditions,” Bru said. “You’re a clown and not a judge.”
Prosecutors had warned the court that Bru intended to disrupt his sentencing. On Tuesday, he called in to a nightly vigil outside the jail where he and other rioters are being held. He told supporters of the detained Jan. 6 defendants that he would “try to put on a good show” at his sentencing.
Boasberg convicted Bru of seven charges, including two felonies, after hearing trial testimony without a jury in October.
Prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of seven years and three months for Bru, a resident of Washington state.
“Bru appears to have envisioned and been planning for a true armed insurrection, and from his post-conviction comments, he appears only to have become further radicalized and angry since then,” they wrote.
Bru absconded before his trial, skipped two court hearings and “defiantly boasted via Twitter that the government would have to come get him if it wanted him.”
“Approximately a month later, it did,” prosecutors added.
Bru represented himself at his bench trial but didn’t present a defense. Instead, he repeatedly proclaimed that he refused to “consent” to the trial and “showed nothing but contempt for the Court and the government,” prosecutors wrote.
Bru flew from Portland, Oregon to Washington a day before then-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House. Before Trump’s speech, he joined dozens of other Proud Boys in marching to the Capitol and was one of the first rioters to breach a restricted area near Peace Circle.
Bru grabbed a barricade and shoved it against police officers. He later joined other rioters inside the Capitol and entered the Senate gallery, where he flashed a hand gesture associated with the Proud Boys as he posed for selfie photos. He spent roughly 13 minutes inside the building.
Several weeks after the riot, Bru exchanged text messages with a friend about buying gas masks in bulk. He also texted a Proud Boys recruit and indicated that he wanted to “repeat the violence and lawlessness of January 6 in Portland in order to take over the local government,” prosecutors said.
“In fact, those text messages indicate that Bru’s chief takeaway from January 6 is that it was not violent enough or not sufficiently dedicated to overthrowing the government,” prosecutors wrote. “In other words, in the aftermath of January 6, Bru was plotting an armed insurrection, not feeling remorseful.”
The FBI initially arrested Bru in March 2021 in Vancouver, Washington. After his pretrial release, Bru was charged with separate drunken driving-related offenses in Idaho and Montana.
In July, Bru was secretly living in Montana when a drunken driver hit his car. Police officers who responded to the collision arrested Bru on a warrant stemming from his failure to appear in court before trial. He has “continued to spew disinformation” from jail since his re-arrest and trial, prosecutors said.
“If anything, he appears to be growing more defiant and radicalized,” they wrote.
More than 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes. About 900 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials. Over 750 have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving some term of imprisonment, according to data compiled by The Associated Press."

The contract will allow for the purchase of 220,000 rounds of 155-millimeter ammunition, the most widely sought after artillery shell, according to NATO’s support and procurement agency. It will allow allies to backfill their arsenals and to provide Ukraine with more ammunition.
“This is important to defend our own territory, to build up our own stocks, but also to continue to support Ukraine,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.
“We cannot allow President (Vladimir) Putin to win in Ukraine,” he added. “That would be a tragedy for the Ukrainians and dangerous for all of us.”
Ukraine was firing around 4,000 to 7,000 artillery shells each day last summer, while Russia was launching more than 20,000 shells daily in its neighbor’s territory, according to European Union estimates.

Russia’s arms industry far outweighs Ukraine’s and Kyiv needs help to match Moscow’s firepower.
But the shells will not arrive quickly — delivery on orders takes anywhere from 24 to 36 months, the NATO agency said.
The European Union plans to produce 1 million artillery rounds for Ukraine have fallen short, with only about a third of the target met. Senior EU officials have said that they now expect the European defense industry to be producing around one million shells annually by the end of this year.

5ER5WRXUV0_1FME3Q92OX7HZJB,Michigan school shooter’s mother to stand trial for manslaughter in 4 student deaths,By ED WHITE,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/oxford-school-shooting-mother-charged-723e9ae9f1b43f1d2cccfb9f2c22544e,"PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) — The mother of a teenager who committed a mass school shooting in Michigan is headed to trial on involuntary manslaughter charges in an unusual effort to pin criminal responsibility on his parents for the deaths of four students.
Jennifer and James Crumbley are not accused of knowing their son planned to kill fellow students at Oxford High School in 2021. But prosecutors said they made a gun accessible to Ethan Crumbley, ignored his mental health needs and declined to take him home when confronted with his violent drawings at school on the day of the attack.
Involuntary manslaughter has been “well-defined for ages, and its elements are definite and plain: gross negligence causing death,” assistant prosecutor Joseph Shada said in a court filing.
Jury selection moved slowly Tuesday in the trial of 45-year-old Jennifer Crumbley. Hundreds of people were summoned to the court in Oakland County, 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Detroit — an enormous pool to account for people who might be excused because of their feelings about guns and the highly publicized tragedy, among other factors.
“The question is whether you can be fair and impartial,” Judge Cheryl Matthews told the first group of 50.

James Crumbley, 47, will face a separate trial in March. In December, Ethan was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to murder, terrorism and other crimes.
It’s a notable case: The Crumbleys are the first parents to be charged in a mass U.S. school shooting. The mother of a 6-year-old Virginia boy who wounded his teacher with a gun was recently sentenced to two years in prison for child neglect.
“I think prosecutors are feeling pressure when these weapon-related offenses occur,” said Eve Brensike Primus, who teaches criminal procedure at the University of Michigan Law School. “People are outraged, and they’re looking for someone to take responsibility for it.”
There’s no dispute that James Crumbley bought a gun with Ethan at his side four days before the shooting — the teen called it, “my new beauty.” Jennifer Crumbley took him to a shooting range and described the outing on Instagram as a “mom and son day.”
A day before the shooting, the school informed Jennifer Crumbley that Ethan, who was 15, was looking at ammunition on his phone. “I’m not mad,” she texted him. “You have to learn not to get caught.”
Defense attorneys insist the murders were not foreseeable by the parents. They liken the charges to trying to put a “square peg into a round hole.”
“After every school shooting, the media and those affected are quick to point to so-called ‘red flags’ that were missed by those in the shooter’s life,” Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman said in an unsuccessful effort to get the Michigan Supreme Court to dismiss the charges. “But the truth of the matter is one cannot predict the unimaginable.”
At his sentencing, Ethan, now 17, told a judge that he was a “really bad person” who could not stop himself.
“They did not know and I did not tell them what I planned to do, so they are not at fault,” he said of his parents.
A few hours before the shooting, the Crumbleys were summoned to Oxford High School. Ethan had drawn violent images on a math assignment with the message: “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.”
The parents were told to get him into counseling, but they declined to remove him from school and left campus after less than 30 minutes, according to investigators. Ethan had brought a gun from home that day, Nov. 30, 2021, though no one checked his backpack.
The shooter surrendered to police after killing four students and wounding seven more people. The parents were charged a few days later, but they weren’t easy to find. Police said they were hiding in a building in Detroit.
The Crumbleys have been in jail for more than two years awaiting trial, unable to afford a $500,000 bond. Involuntary manslaughter in Michigan carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said that 26,083 people have been killed and more than 64,400 wounded since Oct. 7, the day militants from the territory launched a surprise attack in southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages.
South Africa has accused Israel of genocide and asked the world court in The Hague, Netherlands, to impose interim measures as the case proceeds. The requested measures included ordering Israel to stop its offensive, to allow Gaza residents access to aid and to take “reasonable measures” to prevent genocide.
Israel has denied committing genocide and asked the court to throw out the case, which the panel of 17 judges refused to do.
The president of the International Court of Justice, Joan E. Donoghue, says the legal team has paid close attention to statements on the war.

Here’s the latest:
UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. Security Council has scheduled a meeting on Wednesday to follow up on the ruling by the U.N.’s top court ordering Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza.
Algeria, the Arab representative on the council, requested the meeting late Friday. The request followed a closed-door meeting of the U.N.’s 22-member Arab group, which supported a council meeting.
France’s U.N. Mission, which holds the council presidency this month, said the meeting will take place Jan. 31 at 11 a.m. EST.
The International Court of Justice stopped short of calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war which followed the militant group’s attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7. But it offered little other consolation to Israel in the case brought by South Africa under the Genocide Convention.
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told reporters as he headed into Friday’s meeting that the International Court of Justice’s ruling was “historic.” He said the Palestinians, Algeria and South Africa are analyzing the ruling in order to take “appropriate steps” in the Security Council.
“If one is to look at the provisional measures separately and collectively, it gives the clear message that in order to do all the things that they are asking for, you need a ceasefire for it to happen,” Mansour said.
The council has adopted resolutions endorsing humanitarian pauses, but the United States, a veto-wielding council member, opposes a ceasefire and has blocked attempts to have the council call for a halt to hostilities.
WASHINGTON — A British vessel was struck by a missile and caught fire in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen’s coast, the U.S. and U.K. militaries said Friday.
A U.S. military official confirmed the vessel was hit and damaged by a single anti-ship ballistic missile fired from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthi rebel group. The official said there were no known injuries, and spoke on condition of anonymity because no authorization had been given to discuss the incident.
The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Operations, which oversees Mideast waterways, acknowledged a vessel had been struck.
It’s latest assault by the Houthis in their campaign against ships traveling through the Red Sea and surrounding waters amid Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip.
The attack came hours after the Houthis launched a missile at a U.S. warship patrolling the Gulf of Aden, forcing it to shoot down the projectile.
Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree did not acknowledge the Carney attack, but claimed a missile attack on a commercial vessel that had set the ship ablaze. He identified the vessel as the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda. The Associated Press could not immediately reach the ship’s British managers.
The U.S. and Britain have launched multiple rounds of airstrikes since the Houthi attacks began.
UNITED NATIONS – U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “horrified” at the “extremely serious allegations” implicating several U.N. staff members in Gaza in Hamas’ surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7 and has ordered the U.N.’s internal watchdog to investigate.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday that Guterres was briefed on the allegations earlier this week by Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the U.N. agency dealing with Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA.
The secretary-general asked the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the U.N.’s internal watchdog, to launch an investigation “to establish the truth without delay,” Dujarric said.
“Any employee of UNRWA who is involved in acts of terror will be held accountable including through criminal prosecution,” he said.
Dujarric said 153 U.N. staff have perished during the Israeli-Hamas war and some 13,000 UNRWA staff are “all working to their best of their ability to deliver humanitarian aid.”
Dujarric said Guterres spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the UNRWA allegations, when asked about the U.S. suspension of funding to UNRWA.
Dujarric said UNRWA launched an appeal at the end of December for about $481 million and has received about $280 million plus an additional $90 million for urgent needs. He said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians need humanitarian assistance “even more now than they did before” and support for UNRWA remains critical.
UNITED NATIONS – U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is stressing that rulings of the U.N.’s top court are legally binding and trusts that Israel will comply with its orders, including “to take all measures within its power” to prevent acts that would bring about the destruction of the Palestinian people.
The U.N. chief takes note of the provisional measures the International Court of Justice ordered, and takes special note of its order to Israel to ensure the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the conditions in Gaza, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday.
Guterres also notes the court’s emphasis that “all parties to the conflict in the Gaza Strip are bound by international humanitarian law,” and that it calls for the immediate release of all hostages abducted by Hamas and other armed groups during the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, he said.
Dujarric said the secretary-general respects the independence of the U.N. court and did not want to be a commentator on its rulings.
But he said Guterres has repeatedly called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, stepped up humanitarian assistance for most of the 2.3 million people there, and the immediate release of the hostages.
WASHINGTON — CIA Director Bill Burns is slated to soon meet in Europe with David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.
The meeting will focus on the release of hostages in exchange for a pause in hostilities in Gaza. The administration’s hope is that an agreement could lead to a extended cease-fire that could eventually bring an end to the conflict, according to a U.S. official.
The CIA and White House National Security Council declined to comment on the meeting.
Egypt and Qatar have brokered past agreements between Israel and Hamas.
Burns’ trip comes after a visit to the Mideast by White House senior envoy Brett McGurk this week focused on the winning the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.
McGurk has also been laying the groundwork for another trip to the region by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who could make his fifth visit to the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war next week.

BERLIN — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Friday afternoon that Israel “must adhere” to the ICJ’s ruling Friday, but also said Hamas needs to release its remaining hostages.
“The International Court of Justice did not decide on the main issue, but ordered temporary measures in the interim legal protection proceedings,” she said. “But these are also binding under international law. Israel must adhere to this.”
“At the same time, the court made it clear that Israel’s actions in Gaza follow the barbaric terror of Oct. 7, and recalled that Hamas is also bound by international humanitarian law and must finally release all hostages,” Baerbock added. “We will support this with all our might, as well as the measure ordered by Israel to urgently allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.”
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says Israel’s alleged crimes against Palestinians in Gaza have been “laid bare” in the International Court of Justice’s ruling.
Ramaphosa also said his country, which lodged the genocide case against Israel at the top U.N. court, is happy that “the Palestinian people’s cries for justice have been heeded by an eminent organ of the United Nations.”
The court ruled in a preliminary order that Israel must do all it can to prevent deaths, destruction and any acts of genocide in its offensive in Gaza, but did not order a cease-fire by Israel, which South Africa had pushed for.
Ramaphosa, in a live television address in South Africa hours after the ruling, accused Israel of meting out “collective punishment” against Palestinians in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas militants. The South African leader said Israel’s military offensive was ”vastly disproportionate to any claim by Israel that it has been acting in self-defense.”
He also explained why South Africa brought the case to the world court, comparing Israel’s actions in Gaza to South Africa’s own history of apartheid under the previous system of white minority rule that forced most Black South Africans to live in “homelands” and denied them the right of freedom of movement among many other oppressive policies.
Leading rights groups in Israel and abroad and Palestinians have accused Israel and its 56-year occupation of the West Bank of morphing into an apartheid system that they say gives Palestinians second-class status and is designed to maintain Jewish hegemony from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.
“Some have told us that we should mind our own business and not get involved in the affairs of other countries,” Ramaphosa said. “Others have said it is not our place. And yet it is very much our place as a people who know too well the pain of dispossession, discrimination, state-sponsored violence.”
“We are also a people who were victims of the crime of apartheid,” he said. “We know what apartheid looks like.”
JERUSALEM — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched a missile at a U.S. warship patrolling the Gulf of Aden, forcing it to shoot down the projectile.
The attack Friday on the USS Carney marks the latest by the rebels amid their campaign against ships traveling through the Red Sea and surrounding waters. The Houthis say the attacks aim to force a halt to Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas.
The Iranian-backed Houthi rebels did not immediately acknowledge Friday’s attack, although they typically take several hours afterward to claim their assaults.
The U.S. and Britain have launched multiple rounds of airstrikes in the time since targeting Houthi missile depots and launcher sites in Yemen, a country that’s been wracked by conflict since the rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.
ISTANBUL – Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the International Court of Justice’s decision as “valuable.”
Ankara has strongly criticized Israel’s operation in Gaza, alleging war crimes and human rights abuses.
Turkey would continue seeking to “ensure that war crimes committed against innocent Palestinian civilians do not go unpunished,” he added, writing on X, formerly Twitter.
“We hope that Israel’s attacks against women, children and the elderly will come to an end,” Erdogan said.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it expected the decision to be “immediately and fully implemented by Israel.”
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has temporarily suspended assistance to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees following allegations that some of its employees took part in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.
The State Department said Friday it was “extremely troubled” by the allegations and had paused additional aid to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency pending a review of the claims and any action the U.N. takes to address them.
It said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had spoken to U.N. chief Antonio Guterres on Thursday to inform him of the decision, which is a significant reversal from the administration’s past support for UNRWA.
Blinken had visited UNRWA’s offices in Jordan just a month ago and praised the agency’s work in Gaza while lamenting the deaths of dozens of its employees in the conflict.
“We welcome the decision to conduct such an investigation and Secretary General Guterres’ pledge to take decisive action to respond, should the allegations prove accurate,” the department said of the UN probe.
“We also welcome the UN’s announcement of a ‘comprehensive and independent’ review of UNRWA. There must be complete accountability for anyone who participated in the heinous attacks of October 7,” it said.
Shortly after taking office, the Biden administration resumed funding to UNRWA that had been cut off during Donald Trump’s presidency.
JERUSALEM — Israel’s defense minister vowed to press forward with the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the International Court of Justice ruled that the country has to try to contain death and damage in the besieged enclave.
The International Court of Justice issued an interim ruling Friday in a case in which South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The court stopped short of ordering an immediate cease-fire but issued a sharp rebuke of Israel’s wartime conduct.
More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s military offensive, according to Gaza health officials, since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.
“The State of Israel does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement in response to the court ruling.
He said the military would “continue operating to dismantle the military and governing capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organization.”
A U.N. report last week said women and children are the main victims in the Israel-Hamas war, with some 16,000 killed, with an estimated two mothers losing their lives every hour.
The ruling also directly referenced a statement Gallant made to Israeli soldiers as an example of “dehumanizing” language toward Palestinians in Gaza.
“I have released all restraints,” Gallant told troops in the early days of the war. “You saw what we are fighting against. We are fighting human animals.”
The quotation was originally referenced by South Africa as an example of expressions of what it called “genocidal intent” by senior Israeli officials. Israel has vehemently denied the genocide allegations.
PRETORIA, South Africa — The South African government said the ruling was a victory for international law and the ruling had determined that “Israel’s actions in Gaza are plausibly genocidal.”
“There is no credible basis for Israel to continue to claim that its military actions are in full compliance with international law, including the Genocide Convention, having regard to the Court’s ruling,” the statement said.
“South Africa sincerely hopes that Israel will not act to frustrate the application of this Order, as it has publicly threatened to do, but that it will instead act to comply with it fully, as it is bound to do,” it said.
The South African government said other countries were now “are now on notice of the existence of a serious risk of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. This necessarily imposes an obligation on all States to cease funding and facilitating Israel’s military actions, which are plausibly genocidal.”
South Africa has gone to the International Court of Justice and accused Israel of genocide in response to Israel’s devastating military offensive in Gaza. Israel rejects the claim and accuses Pretoria of providing political cover for Hamas.
AMMAN, Jordan — The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says he has fired several employees and ordered an investigation following Israel’s allegation that dome of the agency’s staff took part in the deadly attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel.
In a statement Friday, Philippe Lazzarini described the allegations as “shocking.” He said his agency, known by the acronym UNRWA, condemns the Oct. 7 attacks in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. He called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages to their families.
Lazzarini said Israeli authorities provided his agency with information about the alleged involvement of several employees in the attacks. The refugee agency, which provides education, medical care and welfare services to hundreds of thousands of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, has tens of thousands of employees.
“Anyone who betrays the fundamental values of the United Nations also betrays those whom we serve in Gaza, across the region and elsewhere around the world,” Lazzarini said.
He said that in addition to the people fired, additional agency employees would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution, if they were found to have been involved.
Lazzarini didn’t say how many UNRWA employees are accused of taking part. The U.S. State Department put the number at 12 in an announcement that it has temporarily paused additional funding for the aid agency while reviewing the allegations.
RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian officials have welcomed an interim ruling by the world court ordering Israel to prevent death and damage in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
An order issued Friday by the International Court of Justice was seen as an overwhelming rebuke of Israel’s conduct in the war, now in its fourth month. The court ordered Israel to report back in one month to show compliance.
The court stopped short of ordering a cease-fire. Friday’s ruling came in a case brought by South Africa, which alleged Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.
“States now have clear legal obligations to stop Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinian people in Gaza and to make sure that they are not complicit,” the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The world court’s order “should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity,” said the ministry, which is part of the Palestinian Authority, a self-rule government in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The Palestinian Authority and Hamas, an Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, are bitter political rivals.
Israel has vehemently denied allegations that it was committing genocide in Gaza.
Following the ruling of the International Court of Justice, a crowd of pro-Palestinian supporters that had gathered outside the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, waved Palestinian flags and chanted “Cease-fire now!” and “Free, Free Palestine!”
They also denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and shouted: “Netanyahu, criminal” and “Israel, criminal.” Many protesters wore the black and white checkered scarfs that have come to symbolize Palestinian solidarity.
Outside the building that houses the court, pro-Israeli protesters sang and chanted ″Bring them home!″ after the ruling was read, waving Israeli flags and posters of hostages held by Hamas.
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will continue to do “what is necessary” to defend itself after the U.N.'s top court issued a ruling that harshly criticized Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The International Court of Justice stopped short Friday of ordering a cease-fire in Gaza but demanded that Israel try to contain death and damage from its military offensive in the tiny coastal enclave.
The world court based in The Hague, Netherlands, issued six interim actions it wants Israel to take as a panel of 17 judges considers genocide charges against the country brought by South Africa. The court on Friday denied Israel’s request to throw out the case.
Netanyahu rejected the genocide claims as “outrageous” and vowed to press ahead with the war. “We will continue to do what is necessary to defend out country and defend our people,” he said.
“Israel’s commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to continue to defend our country and defend our people,” the Israeli leader added.
He said Israel would “continue to facilitate humanitarian assistance, and to do our utmost to keep civilians out of harm’s way, even as Hamas uses civilians as human shields.”
THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The president of the International Court of Justice says Israel must report back to the U.N.'s top tribunal in one month to show it has implemented the interim measures it ordered Friday to limit further deaths and destruction in the Gaza Strip.
During a one-hour hearing in The Hague, Netherlands, Judge Joan E. Donoghue listed the steps the court is demanding while it considers genocide charges that South Africa brought against Israel over the tens of thousands civilian casualties from its military campaign against Hamas.
The orders call on Israel to take all steps within its power to prevent a genocide, to make sure that any evidence that could point toward genocide is not destroyed, and to “prevent and punish public incitement” that could encourage genocide.
Israel also must also take “immediate and effective measures to ensure the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”
While the ruling stopped short of South Africa’s request for a cease-fire, it nonetheless amounted to an rebuke of Israel’s wartime conduct.
THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The six interim actions that the U.N.'s top court ordered Israel to take to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza received broad support among the 17 judges participating in the genocide case South Africa brought against Israel.
Many of the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice on Friday were endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the panel, which included an Israeli judge who voted with the majority on several orders.
The Israeli judge, Aharon Barak, wrote in a separate opinion that “although I am convinced there is no plausibility of genocide,” he voted for two of the measures. He said he joined the majority in ordering Israel to refrain from public incitement “in the hope that the measure will help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric.”
He said he voted for a measure about ensuring humanitarian aid in the hope that it “will alleviate the consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable.”
During a one-hour reading of the court’s findings in The Hague, Netherlands, Israel was criticized time and again for its extraordinary use of force in Gaza, for top officials inciting the public in a way that dehumanized Palestinians, and for the tens of thousands of dead and wounded among the territory’s civilian population.
THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take steps to try to reduce further deaths and damage in the Gaza Strip but stopped short of demanding a stop to the blistering offensive that has decimated the Palestinian territory.
The court in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered a total of six provisional measures on Friday as it considers the genocide charges that South Africa brought against Israel. South Africa requested interim steps since the proceedings could take several years.
Court President Joan E. Donoghue said there were enough elements in South Africa’s arguments to continue the genocide case but that Israeli troops had to do much more in the meantime to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
She said the court was “of the view that Israel must take measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide.”
THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The United Nations’ top court has refused to throw out the genocide case that South Africa filed against Israel.
The International Court of Justice is not deciding Friday whether Israel has committed genocide in the Gaza Strip but only ruling on South Africa’s request for interim measures, including an order for Israel to halt its military offensive in Gaza.
While Israel asked the court to throw out the case, court president Joan E. Donoghue said a panel of 17 judges concluded that it has appropriate jurisdiction and therefore “cannot accede to Israel’s request for the case to be removed.”
Donoghue opened the hearing in The Hague, Netherlands, by noting that Israel’s war against Hamas “is causing massive civilian casualties, extensive destruction of civilian infrastructure and the displacement of the overwhelming majority of the population in Gaza.
“The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering,” the judge said.
RAMALLAH, West Bank — A Palestinian delegation plans to be in The Hague when the International Court of Justice announces whether it is ordering Israel to suspend its offensive against Hamas militants and to take other steps to protect Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
The world court is delivering its preliminary decisions in a genocide case that South Africa brought against Israel. The court is set to rule Friday only on South Africa’s request for interim measures to ease the suffering in Gaza while the case proceeds, a process expected to take several years.
“By moving quickly and issuing the ruling only two weeks after the oral hearings, the court acknowledges the urgency of the situation on the ground,” the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Meanwhile, a top official with Hamas says his group will abide by a cease-fire if the court in the Netherlands calls for one.
Osama Hamdan said Thursday that Hamas also would be ready to release the remaining hostages it is holding if Israel releases Palestinian prisoners.
Hamdan says Hamas is open to all initiatives for an exchange but that the hostages would not return home until there was “a comprehensive cease of the aggression against our people.” He added that any delays or procrastination “means more deaths among (Israelis).”
DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Fifteen Palestinians, including an infant, were killed in Israeli airstrikes on two apartment buildings in the central Gaza Strip, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the bodies at a local hospital Friday.
The strikes hit the Nuseirat refugee camp on Thursday evening, and the dead were taken to the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah.
One of the bombardments killed seven members of the Rawah family, including a 5-month-old baby.
The strikes came as the Israeli army continued to expand its assault on the southern half of war-stricken Gaza, with a focus on Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city.
The Israeli military said its troops were engaging in close, urban combat with Hamas fighters in neighborhoods of Khan Younis. The military says it is calling in airstrikes and attack helicopters to hit militants allegedly spotted with rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.
Earlier this week,the military ordered civilians to evacuate most of the western half of the city and the Khan Younis refugee camp.
Hamas has reported that troops from the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the group’s military wing, are battling Israeli forces in the heart of the city.
RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The number of Palestinians killed in Gaza since the start of the Israel-Hamas war has surpassed 26,000, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday.
The ministry said the total number of dead is 26,083, with 64,487 Palestinians wounded since the start of the war on Oct. 7. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll, but has said about two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
In the past 24 hours, 183 people were killed and 377 others were injured, ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said in a statement.
Israel’s blistering ground and air offensive has decimated vast swaths of Gaza during the nearly 4-month-old war. The conflict broke out on Oct. 7 when Hamas militants stormed southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted some 250.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — South Africa’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it was seeking an interim ruling that “Israel immediately cease its military operations in Gaza, take reasonable measures to prevent the genocide of Palestinians, ensure that the displaced return to their homes and have access to humanitarian assistance, including adequate food, water, fuel, medical and hygiene supplies, shelter and clothing.”
The statement late Thursday also said Israel should “take necessary steps to punish those involved in the genocide and preserve the evidence of genocide.” Israel has denied the allegations of genocide.
South Africa will be represented at the ruling at The Hague by Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, who spoke with United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken by phone Thursday, according to the State Department. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken spoke about the need to protect civilians in the war in Gaza and ensure there was humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, while working toward lasting regional peace that “ensures Israel’s security and advances the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.”
“The secretary reaffirmed support for Israel’s right to ensure the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7 can never be repeated,” Miller said."
62531SQAS1_8OGF3F49N2S791F,The EU sanctions 6 companies accused of trying to undermine stability in conflict-torn Sudan,_,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sudan-conflict-eu-sanctions-companies-9f26b224d9946b811a58e916ec23ea62,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union imposed sanctions Monday on six companies it said are responsible for trying to undermine stability in conflict-ravaged Sudan, largely targeting firms linked to weapons procurement and manufacturing.
Sudan plunged into chaos last April when long-simmering tensions between the military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, erupted into street battles in the capital, Khartoum, and other areas including the western Darfur region.
The fighting has displaced 7 million people and killed 12,000, according to the United Nations. Local doctors’ groups and activists say the true death toll is far higher.
Given the “gravity of the situation in Sudan,” the EU statement said, sanctions were imposed on two companies making weapons and vehicles for Sudan’s armed forces, the Zadna International Company for Investment controlled by the armed forces and three companies involved in procuring military equipment for the RSF.
Five of the companies are Sudanese. One is registered in the United Arab Emirates.
The companies ’ assets will be frozen in the EU, and EU citizens are banned from making funds or economic resources available to them.
The United States in recent months has imposed sanctions on senior Sudanese military leaders and companies, including former Foreign Minister Ali Karti and a brother of Dagalo.

(AP) — New Jersey’s Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that an Atlantic City casino is not entitled to payouts from business interruption insurance for losses during the COVID-19 outbreak, determining that the presence of the virus did not constitute the kind of “direct physical loss or damage” required for such a payout.
The case involved the Ocean Casino Resort’s claims against three insurance companies — AIG Specialty Insurance Co., American Guarantee & Liability Insurance Co. and Interstate Fire & Casualty Co. Those insurers largely denied payouts to the casino, saying it did not suffer direct physical loss or damage because of the virus.
The casino sued and defeated an attempt by the insurers to dismiss the case. But that decision was reversed by an appellate court.
The high court agreed to take the case in order to resolve the legal question of what constituted loss or damage.
“Based on the plain terms of the policies, we conclude that in order to show a ‘direct physical loss’ of its property or ‘direct physical . . . damage’ to its property under the policy language at issue, (parent company AC Ocean Walk LLC) was required to demonstrate that its property was destroyed or altered in a manner that rendered it unusable or uninhabitable,” the court wrote in a unanimous decision.

“At most, it has alleged that it sustained a loss of business during the COVID-19 government-mandated suspension of business operations because it was not permitted to use its property as it would otherwise have done,” the opinion read.
It concluded that the casino’s pleadings “do not support a finding that it is entitled to insurance coverage.”
The casino declined comment Wednesday.
The ruling is similar to others reached in state and federal courts around the country, including cases where payouts were denied involving a chain of California movie theaters; a Los Angeles real estate firm; a group of hotels in Pennsylvania; and a group of hotels and a law firm in New Jersey.
During arguments in September before the Supreme Court, Stephen Orlofsky, a lawyer for Ocean, said the casino took several steps to respond to the virus, including employing air filtration systems and using “industrial-strength” cleaning supplies.
But David Roth, a lawyer for American Guarantee, said the policies require there to be physical damage to the property, which he said did not occur at the casino. He said 14 state Supreme Courts around the nation have held that the mere interruption of business activity during the pandemic does not constitute physical losses.
Ocean maintained that in addition to an order by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy closing the casinos for 3 1/2 months in 2020, it also shut down because of “the concern that the virus was having on the physical surfaces and the air” inside the casino.

69LUXZTYQ8_FTNCHLP532W0NSB,France’s constitutional court rejects several measures in controversial immigration law,_,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/france-migration-law-protests-83d89fd9578214d3e5c1f38da1bb9bf3,"PARIS (AP) — France’s Constitutional Council on Thursday rejected several measures in a divisive new immigration law that critics call inhumane, in a new blow to President Emmanuel Macron and his government.
The council said in a statement that it threw out all or part of 32 of the law’s 86 articles, saying they were contrary to the constitution. Macron and lawmakers had sought the body’s assessment of the law, passed last year after a torturous debate.
Among measures rejected were those making it harder for immigrants to bring their families to France, and limiting their access to social welfare. The bill also strengthens France’s ability to deport foreigners considered undesirable.
Groups who see the law as contrary to French values — and as a gift to the increasingly influential far right — protested ahead of the ruling outside the Constitutional Council across from the Louvre Museum in central Paris. Other protests were also planned, and Paris police deployed special security measures for the day.
The demonstrators accused the government of caving into pressure from Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party to get the law through parliament. About 75,000 people protested across France on Sunday over the legislation, urging Macron not to sign it into law.
The dispute comes amid tensions across Europe around migration and as anti-immigration parties on the far right are rising in popularity ahead of European Parliament elections in June.
Macron has moved increasingly to the right, notably on security and immigration issues, since rising to office on a pro-business, centrist platform."
6KIYKX3EEJ_HMKEJHO6UXO2MMI,Cameroon starts world’s first malaria vaccine program for children,By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/malaria-vaccine-cameroon-children-disease-cdaf5baa0b7b0aa3ad056101a07d174c,"Cameroon will be the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine as the shots are rolled out in Africa.
The campaign due to start Monday was described by officials as a milestone in the decades-long effort to curb the mosquito-spread disease on the continent, which accounts for 95% of the world’s malaria deaths.
“The vaccination will save lives. It will provide major relief to families and the country’s health system,” said Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer at the Gavi vaccines alliance, which is helping Cameroon secure the shots.
The Central Africa nation hopes to vaccinate about 250,000 children this year and next year. Gavi said it is working with 20 other African countries to help them get the vaccine and that those countries will hopefully immunize more than 6 million children through 2025.
In Africa, there are about 250 million cases of the parasitic disease each year, including 600,000 deaths, mostly in young children.

Cameroon will use the first of two recently approved malaria vaccines, known as Mosquirix. The World Health Organization endorsed the vaccine two years ago, acknowledging that that even though it is imperfect, its use would still dramatically reduce severe infections and hospitalizations.
The GlaxoSmithKline-produced shot is only about 30% effective, requires four doses and protection begins to fade after several months. The vaccine was tested in Africa and used in pilot programs in three countries.
GSK has said it can only produce about 15 million doses of Mosquirix a year and some experts believe a second malaria vaccine developed by Oxford University and approved by WHO in October might be a more practical solution. That vaccine is cheaper, requires three doses and India’s Serum Institute said they could make up to 200 million doses a year.
Gavi’s Nguyen said they hoped there might be enough of the Oxford vaccines available to begin immunizing people later this year.
Neither of the malaria vaccines stop transmission, so other tools like bed nets and insecticidal spraying will still be critical. The malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills.

(AP) — Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. announced plans Thursday to build an $800 million data center in southern Indiana that’s expected to create 100 long-term, high-paying jobs when it’s operational and several hundred other jobs during construction.
Work will begin this month on the nearly 700,000-square-foot (65,032-square-meter) data center at the River Ridge Commerce Center in Jeffersonville, Meta said. Jeffersonville is an Ohio River city located just north of Louisville, Kentucky.
The Indiana Economic Development Corp. has committed to granting Meta a 35-year sales tax exemption for the data center, among other performance-based project incentives.
The project is expected to be operational in 2026, the company said. During peak construction, it’s expected to support 1,250 construction jobs.
Gov. Eric Holcomb, who attended Thursday’s announcement at the business park, said it was “a great day for Indiana and for our southeast region.”
The Jeffersonville center will become Meta’s 18th data center in the U.S. and its 22nd worldwide, helping power Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta said in a news release.
“We are thrilled to make Indiana and Jeffersonville our new home,” said Brad Davis, Meta’s director of data center community and economic development."
78F6UEB511_0YCEZPFXP6E1WV9,Pretrial detention for American reporter accused of spying in Russia extended through March,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/gershkovich-russia-jailed-journalist-wsj-6355a64af82338408373f89330c33661,"MOSCOW (AP) — A court in Moscow Friday extended the pretrial detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested on espionage charges, until the end of March, meaning the journalist will spend at least a year behind bars in Russia.
United States Consul General Stuart Wilson attended the hearing at Lefortovo District Court, which took place behind closed doors because authorities say details of the criminal case against the American journalist are classified.
In video shared by state news agency Ria Novosti, Gershkovich was shown listening to the ruling, standing in a court cage wearing a hooded top and light blue jeans. He was pictured a short time later walking towards a prison van to leave the court.
Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March while on a reporting trip to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Moscow.
Russia’s Federal Security Service alleged that the reporter, “acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.”

Gershkovich and the Journal deny the allegations, and the U.S. government has declared him to be wrongfully detained. Russian authorities haven’t detailed any evidence to support the espionage charges.
During his end-of-year news conference in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is in dialogue with the United States on bringing home both Gershkovich and jailed American Paul Whelan, and that the Kremlin hopes to “find a solution” even though “it’s not easy.”
Putin was replying to a question about an offer the Biden administration made to secure the two men’s release. The U.S. State Department reported it in December, without offering details, and said Russia rejected it.
“We have contacts on this matter with our American partners, there’s a dialogue on this issue. It’s not easy, I won’t go into details right now. But in general, it seems to me that we’re speaking a language each of us understands,” Putin said.
“I hope we will find a solution,” he continued. “But, I repeat, the American side must hear us and make a decision that will satisfy the Russian side as well.”
The Russian Foreign Ministry has said it will consider a swap for Gershkovich only after a verdict in his trial. In Russia, espionage trials can last for more than a year.
Gershkovich is the first American reporter to be charged with espionage in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Gershkovich is being held at Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, notorious for its harsh conditions.
Analysts have said that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips after U.S.-Russian tensions soared when Russia sent troops into Ukraine. At least two U.S. citizens arrested in Russia in recent years, including WNBA star Brittney Griner, have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the U.S.
A previous version of this story incorrectly described the court hearing as an appeal. It was a hearing on extending pretrial detention."
7COWJIMSJN_Z5BMR338D7M5EUI,US and British militaries launch new round of joint strikes against multiple Houthi sites in Yemen,By LOLITA C. BALDOR and TARA COPP,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/us-british-strikes-houthi-yemen-4ca86a7c0f484fcdf9c386cd752c1878,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and British militaries bombed multiple targets in eight locations used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on Monday night, the second time the two allies have conducted coordinated retaliatory strikes on an array of the rebels’ missile-launching capabilities.
According to officials, the U.S. and U.K. used warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets to take out Houthi missile storage sites, drones and launchers. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a military operation, said Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands contributed to the mission, including with intelligence and surveillance.
In a joint statement, the six allied nations said the strikes specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis’ missile and air surveillance capabilities. They added, “Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.”
Britain’s Ministry of Defense confirmed that four Royal Air Force Typhoon jets struck “multiple targets at two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield” with precision-guided bombs. The strikes, said Defense Secretary Grant Shapps, were “aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities” and would “deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade.”
One senior U.S. military official told reporters the strikes dropped between 25 and 30 munitions and hit multiple targets in each location, adding that the U.S. “observed good impacts and effects” at all sites, including the destruction of more advanced weapons in the underground storage facility. The official said this is the first time such advanced weapons were targeted.

The official also said fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier conducted strikes, and other ships involved included the USS Gravely and USS Mason, both naval destroyers, and the USS Philippine Sea, a cruiser.
The joint operation comes about 10 days after U.S. and British warships and fighter jets struck more than 60 targets in 28 locations. That was the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.
The Houthis’ media office said in an online statement Monday that raids targeted Sanaa, Yemen’s capital. And Jamal Hassan, a resident from south Sanaa, told The Associated Press that two strikes landed near his home, setting off car alarms in the street. An Associated Press journalist in Sanaa also heard aircraft flying above the skies of Sanaa overnight Monday.
Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said there were raids on three areas of Sanaa: al-Dailami Air Base just north of the capital, Sarif, northeast of the city center, and al-Hafa, which is south of Sanaa.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke with President Joe Biden earlier Monday. Sunak’s office said the two leaders agreed to take “as needed, targeted military action to degrade Houthi capabilities.”
The latest barrage of allied attacks marks the eighth time the U.S. has conducted strikes on Houthi sites since Jan. 12. And it follows an almost-daily assault on Houthi missile launchers by U.S. fighter jets and ship-based Tomahawks over the past week. The rapid response missions, which officials said go after launchers that are armed and ready to fire, demonstrate the military’s increasing ability to watch, detect and strike militant activities in Yemen.
The chaotic wave of attacks and reprisals involving the United States, its allies and foes suggests that the retaliatory strikes haven’t deterred the Houthis from their campaign against Red Sea shipping, and that the broader regional war that the U.S. has spent months trying to avoid is becoming closer to reality.
For months, the Houthis have attacked ships in the region’s waterways that they say are either linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports. They say their attacks aim to end the Israeli air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip that was triggered by the Palestinian militant group Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. But any such links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as the attacks continue.
The U.S. and allies warned of retaliation for weeks, and the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning on Jan. 3 to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action.
That threat, however, had little noticeable effect. The Houthis continued to attack ships in the region, including at times appearing to target U.S. Navy and U.S.-owned ships, in addition to the wide range of commercial vessels.
Of the eight strike missions on Yemen this month, all but the two with Britain were conducted by the U.S. military alone. Five of the latest strikes were labeled self-defense to take out missiles ready to fire. The most recent, on Saturday, struck and destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch, according to Central Command.
The Biden administration has also put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing, while also allowing vital humanitarian aid to continue flowing to impoverished Yemenis.
U.S. defense officials have said they believe the strikes have degraded the Houthis’ weapons and strike capabilities. But Biden and others have acknowledged that the rebels are well-equipped by Iran and are likely to continue the attacks.
The Houthis, meanwhile, have made it clear that they have no intention of scaling back their assault. In the wake of the first U.S. and British joint attack, Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their Foreign Ministry, said, “America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression.”
The continued harassment of the ships has driven the U.S. and international partners to take extraordinary steps to defend them through a joint mission named Operation Prosperity Guardian, in which they provide a protective umbrella for vessels traveling the critical waterway that runs from the Suez Canal down to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait.
About 400 commercial vessels transit the southern Red Sea at any given time. And the ongoing violence has prompted companies to reroute their ships, sending them around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope instead — a much longer and less efficient passage.

7DVIBRQLT8_W10TLNIIA8VK1R8,Dueling political factions demonstrate in Venezuela’s capital as presidential election race heats up,By REGINA GARCIA CANO,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-opposition-machado-963f0850c1ef279ffd43686c28363ee4,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Dueling political factions took to the streets of Venezuela’s capital on Tuesday for the first competing rallies of the presidential election year, showcasing their ability to draw people en masse, as voters grapple with political disappointments and uncertainty over the candidate who ultimately will challenge President Nicolás Maduro.
Supporters of Maduro’s ruling party and opposition leader María Corina Machado demonstrated in Caracas a day after Venezuela’s top prosecutor announced the detention of more than 30 people and arrest warrants for a dozen others who allegedly plotted efforts to destabilize the South American country’s government.
But if either camp had hoped to scare the other in numbers, neither gathered the tens of thousands each were capable of last decade.
Maduro supporters — overwhelmingly a mix of state workers, ruling-party community leaders and loyalists of the late President Hugo Chávez — walked across the city, with dozens of them also concentrating in the same plaza where Machado, the winner of an October presidential primary election, was expected to address her own followers.
More than an hour after Machado was supposed to show up, her supporters left the plaza and stopped traffic, allowing her to address them from a makeshift stage as they waved Venezuelan flags.

“They talk about elections, but they are terrified of elections,” Machado said, referring to Maduro and his allies. “But because they know that they do not have votes, they hide... behind threats, persecution, lies, a fabricated sentence, to try to end us. Let them know clearly, no one takes us out of this electoral route.”
Maduro and the opposition faction behind the primary agreed last year to hold a presidential election in the second half of 2024. The agreement, which also calls on both sides to work on free and fair electoral conditions, earned Maduro’s government some relief from U.S. economic sanctions and resulted in the release of several political prisoners.
Maduro will seek to add six more years to his decade-long, crisis-ridden presidency. His challenger’s participation in the election remains in doubt even though she won the primary with more than 90% of support.
The government has banned the former lawmaker from running for office, and Attorney General Tarek William Saab has opened criminal investigations against organizers of the primary, which was carried out with no support from Venezuela’s electoral authorities. Authorities have not shown any evidence supporting the ban against Machado, who has continued to campaign, insisting that voters, not ruling-party loyalists, are the rightful decision makers of her candidacy.
The uncertainty is sowing doubts among her supporters.
Digital marketing manager Yeickson Ramos considers Machado “the most serious and credible option” that the opposition has “to challenge the government.” But at Tuesday’s rally, Ramos, 33, acknowledged the urgent need for the opposition to determine the steps to follow if the government does not lift Machado’s ban.
“Will she choose (her substitute)?” said Ramos, who has witnessed the apathy that previous opposition failures have created among voters. “Or will there be an internal negotiation that concludes it can’t be any of the primary candidates who received minimal support, but we are going to look for an option that is attractive to the population.”
The U.S.-backed opposition stunned its allies and adversaries when more than 2.4 million people, included in neighborhoods long considered strongholds of the ruling party, voted in the primary. The high turnout happened despite numerous setbacks and government efforts to discredit and discourage participation in the contest.
In December, Maduro’s government was stunned again when it held a referendum on claiming part of Guyana and voting centers appeared virtually deserted throughout Election Day. Maduro and his allies insist more than 10 million people voted. Still, the absence of long lines typical of elections called for by the ruling party displayed its growing inability to mobilize supporters, even when some are required to submit proof of participation to keep their jobs or maintain certain government benefits.
Chavistas — supporters of Chávez and his self-described socialist policies — have long been cautious when expressing criticism of Maduro, who was handpicked by Chávez to lead Venezuela shortly before he died in 2013. A complex ten-year crisis that pushed millions into poverty coupled with recent corruption scandals is loosening lips.
Leonard Suarez, a Caracas lawyer, voted for Chávez and Maduro in previous elections. This year, he says he wants to see on the ballot someone other than Maduro representing Chávez’s ideals after concluding that “keeping only one person in power breeds corruption.” In the name of democracy, Suarez said, Machado better make it to the ballot.
“She should participate because it would be an example of the democracy that exists in our country,” he said near the ruling party’s demonstration.
Machado, a free-market supporter, asked Venezuela’s highest court last month to review her ban. No final ruling has been issued, but her refusal to walk away from the race has intensified repressive actions against her and her team.
Saab in early December ordered the arrest of three of Machado’s campaign staffers after accusing them, without making public any evidence, of conspiring against the referendum on the territorial dispute. Meanwhile, Roberto Abdul, a close ally of Machado with whom she co-founded a pro-democracy organization was taken into custody and released several days later under a prisoner-swap deal between Maduro and the U.S. government.
On Tuesday, Machado accused Maduro’s government of vandalizing the headquarters of her party, Vente Venezuela, and denounced the arrest of a state-level campaign manager. Her party in a statement said the manager’s whereabouts remain unknown after police officers arrived at his house “without a court order.”
The U.S. government has threatened to yank some of the sanctions relief it granted Maduro in October if he fails to guarantee a leveled playing field for the presidential election. Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, in a tweet Tuesday reiterated the Biden administration’s position.
“Deeply concerned by recent actions against the opposition & civil society in Venezuela based on unsupported allegations,” Nichols tweeted.”

Mark McCloskey pleaded guilty in 2021 to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and was fined $750. Republican Gov. Mike Parson pardoned him, as well as his wife Patricia McCloskey, weeks later.
Mark McCloskey filed a form Tuesday seeking to have the misdemeanor scrubbed from his record, multiple St. Louis media outlets reported.
The McCloskeys said they felt threatened by the protesters, who were passing their home in June 2020 on their way to demonstrate in front of the mayor’s house nearby. It was one of hundreds of demonstrations around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The couple also said the group was trespassing on a private street.
Mark McCloskey emerged from his home with an AR-15-style rifle, and Patricia McCloskey waved a semi-automatic pistol, according to the indictment.

Chief of the General Staff Gen. Patrick Saunders said preparing for a potential land war would have to be a “whole-of-nation” undertaking. He praised European nations closer to Russia for “prudently laying the foundations for national mobilization.”
Saunders, who has long argued for more military spending and is due to leave his job this year, said that “within the next three years, it must be credible to talk of a British Army of 120,000.”
“But this is not enough,” he added during a speech at the International Armored Vehicles conference in London. “Taking preparatory steps to enable placing our societies on a war footing when needed are now not merely desirable but essential.”
He said “Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.”

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesman, Max Blain, said the government “has no intention” of introducing conscription.
“The British military has a proud tradition of being a voluntary force. There are no plans to change that,” he said.
He added that “engaging in hypothetical wars” was “not helpful.”
Defense Secretary Grant Shapps has also used stark language about the threat to the U.K. Last week he referred to Britain “moving from a post-war to pre-war world.”
Despite that, the government has no plans to increase the size of the army from its current level of about 74,000 full-time troops, down from 102,000 in 2006. The government says it will increase military spending from just over 2% of GDP to 2.5% -- still much less than at the height of the Cold War.
The British Army conscripted soldiers during World War I, and again during and after World War II, but it has been an all-volunteer force for most of its 364-year history."

The hanging of Mohammad Qobadlu, who had been convicted in the death of a policeman, drew condemnation from U.N. experts who said Qobadlu faced unfair proceedings. It was the ninth execution since the protests, according to a count by The Associated Press.
A report on state television said Qobadlu was executed after being sentenced for killing a policeman and injuring five others when he ran them over in his car during a rally in the town of Parand, near the capital of Tehran.
The TV report said the 23-year-old Qobadlu, who had confessed to his crime, had access to a lawyer during the trial. Qobadlu had appealed his death sentence, handed down by a lower court, but the Supreme Court later upheld the original verdict.
Later Tuesday, a group of U.N. experts strongly condemned the execution of Qobadlu in a statement, saying that he had suffered from a psychosocial disability. The group said it was “alarmed” by reports of unfair trial proceedings against him and other defendants, including what they maintained was the denial of access to lawyers.

Qobadlu’s lawyer, Amir Raisian, said in a tweet on “X” said the verdict and sentence came despite his efforts to appeal for another trial for his client. He said such an execution could be characterized as “murder.”
The monthslong unrest followed the Sept. 16, 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who had been detained by Iran’s morality police allegedly because she improperly wore the mandatory Islamic veil, or hijab.
At least 529 people have been killed and scores of thousands of others have been detained in the demonstrations. The protests gradually died down in the early months of last year.
In December, Iran executed a bank guard convicted of fatally shooting a senior cleric last April. Ayatollah Abbas Ali Soleimani, 77, was the most senior member of the clergy who was killed since the protests and the subsequent security crackdown on the demonstrators. The guard’s motive for the shooting were not explained.
Though Shiite clergy have long held an important role in Iran, particularly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, discontent has increased in recent years during waves of protests over economic, political and civil rights issues.
In November, Iran hanged Milad Zhohrevand, 21, in the western city of Hamadan for shooting and killing a member of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during the protests.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran hanged Farhad Salimi, a Kurdish cleric who had spent 14 years behind bars over the killing of another clergyman, human rights groups reported. Iran has offered no elaboration."

The National Oil Corp. said in a terse statement that it lifted the force majeure at the Sharara oil field in the country’s south and resumed full production. It didn’t provide further details. Force majeure is a legal maneuver that releases a company from its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.
The company had activated the maneuver on Jan. 7 after protesters from the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, shut down the field to protest fuel shortages.
Over the past two weeks the company’s chief, Farhat Bengdara, and military officials from eastern Libya have been negotiating with the protest leaders, Fezzan Group.
Barzingi al-Zarrouk, the protesters’ spokesman, announced that they have suspended their protest after they reached agreement with the company.

He said the agreement was brokered by the self-styled Libyan National Army, which is commanded by powerful military general Khalifa Hifter. Hifter’s forces control Libya’s east and much of the south.
The protesters have reportedly called for rehabilitating infrastructure and repairing roads in the southwestern region of Fezzan, one of the historic three provinces of Libya. They previously closed the field for two days in July.
Libya’s light crude has long featured in the country’s yearslong civil conflict, with rival militias and foreign powers jostling for control of Africa’s largest oil reserves.
Libya has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The North African nation has for most of the past decade been split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by militias and foreign governments."

The protesters, chanting “Students, United, Will Win,” filed past the main Athens University building and statues of the ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Socrates as they marched through central Athens and riot police took up positions in nearby side streets.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ center-right government is pushing through several key pieces of legislation early in the new year, taking advantage of a landslide reelection in 2023, and a huge lead in opinion polls.
It argues the measure would stop thousands of Greeks going abroad each year to study, and would keep vital skills in the country.
But opponents say it would undermine public universities, which are already facing funding difficulties.
The government has faced a series of protests by various professional groups in recent weeks, triggered by the legislative reforms and the cost of living crisis.
In central Greece Thursday, farmers used tractors to block sections of a highway, demanding additional financial support from the government to reduce production costs.
Farmers’ groups told The Associated Press that they were holding meetings Thursday to consider further action."
8OZJ9YSOIY_OEGIIPAEZL3O6CA,"EU pushes for Palestinian statehood, rejecting Israeli leader’s insistence that it’s off the table",By LORNE COOK,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-eu-europe-statehood-ee6db2a05e31038278ab5d702aaca8b9,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union foreign ministers argued Monday that the creation of a Palestinian state is the only credible way to achieve peace in the Middle East, expressing concern about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s clear rejection of the idea.
“The declarations of Benjamin Netanyahu are worrying. There will be a need for a Palestinian state with security guarantees for all,” French Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Sejourne told reporters in Brussels, where ministers met to discuss the war in Gaza.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and Palestinian counterpart Riad Malki were also in Belgium’s capital for the talks. The issue of Gaza’s future has set Israel in opposition to the United States and its Arab allies who are trying to mediate an end to the fighting in the besieged Palestinian territory.
The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has surpassed 25,000, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Israel said Sunday that another of the hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war had died.
The EU is the world’s top provider of aid to the Palestinians but holds little leverage over Israel, despite being its biggest trading partner. The 27 member countries are also deeply divided in their approach. But as the death toll in Gaza mounts, so do calls for a halt to the fighting.

“Gaza is in a situation of extreme urgency. There is a risk of famine. There is a risk of epidemics. The violence must stop,” said Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency. Not all EU member countries agree on the cease-fire call.
Lahbib said a two-state solution was “the only way to establish peace in a durable way in the region.”
Israel appears far from achieving its goals of crushing Hamas and freeing the more than 100 remaining hostages. But Netanyahu rejects Palestinian statehood and seeks open-ended military control over Gaza.
The dispute over the territory’s future — with no end in sight to the war — poses a major obstacle to any plans for postwar governance or reconstruction.
The European ministers had wanted to hear about Israel’s plans for the future.
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind?” asked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting. “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill off them?”
But Katz appeared reluctant to respond. He showed the ministers two videos: one about the creation of an artificial island off the coast of Gaza, the other a project for a rail linking the Middle East and India.
“I think the minister could have made better use of his time and focused on the deaths in Gaza,” Borrell said. Asked about persuading Katz of the merits of a two-state solution, Borrell conceded that “we weren’t able to get him to change his mind, but we weren’t expecting that.”
The Palestinian minister said a cease-fire is the most urgent need.
“We have to call collectively for a cease-fire. We cannot accept anything less,” Malki said.
He also called on the EU “to start contemplating sanctions against Netanyahu and others who are really destroying the chances for a two-state solution and for peace in the Middle East.”
Spain has pushed for a peace conference to discuss what might happen once the fighting is over. A future meeting in Brussels is in the works, but the timing remains unclear. The plan has the backing of some EU member countries, but others say it can only happen with Israel’s support.
“If Israel is not (at) the table, there is no use to have peace conferences,” Luxembourg Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel said. He does not believe Israel will be ready for talks as long as it believes that Hamas poses a danger.
The Israeli minister refused to respond when asked about the possibility of Palestinian statehood. Holding up pictures of Israeli hostages, he said he had come to seek support for Israel’s campaign to dismantle Hamas.
“We have to bring back our security. Our brave soldiers are fighting in very hard conditions,” he told reporters. The Israeli government’s aims, Katz said, are clear: “to bring back our hostages and restore security for the citizens of Israel.”
With regional tensions flaring, the ministers also gave their approval to an EU naval mission to help ensure maritime traffic security in the Red Sea, a major world trade route. Belgium has committed to send a frigate, and Germany could do the same. Italy also is willing to take part.
Borrell said that details remained to be ironed out, including when the mission might be launched.
For months, Yemen’s Houthi rebels have attacked ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports. U.S. airstrikes have hit sites of the Iranian-backed Houthis seven times, according to U.S. officials. U.K. forces participated in some strikes."
8YJOUOSW5N_INU3BEUGZ501NFY,Thousands protest in Slovakia against plan to amend penal code and close special prosecutor’s office,_,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-penal-code-protests-robert-fico-7fbd3c9cfb4f97298f00a0fca01c3e15,"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Thousands of people on Thursday joined growing street protests across Slovakia against a plan by populist Prime Minister Robert Fico to amend the penal code and eliminate a national prosecutors’ office.
The proposed changes have faced sharp criticism at home and abroad.
The plan approved by Fico’s coalition government includes abolishing the special prosecutors’ office, which handles serious crimes such as graft, organized crime and extremism. Those cases would be taken over by prosecutors in regional offices, which haven’t dealt with such crimes for 20 years.
The planned changes also include a reduction in punishments for corruption and some other crimes, including the possibility of suspended sentences, and a significant shortening of the statute of limitations.
Thursday’s protests took place in two dozens of cities and towns, including the capital, and spread also to Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Krakow in Poland and Paris.

“We’re not ready to give up,” Michal Šimečka, who heads the liberal Progressive Slovakia, the strongest opposition party, told the big crowd that filled the central SNP square in Bratislava.
“We will step up our pressure,” Šimečka said. ''We will defend justice and freedom in our country,” he said.
“Mafia, mafia” and “Fico mobster,” people chanted.
Earlier Thursday, the ruling coalition voted to use a fast-track parliamentary procedure to approve the changes. That means the draft legislation won’t be reviewed by experts and others usually involved in the common legislative procedures.
The coalition also voted to limit the discussion in the first of the three parliamentary readings. The opposition condemned the move.
“They decided to silence us in Parliament but they won’t silence you all,” Šimečka said.
The second reading, in which changes could possibly be made to the draft legislation, could take place next Wednesday while the final vote is possible by the end of next week.
President Zuzana Čaputová said the proposed changes jeopardize the rule of law and cause “unpredictable” damage to society.
Also, the European Parliament has questioned Slovakia’s ability to fight corruption if the changes are adopted. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office has said Slovakia’s plans threaten the protection of the EU’s financial interests and its anti-corruption framework.
Čaputová said she is willing to bring a constitutional challenge of the legislation. It’s unclear how the Constitutional Court might rule.
Fico returned to power for the fourth time after his scandal-tainted leftist party won Sept. 30 parliamentary elections on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform.
A number of people linked to the party face prosecution in corruption scandals.
Fico’s critics worry his return could lead Slovakia to abandon its pro-Western course and instead follow the direction of Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

920AO66LWU_KBDJEHJZD7ZMV9L,A Pennsylvania law shields teacher misconduct complaints. A judge ruled that’s unconstitutional,By MICHAEL RUBINKAM,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-teacher-discipline-confidentiality-lawsuit-f9a550ba6fa1e32a55e4d11ecf705d0d,"A Pennsylvania law that makes it a crime to release information about teacher disciplinary complaints is an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment, a federal judge has ruled. The judge sided with a school board member who sought to publicize a misconduct allegation against his son’s school psychologist — and criticize the state’s dismissal of it — without fear of being prosecuted for the disclosure.
The unusual case involves the Educator Discipline Act, a state law that controls how the Pennsylvania Department of Education investigates and prosecutes misconduct complaints against teachers and other school staff. The law’s confidentiality provision makes it a misdemeanor to disclose the existence of a state complaint or any information about it unless and until discipline is imposed.
Criminalizing disclosure of educator misconduct complaints is rare and perhaps unique among the states. Jimmy Adams, executive director of the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification, said he’s not aware of another state that has a similar law, although the state education agencies themselves are constrained from releasing information while an investigation is pending.
Proponents of the Pennsylvania statute say it’s needed to protect due process. Opponents say it allows teachers, and the state’s disciplinary system, to avoid scrutiny.
U.S. District Judge Karen S. Marston did not strike down the law itself in her Jan. 10 ruling. But she prohibited the Bucks County district attorney from applying it to the plaintiff, James Pepper, an attorney and school board member in the Philadelphia suburbs.

Pepper’s lawsuit grew out of the tangled, toxic politics of the Central Bucks School District, Pennsylvania’s third-largest school system, where cultural battles have raged over transgender athletes, sexualized content in books, and a “neutrality” policy that barred social and political advocacy in classrooms. Pepper wanted to talk publicly about his complaint against a Central Bucks school psychologist whom he accused of “weaponizing” his sons’ disabilities, but he feared prosecution under the Educator Discipline Act.
Ruling on Pepper’s challenge, Marston said the law’s confidentiality provision violated his free-speech right to discuss both the 2023 misconduct complaint, and the Department of Education’s subsequent determination that the complaint lacked legal merit.
The ruling does not prevent enforcement in other cases where educator confidentiality is violated under the law. But Pepper’s attorney, Aaron Martin, said he hopes the decision on First Amendment grounds will cause any prosecutor considering it to hesitate.
“This ruling is a victory for free speech,” Martin said. “We hope the effect ... will be to shine more light on the actions of government so that people can make up their own minds as to whether government agencies are properly fulfilling their duties.”
The state’s largest teachers union said it was disappointed by the ruling and called for an appeal.
“The confidentiality provision exists to protect the reputation, privacy, and due process rights of educators” who are accused, and ultimately cleared, of wrongdoing, said Chris Lilienthal, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Education Association. “It also protects student privacy and avoids unnecessary disruption of the educational process.”
It’s not clear whether the ruling will be appealed. Bucks County District Attorney Jennifer Schorn, who took office this month and inherited the case from her predecessor, declined to comment this week.
Pepper’s misconduct complaint centers on a January 2023 email that school psychologist Julia Szarko sent to his school district account. Szarko urged Pepper to vote against the board’s neutrality policy, which critics said targeted Pride flags and other symbols of support for LGBTQ+ students. Proponents said the policy applied to all political and social advocacy, and was necessary to prevent indoctrination in the classroom.
Szarko — who had worked with Pepper’s youngest son — began her email by commending his dedication to both of his disabled sons “with all of their incredible strengths but also their extensive needs.”
Pepper, a Republican, said in an interview that while Szarko was free to engage with him on a policy issue, it was “incredibly unprofessional” of her to “use information about my children that she’s learned as a school psychologist to lobby me on a vote.”
Worse, in Pepper’s view, was that by emailing his school district account, Szarko had made private information about his sons’ disabilities discoverable via the state’s open records law — a breach of professional ethics, Pepper asserted. He said it wasn’t the first time that district personnel had disclosed confidential information about his sons to hurt him politically.
Szarko did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
“Dr. Szarko weaponized our vulnerability, and her access to strictly confidential information about our sons, for her own political purposes,” Pepper wrote in his complaint to the state education department.
The department quickly dismissed Pepper’s complaint without opening a formal investigation, saying there was no legal basis to proceed.
“The allegations contained in the complaint, even if proved to be true, would not warrant professional discipline,” an education department lawyer wrote to Pepper on July 26.
Citing the Educator Discipline Act, the lawyer also warned Pepper that “any unauthorized release of confidential information” about the complaint was a crime. The state’s online complaint form included identical warning language.
Pepper viewed the confidentiality provision as plainly unconstitutional and filed suit.
“This prevents people from filing in the first instance, because they’re afraid of getting themselves enmeshed in something that has criminal liability attached to it,” Pepper said. “Who knows the bodies that are buried out there.”
It’s not clear whether Marston’s ruling will prompt the Department of Education to stop warning people to remain quiet about their complaints. A spokesperson said the agency was reviewing the decision, but did not answer detailed questions about the impact of the ruling on department policy."
926UXODB05_AFJDAECHV095E8X,NATO chief upbeat that Sweden could be ready to join the alliance by March,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/nato-sweden-turkey-hungary-enlargement-599b08d2d48b12b9e3bb19856a1d78ad,"BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg expressed optimism on Friday that Sweden could be ready to join the military organization by March, after receiving positive signals this week from holdouts Hungary and Turkey.
Sweden, along with its neighbor Finland, set aside decades of military nonalignment after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 to seek protection under NATO’s collective defense umbrella. Finland has since joined, and it along with the other 30 allies must all agree for Sweden to join.
But Turkey and Hungary have held up proceedings.
“Sweden’s entry into NATO will make the whole alliance stronger,” Stoltenberg told reporters as he provided details about talks this with week with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and noted new developments in Turkey.
“The message I have received from Budapest is that the parliament will reconvene at the end of February, so we have to wait for that. But I’m absolutely confident, and I count on Hungary,” Stoltenberg said.

Initially, Hungary gave no clear reason for the delays, and Orbán had insisted that his government wouldn’t be the last to endorse Sweden. But the tone toward Stockholm hardened, as the European Commission refused to allow Hungary access to EU funds over democratic backsliding.
Budapest accused Swedish politicians of telling “blatant lies” about the state of Hungary’s democracy.
Orbán, who has broken ranks with NATO allies by adopting a Kremlin-friendly stance toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Tuesday that he had invited Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson to Budapest to discuss “future cooperation in the field of security and defense as allies and partners.”
Unless an emergency session of parliament is called to debate Sweden’s bid, the assembly is due to sit on Feb. 26.
To let Sweden join, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan imposed a series of conditions including a tougher stance on groups that Turkey considers to be threats to its security, like Kurdish militants and members of a network he blames for a failed coup in 2016.
Separately, but linked to his approval, Erdogan insisted on a fighter-jet deal with the United States.
On Tuesday, Turkish lawmakers finally held a vote on the issue and ratified Sweden’s accession protocol by 287 votes to 55. The Turkish government finalized the step Thursday by publishing the measure in an official gazette.
Stoltenberg welcomed the fact that on Thursday night Erdogan “gave his signature to the decision of the parliament, so now all decisions are in place in Turkey.”
Sweden will become NATO’s 32nd member once Hungary completes its procedures and the “instruments of ratification” of all allies have been received by the U.S. State Department."
9A8Q4DHEIC_YA8RJPVSGC83F26,Senators are racing to win support for a border deal as aid to Ukraine hangs in the balance,By STEPHEN GROVES,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-border-security-congress-joe-biden-861ae00d162a5027f929c0f04ca30625,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate negotiators were laboring Monday to win wide support for a deal on border policy as they entered what could be a pivotal stretch for a painstakingly negotiated compromise that could open the door for Republican votes to replenish U.S. wartime aid for Ukraine.
A core group of negotiators has worked in private for nearly two months over changes to U.S. border and immigration policy and hoped to unveil the legislation later this week.
But the bipartisan group is treading on one of the most explosive issues in American politics, and the legislation faces heavy skepticism from the wings of both political parties, including Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, an arch-conservative who has shown little willingness to compromise on the issue.
With the House on recess, the Senate has an opportunity this week to gain momentum for the initiative. But Republican Senate leaders said they did not expect to vote on the bill this week as negotiations turned to funding the policy changes.
Republican senators want a robust showing of GOP support for the bill to put pressure on Johnson to take it up. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell’s ability to marshal his conference for the border measures could ultimately decide the fate of one of his key priorities: bolstering U.S. support for democratic allies around the world.

“The entire world understands what’s at stake here in the Senate in the coming weeks,” McConnell said in a floor speech.
It’s a goal shared with President Joe Biden, who is requesting $110 billion from Congress to provide wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel, support allies in the Asian-Pacific and overhaul the U.S. immigration system. However, the emergency funding package has been delayed months in Congress after Republicans insisted that border policy changes also be included in the package.
“President Biden has also made clear he’s willing to work with Republicans in a big way — in a big way — on border security,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “All of us on the Democratic side are serious about getting something done.”
He also cautioned, “It’s certainly not a done deal yet.”
It remains to be seen whether the border policy changes, which have been negotiated in private with top White House officials, will be enough to satisfy most Republican senators. Democrats have questions of their own, including whether the border policies will harm migrants seeking asylum in the U.S., and some in the party are pushing to condition military aid for Israel on humanitarian standards.
A small group of three senators has tried to craft a package that gains support from centrists of both parties.
“You get as many votes as you can on both sides,” said Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona independent who has been central to the negotiations. “But yeah, not everyone’s going to be happy.”
The proposal would toughen the asylum process with a goal of cutting the number of migrants who come to the southern U.S. border to make an asylum claim. The group has mostly reached agreements on policy changes, but on Monday was working with Senate appropriators to determine funding levels for the programs.
“We can’t create new funding and new programming and then not fund it,” said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the lead Democratic negotiator. “So if you’re committed to the policy change, you have to be equally as committed to funding the policy change.”
Biden had already requested $14 billion in the national security package to bolster the immigration system, including sending financial aid to local governments that have absorbed the historic number of people migrating to the U.S. But the Senate proposal also calls for the expansion of a Biden administration program that tracks families seeking asylum with electronic surveillance like ankle bracelet monitors until they are given an initial interview to determine if they are likely fleeing persecution in their home country, according to two people familiar with the talks who spoke anonymously to discuss the private negotiations.
“The overall policy issues we’re pretty well established on,” said Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead Republican negotiator. He added that negotiators were still reviewing legislative text to make sure it didn’t have unintended consequences.
The Senate proposal would also give federal authorities the ability to expel migrants at the border if the number of encounters reached a certain number. The talks had also floundered on Republican demands to restrict the executive branch’s ability to allow migrants into the country through exceptions to immigration law called humanitarian parole, but negotiators had discussed compromises, including placing limits on how parole can be used.
The policy could still trip up the compromise if many Republicans are displeased that the changes don’t go far enough.
“Parole is the stickler,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said after a weekly leadership meeting. “If you leave open the ability to just release people on parole, it creates a backdoor, which doesn’t solve any problem.”
But Democrats are trying to protect a policy that has historically been used to provide urgent relief to people fleeing war and unrest around the world, including from Central America, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Vietnam. The Biden administration has aggressively used parole authority, including by allowing up to 30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela into the country if they have a financial sponsor and a plane ticket.
“I am skeptical of any demolition of the president’s power in this area,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat of Illinois, who added that he was waiting to see bill details before passing final judgement.
Durbin also said he was worried about the signs of resistance coming from the Republican-controlled House. Johnson, the speaker, has repeatedly called for Republicans to insist on a conservative plan intended to choke off asylum claims. He has also charged that the problems at the border have been caused by Biden’s policies and could be changed through executive actions.
Still, Congress has not made significant changes to immigration and border law in decades and the politics around it have only become more deeply entrenched.
Democrats have bemoaned the Republican decision to tie Ukraine aid with border policy changes. Schumer, D-N.Y., sought to underscore the urgency of the situation, saying that Ukraine is running low on ammunition.
“The future of the war in Ukraine hangs in the balance,” Schumer said. “The security of our Western democracy hangs in the balance.”"

9L91THZ8UT_U640GJ3AUG1KOIG,Danish report underscores ‘systematic illegal behavior’ in adoptions of children from South Korea,By JAN M. OLSEN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/denmark-south-korea-adoptions-49eb9356a365b6fbe272a8c239941a15,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A Danish report on Thursday said adoptions of children from South Korea to Denmark in the 1970s and 1980s was “characterized by systematic illegal behavior” in the Asian country.
These violations, the report said, made it “possible to change information about a child’s background and adopt a child without the knowledge of the biological parents.”
The report was the latest in a dark chapter of international adoptions. In 2013, the government in Seoul started requiring foreign adoptions to go through family courts. The move ended the decadeslong policy of allowing private agencies to dictate child relinquishments, transfer of custodies and emigration.
The Danish Appeals Board, which supervises international adoptions, said there was “an unfortunate incentive structure where large sums of money were transferred between the Danish and South Korean organizations” over the adoptions.
The 129-page report, published by an agency under Denmark’s ministry of social affairs, focused on the period from Jan. 1, 1970 to Dec. 31, 1989.

A total of 7,220 adoptions were carried out from South Korea to Denmark during the two decades.
The report based its findings on 60 cases from the three privately run agencies in Denmark — DanAdopt, AC Boernehjaelp and Terres des Hommes — that handled adoptions from South Korea. The first two merged to become Danish International Adoption while the third agency closed its adoptions in 1999.
The agency wrote that two of the agencies — DanAdopt and AC Boernehjaelp — “were aware of this practice” of changing information about the child’s background.
The report was made after a number of issues raised by the organization Danish Korean Rights Group. In 2022, Peter Møller, the head of the rights group, also submitted documents at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Seoul.
“Danish organizations continuously expressed a desire to maintain a high number of adoptions of children with a specific age and health profile from South Korea,” the report said. The South Korean agencies that sent kids to Denmark were Holt Children’s Services and the Korea Social Service.
The two South Korean agencies and that country’s Ministry of Health and Welfare, the main government agency that handles adoption, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Boonyoung Han of the Danish activist group, told The Associated Press that an independent investigation was still needed because with such a probe “we expect that those responsible will finally be held accountable for their actions.”
In the late 1970s and mid-1980s, South Korean agencies aggressively solicited newborns or young children from hospitals and orphanages, often in exchange for payments, and operated maternity homes where single mothers were pressured to give away their babies. Adoption workers toured factory areas and low-income neighborhoods in search of struggling families who could be persuaded to give away their children.
On Jan. 16, Denmark’s only overseas adoption agency DIA said that it was “winding down” its facilitation of international adoptions after a government agency raised concerns over fabricated documents and procedures that obscured children’s biological origins abroad. In recent years, DIA had mediated adoptions in the Philippines, India, South Africa, Thailand, Taiwan and the Czech Republic.
For years, adoptees in Europe, the United States and Australia have raised alarms about fraud, including babies who were falsely registered as abandoned orphans when they had living relatives in their native countries.

9NPH8Z20DN_POATSPVA649FITQ,Austrian man who raped his captive daughter over 24 years can be moved to a regular prison,By PHILIPP JENNE,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/austria-rape-incest-father-daughter-747925e89108567623e07e72cfa357ec,"KREMS, Austria (AP) — An Austrian man who had kept his daughter captive for 24 years and raped her thousands of times, fathering seven children with her, can be moved from psychiatric detention to a regular prison, a court ruled on Thursday.
The decision, however, stipulates that Josef Fritzl, 88, will have to attend regular psychotherapy and undergo psychiatric evaluations during a 10-year probation period at the prison, Austria Press Agency reported.
A request to release him from detention was rejected but the decision is still a win for Fritzl’s legal team as conditions in a regular prison are considered an improvement, compared to strict controls in a psychiatric institution.
His atrocious crime was revealed in 2008 and he was sentenced in 2009 to life imprisonment for committing incest, rape, coercion, false imprisonment, enslavement and negligent homicide of one of his infant sons.
Fritzl became known as the “monster of Amstetten” after the northern Austrian town where he in 1984 locked up his then 18-year-old daughter in a sound-proofed basement of his house.

Over the next 24 years, he repeatedly raped her and fathered seven children with her, one of whom died.
Fritzl’s wife, who lived on the second floor of the home with the rest of the family, was allegedly unaware of what was going on in the basement, according to Austrian authorities.
Fritzl’s daughter disappeared in 1984 at age 18, re-emerging in 2008 from the dungeon-like basement chamber in Amstetten. When the case came to light, it made headlines around the world.
A three-judge regional court in the town of Krems ruled on Thursday that Fritzl, who now reportedly has dementia, could be moved to a regular prison based on a psychiatric assessment that he no longer poses a danger. The ruling overturned an earlier decision from 2022 when Fritzl’s request to be moved to a regular prison was rejected.
“In summary, the court has come to the conclusion that it is indeed the case that he is no longer dangerous,” Fritzl’s lawyer Astrid Wagner told The Associated Press.
She told APA that she would continue to work for Fritzl’s release.
“He was close to tears during the hearing,” Wagner said. “He said he is unbelievably sorry for his victims, he would love to undo everything he did.”
The verdict is not yet legally binding and prosecutors have 14 days to lodge an appeal, APA reported."

At issue before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans was Mississippi’s prohibition on voting for those convicted of any of a list of various felonies, including nonviolent ones such as forgery or timber theft. The outcome could affect voting rights for tens of thousands.
Criminal justice advocates won a major victory in August when a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled that the ban violates the Constitution’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. But the full 17-member circuit court vacated that ruling weeks later and scheduled Tuesday’s hearing.
Judge Kyle Duncan was among 5th Circuit judges who suggested during questioning that the Legislature, not judges, should prescribe punishment for a crime. “There is no judicial calculus to tell the difference between a rapist, and an armed robber and a car thief — and a timber thief, for that matter,” Duncan told attorney Jon Youngwood, who was arguing against disenfranchisement.
Judge Stephen Higginson appeared to be more sympathetic to Youngwood’s argument, noting that Mississippi is unusual in permanently disenfranchising people for lesser felonies. And he pushed back against Mississippi attorney Scott Stewart’s contention that the voting ban is not a criminal punishment, but a regulation regarding fitness to vote.

Permanently disenfranchising someone, Higginson said, “sounds punitive.”
The court’s 17 full-time active judges heard arguments, along with two senior-status, part-time judges who sat on the panel that ruled against the ban in August. They gave no indication when they would rule.
Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of 10 specific felonies, including bribery, theft and arson, lose the right to vote. Under a previous state attorney general, the list was expanded to 22 crimes, including timber larceny — felling and stealing trees from someone else’s property — and carjacking.
To have their voting rights restored, people convicted of any of the crimes must get a pardon from the governor or persuade lawmakers to pass individual bills just for them with two-thirds approval. Lawmakers in recent years have passed few of those bills, and they passed none in 2023.
“Mississippi stands as an outlier among its sister states, bucking a clear and consistent trend in our Nation against permanent disenfranchisement,” Senior Judge James Dennis wrote in the August opinion, joined by Senior Judge Carolyn Dineen King. Both judges were nominated to the court by Democratic presidents — King by Jimmy Carter and Dennis by Bill Clinton.
Also on the panel was Judge Edith Jones, still on full-time status nearly 40 years after she was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan. In a dissent to the August ruling, Jones cited a previous Supreme Court ruling regarding felons’ disenfranchisement, saying it is up to legislatures to decide such matters.
Tuesday’s hearing will include Jones and 16 other full-time members of the court. King and Dennis will also take part because they were members of the original ruling panel. The 5th Circuit is one of the most conservative circuit appeals courts, with 12 of its full-time posts filled by nominees of Republican presidents. Duncan was nominated by former President Donald Trump, Higginson by former President Barack Obama.
This story has been corrected to show that an attorney’s last name is Youngwood, not Youngblood, and that another attorney’s last name is Stewart, not Stern."
9SOZ6NCSSH_5VL5VL852HUE7UU,Pentagon has no more money for Ukraine as it hosts a meeting of 50 allies on support for Kyiv,By TARA COPP and LOLITA C. BALDOR,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-money-congress-weapons-dd5076b30bf8fab5c914a1222186e7f0,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is out of money for Ukraine, unable to send the ammunition and missiles that the government in Kyiv needs to fend off Russia’s invasion.
With the aid caught up in domestic politics, the Biden administration on Tuesday came empty-handed for the first time as host of the monthly meeting of about 50 nations that coordinate support for Ukraine. The group was established by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in April 2022.
While waiting for Congress to approve more money for Ukraine’s fight, Washington will look to allies to keep bridging the gap.
“I urge this group to dig deep to provide Ukraine with more lifesaving ground-based air defense systems and interceptors,” Austin said in opening remarks broadcast from his home, where he is recuperating after prostate cancer surgery.
The opening statement by video was the first public appearance from Austin, 70, who appeared slightly gaunt. He was hospitalized for two weeks after complications from the surgery.

After the meeting, Celeste Wallander, assistant defense secretary for international affairs, told reporters that Ukraine’s ministry of defense is getting reports from its front lines that “units are not do not have the stocks and the stores of ammunition that they require.”
Wallander added, “That is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress’ questions, so that they are able to move forward on a decision to pass” legislation with the aid.
While Ukraine waits to see what Congress will do, European allies are moving ahead with new measures to support Ukraine.
In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced a $1.2 billion joint contract to buy more than 222,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition. The rounds are some of the most heavily used munitions in the war, and the contract will be used to backfill allies that have pushed their own reserves to Kyiv.
While the conflict between Israel and Hamas has dominated headlines since October, Russia’s onslaught against Ukraine has continued.
Russia on Tuesday launched a barrage of more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles into Ukraine’s two biggest cities, damaging apartment buildings and killing at least five people. The assault came a day after Moscow shunned any deal backed by Kyiv and its Western allies to end the almost two-year war.
Ukraine’s air defenses were able to intercept at least 21 of the missiles. But the attacks injured at least 20 people in four districts of Kyiv, the capital.
The Pentagon announced its last security assistance for Ukraine on Dec. 27, a $250 million package that included 155 mm rounds, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other high-demand items drawn from existing U.S. stockpiles.
The U.S. has not been able to provide additional munitions since then because the money for replenishing those stockpiles has run out and Congress has yet to approve more funds.
More than $110 billion in aid for both Ukraine and Israel is stalled over disagreements between Congress and the White House over other policy priorities, including additional security for the U.S.-Mexico border.
Senators are trying for a bipartisan deal that would include nearly $61 billion in aid for Ukraine and make changes in border policy. But Republicans are renewing a push to scale back the amount of assistance for Ukraine, targeting money that would go to Ukraine’s civil sector and arguing that European nations could step in to fund those needs.
“Personally speaking, I’d like to see portions pared down,” Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican senator, told reporters Tuesday. “I think the number is really high and there are a lot of things funded in there.”
But even if a deal can be reached in the Senate, the package faces even more opposition in the House, where many Republicans have voted repeatedly against the Ukrainian war effort.
The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $44.2 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in February 2022. About $23.6 billion of that was pulled from existing military stockpiles and almost $19 billion was sent in the form of longer-term military contracts, for items that will take months to procure. So even though funds have run out, some previously purchased weapons will continue to flow in. An additional $1.7 billion has been provided by the U.S. State Department in the form of foreign military financing.
The U.S. and approximately 30 international partners are also continuing to train Ukrainian forces, and to date have trained a total of 118,000 Ukrainians at locations around the world, said Col. Marty O’Donnell, spokesman for U.S. Army Europe and Africa.
The United States has trained approximately 18,000 of those fighters, including approximately 16,300 soldiers in Germany. About 1,500 additional fighters are currently going through training.

9W11CYMO7W_YDMFCSJFTIXNZ3O,"Movie Review: ‘Miller’s Girl’ with Jenna Ortega is an airless, cold affair that fails to spark",By MARK KENNEDY,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/millers-girl-movie-review-jenna-ortega-d0437532d0e9fab696ce896f2aef130a,"Jenna Ortega’s stark rise as Gen Z’s goth-glam princess takes a pointless, awkward turn in “Miller’s Girl,” a new romantic horror movie about cerebral people that’s simply tiresome.
Written and directed by newcomer Jade Halley Bartlett, the movie retells the classic story of a teenage girl smitten by her older teacher and a tumble into seduction. It wants to be close to Vladimir Nabokov, but it’s more “Don’t Stand So Close to Me” by The Police.
Ortega stars as 18-year-old Tennessee student Cairo Sweet, a precocious and wealthy young lady with a tragic, icy cool personality. “Literature is my solace in the solitude and writing is my only means of escape,” she says, like most 18-year-olds do.
Sweet is the kind of student who reads the long list of suggested texts before school even starts and devours “Finnegans Wake” of her own volition. She has a 4.6 GPA and “crippling ennui.” She also dresses like Britney Spears circa “…Baby One More Time.”
Sweet latches onto unmoored literature teacher Jonathan Miller, a former writer — author of “Apostrophes and Ampersands: Six Abysmally Romantic Short Stories” — who hasn’t put pen to paper since he got married and started teaching. He’s played by a hangdog Martin Freeman, wonderfully anguished and pained.

“You’re not a writer,” his wife baits him. “You chose to be a teacher. Why would I see you as anything else?” She’s played by Dagmara Domińczyk, a half-drawn woman who is constantly working, prickly and hurtful. To prove that she’s wise, she uses words like “vituperation.”

Our unhappy Miller begins spending more and more time with his prize student, awakened by her writing skills and her apparent interest in him. “You’re exceptionally talented,” he tells her. Her hunger for approval almost bursts through the screen.
They sit around and quote memorized passages of each others’ work to the other. “You do see me and I see you,” she tells him. There are as many red flags waving as during hurricane season.
“Teenage girls are dangerous,” his wife says. “They’re full of emotional violence and vituperation. I hope you know what you’re doing.” He doesn’t.
Ortega mimics much of her chilly Wednesday Addams in the role, undercurrents of savagery popping up now and again through the shivering stillness. There’s no warmth here. Mr. Miller is being seduced by a copy of the Paris Review.

Fact and fantasy get confused between these two. Are they really lovers? Or might it all be in her head? Bartlett coyly sidesteps the depth of their relationship to leave you hanging until the end — and so whatever the filmmaker is trying to say is left hanging, too. Maybe something about the confusing lines of power, or maybe that writers are really awful people?
Two other characters — Bashir Salahuddin as another teacher and Gideon Adlon as Sweet’s vampy, lollipop-licking friend — are genuinely much more interesting and so unbalance the main would-be couple.
Bartlett lets the first half drag way too long, establishing over and over the characters’ plight, getting lost in the forest mist that Sweet keeps emerging from, bizarrely and with no subtlety. The second half is agonizing — all arguments and tears. Taken together, this movie might be less fun than taking the SATs.
This image released by Lionsgate shows Martin Freeman as Jonathan Miller in “Miller’s Girl.” (Zac Popik/Lionsgate via AP)
It’s notable that Bartlett’s airless script, which landed among the top unproduced screenplays in 2016, predates #MeToo and feels wholly out of its time in 2024. Do we really need a spiteful Lolita threatening to lob grenades into her rivals’ lives and careers? Bartlett seems to have lots to say at the beginning about art and passion, but ends with nothing other than seemingly not to believe women. That couldn’t have been her intention.
“Miller’s Girl,” a Lionsgate release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for “sexual content, language throughout, some teen smoking and drinking.” Running time: 93 minutes. One star out of four.
MPAA definition of R: Restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.

A2QCNAJJ13_DZ7855G5E7DELPA,Here’s what to know about Sweden’s bumpy road toward NATO membership,_,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-sweden-nato-explainer-b5a94a1aa0a4088a60b920eaa09737a5,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Sweden’s bid to join NATO — held up for almost two years — cleared its next-to-last hurdle when Turkey gave its go-ahead this week to let the Nordic country into the alliance.
All existing NATO countries must give their approval before a new member can join the alliance, and Hungary is now the only member that hasn’t given Sweden the green light.
Here is a look at Sweden’s complicated path toward NATO membership.
Sweden has stayed out of military alliances for more than 200 years and long ruled out seeking NATO membership. But after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it ditched its longstanding policy of nonalignment almost overnight and decided to apply to join the alliance together with neighboring Finland.

Both Sweden and Finland had already developed strong ties with NATO after the end of the Cold War, but public opinion remained firmly against full membership until the war in Ukraine.
Nonalignment was seen as the best way to avoid creating tensions with Russia, their powerful neighbor in the Baltic Sea region. But the Russian aggression caused a dramatic shift in both countries, with polls showing a surge in support for NATO membership.
Political parties in both Finland and Sweden decided they needed the security guarantees that only come with full membership in the U.S.-led alliance.
While Finland became NATO’s 31st member in April of last year, Sweden’s application has been held up by Turkey and Hungary.
To let Sweden join, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put forth a series of conditions including a tougher stance toward groups that Turkey regards as threats to its security, such as Kurdish militants and members of a network it blames for a failed coup in 2016.

Although the Swedish government tried to appease Erdogan by lifting an arms embargo on Turkey and promising to cooperate on fighting terrorism, public demonstrations in Sweden by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, and by anti-Muslim activists who burned the Quran complicated the situation.
Pressure from the U.S. and other NATO allies on Turkey to remove its objections to Swedish membership appeared to have little effect until Erdogan said at a NATO summit last year that he would send the documents to Parliament for approval. But the issue was held up in Parliament until lawmakers finally held a vote on the issue Tuesday and ratified Sweden’s accession protocol by 287 votes to 55. The Turkish government finalized the step Thursday by publishing the measure in an official gazette.
That leaves Hungary as the last hurdle for Sweden’s NATO bid. Hungary initially didn’t given any clear reason for its delays and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán long insisted that his country wouldn’t be the last to give Sweden its approval. But the tone toward Stockholm hardened last year, with Hungary accusing Swedish politicians of telling “blatant lies” about the condition of Hungary’s democracy.
Orbán, who has broken ranks with NATO allies by adopting a Kremlin-friendly stance toward Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Tuesday that he had invited Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson to Budapest to discuss “future cooperation in the field of security and defence as allies and partners.”
Unless an emergency session of Hungary’s parliament is called to debate Sweden’s NATO bid, its next scheduled assembly is expected on Feb. 26.
The inclusion of Sweden would leave the Baltic Sea surrounded by NATO countries, strengthening the alliance in the strategically important region. The Baltic Sea is Russia’s maritime point of access to the city of St. Petersburg and the Kaliningrad enclave.
Sweden’s armed forces, though sharply downsized since the Cold War, are widely seen as a potential boost to NATO’s collective defense in the region. The Swedes have a modern air force and navy and have committed to increase defense spending to reach NATO’s target of 2% of gross domestic product.
Like the Finns, Swedish forces have for years participated in joint exercises with NATO.
Not surprisingly, Moscow reacted negatively to Sweden and Finland’s decision to abandon nonalignment and seek NATO membership, and warned of unspecified countermeasures.
Russia said the move adversely affected the security situation in Northern Europe, which it said ”had previously been one of the most stable regions in the world.”
Finland’s security service said in October that the country’s relations with Russia had deteriorated significantly and that Moscow now considers its western neighbor as a hostile country.
Both Sweden and Finland have warned of an increased risk of Russian interference and hybrid attacks."
A851I8PJWI_MN07AI4DIEVA4NZ,The European Commission launches an in-depth look at competitive costs of the Lufthansa deal for ITA,By COLLEEN BARRY,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lufthansa-ita-competition-eu-commission-e03d0b1b11d0d7b6e8c7c540c1849a56,"MILAN (AP) — The European Commission on Tuesday announced an in-depth investigation of German airline Lufthansa’s planned takeover of Italian carrier ITA Airways, citing competitive concerns.
Lufthansa signed a deal last year for a 41% minority share in the long-struggling ITA Airways, formerly Alitalia. The deal calls for a 325-million-euro ($354 million) investment by Lufthansa, and another 250 million euros ($272 million) from the Italian Finance Ministry. Lufthansa would have the option of buying the remaining shares at a later date.
The European Commission cited concerns about reduced competition on short-haul flights between Italy and Central Europe and long-haul routes between Italy and the United States, Canada, Japan and India.
ITA Airways and Lufthansa compete on the Central European flights, where low-cost players generally serve secondary airports. On the longer-haul routes, ITA is competing against Lufthansa and its partners Air Canada and United. The commission also said the deal could strengthen ITA’s dominant position at Milan’s Linate airport.
The commission said that it would make a decision by June 6. The commission has the power to set conditions for the deal. It said that Lufthansa’s response to preliminary concerns was insufficient.

Airline analyst Gregory Alegi said that the commission’s concerns were a paradox, since 20 years ago it had taken the position that the European Union market wasn’t big enough for the many flagship carriers that existed at the time.
“Now you start working about not enough competition?” said Alegi, a LUISS University professor, calling the flip in approach “an indictment of this high-level attempt to shape markets by regulation.”
ITA was formed in October 2021 on the ashes of Alitalia, which had gone through a series of bankruptcies, government bailouts and failed partnerships as subsequent governments tried to prevent its demise. At the time, the commission insisted on a new name to mark a break with the 74-year-old carrier’s past.
“The commission’s patience has been tested with Alitalia’s several bailouts, and ITA airways came about, because a previous government would not let it collapse, so there had to be a total break,’’ Alegi said."

John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters aboard Air Force One that the visit will include a formal state dinner.
As president, Biden has visited Japan twice, most recently going to the city of Hiroshima last May for the Group of 7 summit among major industrialized nations. Kishida’s visit comes as the federal government is reviewing the national security implications of Japan’s Nippon Steel plans to acquire the Pittsburgh-based company U.S. Steel for roughly $14.1 billion.
Kirby declined to say whether the government’s review of that potential merger would be a subject at the state visit. He said that Biden and Kishida will likely discuss a range of issues in Asia, including how to improve cooperation with South Korea.
“I think you can expect to see a robust discussion about how we’re deepening our bilateral cooperation with Japan, improving our alliance capabilities across the board,” Kirby said. “There will be a lot to discuss.”"

In Spanish-speaking nations, people often go by two first and last names given by their parents. The court’s decision would effectively allow citizens to choose the order of their own last names.
The court modified a piece of civil code originally mandating that names had to be written in that order. It made the decision on the grounds that the original code contradicts the right of equality before the law, as well and national and international legislation protecting against discrimination against women.
The code was based on “customary practices based on patriarchal and archaic concepts of family, which discriminates against women and today is incompatible with the Law of the Constitution,” the Chamber said in a press release.
Judge Paul Rueda said the changes were made based on a case where a person sought to reverse the current order of her surnames so that her mother’s name is placed first. The court added that keeping the law as is also limited citizens’ right to freely develop their own personalities and identities.
“Surnames form an inseparable part of the personality of human beings and their order is inherent to the fundamental rights to name and identity,” the magistrates added.
This decision came after another bill passed the Human Rights Commission in Costa Rica’s congress last year which also proposed citizens be able to choose order in which their names are placed."
ALBE48KOCB_TUVDKBF4U40N2L4,Pakistan accuses Indian agents of orchestrating the killing of 2 citizens on its soil,By MUNIR AHMED,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-india-intelligence-pakistanis-killed-2cbcdfbbcbc3e20423f926406307b926,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan on Thursday accused neighboring India’s intelligence agency of involvement in the extrajudicial killings of its citizens, saying it had credible evidence linking two Indian agents to the deaths of two Pakistanis in Pakistan last year.
“We have documentary, financial and forensic evidence of the involvement of the two Indian agents who masterminded these assassinations,” Foreign Secretary Sajjad Qazi said at a news conference in Islamabad.
He said the assassination of Pakistani nationals on Pakistani soil was a violation of the country’s sovereignty and a breach of the U.N. Charter. “This violation of Pakistan sovereignty by India is completely unacceptable,” he said.
The two dead men, both anti-India militants, were killed in gun attacks inside mosques in separate cities in Pakistan.
The allegations come months after both the United States and Canada accused Indian agents of links to assassination attempts on their soil.

“Clearly the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon,” Qazi said.
India denied the Pakistani allegation, calling it an “attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda.”
“As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities,” Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. “To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution.”
Qazi said the Indian agents, whom he identified as Yogesh Kumar and Ashok Kumar, orchestrated the deaths of the two Pakistanis from a third country.
He said the killings involved “a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions. Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations.”
Qazi said most of the men allegedly hired by the Indian agents for the killings had been arrested.
In September, gunmen killed anti-India militant Mohammad Riaz inside a mosque in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. He was a former member of the militant group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which was founded by Hafiz Saeed, who also founded the outlawed group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was blamed by New Delhi for attacks in Mumbai in 2008 that killed 166 people.
Qazi said the other Pakistani national, Shahid Latif, was killed in October inside a mosque in Pakistan’s Sialkot district. Latif was a close aide to Masood Azhar, the founder of the anti-India Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, he said.
Pakistan and India have a long history of bitter relations. Since independence from Britain in 1947, the two South Asian rivals have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir.

AWNNHWA524_841Y5DGTJZKIKI3,US and UK sanction four Yemeni Houthi leaders over Red Sea shipping attacks,By FATIMA HUSSEIN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/houthi-israel-gaza-sanctions-treasury-d79fdbe966c5448619144c8cb3de968e,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. and U.K. on Thursday imposed sanctions on four leaders of Yemen’s Houthi rebel group who have supported the militant group’s recent attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
Houthi leaders Mohamed al-Atifi, Muhammad Fadl Abd al-Nabi, Muhammad Ali al-Qadiri and Muhammad Ahmad al-Talibi are all accused of assisting or sponsoring acts of terrorism, according to U.S. Treasury.
The Houthis have repeatedly launched attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, though they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.
The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans.
Members of a former rebel group originally from the remote mountains of northwest Yemen, Houthi leaders are generally seen as having few assets within reach of U.S. authorities to be affected by the sanctions. But Middle East analysts say the sanctions may have impact simply by reminding movement leaders that the U.S. knows who they are, and may be tracking them.

Abdel Malek al-Houthi, a Yemeni politician who serves as the leader of the Houthi movement, said Thursday in a speech: “Since the beginning of the offense, with aid raids on our country, and missiles strikes from the sea, the Americans were not able to stop our strikes in the sea and our targeting of ships. But they got themselves, as well as the British, in this problem (conflict).”
State Department official Matthew Miller said in a statement that the U.S. “is continuing to take action to hold the Houthis accountable for their illegal and reckless attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.”
“The Houthis’ terrorist attacks on merchant vessels and their civilian crews in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden have disrupted international supply chains and infringed on navigational rights and freedoms,” Miller said.
As recently as Wednesday, two American-flagged ships carrying cargo for the U.S. Defense and State departments came under attack by Houthi rebels, U.S. officials said, with the U.S. Navy intercepting some of the incoming fire. The U.S. and the United Kingdom have launched multiple rounds of airstrikes seeking to stop the attacks.
Treasury Under Secretary Brian E. Nelson said Thursday’s joint action with the U.K. “demonstrates our collective action to leverage all authorities to stop these attacks.”

(AP) — A Baltimore woman suspected of striking people with her car and randomly stabbing others in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., was charged Friday with attempted murder.
The attacks occurred over roughly two hours Thursday night in Prince George’s County. Six people were injured, including two stabbing victims who were hospitalized in critical condition, police said.
Police said in a news release Friday that officers arrested the 31-year-old suspect, Tanay Stallings-Brown, in Baltimore after tracking her car. The vehicle had significant damage, including a broken windshield, when officers pulled her over late Thursday, police said.
She was taken back to Prince George’s County and charged with multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder, assault and other charges, police said.
“The motive for these crimes remains under investigation,” police said in the news release. “At this time, it appears she chose her victims at random.”

No attorney was listed in online court records who could speak on Stallings-Brown’s behalf Friday.
The violence began Thursday evening when a woman walking on a sidewalk was struck by a car, Deputy Chief James McCreary said during a news conference. She suffered minor injuries.
About 10 minutes later, police learned of another hit-and-run followed by a stabbing less than 2 miles (3 kilometers) away. The driver drove into an adult and a teenager, then got out of the car and stabbed the teen. Officials said the 15-year-old girl was in critical condition.
A short time later, two more pedestrians were struck and injured a few miles from that scene, he said. Neither was seriously injured. And an hour after that, a man was stabbed at a gas station several miles away, leaving him also in critical condition, police said.
“This evolved rapidly,” McCreary said, adding that he hasn’t seen anything like this in his 20 years on the force."

Mexico’s army is finding belt-fed machine guns, rocket launchers and grenades that are not sold for civilian use in the United States.
“The (Mexican) Defense Department has warned the United States about weapons entering Mexico that are for the exclusive use of the U.S. army,” Foreign Relations Secretary Alicia Bárcena said. “It is very urgent that an investigation into this be carried out.”
The Mexican army said in June that it had seized 221 fully automatic machine guns, 56 grenade launchers and a dozen rocket launchers from drug cartels since late 2018.
The military-grade U.S. weaponry — which cartels have bragged about and openly displayed on social media — poses a special challenge for Mexico’s army, which along with police and the National Guard already faces cartels operating homemade armored vehicles and bomb-dropping drones.

In June, Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said five rocket launchers had been found in the possession of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, four were seized from the rival Sinaloa cartel and three more seized from other cartels. Sandoval did not specifically say the weapons were from U.S. military stockpiles.
Ken Salazar, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, confirmed Monday that Mexican officials had brought up the issue at meetings last week, and while he had not been aware of the problem, he pledged the United States would look into it.
“We are going to look into it, we are committed to working with Sedena (Mexico’s Defense Department) to see what’s going on,” Salazar said.
There are a number of possible routes by which the weapons may have made their way to Mexico. Central America was awash with U.S. weaponry during the conflicts of the 1980s, military grade weapons sometimes go missing from stocks in the United States, and some manufacturers who sell arms to the U.S. military might also have sold some abroad or on the black market.
While the Mexican army and marines still have superior firepower, the drug cartels’ weaponry often now outclasses other branches of Mexican law enforcement.
Mexico has long had a problem with semi-automatic rifles that are permitted for civilian use in the United States being smuggled into Mexico, where only low-caliber firearms are permitted and strictly regulated. Mexico has launched legal actions against U.S. arms manufacturers and gun shops, arguing that they contribute to violence.
On Monday, an appeals court in Boston, Massachusetts handed Mexico a victory in one of those actions, reviving a $10 billion lawsuit against seven U.S. gun manufacturers and one distributor. Mexico argued the companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.
In 2022, a U.S. federal judge dismissed Mexico’s claims based on the broad protection provided to gun manufacturers by a 2005 U.S. law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. The law shields gun manufacturers from damages “resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse” of a firearm.
Mexico appealed that ruling, and on Monday the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals revived the lawsuit, saying the PLCAA did not apply to the claims the guns caused deaths, damages and injuries in Mexico. The appeals court returned the case to the lower court, to consider the facts in the case.
The Mexican government estimates 70% of the weapons trafficked into Mexico come from the U.S., according to the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
Also Monday, describing talks last week with U.S. officials, Bárcena said the United States is planning to announce sanctions against airlines and transportation companies that move migrants to South and Central America and through Mexico to the U.S. border.
“The United States said it was going to impose sanctions on South American and Central American companies that are transporting migrants irregularly, and they want us to do the same,” Bárcena said. “The (Mexican) Interior Department is going to call on the bus and airline companies, but we don’t want them (the United States) to act unilaterally.”
Mexico, meanwhile, wants changes made to the U.S. CBP One mobile application for asylum-seekers to make appointments.
The app is designed only to work on telephones in northern Mexico, but Bárcena said Mexico has asked that coverage be extended to allow appointments to be made from further south, to avoid a pileup of migrants rushing to Mexico’s northern border cities."
BJ1RVB2EJL_XZCNKDZFQS7Z2KT,A plagiarism scandal rocks Norway’s government,By MARK LEWIS,_,20240117,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/norway-plagiarism-borch-kjerkol-1cde4d0c7305b7107852eaee478a983c,"STAVANGER, Norway (AP) — The specter of academic plagiarism — a hot topic in the U.S. — has now reached the heart of Norwegian politics, toppling one government minister and leaving a second fighting for her political career.
Sandra Borch, Norway’s minister for research and higher education, resigned last week after a business student in Oslo discovered that tracts of Borch’s master’s thesis, including spelling mistakes, were copied without attribution from a different author.
The student, 27-year-old Kristoffer Rytterager, got upset about Borch’s zealous approach to punishing academic infractions: After several students fought cases of “self-plagiarism” — where they lifted whole sections from their own previous work— and were acquitted in lower courts, the minister for higher education took them to the Supreme Court of Norway.
“Students were being expelled for self-plagiarism. I got angry and I thought it was a good idea to check the minister’s own work,” Rytterager told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
Rytterager, who studies at the BI Business School in Oslo, said he found several tracts that were suspiciously well written, and discovered they were not her own words. On Friday, the media followed up Rytterager’s posts on X, formerly Twitter, and published his discoveries. Borch resigned the same day.

“When I wrote my master’s thesis around 10 years ago I made a big mistake,” she told Norwegian news agency NTB. “I took text from other assignments without stating the sources.”
The revelations put the academic history of other politicians in the crosshairs and by the weekend several newspapers were describing inconsistencies in the work of Health Minister Ingvild Kjerkol. She blamed “editing errors” for similarities between her own academic work and that of other authors.
The revelations have put pressure on Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, who leads a center-left coalition government of his own Labor party and the junior Center Party.
He accepted Borch’s resignation, saying her actions were “not compatible with the trust that is necessary to be minister of research and higher education,” but has backed the health minister, claiming it was up to universities rather than politicians to judge academic misdemeanors. He instructed all his ministers to search their own back catalogs for hints of plagiarism.
That’s not good enough, critics say. In a letter to Norwegian news agency NTB, Abid Raja, deputy leader of the opposition Liberal Party, wrote: “It is not Kjerkol who should decide her own position,” it is Støre who should “consider whether this matter is compatible with her continuing as health minister.”
Rytterager said he is ambivalent about the “feeding frenzy” he started. “I feel like the media are out for blood and are checking everyone,” he said. “I am afraid that in the future we may not have politicians that have ever taken a risk in their lives because they are afraid to get dragged through the dirt.”"
BJIWTCCJ40_LWD99VAACSGINM5,A Zimbabwe opposition figure seen by supporters as the face of resistance to repression is convicted,By FARAI MUTSAKA,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/zimbabwe-opposition-convicted-prison-repression-04ffaf5d1ca220005be16abb7d812078,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — A Zimbabwean opposition figure who has spent close to 600 days in pretrial detention was convicted on Wednesday of inciting public violence, while some supporters sobbed at the treatment of a man seen by many as the face of resistance to the government’s alleged repression.
Job Sikhala, an outspoken official with the main opposition Citizens Coalition for Change party and a former member of parliament, was detained in June 2022 following the killing and dismembering of an activist from his party. He was accused of using social media to encourage opposition supporters to violently respond to the death of Moreblessing Ali.
Sikhala denied the charges, arguing that he was simply acting as the family’s lawyer in their quest to find Ali, whose body parts were later discovered in a well.
However, magistrate Tafadzwa Miti said evidence showed that Sikhala and opposition lawmaker Godfrey Sithole were responsible for the violence that followed Ali’s death near the capital, Harare.
Both men face up to 10 years in prison or a fine.

Sikhala has been arrested more than 65 times in the past 20 years and walked free each time before Wednesday’s verdict, his lawyers said. Supporters say his case highlights repression of dissenting voices in the southern African country.
Tension filled the courthouse in Harare. Dozens of people who couldn’t fit into the tiny courtroom packed the corridors and shoved police.
Outside, police in anti-riot gear and wielding batons blocked a group of activists from entering the courtyard to protest Sikhala ‘s continued detention. Some wept after the verdict was passed.
Sikhala seemed unshaken.
“Let them do what they want. I don’t care, don’t worry,” he said, wearing leg irons while walking from the court’s holding cells.
One of Sikhala’s lawyers, Harrison Nkomo, said they have been instructed to appeal Wednesday’s verdict.
The court on Monday will hear mitigation, a routine process in which lawyers plead for leniency before sentencing.
Global and local human rights groups including Amnesty International have protested the treatment of Sikhala, saying his situation underlines continued repression of the opposition and other government critics such as university students and labor unionists.
Last year’s election in Zimbabwe, the second since the coup that ousted the late and long-serving Robert Mugabe, was marked by allegations of violence, arrests, disruption of opposition activities and disputed results.
Current President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former Mugabe ally who took power after the army-backed coup with promises of democratic reform, denies allegations of clamping down on the opposition. He insists that his government has improved the political environment and human rights situation.
Douglas Coltart, one of Sikhala’s lawyers, accused the government of using the law and the courts to punish outspoken rivals.
”The human rights situation in this country is extremely worrying. And it appears to be deteriorating,” he said outside the court."
BOHZLIYSUL_RQ6WVSDRUTXU53K,"US targets Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad, its CEO and Hamas cryptocurrency financiers for sanctions",By FATIMA HUSSEIN and ABBY SEWELL,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-israel-gaza-iran-ec177d99010a316057583e1ce088bf94,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Monday hit Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO with sanctions, alleging assistance to Iran’s military wing, and imposed a fifth round of sanctions on the militant group Hamas for abuse of cryptocurrency since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
The sanctions come as Israel’s bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip continues — killing 25,000 Palestinians so far, according to the Gaza Strip Healthy Ministry — and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launch regular strikes against bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.
In the new sanctions, the Treasury Department said Fly Baghdad and CEO Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani have provided assistance to Iran’s military wing and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
“Iran and its proxies have sought to abuse regional economies and use seemingly legitimate businesses as cover for funding and facilitating their attacks,” Treasury Undersecretary Brian E. Nelson said in a statement. “The United States will continue to disrupt Iran’s illicit activities aimed at undermining the stability of the region.”
The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans.

Fly Baghdad denied the U.S. allegations and said it would take legal action to demand compensation for losses resulting from the sanctions “as it is clear that the decision was based on misleading and false information and cannot stand before the law.”
The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also designated three leaders and supporters of an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah, as well as a business that it says moves and launders funds for the organization.
Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has launched strikes against bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. The group has said that the strikes are in retaliation for Washington’s backing of Israel in the war in Gaza and that it aims to push U.S. troops out of Iraq.
Most of the strikes have fallen short or been shot down and have not caused casualties, but on Saturday a missile salvo launched at al-Asad airbase in western Iraq injured a number of U.S. personnel and one Iraqi military service member stationed there.
Some of the Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, including Kataib Hezbollah, officially operate under the control of the Iraqi military as part of a coalition known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, which was a key player in the fight against the Islamic State extremist group when it rampaged across Iraq and Syria, seizing wide swaths of territory. In practice, however, the groups largely operate outside of state control.
In addition on Monday, the U.S. sanctioned a network of Hamas-affiliated financial exchanges in Gaza, including financial facilitators that transferred funds through cryptocurrency from Iran to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
The U.K. and Australia coordinated with the U.S. on these sanctions.
Hamas has said it planned for a potentially long fight and was “ready to do whatever is necessary for the dignity and freedom of our people.”

BS5ZP10X9B_D389VM38Z3INF6F,"After family feud, Myanmar court orders auction of home where Suu Kyi spent 15 years’ house arrest",By GRANT PECK,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/suu-kyi-yangon-family-home-auction-c8f1325eddc080da28b75bebb309dc9c,"BANGKOK (AP) — A court in military-controlled Myanmar on Thursday ordered the family home of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, where she spent 15 years under house arrest, put on auction in March following a bitter decades-long legal dispute between her and her brother.
The decision by a district court in Yangon, the country’s largest city, came nearly 1 1/2 years after the Supreme Court upheld a special appeal lodged by Suu Kyi’s estranged older brother, Aung San Oo, granting him half ownership of the family property that the siblings inherited in Yangon.
A legal official familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information, said the district court decided to auction the property on March 20 with a floor price of 315 billion Myanmar kyats (about $90 million).
He said the auction will be held in front of the historic property.
The 1.923-acre (0.78-hectare) family property on Inye Lake with a two-story colonial-style building was given by the government to Suu Kyi’s mother, Khin Kyi, after her husband, independence hero Gen. Aung San, was assassinated in July 1947. Khin Kyi died in December 1988, shortly after the failure of a mass uprising against military rule in which Suu Kyi took a leadership role as a co-founder of the National League for Democracy party.

Suu Kyi was detained in 1989 ahead of a 1990 election. Her party easily won the polls but was not allowed to take power when the army annulled the results. She ended up spending almost 15 years under house arrest at the property at 54 University Avenue and stayed there after her 2010 release.
For most of the time she was detained in Yangon, Suu Kyi was alone with just a housekeeper, and at one point had to sell some of her furniture to afford food.
As she was gradually allowed her freedom, the property became a sort of political shrine and unofficial party headquarters. She was able to deliver speeches from her front gate to crowds of supporters gathered in the street outside, and in later years hosted visiting dignitaries including then-U.S. President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
In 2012 she moved to the capital, Naypyitaw, where she stayed part time after being elected to Parliament, and spent even more time after becoming the de facto head of government after the 2015 general election. She was uprooted again in February 2021 when the army ousted her elected government and arrested her. After being tried on what are widely regarded as flimsy, politically motivated charges, she is serving a combined 27-year sentence in Naypyitaw’s main prison.
Her brother, Aung San Oo, first filed suit in 2000 for an equal share of the Yangon property, but his case was dismissed in January 2001 on procedural grounds. He returned to court again and again over the following two decades to press his claim.
In 2016, the Western Yangon District Court issued a ruling dividing the plot equally between the siblings. Aung San Oo considered the decision unfair and appealed unsuccessfully multiple times for the court to have the property sold by auction and the proceeds split between him and Suu Kyi.
The Supreme Court agreed to allow his special appeal and decided in August 2022 -- after the army’s seizure of power from Suu Kyi’s elected government — to have the property sold by auction.
A month after that, Duwa Lashi La, the acting president of the National Unity Government, the country’s popular opposition organization which lays claim to being its legitimate government, designated the property as a cultural heritage site and prohibited its sale or destruction, under threat of eventual legal punishment."

The evidence included what appeared to be a blood-soaked shirt and bra, as well as zip ties, gloves, plastic ponchos, a box cutter and other things with what State Police Sgt. Kevin Duggan testified was a “blood-like” substance on them. The items were pulled from Hartford, Connecticut, trash receptacles where, according to prosecutors, surveillance video shows Troconis sitting in a vehicle with boyfriend Fotis Dulos as he tossed trash into the same bins shortly after Jennifer Dulos disappeared.
Troconis, 49, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. She’s accused of helping Fotis Dulos cover up the killing of his wife, whose body has never been found.
Police believe Fotis Dulos killed Jennifer Dulos in the garage of her home in New Canaan, Connecticut, after she dropped their children off at school in May 2019 and then cleaned up the crime scene.
Troconis, who is not seen handling the trash in any of the videos, has pleaded not guilty and denied any involvement.

“Nothing that was in those bags will be shown to have had anything to do with Michelle Troconis or that she knew what was in any of those bags,” Jon Schoenhorn, Troconis’ lawyer, told reporters outside of the courthouse.
Jennifer Dulos’ family and friends said seeing the evidence in court was “brutal but also crucial,” according to a statement released by her friend Carrie Luft in the evening. They hope the trial provides answers and accountability for her killing.
“Witnessing Jennifer’s blood-soaked clothing, knowing that was the shirt, the bra, she wore on the last day of her life, made us imagine, again, what she must have endured on May 24, 2019,” the statement said. “She died a tragic death, and her loss is felt beyond what words can express.”
The case drew widespread attention and became the subject of the made-for-TV movie “Gone Mom.” Jennifer Dulos, 50, was declared legally dead in October. She was a member of a wealthy New York family whose father, the late Hilliard Farber, founded a brokerage firm. She also was a niece by marriage of fashion designer Liz Claiborne.
Fotis Dulos, a luxury home builder originally from Greece, died by suicide in January 2020 after being charged with his wife’s murder.
According to Troconis’ arrest warrant, DNA from Jennifer Dulos and Fotis Dulos was found on items in the trash from Hartford, and Troconis’ DNA was found on some of the trash bags. That evidence is expected to come later in the trial.
The surveillance videos from Hartford, which is about 75 miles (121 kilometers) from Jennifer Dulos’ home, were recorded the evening she disappeared but not discovered for six days. Police have said they believe some evidence may have been lost because much of the trash in that area was picked up during that week.
Video also showed Fotis Dulos placing near a building what police say resembled a vehicle cargo mat missing from his wife’s abandoned SUV and dropping an envelope down a sewer drain. Prosecutors on Monday showed jurors what they said were altered license plates found in an envelope in the sewer drain.
More video evidence was presented Tuesday afternoon from cameras on buses and other surveillance cameras showing Fotis Dulos’ vehicle traveling around the Hartford area.
At the time she vanished, Jennifer and Fotis Dulos were going through a contentious divorce and child custody proceedings that had limited his time with their children. Jennifer Dulos had moved out of the family home in Farmington, Connecticut, and Fotis Dulos was living there with Troconis and her daughter."

Traffic-snarling drive-slows, barricades of straw bales, stinky dumps of agricultural waste outside government offices and other demonstrations have rapidly blown up to become the first major crisis for newly appointed Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, installed two weeks ago by President Emmanuel Macron in hopes of injecting new vigor into his administration.
Macron’s opponents are seizing on the farmers’ demonstrations to bash his government’s record ahead of European elections in June. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party is polling strongly, blamed free-trade agreements, imports and bureaucracy for farmers’ economic woes.
“The worst enemies of farmers are to be found in this government,” she said Thursday.
Roads hit Thursday morning by drive-slows included a highway west of the French capital and seat of power.

“We are getting progressively closer to Paris,” farmer David Lavenant said to broadcaster BFM-TV.
Two agricultural unions called for farmers to converge on highways into the city on Friday to blockade it.
Highway operator Vinci reported blockages on 14 of the motorways that it operates, as well as disruptions on others. Attention-grabbing protests elsewhere included a supermarket being showered with a thick jet of pig slurry.
“We’re hit from both sides with high fixed costs but low prices. You don’t need a drawing to imagine what our balance sheets look like,” said Benoit Mazure, a regional representative of the influential FNSEA agricultural union.
Protest leaders said farmers would closely scrutinize measures expected Friday from the government in response to their demands before deciding on next steps.
“The determination is total,” said Arnaud Rousseau, the FNSEA president. “We expect urgent measures.”
In Brussels, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen opened a discussion panel to try to put farming on a new footing, hoping to take into account some of the complaints raised by protesters around the 27-nation bloc.
The so-called strategic dialogue comes as campaigning for the June 6-9 EU parliamentary elections is picking up steam and the fate of the farm sector is expected to be a hot-button issue.
“We all agree that the challenges are, without any question, mounting, said von der Leyen, be it “competition from abroad, be it overregulation at home, be it climate change, or the loss of biodiversity, or be a demographic decline, just to name a few of the challenges.
In recent weeks, farmers have staged protests in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania."
C5RAFASW1S_N9FJSRQVZ3UD4AA,A Texas school’s punishment of a Black student who wears his hair in locs is going to trial,By JUAN A. LOZANO,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hair-discrimination-school-dreadlocks-1efecc37df77d6bc087d71a1b573bed6,"ANAHUAC, Texas (AP) — A judge ordered Wednesday that a trial be held next month to determine whether a Black high school student in Texas can continue being punished by his district for refusing to change a hairstyle he and his family say is protected by a new state law.
Darryl George, 18, has not been in his regular classroom in Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu since Aug. 31. Instead, he has either been serving in-school suspension or spending time in an off-site disciplinary program.
His Houston-area school district, Barbers Hill, has said George’s long hair, which he wears in neatly tied and twisted locs on top of his head, violates a district dress code that limits hair length for boys. The district has said other students with locs comply with the length policy.
George, a junior, said Wednesday that he has felt stress and frustration over what he sees as unfair punishment, but that he was grateful to soon be getting his day in court.
“I’m glad that we are being heard, too. I’m glad that things are moving and we’re getting through this,” George said after the hearing in Anahuac, with his mother, Darresha George, standing next to him.

State District Judge Chap Cain III in Anahuac set a Feb. 22 trial in a lawsuit filed by the school district regarding whether its dress code restrictions limiting the length of boys’ hair violates the CROWN Act. The new Texas law, which took effect in September, prohibits race-based hair discrimination and bars employers and schools from penalizing people because of hair texture or protective hairstyles including Afros, braids, locs, twists or Bantu knots.
Darresha George said she was disappointed the judge did not consider granting a temporary restraining order, which would have halted her son’s punishment until next month’s trial.
“I have a son, 18 years old, that wants to go to school, that wants to get his education, and y’all messing with him. Why?” she said.

In an affidavit filed last week in support of the temporary restraining order, Darryl George said he is being subjected to “cruel treatment.”
“I love my hair, it is sacred and it is my strength,” George wrote. “All I want to do is go to school and be a model student. I am being harassed by school officials and treated like a dog.”
A spokesperson for the school district didn’t speak with reporters after the hearing and didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
In a paid ad that ran this month in the Houston Chronicle, Barbers Hill Superintendent Greg Poole maintained the district is not violating the CROWN Act.
In the ad, Poole defended his district’s policy and wrote that districts with a traditional dress code are safer and had higher academic performance and that “being an American requires conformity.”
“We will not lose sight of the main goal — high standards for our students — by bending to political pressure or responding to misinformed media reports. These entities have ‘lesser’ goals that ultimately harm kids,” Poole wrote.
The two Texas lawmakers who co-wrote the state’s version of the CROWN Act — state Reps. Rhetta Bowers and Ron Reynolds — attended Wednesday’s hearing and said the new state law does protect Darryl George’s hairstyle.
The district “is punishing Darryl George for one reason: his choice to wear his hair in a protective style which harms no one and causes no distraction in the classroom,” Bowers said.
George’s family has also filed a formal complaint with the Texas Education Agency and a federal civil rights lawsuit against Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with the school district, alleging they failed to enforce the CROWN Act. The lawsuit is before a federal judge in Galveston, Texas.
Barbers Hill’s policy on student hair was previously challenged in a May 2020 federal lawsuit filed by two other students. Both students withdrew from the high school, but one returned after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction, saying the student showed “a substantial likelihood” that his rights to free speech and to be free from racial discrimination would be violated if not allowed to return to campus. That lawsuit remains pending.

C7U7Q5WIQ4_PV6YXRMOZRZR1D0,A caravan of migrants from Honduras who were heading to the US dissolves in Guatemala,_,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-honduras-migrants-3553722800a9606232d0ba2a537f78a3,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A caravan of some 500 migrants that departed northern Honduras in hopes of reaching the United States dissolved Sunday after crossing the border into Guatemala, the Guatemalan Migration Institute reported.
Authorities had been monitoring three border crossings and said part of the caravan advanced a few kilometers (miles) into Guatemalan territory, before the migrants were stopped by migration officials who processed them, prioritizing the minors.
According to the immigration agency, no force was used and dialogue prevailed. Those who had documents were able to continue on as Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador have free transit among them. Those who did not have the necessary documents returned to Honduras.
Authorities did not offer figures on how many stayed or returned.
The caravan left Saturday, walking from the bus terminal of San Pedro Sula in Honduras. It was the first such group to leave Honduras since January 2022.

The vast majority of migrants cross Central America and Mexico in small groups, using all types of transportation and smuggling networks. Only a few form caravans.
The largest ones left San Pedro Sula in late 2018 and 2019 and many made it as far as the southern U.S. border. But after the pandemic, the U.S. put pressure on Mexico and Central American governments to increase their efforts to stop migrants headed north.
Since then, the caravans were stopped first in southern Mexico and later in Guatemalan territory.
In 2023, there were record numbers of migrants all over the hemisphere. Arrests for illegal crossings into the U.S. from Mexico intensified by the end of year, when U.S. authorities registered up to 10,000 illegal crossings over several days in December. The number dropped to 2,500 in the first days of January.

(AP) — A Bennington man has been charged with possessing a bomb and is accused of leaving it at his former residence when he moved out, according to federal prosecutors.
Tyler Hayes, 41, was indicted by a federal grand jury and pleaded not guilty in federal court in Burlington on Monday, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. His attorney did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
According to court records, he made the pipe bomb and told acquaintances about the destruction it would cause if it were set off, prosecutors said. He left it in his former residence when he moved out in connection with eviction proceedings, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
The bomb was discovered by his landlord last February on the back porch area of the house that he and his partner had abandoned, according to court papers and police. The Vermont State Police bomb squad rendered the device safe, police said.
“Hayes took no apparent precautions to make sure the bomb did not fall into the wrong hands or detonate inadvertently,” the U.S. attorney’s office said in a news release.
Prosecutors wrote in a court filing that Hayes should be detained because he not only built the bomb but he attempted to sell it in exchange for drugs and told several people that he intended to use it against the next person who angered or disrespected him.
Hayes is charged with knowingly possessing a bomb that was not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. The judge on Tuesday ordered him held pending trial. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.
Hayes has a felony conviction for drug trafficking from New York in 2009 and appears to have about 17 misdemeanors for offenses including providing false information to law enforcement, disorderly conduct, cocaine possession, resisting arrest, and contempt of court, prosecutors wrote."
CBCX8YEU1C_ZN9YGG59WBCATY2,China accuses US of ‘abusing’ international law by sailing in Taiwan Strait and South China Sea,By KEN MORITSUGU,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-us-south-china-sea-taiwan-strait-1fda357c498ba8cf1b8aafafab36f12e,"BEIJING (AP) — China accused the U.S. of abusing international law with its military maneuvers in the western Pacific, one day after an American naval destroyer sailed through the politically sensitive Taiwan Strait.
While China welcomes military-to-military communication with the United States, Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said Thursday that U.S. warplane and warship activity “on China’s doorstep” is the root cause of the problems between the two military powers.
“The United States side should stop abusing international law, cease all dangerous and provocative behavior, and strictly restrain the activities of front-line troops, which is the fundamental way to avoid accidents at sea and in the air,” he said at a monthly briefing.
The USS John Finn sailed Wednesday though the 160-kilometer (100-mile)-wide waterway that separates China from Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its own territory.
China agreed to resume military contacts with the U.S. at a meeting last November between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in California. In part, the argument for doing so was to be able to manage an unintentional collision or other incident that could happen as both sides hold drills and patrol the waters in regional hotspots including the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.

The U.S. defends its actions as in line with international laws that guarantee freedom of navigation.
“No member of the international community should be intimidated or coerced into giving up their rights and freedoms,” the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet said in a news release on the John Finn’s transit of the Strait. “The United States military flies, sails and operates anywhere international law allows.”
China’s rise has given it the ability to project military power into the western Pacific, which brings it into conflict with the United States, long the dominant military power in the region.
The American military activity is aimed in part at deterring China from launching any attack on Taiwan or using its strength to enforce its territorial claims in disputes with smaller neighbors such as the Philippines.
Chinese and Philippine ships clashed last year as disputes over shoals and other outcroppings in the South China Sea flared. Wu said the Philippines was violating China’s sovereignty “in collusion with outside powers.”
“On the issue of easing tensions in the South China Sea, it is very necessary for the big power concerned, namely the United States, to stop interfering and stop provoking,” he said.
Diplomats from China and the Philippines agreed at a recent meeting in Shanghai to work toward lowering tensions in the South China Sea, but doing so won’t be easy.
“It must be frankly stated that it is impossible to resolve the current South China Sea issue overnight,” Wu said.
China is willing to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation, he said, but warned that “if the Philippine side insists on taking its own course, we will surely take firm countermeasures.”"
CI727MM1MK_2J7L392M2OYBXQY,Auto dealers up campaign urging Biden administration to halt EPA tailpipe emission limits regulation,By ALEXA ST. JOHN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/biden-epa-auto-dealers-electric-vehicles-62c173d2be33e05e3405a489e5924e26,"DETROIT (AP) — More than 4,700 auto dealerships across the United States urged President Joe Biden in a letter Thursday to halt the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to enforce stricter vehicle-pollution standards.
The missive comes just weeks before the agency’s expected ruling on its tailpipe-emissions proposal, which addresses both climate change and pollutants that are harmful to health.
It is the second letter that auto dealers have sent to the White House in two months on the EPA’s upcoming ruling, which could codify the agency’s strictest-ever tailpipe emissions limits, proposed last April. The dealerships said Thursday that the Biden administration did not respond to their first letter sent on Nov. 28.
An EPA spokesperson said the agency cannot comment as the proposal is currently in the interagency review process.
“President Biden is investing in a future that is made in America by American workers as we position the United States to lead the clean energy future,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “More Americans are buying EVs every day—with EV sales rising faster than traditional gas-powered cars—as the President’s Inflation Reduction Act makes EVs more affordable and helps Americans save money when driving.”

With the world focused on trying to limit warming to no more than 1.5-degree Celsius temperature above pre-industrial times, the administration has an ambitious goal to cut domestic planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. Part of its focus is on the transportation sector, 58% of the emissions from which come from passenger cars and trucks, according to the EPA. The regulation also limits hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the air. These emissions cause a host of health issues and disproportionately affect people who live near heavy traffic.
The EPA says its proposed regulations could mean that up to two out of every three vehicles sold in the U.S. are electric by 2032. That’s higher than the administration’s target of 50% set two years ago.
The regulations, which impact light- and medium-duty vehicles beginning with the 2027 model year, could mean a 56% drop in projected greenhouse gas emissions from the fleet, relative to existing standards, avoiding nearly 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2055. They also reduce pollutants harmful to health by 60% from the existing standard by model year 2032.
Most automakers around the globe have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to transition to all-electric new vehicle sales in the coming decade as momentum to address climate change builds. Last year, U.S. EV sales overall grew 47% to a record 1.2 million, according to Motorintelligence.com. EVs are seeing year-over-year growth, but only hit 7.6% of overall market share in 2023.
Given that, thousands of auto dealers say they won’t be able to meet the EPA’s stringent goals.
Nearly 4,000 dealerships of the nearly 17,000 franchised shops nationwide asked Biden to “tap the brakes” on the EPA proposal in the November letter, referring to the rules as an “electric vehicle mandate.” House Republicans approved a bill in December to block the pollution limits and also called the rules a mandate.
In this week’s letter, the dealerships asked Biden to “hit the brakes” entirely, citing several factors that they say indicate slowing EV adoption. The signers said the supply of EVs on dealer lots is twice that of internal combustion engine vehicles, and that they won’t be able to sell EVs at the rate the regulations would require.
“It is uncontestable that the combination of fewer tax incentives, a woefully inadequate charging infrastructure, and insufficient consumer demand makes the proposed electric vehicle mandate completely unrealistic,” the letter says.
The EPA’s tailpipe-pollution limits wouldn’t require automakers to sell a specific number of EVs every year.
Automakers can meet EPA regulations not just through pure-electric vehicle sales, but also through a sales mix including hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, plus cleaner internal-combustion engine vehicles. The EPA has also said that the auto industry could employ widespread use of particulate filters, which mitigate the soot emitted from conventional gasoline-fueled engines.
“In order to stay on track to meeting overall climate policy goals that have been adopted by the country, I think it’s important to be aggressive in this sector where you have the technology, progress is being made, there’s momentum in markets,” said Jessika Trancik, a professor in energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This can be a really important part of the overall effort to reach 2030 and ultimately, 2050 emissions reduction targets.
“There are a number of different ways you can improve efficiencies and reduce emissions,” Trancik added. But, “If you want to meet those targets, fully electric vehicles are probably going to be a really important tool, at least in part, to allow for that because they do offer the greatest emissions cuts.”
The EPA is also proposing regulations for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and the government’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has separately proposed a fuel-economy increase.

CUQKENU5VD_3DYIQ4V2KASJIRN,Sri Lankan lawmakers debate controversial internet safety bill amid protests by rights groups,By BHARATHA MALLAWARACHI,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-media-freedom-freedom-of-expression-internet-economic-crisis-07403d4ee6d5c175048510db8469d6b2,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankan lawmakers on Tuesday began debating a controversial internet safety bill that has been criticized by opposition politicians, journalists and rights groups as a move by the government to stifle freedom of speech.
Public Security Minister Tiran Alles introduced the bill in Parliament, saying it seeks to address problems related to online fraud, abuse and false statements that threaten national security and stability.
He said the laws are necessary to deal with offenses committed online, noting that last year more than 8,000 such complaints were filed with police related to sexual abuse, financial scams, cyber harassment, data theft and other offenses.
However, media, internet and civil rights groups say the bill would have “a chilling effect on free speech,” as several provisions would serve to undermine human rights and freedom of expression. The groups have demanded that the government withdraw the bill.
Lawmakers are expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday.

The bill aims to establish an online safety commission with “wide-ranging powers to restrict free speech” that could direct users, service providers and others to “take down content and block access to accounts on extremely vague and overbroad grounds,” said Article 19, a rights watchdog, and 50 other groups.
Opposition lawmaker Rauff Hakeem said the government is trying to throttle freedom of speech in Sri Lanka, adding that “a very oppressive environment is going to be created.”
“This is a manifestation of a government which is trying to dismantle even the remaining few safeguards for freedom of expression in this country and to destroy democracy,” Hakeem said.
Alles rejected the accusations, saying the bill was not drafted with the intention of harassing media or political opponents.
Debate over the bill comes as Sri Lanka struggles to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which hit the island nation two year ago. The country declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half of it to foreign creditors.
The crisis caused severe shortages of food, fuel and other necessities. Strident public protests led to the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The IMF agreed last March to a $2.9 billion bailout package.
Under new President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine have largely abated over the past year and authorities have restored power supply. But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government’s effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses.
Media and civil rights groups accuse the government of trying to introduce more repressive laws in an attempt to “suppress the public’s right to expression as a narrow effort with the aim of winning the upcoming elections at any cost.”
Sri Lanka’s presidential and parliamentary elections are likely to be held later this year or early next year."
CYLSRK9JXF_EO2TE3VA4WVABJM,"As US brings home large numbers of jailed Americans, some families are still waiting for their turn",By ERIC TUCKER,_,20231227,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/american-hostages-wrongfully-detained-joe-biden-0fb40f42130f59dadb783e8a9823d3e1,"WASHINGTON (AP) — By any standard, the past 18 months have been remarkable for getting wrongfully detained Americans home. There were major swaps with adversaries like Iran and Russia, including one that secured the freedom of WNBA star Brittney Griner, and a large prisoner exchange just last month with Venezuela.
But Harrison Li has had little to celebrate. Despite the succession of high-profile releases, jubilant family reunions and triumphant photos on government airplanes, his father, Kai, remains detained in China on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus and politically motivated.
Li, a Stanford University doctoral student, says though he feels “so much joy and happiness” for the other families — many of whom he’s become friendly with over the years — “I’d be lying if I didn’t say that then the next thought is, you know, when’s it our turn?”
He added, “When you see so many folks come home but then you still see your loved one not, then, yeah, there’s definitely an element of frustration.”
Li is not alone. For all the releases of wrongly detained Americans, many more remain either locked up or missing in countries including Russia, Syria and Afghanistan — often held by a hostile foreign government. In some instances, there have been few signs of progress, and families have sometimes seen the countries that are holding their loved ones release other detainees but not yet their relatives.

Those sensitivities are not lost on Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs and the Biden administration’s public face for matters related to hostages and wrongful detainees — the label applied to Americans jailed in foreign countries for what the government considers legally specious allegations or for improper motivations.
He handles negotiations with foreign governments and once the deal is done flies out to bring the released American back, routinely telling them that on behalf of the U.S. government, “I’m here to take you home.”
“There’s always a very short-lived celebration because we still have a lot of work to do to bring other people home,” Carstens said in an interview.
The Biden administration has been notably aggressive in cutting deals, signing off on prisoner exchanges and other concessions that would once have been unthinkable and achieving releases at what advocates say is a historically high level. U.S. officials have called bringing home wrongfully detained Americans a core administration priority even when it collides with other foreign policy or law enforcement interests, though in all cases, the ability to achieve a deal depends on negotiators reaching mutually agreeable conditions — no small thing when countries otherwise have little they agree on.
Last month, Venezuela freed 10 Americans and returned to the U.S. for prosecution an indicted Navy contractor known as “Fat Leonard” in exchange for the U.S. releasing an ally of President Nicolas Maduro charged in a money-laundering conspiracy. In September, five Americans jailed for years in Iran walked free in a deal that saw the release of nearly $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets. Months earlier, Rwanda freed Paul Rusesabagina, who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda,” after a diplomatic intervention by the U.S.
And in 2022, the U.S. swapped an imprisoned Taliban drug lord for an American contractor in Afghanistan, and a notorious Russian arms trafficker for Griner.
As hostage diplomacy has generated front-page news and become a key area of focus — elevated in part by the October capture of scores of hostages in Israel by Hamas — families of detainees have jostled for attention from the U.S. government, including from President Joe Biden himself.
The president has met with some families — he had in-person and virtual conversations with families of American hostages held in Gaza — though some, like Li, are still seeking their first encounter.
Kai Li, a Chinese immigrant who started an export business in the U.S., was detained in September 2016 after flying into Shanghai. He was placed under surveillance, interrogated without a lawyer and accused of providing state secrets to the FBI. The U.S. government has designated him as wrongfully detained. A United Nations working group has called his 10-year prison sentence arbitrary.
Complicating the matter are diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China, which view each other as strategic rivals. Harrison Li regards last November’s summit between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping as a missed opportunity to more forcefully move his father’s case toward resolution, and wonders what additional steps can be taken.
“You think, OK, what else can you do? What is something that you’re not doing properly or you could do better or you could do more of?” Li said.
Maryam Kamalmaz has had no trace of her father, Majd Kamalmaz, since the psychologist from Texas was stopped at a checkpoint in Syria in 2017 after traveling there to visit a family member. He remains one of several Americans missing in Syria, including journalist Austin Tice, despite a 2020 visit by Carstens to try to negotiate their release.
“Other families know their loved ones’ condition. They know what’s going on. In my father’s case, there’s been no trial, there’s been no case. There’s nothing against him. He’s just basically disappeared into their system, disappeared completely,” said Kamalmaz.
Part of Carstens’ job involves regular communication with families. Sometimes the updates are cheerful, sometimes they’re painful.
Just before Griner’s release, a representative from his office visited the sister of Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan detained in Russia since December 2018, to break the news in person that Griner would be coming home but that Moscow had refused to free Whelan s part of a swap.
Carstens said deals like that, in which a detainee from one country is released but another is not, are “no small thing” and weigh heavily on his team.
“Unless someone’s coming off a plane, onto a tarmac, in the United States of America and into the arms of their loved ones, we’re not getting a win,” he said.
Whelan’s brother, David, released a statement upon Griner’s release trumpeting her freedom while noting the “public disappointment” of his brother’s continued imprisonment.
In an interview, David Whelan said he feels elated when detainees return, though he acknowledged his feelings are more nuanced when it has come to deals with Russia that don’t involve his brother. He laments that his brother is not home, but also doesn’t believe that the U.S. government has diverted resources to other detainees.
At the end of the day, Whelan said: “I think the enemy is the Kremlin. And the people who can make the decision are in the Kremlin.”"
D6QPS0FULT_84Q7EK163TQ239L,Colombia captures its first narco-submarine of the year carrying almost 800 kilos of cocaine,By ASTRID SÚAREZ and MANUEL RUEDA,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/colombia-drugs-submarine-nave-cocaine-f66f6a827dbd38b7bfb1a101abb1e638,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia has intercepted its first narco-submarine of the year, the navy said Monday, as drug traffickers in the South American country produce record amounts of cocaine destined for Europe and the United States.
The submersible was intercepted on Saturday morning off Colombia’s Pacific Coast, navy spokesman Capt. Wilmer Roa said. The 15 meter-long, homemade craft was carrying almost 800 kilograms of cocaine in small packages the size of bricks. The packets were were stamped with images of scorpions and Mexican flags.
“In reality, this was a small” seizure, Roa said. “We’ve caught submarines with almost 3,500 kilos” of the drug.
Roa said that last year Colombia’s navy captured 10 narco-submarines.
Colombia’s government has struggled to limit cocaine production in recent years, as rebel groups and drug trafficking gangs take over territory that was abandoned by Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas following the group’s 2016 peace deal with the government.

According to the UN’s office for Drug and Crime, the area planted with coca bushes in Colombia reached an all time high of 230,000 hectares in 2022, with potential cocaine production also rising to 1,700 tons - a 24% increase from the previous year.
But while cocaine production increases in Colombia, Ecuador is becoming a popular route to smuggle the drug.
On Saturday, officials in Ecuador announced they had also seized a submarine carrying 3.2 tons of cocaine. The submarine was captured with information supplied by Colombia’s navy.
Roa explained that drug traffickers use the hulls of speedboats to make the submersibles, and adapt them so they can travel slightly under the surface of the sea.
“Some people die inside these machines, because they experience mechanical failures, or have very small ducts for letting in fresh air,” he said."
DFTQE1OGS7_1ZTRCPBUB99Q8FF,"With Oregon facing rampant public drug use, lawmakers backpedal on pioneering decriminalization law",By CLAIRE RUSH,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/oregon-drug-decriminalization-law-3f851183d45e9c29609360b09e996d04,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Democratic lawmakers in Oregon on Tuesday unveiled a sweeping new bill that would undo a key part of the state’s first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law, a recognition that public opinion has soured on the measure amid rampant public drug use during the fentanyl crisis.
The bill would recriminalize the possession of small amounts of drugs as a low-level misdemeanor, enabling police to confiscate them and crack down on their use on sidewalks and in parks, its authors said. It also aims to make it easier to prosecute dealers, to access addiction treatment medication, and to obtain and keep housing without facing discrimination for using that medication.
“It’s the compromise path, but also the best policy that we can come up with to make sure that we are continuing to keep communities safe and save lives,” state Sen. Kate Lieber, a Portland Democrat, told The Associated Press.
Voters passed the pioneering decriminalization law, Measure 110, with 58% support in 2020. But Democratic legislators who championed it as a way to treat addiction as a public health matter, not a crime, are now contending with one of the nation’s largest spikes in overdose deaths, along with intensifying pressure from Republicans and growing calls from a well-funded campaign group to overhaul it.
Researchers say it’s too soon to determine whether the law has contributed to the state’s deadly overdose surge, and supporters of the measure say the decadeslong approach of arresting people for possessing and using drugs didn’t work.

The bill, unveiled by Lieber and other Democrats serving on a recently created committee on addiction, is set to be introduced during the legislative session that starts in February. The Legislature adjourned over the summer, but concern over the state’s drug crisis led Democrats to launch the committee in between sessions. Since September, the committee has held multiple hearings and heard testimony from law enforcement and substance use disorder experts on the law’s accomplishments and shortcomings.
Measure 110 directed the state’s cannabis tax revenue toward drug addiction treatment while decriminalizing “personal use” amounts of illicit drugs. Possession of under a gram of heroin, for example, is only subject to a ticket and a maximum fine of $100.
Those caught with small amounts can have the citation dismissed by calling a 24-hour hotline to complete an addiction screening within 45 days, but those who don’t do a screening are not penalized for failing to pay the fine.
In the year after the law took effect in February 2021, only 1% of people who received citations for possession sought help via the hotline, state auditors found. As of last June, the hotline received an average of 10 calls per month that were related to citations.
Opponents of the law say it hasn’t created an incentive to seek treatment, a criticism the new bill seeks to address.
The measure’s details have yet to be finalized, but “personal use” possession of illegal drugs would become a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a $1,250 fine. The bill would not affect Oregon’s legalization of cannabis or psychedelic mushrooms.
Those arrested for small amounts would be referred by police to a peer support specialist to schedule an assessment or intervention. If the person shows up to the meeting, they wouldn’t be charged. If they don’t, the offense could be referred to the district attorney’s office.
If charges are filed, they could avoid jail by agreeing to certain conditions of probation, or by agreeing to have their case diverted to drug court, where judges place people in treatment programs rather than jail.
“We’re trying to give people off-ramps while also introducing some accountability into the system,” Lieber said.
Republican lawmakers said the bill didn’t go far enough. They called for mandatory treatment and “personal use” possession to be a higher-level misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail or a $6,250 fine.
“A low-level class C misdemeanor only provides 30 days in jail as an alternative. This is nowhere near the amount of time needed to address addiction,” state Rep. Kevin Mannix said in a statement.
Advocacy groups that have backed Oregon’s decriminalization law opposed the proposal to once again make “personal use” possession a crime.
“You don’t need a criminal penalty. You need services, and you need to make sure that you’re investing in those services,” said Tera Hurst, executive director of the Health Justice Recovery Alliance. “Criminalization is not an effective tool to getting people into treatment, and it does more harm than good.”
Regarding drug dealing, the bill would make it easier to prosecute people for selling drugs and create harsher penalties for doing so in parks and near homeless shelters and substance use disorder treatment centers.
The bill also aims to expand access to treatment, particularly medications used to treat opioid addiction. It would allow doctors to prescribe such medication without prior approval or review from insurance companies, and make it easier for pharmacists to refill prescriptions in certain emergency situations.
Additionally, it would expand fair housing standards to protect people prescribed such medication from being discriminated against when trying to maintain or access long-term living facilities, such as permanent supportive housing for people exiting homelessness.
Lawmakers will have just 35 days to pass the bill once the legislative session starts on Feb. 5."
DRXYK96382_1KGTZ0JSDUN0R7E,U.S. sets plans to protect endangered whales near offshore wind farms; firms swap wind leases,By WAYNE PARRY,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/offshore-wind-endangered-right-whales-ocean-turbines-67814ad1f39509c39e6e4ca4002e1b26,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Two federal environmental agencies issued plans Thursday to better protect endangered whales amid offshore wind farm development.
That move came as two offshore wind developers announced they were swapping projects.
The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released final plans to protect endangered North American right whales, of which there are only about 360 left in the world.
The agencies said they are trying to find ways to better protect the whales amid a surge of offshore wind farm projects, particularly on the U.S. East Coast. They plan to look for ways to mitigate any potential adverse impacts of offshore wind projects on the whales and their habitat.
The strategy will use artificial intelligence and passive acoustic monitoring to determine where the whales are at a given time and to monitor the impacts of wind development on the animals.

It also calls for avoiding the granting of offshore wind leases in areas where major impacts to right whales may occur; establishing noise limits during construction; supporting research to develop new harm minimization technologies; and making it a priority to develop quieter technology and operating methods for offshore wind development.
They also want to conduct “robust sound field verification” of offshore wind operations to ensure that noise levels are not louder than expected.
The news came about an hour before the companies Equinor and energy giant BP announced they were swapping leases for offshore wind projects in New York and Massachusetts.
The deal calls for Equinor to take full ownership of the Empire Wind lease and projects, and for BP to take full ownership of the Beacon Wind lease and projects.
The companies said the swap will be a “cash neutral transaction,” although Equinor said it would take a loss of about $200 million.
“We now take full ownership of a mature, large-scale offshore wind project in a key energy market, where we have built a strong local organization,” said Pal Eitrheim, an executive vice president at Equinor.
Equinor won the Empire Wind lease in 2017 and the Beacon Wind lease in 2019. In 2020, BP bought a 50% share of both projects.
Although opponents of offshore wind projects blame them for a spate of whale deaths over the past 13 months on the East Coast, the agencies said climate change is the biggest threat to the right whales. They and other scientific agencies say there is no evidence that offshore wind preparation work is harming or killing whales. Many of them have been struck by ships or become entangled in fishing gear.
Of the 360 right whales left in the ocean, only 70 are reproductively active females.
“Climate change is affecting every aspect of right whales’ survival, changing their ocean habitat, their migratory patterns, the location and availability of their prey, and even their risk of becoming entangled in fishing gear or being struck by vessels,” the agencies said in a statement.
In a separate report issued Monday, NOAA said there were 67 confirmed entanglements of large whales nationwide in 2022, the most recent years for which statistics are available. That is down slightly from the previous year and below the annual average of 71, the agency said.
In addition to vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear, which are the primary causes of death or injury to right whales, low female survival, a male-dominated sex ratio, and low calving rates are contributing to the population’s current decline. The species also has low genetic diversity due to its small size, the agencies said.
As of September 2023, there were 30 offshore wind lease areas along the East Coast, the two agencies said. Construction and operations plans for 18 of them have been submitted to BOEM in the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, including projects under construction in Massachusetts and New York.
All these projects are anticipated to use fixed foundation turbines, although future leasing plans farther offshore contemplate the use of floating technology, the agencies said.

DSAGC0MJFU_5KV725289WVCVRA,Top UN court orders Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza but stops short of ordering cease-fire,By MIKE CORDER and RAF CASERT,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-genocide-court-south-africa-27cf84e16082cde798395a95e9143c06,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Nations’ top court on Friday ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive that has laid waste to the Palestinian enclave.
In a ruling that will keep Israel under the legal lens for years to come, the court offered little other comfort to Israeli leaders in a genocide case brought by South Africa that goes to the core of one of the world’s most intractable conflicts. The court’s half-dozen orders will be difficult to achieve without some sort of cease-fire or pause in the fighting.
“The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering,” court President Joan E. Donoghue said.
The president of the International Court of Justice, Joan E. Donoghue, says a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, triggered a major response by Israel.
The ruling amounted to an overwhelming rebuke of Israel’s wartime conduct and added to mounting international pressure to halt the nearly 4-month-old offensive that has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, decimated vast swaths of Gaza and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.

Allowing the accusations to stand stung the government of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fact that the court was willing to discuss the genocide charges was a “mark of shame that will not be erased for generations.” He vowed to press ahead with the war.
The power of the ruling was magnified by its timing, coming on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Later Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that the top court’s rulings are legally binding and “trusts” that Israel will comply with its orders, including “to take all measures within its power” to prevent acts that would bring about the destruction of the Palestinian people.
“Those truly needing to stand trial are those that murdered and kidnapped children, women and the elderly,” former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said, referring to Hamas militants who stormed through Israeli communities on Oct. 7 in the attack that set off the war. The assault killed some 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being kidnapped.
The court also called on Hamas to release the hostages who are still in captivity. Hamas urged the international community to make Israel carry out the court’s orders.
Many of the measures were approved by an overwhelming majority of the judges. Of the six orders, an Israeli judge voted in favor of two — an order for humanitarian aid and another for the prevention of inflammatory speech.
Israeli Judge Aharon Barak said he supported those orders in the hope that they would “help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric” while easing the ”consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable.”
Such provisional measures issued by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel will comply with them.
“We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people,” said Netanyahu, who pushed back against the ruling in two languages. In a message aimed at his domestic audience, the tone was more defiant in Hebrew, and he stopped short of overtly criticizing the court in English.
The court ruled that Israel must do all it can to prevent genocide, including refraining from harming or killing Palestinians. It also ruled that Israel must urgently get basic aid to Gaza and that the country should punish any incitement to genocide, among other measures.
The panel told Israel to submit a report on steps taken within a month.
“That’s a time that the court could come back and say, ‘You have not met the orders. You have not complied. Now we find you are in the midst of committing genocide,’” said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of law and international peace studies at Notre Dame University’s Kroc Institute.
Friday’s decision was an interim ruling. It could take years for the court to consider all aspects of South Africa’s genocide allegations. The U.N. Security Council scheduled a meeting for Wednesday to follow up on the ruling.
In Israel, commentators said the decision not to order a cease-fire was received with some relief since it helped Israel avoid a collision with a top U.N. body.
Palestinians and their supporters said the court took an important step toward holding Israel accountable. The Foreign Ministry of the internationally backed Palestinian self-rule government in the West Bank said the ruling “should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity,” an apparent reference to the United States, Israel’s chief ally.
The U.S. repeated its position that Israel must “take all possible steps” to minimize harm to civilians, increase humanitarian aid and curb “dehumanizing rhetoric.”
“We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded,” the State Department said in a statement.
The South African government said the ruling determined that “Israel’s actions in Gaza are plausibly genocidal.”
“There is no credible basis for Israel to continue to claim that its military actions are in full compliance with international law,” the government said in a statement.
Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But this time, it took the rare step of sending a high-level legal team — a sign of how seriously it regards the case.
The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll, but the agency has said about two-thirds of those killed have been women and children.
The Israeli military claims at least 9,000 of the more than 26,000 dead were Hamas militants.
U.N. officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease and malnutrition, with at least one-quarter of the Gaza population facing starvation.
Yuval Shany, a law professor at Hebrew University and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the court’s decision was “not as bad as Israel feared it would be” and would not fundamentally alter the way the military conducts the war.
“The greatest fear was that the court would ask Israel to stop the war,” Shany said, describing the decision as “something that Israel can live with.”

DUTNYFNFKY_QOEREPFR3JV79YC,Families of hostages held in Gaza storm Israel’s parliament meeting demanding deal for release,By MELANIE LIDMAN and WAFAA SHURAFA,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-01-22-2024-d092205024c6064eb0440f0bfe06657f,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Dozens of family members of hostages held by Hamas stormed a committee meeting in Israel’s parliament Monday, demanding a deal to win their loved ones’ release, as European foreign ministers joined growing international calls for Israel to negotiate on the creation of a Palestinian state after the war.
The developments showed the increasing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has dug in on both fronts. He has insisted to the Israeli public that pursuing the devastating offensive in Gaza is the only way to bring the hostages home. At the same time, he has rejected the United States’ vision for a postwar resolution, saying he will never allow a Palestinian state.
The dispute over Gaza’s future pits Israel against its top ally and much of the international community. It also poses a major obstacle to plans for postwar governance or reconstruction of the coastal territory, large parts of which have been left unlivable by Israeli bombardment.
As fears grow that Israel’s war in Gaza will spark a wider regional conflict, the U.S. and British militaries bombed eight locations in Yemen used by the Houthi rebels. It’s the eighth time the U.S. has bombed Houthi sites since Jan. 12, U.S. officials said late Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a military operation. The Iranian-backed Houthis have attacked shipping in the region’s waterways, saying they aim to end the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.
In southern Gaza, Israeli strikes and shelling intensified in and around the city of Khan Younis, sending Palestinian families fleeing south in pickup trucks and donkey carts loaded with possessions.

In the city, which has been a battle zone for weeks, people dug graves for the dead inside the yard of Al-Nasser Hospital as staff struggled to deal with dozens of newly killed and wounded, including children. Health care workers said strikes hit at least four schools sheltering displaced people on the city’s western edges, including two inside a coastal strip that Israel had declared a safe zone for people fleeing.
Gaza’s internet and phone networks collapsed again Monday for the 10th time during the war. The repeated blackouts severely hamper distribution of aid that’s essential for the survival of the territory’s population of 2.3 million, U.N. officials said. The loss of service also prevents Palestinians from communicating with each other and the outside world.
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas and to return all remaining hostages after the Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel that triggered the war. In that attack, some 1,200 people were killed and Hamas and other militants abducted around 250 people.
Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it’s possible to do either.
Around 100 hostages were freed under a weeklong cease-fire deal in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been confirmed dead. Hamas has said it will free more captives only in exchange for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners.
Netanyahu has ruled out such an agreement, but anger is rising among hostages’ families. Relatives and other protesters set up a tent camp outside Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem, vowing to remain until a deal is reached.
On Monday, dozens of family members of the hostages stormed into a gathering of the Knesset’s finance committee, holding up signs and yelling, “You won’t sit here while they are dying there!”
“These are our children!” they shouted. Some had to be physically restrained, and at least one person was escorted out.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 25,295 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 60,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
Residents in Khan Younis reported bombardment on all sides of the city. At Nasser Hospital, Ayman Abu Abaid, the head of surgery, told Al Jazeera TV early Monday that at least 50 dead and more than 100 wounded had been brought to the facility.
Ashraf Al-Qudra, spokesman for the Health Ministry, said Israeli troops had stormed Al-Khair Hospital and detained the medical staff, the latest hospital that troops have seized during the conflict. The hospital is just inside the safe zone at Muwasi, a rural coastal strip west of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military had said it would not carry out operations.
Volunteers with the Red Crescent said strikes hit four schools west of Khan Younis — two of them inside the Muwasi zone — causing an unknown number of casualties. They said the organization’s ambulances couldn’t reach the sites.
Families streamed out of Khan Younis along the coastal highway, some walking, some loading blankets and possessions into vehicles. They headed toward Rafah, the tiny sliver at the extreme southern end of Gaza where well over 1 million people are already crowded, many living in tents that have filled the streets.
As he fled Khan Younis with his family, Ahmad Shurrab said he had been displaced multiple times. “Where should I go? Should I go to Rafah? Rafah is like one street. What do they want from us?” he shouted.
Some 85% of the Gaza population has been driven from their homes by the war. United Nations officials say 1 in 4 people in Gaza is starving as the fighting and Israeli restrictions hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid. Only 15 bakeries are working across the Gaza Strip, all of them in either Rafah or the central town of Deir al-Balah, the U.N. said.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants in its offensive, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it operates in dense residential areas.
The war has also stoked tensions across the region, with Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israeli and U.S. targets.
Netanyahu, whose popularity has plummeted since Oct. 7, faces pressure from the U.S. to shift to more precise military operations and do more to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The United States is also calling for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the war and for negotiations to start on a two-state solution. The authority currently governs pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was ejected from Gaza in 2007 when Hamas took power.
Netanyahu has rejected both the entry of the Palestinian Authority and the creation of a Palestinian state. His governing coalition is beholden to far-right parties that want to step up the offensive, encourage the emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and reestablish Jewish settlements there.
At a meeting in Brussels, European Union foreign ministers added their voices to the calls for a Palestinian state, saying it was the only way to achieve peace.
French Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Sejourne said Netanyahu’s rejection of statehood was “worrying. There will be a need for a Palestinian state with security guarantees for all.”
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind?” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said of Israel. “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them off?”
In an interview with CNN late Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said the kingdom will not normalize relations with Israel or contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction without a credible path to a Palestinian state. His comments were notable because before the war, the U.S. had been trying to broker a landmark normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
The Palestinians seek a state including Gaza, the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Peace talks broke down nearly 15 years ago.

DX8J4SDM96_XAL479NNE4K9OJT,Sen. Bob Menendez says gold bars and cash at his residence were illegally found and seized,By LARRY NEUMEISTER,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/menendez-wife-federal-bribery-indictment-4683ff2dfd1a9521544be7ac98de1e84,"NEW YORK (AP) — New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez wants a New York judge to toss out much of the evidence in the bribery prosecution against him, saying investigators illegally searched his residence as revenge because the Democrat defeated a prior prosecution in his home state.
His arguments, delivered by his lawyers, were contained in papers filed late Monday in Manhattan federal court, where Menendez faces a May trial.
In 2017, a federal jury in New Jersey deadlocked on 18 criminal charges against Menendez and a wealthy Florida eye doctor accused of buying his influence with luxury vacations and campaign contributions. Prosecutors then dropped the case.
“The government’s apparent zeal to ‘get back’ at Senator Menendez for defeating its prior prosecution has overwhelmed its sound judgment,” his lawyers said. “The FBI ran roughshod over the Senator’s Fourth Amendment rights, and all evidence collected from those searches must therefore be suppressed.”
Along with his wife, the 70-year-old Democrat is now charged with accepting bribes of cash, gold bars and a luxury car over the last five years to carry out favors for three businessmen who are also charged. All have pleaded not guilty.

After his fall arrest, the senator was forced to give up his powerful post leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Menendez’s lawyers asserted in their latest effort to find defects in the indictment against him that search warrants used to get judicial permission for the seizure of Menendez’s personal belongings “were riddled with material misrepresentations and omissions.”
Menendez’s lawyers said FBI agents ransacked the senator’s home during a June 16, 2022 raid, seizing “virtually anything of value.”
“Agents broke down doors (even, in some cases, where the doors were unlocked) and tore apart closets, wardrobes, dressers and other storage locations in the home, flipped over documents and rifled through file folders,” they wrote. “The FBI seized all manner of things, including the cash and gold bars that the government has made the centerpiece of its case.”
Some pages of the lawyers’ submission were heavily redacted as they asked the judge to conduct a hearing to study their claims.
A spokesperson for prosecutors declined to comment."

E030K9MOZA_CQU5NBA7J981PZD,Former orphanage founder in Haiti faces federal charges of sexually abusing minors,_,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-orphanage-founder-abuse-arrest-e68f80d4a4ea3fc635c2d4d06732d203,"DENVER (AP) — An orphanage founder in Haiti who faced past accusations of abusing boys in his care is facing criminal charges in the U.S. after an investigation revealed that he traveled to the Caribbean country to sexually abuse minors, federal officials said Tuesday.
Michael Geilenfeld, 71, previously sued a Maine activist over accusations he abused boys in Haiti, calling the claims “vicious, vile lies,” before an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI led to an indictment contending he traveled from Miami to the island nation “for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person under 18.”
Geilenfeld, who was arrested in Colorado, is expected to have a detention hearing in Denver on Thursday before being flown to Miami, where the case originated, officials said. His Massachusetts lawyer, Robert Oberkoetter, declined to comment.
Geilenfeld and North Carolina-based Hearts with Haiti sued the activist, Paul Kendrick, who accused Geilenfeld of being a serial pedophile after speaking to young men who claimed they were abused by Geilenfeld as boys in Port-au-Prince, where Geilenfeld founded the St. Joseph’s Home for Boys in 1985.
In a federal civil lawsuit in Maine, Geilenfeld and the charity blamed Kendrick for Geilenfeld’s 237-day imprisonment in Haiti, damage to his reputation and the loss of millions of dollars in donations.

The activist’s insurance companies ended the lawsuit in 2019 by paying $3 million to Hearts with Haiti, but nothing to Geilenfeld.
Kendrick had praise Tuesday for those who stood up to the man who held the purse strings to their education, food, shelter and clothing.
“It took an unbelievable amount of courage for them to come forward and report their abuse,” he said.
The conduct cited by the grand jury happened between November 2006 and December 2010, when Geilenfeld was operating the orphanage.
The charge of traveling in foreign commerce for illicit sexual conduct has a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
Authorities in Haiti have long investigated sex abuse allegations against Geilenfeld, who was arrested in the Caribbean country in September 2014 but released a year later after his case was dismissed.
The alleged victims, who did not appear in court in Haiti, were granted an appeal, but the case has yet to go to trial as Haiti’s judicial system continues to crumble amid widespread corruption and a spike in gang violence."

Authorities said the storm system was still tracking west across the Coral Sea and that gusts of 140 kph (87 mph) are forecast as the cyclone crossed the mainland on Thursday night.
“It’s still making a pretty direct track for Townsville, but it is picking up speed along with its strength as well,” Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Wednesday.
The Bureau said the cyclone would bring intense rainfall that could cause “dangerous and life threatening flash flooding,” and storm tides between Townsville and Mackay which would exacerbate flooding.
More than 100 schools in the affected region were closed on Thursday, the Queensland state government said, while several Australia Day national holiday celebrations scheduled for Friday had been cancelled.

Several airlines have cancelled their flights to and from Townsville and Hamilton Island, and Queensland Rail services north of Rockhampton had been suspended in anticipation of the severe weather.
Residents and guests of the popular tourist destination of Hamilton Island have been asked to stay indoors as the cyclone passes. A community refuge center had been opened on the island to provide shelter.
The storm system is expected to move into inland regions of Queensland from Friday, bringing heavy rain and increased likelihood of flooding.
The Queensland government said extra emergency services crews, specializing in flood rescues, have also been deployed, but residents still needed to prepare.
“We’re prepared and ready for the worst, now we wait and hope for the best,” Queensland state premier Steven Miles told reporters in Brisbane.
“Our message to Queenslanders is now is the time to make sure that you’re ready,” he said. “Make sure your emergency kit is stocked. Make sure that you have enough essential items to potentially have to get through days without power.”
It’s the second cyclone in as many months to hit the region, which was lashed in December by Tropical Cyclone Jasper, the first tropical cyclone of the Australian season, which spans the hot southern hemisphere months of November to April."

Families made their way on foot down the coastal highway, smoke billowing from the city behind them. Others loaded blankets and belongings into vehicles or donkey carts.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, and one in four of them are starving, the U.N. says.
Late Monday, U.S. officials said the American and British militaries bombed multiple sites in Yemen used by the Iranian-backed Houthis to attack shipping in the Red Sea, as fears grow that Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza will spark a regional conflict.
The Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, which erupted on Oct. 7 when militants from Gaza attacked southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas, and to return around 100 hostages who are still held in Gaza.
But he’s facing mounting pressure from the hostages’ relatives to make a deal with Hamas and win their loved ones’ release. On Monday, family members disrupted a committee meeting in Israel’s parliament, yelling, “You won’t sit here while they are dying there!”

Here’s the latest:
WASHINGTON — The U.S. and British militaries bombed multiple sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen on Monday night, several U.S. officials said. It’s the second time the two allies have conducted coordinated retaliatory strikes on the rebels’ missile-launching capabilities.
According to officials, the U.S. and U.K. used warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets to take out Houthi missile storage sites and launchers. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing mission.
The joint operation comes about 10 days after U.S. and British warships and fighter jets struck more than 60 targets in 28 locations. That what was the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The Houthis link their attacks to the conflict.
The Houthi media office said in an online statement that several American and British raids targeted Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. And Jamal Hassan, a resident from south Sanaa, told The Associated Press that two strikes landed near his home, setting off car alarms in the street. An Associated Press journalist in Sanaa also heard aircraft flying above the skies of Sanaa overnight Monday.
The latest barrage of allied attacks follows an almost-daily assault on Houthi missile launchers by U.S. fighter jets and ship-based Tomahawks over the past week.
The chaotic wave of attacks and reprisals involving the United States, its allies and foes suggests that the retaliatory strikes haven’t deterred the Houthis from their campaign against Red Sea shipping, and that the broader regional war that the U.S. has spent months trying to avoid is becoming closer to reality.
Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed.
WASHINGTON — Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday that an attack by Iranian-backed militants on a base housing U.S. troops in Iraq on Saturday “was a larger scale attack than we have seen before,” calling it a “barrage.”
Multiple missiles were fired at al-Asad air base in western Iraq, injuring two U.S. personnel and one Iraqi Security Forces member, she said. The U.S. personnel have returned to duty, Singh said.
Since the Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza began on Oct. 7, Iran-backed militias have launched 151 attacks on U.S. facilities in Syria and Iraq. Most of them have been claimed by an umbrella group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has said the attacks are in retaliation for Washington’s support for Israel in the war.
Singh was briefing reporters at the Pentagon Monday. According to the Pentagon, the three latest attacks took place on Monday morning and included multiple rockets fired at U.S. and coalition troops at Mission Support Site Euphrates in Syria, a single rocket fired at the Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria and a one-way attack drone fired at al-Asad. There were no casualties or damage reported from these attacks.
Also on Monday, the U.S. slapped new sanctions on Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani, saying they have provided assistance to Iran’s military wing and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
RAMALLAH, West Bank — Communication services across the Gaza Strip have dropped due to ongoing fighting, cutting the besieged territory off from the outside world, the Palestinian telecoms provider Paltel said Monday.
“We regret to announce that telecom services in Gaza Strip have been lost,” Paltel said in a post on X. “Gaza is blacked out again for the 10th time since October 7th due to the ongoing and escalating aggression.”
Communication services in Gaza partially returned on Friday following a weeklong blackout. During that time, Palestinians from the enclave often walked miles from their homes or places of shelter hunting for a signal to send message friends and loved ones.
The telecommunications company is used by people in both the Israeli-occupied West Bank and The Gaza Strip.
JERUSALEM — The U.S. Navy’s top Mideast commander says Iran is “very directly involved” in ship attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels during Israel’s war against Hamas.
Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the Navy’s 5th Fleet, stopped short of saying Tehran directed individual attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis link their attacks to the Israel-Hamas war.
However, Cooper acknowledged in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday that attacks associated with Iran have expanded from previously threatening just the Persian Gulf and its Strait of Hormuz into waters across the wider Middle East. He described the Houthi attacks as the most significant hostile actions against merchant shipping in two generations.
In recent days, the U.S. has launched seven rounds of airstrikes on Houthi military sites, targeting air bases under the rebels’ control and suspected missile launch sites.
So far, Iran has not directly gotten involved in fighting either Israel or the U.S. since the war in Gaza began on Oct. 7. However, Cooper maintained Iran had been directly fueling the Houthi attacks on shipping.
“What I’ll say is Iran is clearly funding, they’re resourcing, they are supplying and they’re providing training,” Cooper said. “They’re obviously very directly involved. There’s no secret there.”
BRUSSELS — European Union foreign ministers are saying they think the creation of a Palestinian state is the only credible way to achieve peace in the Middle East.
As they met in Brussels on Monday, the ministers expressed concern that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has rejected Palestinian statehood. He has also described plans for open-ended military control over Gaza.
The EU invited the foreign ministers of Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt, Jordan and a representative of the Arab League to take part in the talks.
Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz refused to respond when asked about the possibility of Palestinian statehood. Holding up pictures of Israeli hostages, Katz said he had come to seek support for Israel’s campaign to dismantle Hamas.
WASHINGTON — The U.S. has hit Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO with sanctions for allegedly providing assistance to Iran’s military wing.
Additionally, the U.S. has imposed a fifth round of sanctions on the militant group Hamas for its abuse of cryptocurrency since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
In the new sanctions announced Monday, Treasury said Fly Baghdad and its CEO Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani have provided assistance to Iran’s military wing and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. A representative from the firm was not immediately available.
The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans.
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also designated three leaders and supporters of an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah, as well as a business that it says moves and launders funds for the organization.
Fly Baghdad denied the U.S. allegations and said it would take legal action to demand compensation for losses resulting from the sanctions “as it is clear that the decision was based on misleading and false information and cannot stand before the law.”
JERUSALEM — Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat says the kingdom will not normalize relations with Israel or contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction without a credible path to a Palestinian state. That’s a nonstarter for Israel’s government.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan’s remarks in an interview with CNN broadcast late Sunday were some of the most direct yet from Saudi officials.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces mounting domestic pressure over the plight of Israeli hostages, including an angry protest inside a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday.
He has rejected Palestinian statehood and described plans for open-ended military control over Gaza. The dispute over Gaza’s future pits Israel against its top ally, the United States, as well as much of the international community.
MELBOURNE, Australia — A pro-Palestinian protester threw papers onto an Australian Open court and briefly disrupted a match between Alexander Zverev and Cameron Norrie on Monday before being stopped by other spectators.
Olympic champion Zverev said he didn’t feel unsafe but questioned why it took several minutes for security to react, leaving it to tennis fans to intervene.
“When something like this happens, it shouldn’t be another fan dragging the other person out,” he said, noting that security at Melbourne Park was usually very tight, including for the players. “It should be the security guys ... there quite quickly.”
Protesters threw anti-war pamphlets onto at least two courts and also near the entrance to the tournament site.
At Zverev’s match, a woman wearing a face mask threw anti-war pamphlets from the stands onto the court behind the baseline during the sixth game of the third set on Margaret Court Arena.
Printed in black on the white pages was the message “Free Palestine” and “While you’re watching tennis bombs are dropping on Gaza.”
Ball kids gathered up the papers and the match continued after security escorted the protester away."
E9JOC5RQ2J_S73JA09MCR8PGHO,Swedish PM says he’s willing to meet Hungary’s Orban to end deadlock over Sweden’s NATO membership,_,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sweden-hungary-nato-8e97f00ea8b8e2a070977ac42310276a,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has agreed to meet with his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orbán, who invited Kristersson to Budapest to discuss Sweden’s accession into NATO, Swedish media reported Thursday.
Kristersson said he agrees more dialogue between the countries would be beneficial. Orbán’s invitation comes as Hungary and Turkey remain the only NATO members not to have ratified Sweden’s bid to join the defense alliance.
“I look forward to discussing all these issues in depth with you in Budapest at a time convenient for both of us,” Kristersson wrote in a letter to Orbán, according to Swedish news agency TT. The Swede also pointed out that they will meet in Brussels on Feb. 1 for a European Council meeting.
Admission into NATO requires unanimity among all member countries, but more than a year of delays in Budapest and Ankara have frustrated other allies who want to expand the defense alliance amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Turkish legislators have endorsed Sweden’s NATO membership, lifting a major hurdle on the previously nonaligned country’s entry into the military alliance. Lawmakers ratified Sweden’s accession protocol 287 to 55, with ruling party members saying the country’s tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who still has to sign the ratification, also previously has linked the ratification to Turkey’s desire to buy fighter jets from the U.S.
Turkey had been delaying Sweden’s membership for more than a year, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups that Ankara regards as security threats. It sought concessions from Stockholm, including moves to counter militants.
Orbán, a right-wing populist who has been lukewarm in his support for neighboring Ukraine and maintained a friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has long promised that Hungary would not be the last NATO member to ratify Sweden’s bid.
Sweden and Finland abandoned their traditional positions of military nonalignment to seek protection under NATO’s security umbrella, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming NATO’s 31st member, after Turkey’s parliament ratified the Nordic country’s bid."
EITAWIK8PU_2AIEBUIRICMB6K8,Evers in State of the State address vows to veto any bill that would limit access to abortions,By SCOTT BAUER,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-state-of-state-880d83a55993320b19ed54e81b51bc10,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers vowed in his State of the State speech Tuesday to veto any bill that would limit access to abortions and announced plans to expand access to emergency contraception.
Evers also declared 2024 the “Year of the Worker” and called on Republicans and Democrats to work together on addressing workforce issues, including expanding access to affordable housing, child care and paid family leave.
Evers also called on the Legislature to release funding to address PFAS pollution.
Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos derided the address, Evers sixth State of the State, as “typical Tony Evers.”
“Not a lot of new ideas and a lot of rehashing of old things that have been proposed over the course of the past few years and failed,” Vos said.

Evers issued his abortion veto pledge even as Republicans move forward with a measure that would let voters weigh in on whether it should be banned after 14 weeks of pregnancy.
The speech comes as Evers and Republicans who control the Legislature have had some bipartisan successes, but continue to fight over redistricting, abortion, tax cuts, election administration and other key issues in a presidential election year.
Evers, like many Democrats nationwide, made abortion rights a focus of his winning 2022 campaign, and he returned to that theme again Tuesday. He noted that his opponent, Republican Tim Michels, supported banning abortions and lost.
“I want to speak directly to women in Wisconsin tonight,” Evers said. “I will veto any bill that takes away your reproductive freedom or makes reproductive health care any less accessible in Wisconsin than it is today. Period.”
Evers announced that enrollees in the state’s BadgerCare Plus Medicaid program will have access to over-the-counter contraception, including emergency contraception, without a separate prescription. The medication will be provided without any out-of-pocket costs, Evers said.
Evers said the public’s widespread support of abortion rights as shown in statewide and nationwide polls shows the importance of having legislative maps that fairly reflect the population. The Wisconsin Supreme Court in December tossed out the current Republican-drawn maps as unconstitutional.
“When elected officials gerrymander themselves into safe seats, they can comfortably ignore the overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites,” Evers said.
Evers also renewed his pledge to fight efforts to make it more difficult to vote in the battleground state. Evers has vetoed a raft of Republican proposals over the past five years that seek to make changes to election administration in the state.
Evers said that in coming weeks he will be announcing new steps his administration is taking to increase voter turnout. He didn’t reveal any details.
Vos said he was disappointed that Evers didn’t mention cutting taxes as Republicans have proposed.
“We’re going to move forward with our plan and hopefully Gov. Evers once he has a chance to review them will sign them into law,” Vos said.
Despite the divisions, Evers called on Republicans and Democrats to work together to address Wisconsin’s workforce shortages, declaring 2024 the “Year of the Worker.”
Evers called for expanding paid family leave, an idea the Legislature rejected last year, investing more in public education and coming up with a long-term solution to child care shortages. Republicans also rejected a plan from Evers last year to continue the Child Care Counts program, but he got around them by allocating $170 million in pandemic relief funds to keep it running through June 2025.
“Republicans are officially on the clock to make the meaningful investments necessary to prevent the collapse of an industry that’s essential for maintaining our current levels of workforce participation,” Evers said.
Evers challenged Republicans to come up with alternate plans if they continue to reject his comprehensive workforce proposals as they have done twice already.
“I will work with any legislator, any partner, any stakeholder who’s willing to engage in meaningful conversations on these issues to do the right thing for Wisconsin,” Evers said. “In the meantime, my administration will continue to pursue every pathway and seek every avenue to address our workforce challenges without legislative action, just as we have for five years.”
Evers also renewed his call for Republicans to release $125 million in funding approved in the state budget to fight pollution from so-called forever chemical known as PFAS. He also called on them to spend more on mental health services statewide. Evers announced the creation of a new interagency council designed to reduce barriers and address gaps in mental health services.
In his speech delivered before lawmakers, members of the state Supreme Court, tribal leaders and others, Evers highlighted bipartisan successes in the past year, including an agreement on a plan to pay for repairs to the Milwaukee Brewers’ stadium that will keep the team in Wisconsin through at least 2050."
ET5YOBL3ZZ_9QBEAGN2KZ4T6MM,Italy’s premier slams Stellantis over reduced Italian footprint since Peugeot-FiatChrysler tie-up,By COLLEEN BARRY,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/stellantis-meloni-production-france-italy-ac43c5f0b76ebbde1b73754cd73383e1,"MILAN (AP) — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed carmaker Stellantis, accusing it of weakening Italy’s industrial footprint since the merger of FiatChrysler and PSA Peugeot that created the world’s fourth largest auto maker.
As one of Italy’s top private sector employers, Fiat and its successors, FiatChrysler and then Stellantis, have always gotten government attention, but rarely have premiers been so pointed in their comments. Meloni also characterized the merger that created Stellantis in 2021 as a French takeover.
“We want to return to making 1 million vehicles a year with whomever wants to invest in the historic Italian excellence,’’ she said in a speech to parliament Wednesday.
Meloni cited figures that motor vehicle production in Italy had dropped from 1 million in 2017 to under 700,000 in 2022 and that Stellantis had slashed 7,000 jobs since the merger.
“If you want to sell cars on the international market advertised as Italian jewels then these cars need to be produced in Italy,’' Meloni said.

Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, who was visiting a plant in Abruzzo, told reporters that he didn’t think the company’s Italian workers would appreciate Meloni’s characterizations.
“We have more than 40,000 workers in Italy who work very hard to adapt the company to the new reality, as decided by politicians, and they are full of talent,’’ he said.
The carmaker said production in Italy grew by nearly 10% last year to 752,000 vehicles, two-thirds of which were exported, “contributing to the Italian trade balance.” Stellantis said it has invested several billion euros in Italian operations for new products and production sites in recent years.
Automotive industry expert Franceso Zirpoli said annual car production in Italy fell from 2 million two decades ago to about 800,000 before the pandemic, despite the goal of the late former FiatChrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne of creating a luxury pole in Italy producing 1.4 million cars a year.
FiatChrysler instead started looking for a European partner, putting a hold on new investments, which only weakened Turin’s claim to remain a research and development center after the merger in 2021, he said.
“It was evident that the technological heart of Europe could not be Turin, it had to be Paris,’’ said Zirpoli, director of the Center for Automotive and Mobility Innovation at Venice’s Ca’ Foscari University.
Without the anchor of research and development activities “you can easily move production from one place to another, and Italy became just one other place where you can locate production,” he said.
Zirpoli said the key for any government that wants to boost production is to make Italy an attractive place to invest.
While Meloni touted Italy’s automotive “jewels,” such as Fiat, Maserati and Alfa Romeo, Zirpoli noted that most of the 474,000 Stellantis vehicles produced in Italy last year for export bore the U.S. brand Jeep nameplate — not the group’s storied Italian brands."
F54KQDCEQG_XQLR0K8AB8SO4RO,Cyprus rescues 60 Syrian migrants from rickety boat after 6 days at sea. Five minors hospitalized,_,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-boat-migrants-syria-rescue-b55a84adab5ad44924eaf47aace9b309,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cypriot police rescued 60 Syrian migrants from a rickety wooden boat that had been at sea for six days, and five minors had to be hospitalized, three of them in intensive care, authorities said Wednesday.
The migrants were found some 55 kilometers (34 miles) off the island nation’s southeastern tip and appeared to have run short of food and water, officials said.
Police and army helicopters initially flew three children and an adult to a hospital after a passing merchant ship notified Cypriot authorities of the boat’s presence off the island’s coast in pre-dawn hours.
Health Services spokesman Charalambos Charilaou told The Associated Press that three minors were in critical condition and two were listed as serious. The adult who was flown to a hospital was treated for hypothermia and released.
Three other adults who had broken bones were treated by officers aboard a patrol vessel that intercepted the migrant boat, police said.

The boat was towed to harbor and the remaining migrants received medical care.
Authorities said the boat had set sail from Lebanon on Jan. 18.
A Lebanese lawyer who follows migrant issues in his country said the boat had gone missing since its departure until it reached Cyprus. He said the migrants were in bad shape because they hadn’t eaten for days.
Lebanon’s coast is about 168 kilometers (105 miles) from Cyprus.
Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides thanked authorities for their quick response in rescuing the migrants. But he said the Lebanese government needs to take action to curb these departures “because we know that these are Syrians who come here from Lebanon.”
Although overall migrant arrivals to Cyprus have significantly gone down, arrivals by sea almost quadrupled from 937 in 2022 to 3,889 in 2023, with almost all migrants being Syrian, according to official interior ministry numbers.
In a written statement, Cypriot Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou said the boat’s arrival was “unfortunate proof” of how people-smuggling rings are endangering lives by forcing migrants to make the journey aboard unsuitable craft.
Ioannou said it’s for this reason that he had told European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson during her recent visit to Cyprus about the urgent need for the EU to put together a unit composed of Europol members, Lebanese officials and Cypriot police to partol Lebanon’s borders.
He said he would again suggest the EU re-evaluate the safety of certain areas inside Syria to enable the repatriation of Syrian migrants when he meets with fellow EU interior ministers in Brussels on Thursday.

FDA5JVER7R_63HPQL4KQTWH3AG,Top religious leaders in Haiti denounce kidnapping of nuns and demand government action,_,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-kidnapped-nuns-archdiocese-letter-83daed4f598f4ee1bbcc565e717522ca,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince pleaded for the release of six nuns kidnapped last week and demanded that Haiti’s government crack down on gang violence, in a strongly worded letter released Monday.
The Archdiocese, along with the Haitian Conference of the Religious, said in the letter that Haitians are tired of the “reign of terror” imposed by armed groups and called on government officials to protect people and their property.
“On many occasions, the Church has denounced their silence, which is similar to an attitude of contempt for people’s suffering,” the letter stated.
Religious leaders said they were distressed to witness that there has not been a serious response to what it called a scourge of kidnappings for more than two years. They said the ongoing violence has “plunged the country into an increasingly confusing and chaotic situation” as they called for the safe release of the kidnapped nuns without conditions.
The nuns and two other people were traveling aboard a bus in Port-au-Prince when they were kidnapped last Friday. No one has publicly claimed responsibility for the abduction.
On Sunday, Pope Francis pleaded for their release. Speaking from a window of the Apostolic Palace to faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said he learned of the news of the kidnapping with sorrow: “In asking fervently for their release, I pray for social harmony in the country, and I ask all to put stop to the violence, which causes so much suffering to that dear population.”
Gangs have been blamed for the kidnappings of nearly 2,500 people last year, a more than 80% increase compared with the previous year, according to U.N. statistics. Police remain overwhelmed and underfunded, with less than 10,000 active officers at a time in a country of more than 11 million people."
FDUJNC3APB_ZBIAECABS527ZQW,Hungary is the last holdout for Sweden’s NATO membership. So when will Orbán follow Turkey’s lead?,By JUSTIN SPIKE,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hungary-sweden-nato-membership-orban-last-holdout-13cb5837bc1819382a08531a879fa348,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — With Turkey completing its ratification of Sweden’s bid to join NATO, Hungary is the last member of the military alliance not to have given its approval.
After more than a year of delays, and consistent urging from its Western partners to move forward with Sweden’s application, the Central European country and its conservative populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, are once again in the spotlight.
Orbán has long promised that Hungary wouldn’t be the last NATO member to ratify Sweden’s request to join the alliance. Yet Monday’s approval in Turkey’s parliament has upended those guarantees, and others in the alliance are now asking: When will Budapest follow Ankara’s lead?
Hungary’s government, Orbán says, is in favor of bringing Sweden into NATO, but lawmakers in his governing Fidesz party remain unconvinced, offended by “blatant lies” from some Swedish politicians that have excoriated the quality of Hungary’s democracy.
Yet Orbán’s critics say that there is no such schism within his party, and that when it comes to Hungary’s approval of Sweden’s NATO membership, Orbán alone is in control.

While Turkey made a series of concrete demands from Sweden as preconditions for supporting its bid to join the alliance, Hungary’s government — long under fire in the European Union for alleged breaches of democracy and rule-of-law standards — has expressed no such requirements, hinting only that it expects a greater degree of respect from Stockholm.
Hungary’s opposition parties, which favor Sweden’s membership in NATO, have made several attempts over the past year to schedule a vote on the matter. But lawmakers from the Fidesz party, which holds a two-thirds majority in parliament, have refused to lend their support.
Agnes Vadai, a lawmaker with Hungary’s opposition Democratic Coalition party and a former secretary of state in the Ministry of Defense, said that the opposition would once again seek to force a vote on Sweden’s membership before parliament’s next scheduled session in late February.
But there’s “very little chance” that Orbán’s party will support the initiative, she said, adding that Hungary’s intransigence on the issue is the prime minister’s attempt to prove his weight on the international stage.
“It has nothing to do with Sweden now, it has nothing to do with Turkey now. It’s merely Orbán’s personal attitude,” she said. “It shows that he’s driven not by political rationale, but by personal vanity. There is no gain for Hungary in this game anymore, because it’s a game that he’s playing.”
As Turkey’s parliament prepared to vote on the ratification on Monday, Orbán announced that he’d sent a letter to Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to negotiate on NATO membership.
Kristersson hasn’t commented publicly on Orbán’s letter, but Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström said that he saw “no reason” to negotiate with Hungary on the matter, noting that Budapest hasn’t presented any conditions for accepting Sweden into the alliance.
On Tuesday, Orbán tweeted that he’d had a phone call with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in which he had “reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden,” and that he would continue to urge his parliament to approve its bid.
But Dorka Takacsy, an analyst and research fellow at the Centre for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Democracy, said that Orbán’s invitation to Kristersson showed that the fate of Sweden’s NATO bid lies not in the hands of Hungarian lawmakers, but with Orbán himself.
Orbán’s letter, she said, “dismantled the narrative that there was any dispute within the parliamentary group of Fidesz ... It simply points to the fact that it is Orbán, the prime minister himself, who manages this whole issue single-handedly.”
Vadai, the opposition lawmaker, agreed.
“Anybody who believed that it’s in the hands of the governing party lawmakers was seriously mistaken,” she said. “It’s the decision of Orbán and nobody else.”
A vote on the protocols for Sweden’s NATO accession hasn’t yet appeared on the Hungarian parliament’s agenda, and barring a surprise emergency session, the matter is unlikely to go before lawmakers until at least late February.
Hungary’s delays, as well as Orbán’s friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, have frustrated other allies who want to expand the alliance and provide security guarantees to Sweden amid the war in Ukraine.
With such stakes, Vadai said that she worries Orbán’s conduct on the international stage has damaged Hungary’s relationship with its Western partners.
“He pushes Hungary to the very edge of NATO now, he’s marginalizing my country,” she said. “This is just a sin.”"
FFYKK1VHXR_JIKKFWYMII1UYS0,Key takeaways from UN court’s ruling on Israel’s war in Gaza,By JOSEF FEDERMAN,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-genocide-world-court-hague-e988bb84b9f57a5fb18c54bb78f370f5,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.N. world court on Friday came down hard on Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, calling on Israel to “take all measures” to prevent a genocide of the Palestinians. But it stopped short of demanding an immediate cease-fire, as the South African sponsors of the case had hoped.
All sides tried to claim victory with the ruling, seizing on different elements that buttressed their positions.
Israel celebrated the court’s rejection of the cease-fire request and said it had endorsed the country’s right to self-defense. Yet harsh criticism of Israel’s campaign in Gaza could further dent its image in the court of public opinion.
The Palestinians welcomed what amounted to an overwhelming rebuke of Israel’s wartime tactics by a lopsided majority of judges over the heavy death toll and humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The six measures in the ruling were approved by margins of 15-2 and 16-1, with even Israel’s representative on the court joining the majority on two of the questions.
As Israel presses ahead with its offensive, Friday’s ruling adds to the growing international criticism of Israel and could put more pressure on it to scale back or halt the operation altogether.

Here are some takeaways from Friday’s ruling:
The court did not rule on the core issue of whether Israel’s devastating military offensive against Hamas amounts to genocide. That question likely won’t be answered by the court for years.
But it did not rule out the possibility that Israel is conducting genocidal acts. In imposing “provisional measures,” the court found that concerns about possible genocide merit further review.
It called on Israel “to take all measures within its power” and “ensure with immediate effect” that its military does not commit genocidal acts, including those causing the unnecessary deaths of Palestinians or humanitarian suffering.
It also called on Israel to prevent “public incitement to commit genocide,” pointing to a series of inflammatory statements by Israeli leaders. Israel was ordered to report back to the court within one month on steps it is taking to meet these demands.
The court said it was gravely concerned about the fate of the hostages and called for their immediate and unconditional release. But the decision focused almost entirely on the plight of Gaza’s Palestinian civilians and urged Israel to do more to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid.
Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at the Israel Democracy Institute think tank, said the ruling was “not great” but could have been worse.
“The finding that South Africa’s claims are plausible is not good,” he said. “But it’s something that Israel can live with.”
Nothing in the court’s ruling requires Israel to halt the war from a legal standpoint.
Israeli leaders vowed Friday to press aheagotchd with the offensive, insisting that they already are in compliance with international law and committed to allowing humanitarian supplies into the besieged territory.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the genocide allegation as “outrageous,” noting that the ruling came on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Netanyahu pointed out that Hamas, which killed 1,200 and kidnapped 250 on Oct. 7, seeks Israel’s destruction.
Barak Medina, a human rights expert at Hebrew University’s law school, said the effects of the ruling on the battlefield are “marginal.”
He said calls to ramp up humanitarian aid and crack down on incitement might have some small effects on policies. “But in terms of the main aspect of the military operation, one would not expect any change on the ground,” he said.
While Israel moves ahead on the battlefield, Friday’s ruling shined an additional bright and critical spotlight on the Israeli offensive.
The war, launched in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, has killed over 26,000 Palestinians and led to widespread destruction, displacement and disease, according to local health officials and international aid agencies.
The United States, Israel’s closest and most important ally, has repeatedly voiced concerns about the civilian death toll and the broader international community has repeatedly called for an immediate cease-fire. The tough language adopted by the court, coupled with the requirement to report back to it, added to the global scrutiny and puts more pressure to scale back or stop the offensive.
Merav Michaeli, leader of Israel’s opposition Labor Party, called the ruling a “yellow card” against a government that she said “is causing enormous international damage to the country.”
A former head of the Israeli military’s international law department said the decision would worsen Israel’s global standing and undermine legitimacy for the war.
“It’s a huge threat,” said Pnina Sharvit Baruch, now a senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. “It eventually impacts also our national security. We need our allies. We cannot manage here on our own.”
Despite its concerns about harm to civilians, the United States has so far backed the Israeli war effort, shielding Israel from international criticism and continuing to deliver weapons to the military.
Friday’s ruling draws unwelcome attention to the U.S. position — a stance that has put it at odds with allies and threatened to hurt President Joe Biden’s standing with the Democratic Party’s progressive wing as he seeks re-election.
“States now have clear legal obligations to stop Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinian people in Gaza and to make sure that they are not complicit,” the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said.
It said the provisional ruling “should serve as a wakeup call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity.”
The ministry is part of the Palestinian Authority, the internationally recognized self-rule government in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The U.S. has said it would like to see a revitalized authority, ousted by Hamas in 2007, return to power in Gaza after the war.
Balkees Jarrah, the associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group that has accused Israel of committing war crimes in past rounds of fighting, said Friday’s “landmark decision puts Israel and its allies on notice.”
“The court’s clear and binding order raises the stakes for Israel’s allies to back up their stated commitment to a global rules-based order by helping ensure compliance with this watershed ruling,” she said.

FSYYC70Y45_CD4NLV033SH31R9,Leader of Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland says deal with Ethiopia will allow it to build a naval base,By OMAR FARUK,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/somalia-somaliland-ethiopia-coast-deal-a36449a0712249a59d74ad44d09d262c,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — The president of Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland has said his government will press ahead with an agreement signed earlier this month with landlocked Ethiopia to give it access to the sea by way of Somaliland’s coastline.
The deal has been condemned by regional and international groups, as well as Western countries, which say it interferes with Somalia’s territorial integrity and is causing tensions that could threaten stability in the Horn of Africa region.
Somalia has also protested the deal as a threat to its sovereignty by Somaliland, a region strategically located along the Gulf of Aden that broke away from Somalia in 1991 as the country collapsed into warlord-led conflict. Somaliland has not been internationally recognized.
Somaliland’s President Muse Bihi Abdi gave more details about the memorandum of understanding he signed on Jan. 1 with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in an interview with Somaliland National Television on Wednesday.
Ethiopia, Abdi said, is seeking to lease a segment of the coastline for a naval base — and not for commercial activities as previously thought. In exchange for leasing a 20 kilometer- (12.4 mile-) stretch of Somaliland’s coastline, Ethiopia would recognize Somaliland as an independent state.

Ethiopia will still be able to conduct its import and export activities through the port of Berbera, the largest in Somaliland. Berbera is not part of the coastline stretch planned for the lease.
With a population of more than 120 million, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world. It lost its access to the sea when Eritrea seceded in 1993. Since then, Ethiopia has been using the port in neighboring Djibouti for most of its imports and exports.
Somalia has protested vehemently against the agreement that would grant Ethiopia access to the strategically important Gulf of Aden and beyond that, to the Red Sea.
Somaliland’s citizens are divided over the deal, with some seeing potential economic benefits while others fear compromising their sovereignty. The breakaway region’s defense minister, Abdiqani Mohamud Ateye, resigned over the deal.
Earlier this month, a meeting of officials from the African Union, European Union and United States reaffirmed their support for Somalia’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, including the breakaway region of Somaliland.
Michael Hammer, U.S. special envoy for the Horn of Africa, said during that meeting that the U.S. is particularly concerned that tensions over the deal could undermine international-backed efforts to combat al-Qaida-linked militants in Somalia.
Matt Bryden, a strategic consultant at Sahan Research, a think tank based in Kenya, said several diverse actors in the region could unite against the agreement — including Egypt, Eritrea and even the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militants — and oppose a more powerful role of Ethiopia.
“Eritrea is likely to be deeply concerned, given its deteriorating relationship with Ethiopia and its long Red Sea coastline,” Bryden said.
Egypt, embroiled in a dispute with Ethiopia over Addis Ababa’s construction of the Grand Renaissance Dam that Cairo says could hamper its share of the Nile River water, could also oppose the project, he added."
G02O0ZEAMM_A28WXIO79J0TYNT,Lawmakers warn that Biden must seek authorization before further strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels,By FARNOUSH AMIRI,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-red-sea-congress-biden-8f83f46a45d0428b5bab78f39cd7abac,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers is raising concerns over a series of recent U.S. military strikes against Yemen Houthi rebels, urging the Biden administration to get congressional authorization before taking further military action in the Middle East.
In a letter to President Joe Biden on Friday, a coalition of nearly 30 House members expressed their strong opposition to what they described as “unauthorized” American strikes that have further escalated the biggest confrontation at sea the U.S. Navy has seen in the Middle East in a decade.
“As representatives of the American people, Congress must engage in robust debate before American servicemembers are put in harm’s way and before more U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent on yet another war in the Middle East,” the letter, led by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, stated. “No President, regardless of political party, has the constitutional authority to bypass Congress on matters of war.”
The lawmakers, who hail from the far-right and far-left of their respective parties, represent a small but growing faction in Congress that is skeptical of the nation’s increasing involvement in the Middle East in recent months.
The White House, for their part, has defended the multiple rounds of airstrikes it has taken in partnership with the United Kingdom since early January in response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.

Since the beginning of the year, Biden has written several times to Congress stating that the strikes have complied with the 1973 War Powers Act. That law, passed during the Vietnam War, serves as a constitutional check on presidential power to declare war without congressional consent. It requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action and limits the use of military forces to no more than 60 days unless Congress authorizes force or declares war.
But lawmakers, including a bipartisan group of senators, have said that decades-old statute does not give the president the “blanket authority” to take military action simply by notifying Congress within 48 hours.
The letter from Khanna and Davidson asserts that the notification only stands if the commander-in-chief “must act due to an attack or imminent attack against the United States.” They said the escalating tensions in the Middle East do not rise to that level.
“We ask that your Administration outlines for us the legal authority used to conduct these strikes, and we urge your Administration to seek authorization from Congress before conducting any more unauthorized strikes in Yemen,” the lawmakers wrote.
Biden has stated that the U.S. would continue the strikes against the Houthis, even though so far they have failed to deter the group from further harassing commercial and military vessels in the region.
When asked by reporters last week if he believes the strikes are working, Biden said, “When you say ‘working,’ are they stopping the Houthis? No.”
He added, “Are they going to continue? Yes.”"

The documentary was among 15 winners of the 2024 duPont-Columbia Awards announced at a ceremony at Columbia University in New York on Thursday. Founded in 1942, the awards highlight outstanding audio and video reporting in the public interest.
“20 Days in Mariupol” chronicles Russia’s siege of the Ukrainian port city and the international journalists who remained, including AP’s team that documented Russia’s atrocities and captured enduring images of the war.
The film has also been nominated for best documentary at the Academy Awards, marking the AP’s first Oscar nomination in the 178-year-old news organization’s history.
A co-production between the AP and PBS’ “Frontline,” it was shot during the first three weeks of the war in Ukraine in early 2022.

Mstyslav Chernov, a Ukrainian journalist and filmmaker, arrived in Mariupol one hour before Russia began bombarding the city. With him were photographer Evgeniy Maloletka and field producer Vasilisa Stepanenko.
The images and stories they captured — the death of a 4-year-old girl, freshly dug mass graves, the bombing of a maternity hospital — unflinchingly documented the grim, relentless realities of the unfolding siege.
During Thursday’s awards ceremony in New York City, ABC News took home two awards and PBS won three.
Other award-winning investigations included “Caught on Camera, Traced by Phone: The Russian Military Unit That Killed Dozens in Bucha” from The New York Times.

In Spanish-speaking nations, people usually go by two last names. In Costa Rica, if a man were named José and his father’s surname were Suárez and his mother’s Ortiz, by law he would have been registered as José Suárez Ortiz. The court’s decision maintains the requirement to use both names, but allows citizens to choose the order, giving them the freedom to put the mother’s first, as in Ortiz Suárez.
On the street in the Costa Rican capital, San Jose, 48-year-old messenger Carlos Barquero said it may be difficult to get over the custom of putting the father’s name first.
“But the truth is, it’s right to recognize the mothers and women in our society as well,” Barquero said. “I don’t see any problem with people choosing the order.”
The court modified a section of civil code mandating the order of the names, following a request for clarification from the country’s elections board after a resident came to the board asking to change the order of their name.

The code was based on “customary practices based on patriarchal and archaic concepts of family, which discriminates against women and today is incompatible with the law of the Constitution,” the court said in a news release.
“Surnames form an inseparable part of the personality of human beings and their order is inherent to the fundamental rights to name and identity,” the justices added.
Also in San Jose, librarian Mayra Jiménez, 42, welcomed the ruling.
“I feel that this is a right and an opportunity for people who want, for one reason or another, to change the order of their last names, so that they can be comfortable with their identity,” Jiménez told The Associated Press.
Larissa Arroyo, a lawyer and human rights activist, said in a telephone interview that the ruling opens the door for many Costa Ricans who for various reasons might want to use the mother’s surname first for themselves or their children.
Arroyo noted the ruling eliminates confusion when a child is born to a same-sex couple, in deciding who is the mother or father.
But it also eliminates a wider social pressure to carry on the last name of a family.
“This is related to the patriarchal issue of maintaining the family name, people spoke of ‘the name disappearing,’” Arroyo said, referring to relatives who favor traditional name order — or who may want to pressure people into having children.
“This is because there is a huge pressure on someone, that goes beyond them as an individual,” Arroyo said.
This decision came after another bill passed the Human Rights Commission in Costa Rica’s congress last year which also proposed citizens be able to choose the order in which their names are placed."

The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists made the annual announcement Tuesday rating how close humanity is from ending. It cited nuclear threat in Russia’s war on Ukraine as well as the Oct. 7 attack in Israel and war in Gaza, worsening climate-related disasters and the danger of generative artificial intelligence.
“Last year, we expressed amplified concern by moving the clock to 90 seconds to midnight, the closest to global catastrophe it has ever been,” said Rachel Bronson, CEO of the Bulletin group. “The risks from last year continue with unabated veracity and continue to shape this year.”
Starting in 1947, the advocacy group used a clock to symbolize the potential and even likelihood of people doing something to end humanity. After the end of the Cold War, it was as close as 17 minutes to midnight. In the past few years, to address rapid global changes, the group has changed from counting down the minutes until midnight to counting down the seconds.
The group said the clock could be turned back if leaders and nations worked together, and specifically noted powerful countries that have the capacity to do so, including the United States, China and Russia."
GJXHVQ2CRF_FDSFYB77QHYKX4N,South Dakota Senate OKs measure for work requirement to voter-passed Medicaid expansion,By JACK DURA,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-legislature-medicaid-44c5165dbb9f648e1e7627e90d099e4c,"Many low-income people in South Dakota would need to have a job in order to get Medicaid health care coverage, under a requirement that passed the Republican-led state Senate on Thursday.
The resolution next heads to the GOP-led House, after passing the Senate in a 28-4 vote.
South Dakota Republican lawmakers want to add the work requirement for people who are not physically or mentally disabled, and who are eligible for an expansion of the government-sponsored program that voters approved in 2022. The change, which took effect last summer, greatly increased the number of people who qualify for Medicaid.
The work requirement would still need to be approved by voters in November, and the federal government would then have to sign off on it.
The 2022 constitutional amendment expanded Medicaid eligibility to people who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which the state Department of Social Services says is up to $41,400 for a family of four.

The expansion was previously opposed by both Republican Gov. Kristi Noem and the GOP-controlled Legislature, which defeated a proposed Medicaid expansion earlier in 2022.
“Really, it’s a fundamental question,” Republican Senate Majority Leader Casey Crabtree, a prime sponsor of the work requirement, told reporters. “Do we want to incentivize those who can, or are able-bodied, those who can work, to do so? Or do we want to leave a gap where government dependency can become a way of life?”
He asserted that work requirements on other state programs have been successful.
Opponents lamented the work requirement as unnecessary, ineffective at encouraging work and going against the will of the voters — as well as creating more paperwork.
“This is about government bureaucracy,” Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba said. “This is about denying health care to people who otherwise qualify for it.”
Republican Sen. John Wiik bemoaned the 2022 measure as “a petition mostly from out-of-state money to put a federal program into our constitution.”
“Our hands are effectively tied. We need to go back to the voters every time we want to make a change to this program,” he said. “And this is the point we need to learn: Direct democracy doesn’t work.”
Republican Rep. Tony Venhuizen, another prime sponsor, said the resolution is a “clarifying question” that wouldn’t reverse the 2022 vote.
“If this amendment was approved, and if the federal government allowed a work requirement, and if we decided we wanted to implement a work requirement, two or three steps down the line from now, we would have to talk about what exemptions are available,” Venhuizen told a Senate panel on Wednesday.
The expanded eligibility took effect July 1, 2023. Roughly 18,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, according to state Secretary of Social Services Matt Althoff. Of those, 12,000 are already receiving food assistance, thus meeting a work requirement.
More people are expected to enroll in Medicaid expansion, something the Legislature’s budget writers are trying to estimate, Venhuizen said. The 2022 measure was estimated to expand eligibility to 42,500 people."

Truckers for years have been able to cross the border without documents, so they generally do not have them. But Pakistan began mandating truck drivers get visas last week.
The two sides after a series of meetings agreed to reopen the Torkham border crossing but Pakistan set a new deadline of March 31 for the truck drivers to get visas, said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, a director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Abdul Basir Zabali, the Taliban-appointed spokesman for the police chief in Nangarhar province, said the Torkham crossing was reopened after the two sides talked, but he didn’t give details.
The Torkham border crossing has been closed a number of times in recent months, mainly following clashes between the security forces for varied reasons including repairs of the border fence by Pakistan."
H63WAI5AS1_3BKR22RCFCVBH8C,Florida House passes a bill to ban social media accounts for children under 16,By BRENDAN FARRINGTON,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/social-media-florida-government-f06dcfcbb8ff75ac3d3b0324cd16a7e7,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida children under the age of 16 would be banned from popular social media platforms regardless of parent approval under a bill passed by the House on Wednesday, a measure that is the top priority for the chamber’s speaker.
The bill doesn’t list which platforms would be affected, but it targets any social media site that tracks user activity, allows children to upload material and interact with others and uses addictive features designed to cause excessive or compulsive use. The bill would not affect apps used for private messages between individuals.
“They’re taking advantage of kids growing up. That’s their business model. And why do they do it? To keep them hooked ... with the dopamine hits that the platform gives our children with every autoplay, with every like, with every push notification,” said bill sponsor Republican Rep. Tyler Sirois.
The House voted 106-13 for the bill, with several Democrats joining Republicans in support. Proponents argued that social media exposes children to bullying and sexual predators and can lead to depression, suicide and an addictive obsession.
Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner said she posted her position on the bill on X on Tuesday, and she referred to her deceased mother. On the House floor Wednesday, she read some of the hateful comments she received from the platform’s users, including people who posted, “Your mother sucks” and “Your mom was stupid.”

“I’m 42-years old ... and comments like these were a gut punch to me, but I was able to navigate,” she said. “Imagine what our babies have to deal with when they have their friends in school doing the same cyberbullying to them.”
Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms, urged the House to seek another solution, such as requiring parental approval to download apps. It also wants the issue addressed on a federal level rather than a patchwork of different state laws.
“Many teens today leverage the internet and apps to responsibly gather information and learn about new opportunities, including part-time jobs, higher education, civic or church gatherings, and military service,” Meta representative Caulder Harvill-Childs wrote to the House Judiciary Committee. “By banning teens under 16, Florida risks putting its young people at a disadvantage versus teens elsewhere.”
Other states have considered similar legislation, but most have not proposed a total ban. In Arkansas, a federal judge blocked enforcement of a law in August that required parental consent for minors to create new social media accounts.
But Republican House Speaker Paul Renner, who has made the issue his top priority, said the Florida bill should withstand constitutional scrutiny because it targets the addictive features of social media, and not the content.
“It’s a situation where kids can’t stay off the platforms, and as a result of that, they have been trapped in an environment that harms their mental health,” Renner told reporters after the vote.
The Florida bill would require social media companies to close any accounts it believes to be used by minors and to cancel accounts at the request of a minor or parents. Any information pertaining to the account must be deleted.
Opponents argued that the bill would violate the First Amendment and take away benefits some children get from social media. And they said parents should make the decisions on which sites their children can visit.
Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani said social media was an outlet and comfort where she could find support after her mother died when she was 13.
“I think the intention of those who have filed (the bill) is absolutely golden. We have a concern about the impact of social media on our young people,” she said. “I just find the solution that you propose too broad and casts a wide a net with unintended consequences.”"

In October 2022, client data from Medibank, Australia’s largest health insurer, was released by an extortionist, including details of HIV diagnoses and drug abuse treatments, after the company refused to pay a ransom for the personal records of current and former customers.
On Tuesday, the U.S. and the U.K. imposed sanctions and the Australian government imposed its cyber sanction powers for the first time against Aleksandr Ermakov after Australian Federal Police and intelligence agencies, with support from undisclosed global partners, made the link between the Russian citizen and the cyber attack. Ermakov did not immediately respond to an online request from The Associated Press seeking comment.
Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said the sanctions imposed are part of Australia’s efforts to expose cyber criminals and debilitate groups engaging in cyber attacks.
“In our current strategic circumstances we continue to see governments, critical infrastructure, businesses and households in Australia targeted by malicious cyber actors,” Marles said in a statement on Tuesday.

“We continue to work with our friends and partners around the world to ensure cyber criminals are held to account for their actions and we will relentlessly pursue activities which disrupt their capability to target Australians in the cyber space.”
The sanctions make it a criminal offense, punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment, to provide assets to Ermakov or to use or deal with his assets, including through cryptocurrency wallets or ransomware payments.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said the sanctions send a clear message to cyber criminals. “There are costs and consequences for targeting Australia and targeting Australians,” she said in a statement.
U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson said in a statement that “Russian cyber actors continue to wage disruptive ransomware attacks against the United States and allied countries, targeting our businesses, including critical infrastructure, to steal sensitive data.”
He said Tuesday’s action “underscores our collective resolve to hold these criminals to account.”

(AP) — Pennsylvania’s Republican Party on Monday endorsed York County’s district attorney, Dave Sunday, for state attorney general out of a three-person field.
The party’s endorsement came the day before candidates could begin collecting the required number of voter signatures to get on Pennsylvania’s primary ballot. State committee members met via video link to vote on Monday evening.
Sunday won the endorsement over state Rep. Craig Williams and Katayoun Copeland, both former federal prosecutors who hail from Delaware County in southeastern Pennsylvania. Copeland has said she would not run against the party’s endorsed candidate and ended her candidacy, a campaign aide said Monday.
Pennsylvania’s office of attorney general played a critical role in court defending Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the presidential battleground against repeated attempts to overturn it in state and federal courts by Donald Trump’s campaign and Republican allies.
Democrats are facing a five-way primary for an office that will be open after next year.

The Democrats running are Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer, state Rep. Jared Solomon of Philadelphia, former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, former federal prosecutor Joe Kahn and Keir Bradford-Grey, the former head of Philadelphia’s and Montgomery County’s public defense lawyers.
The attorney general’s office has a budget of about $140 million annually and plays a prominent role in arresting drug traffickers, fighting gun trafficking, defending state laws in court and protecting consumers from predatory practices.
No Republican has been elected attorney general since 2008. Candidates must file paperwork by Feb. 13 to appear on the April 23 primary ballot.
The current officeholder, Michelle Henry, is filling the last two years of Gov. Josh Shapiro ’s second term as attorney general and doesn’t plan to run for the office. Shapiro nominated Henry, his top deputy, in January when he was sworn in as governor.

I2S00QW92W_AOO61GGSPK4EZHG,Lawyer for indicted founder of Haitian orphanage says a previous grand jury didn’t charge him,By COLLEEN SLEVIN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-orphanage-founder-abuse-arrest-22df9255003a1244e3c6b9decb0defea,"DENVER (AP) — An American founder of a Haitian orphanage who has been charged with sexual abuse was investigated by a grand jury about a decade ago but not indicted, according to a court document filed by his attorney on Thursday.
The revelation was included in a filing requesting that Michael Geilenfeld be released from custody while the current case proceeds. The detention hearing was delayed until Friday.
Geilenfeld, 71, was indicted on Jan. 18 by a grand jury in Florida and accused of traveling from Miami to Haiti “for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person under 18. He was arrested in Colorado on Saturday.
The behavior took place between November 2006 and December 2010, according to the indictment, a time period when Geilenfeld was operating the St. Joseph’s Home for Boys orphanage. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
Geilenfeld has not yet entered a plea and his attorney, Robert Oberkoetter, has declined to comment on the charges. But in the petition seeking Geilenfeld’s release, Oberkoetter wrote that a federal grand jury in Charlotte, North Carolina, had already investigated his client in 2012. The jury subpoenaed Geilenfeld’s travel documents, including those involving the time period at issue in the new case, and interviewed witnesses about allegations of pedophilia and child abuse, but did not indict him, Oberkoetter said.

Oberkoetter accused prosecutors of “forum shopping,” a practice in which lawyers try to have cases tried in a jurisdiction where they think they will be more successful. He said the government violated its own rules by not seeking permission to pursue the same case with another grand jury. Oberkoetter also asked that Geilenfeld be tried in Colorado, not Florida, where the charges were filed, but did not say why.
Justice Department spokesperson Scottie Howell declined to comment.
Lawyers had been set to argue in court on Thursday about whether Geilenfeld should be released from a suburban Denver prison where he is currently being held. But the debate was delayed until Friday after Geilenfeld said he has not yet been able to speak with Oberkoetter, who works in Massachusetts. U.S. Marshals agreed to take him to their holding cells in the courthouse after the hearing so he could talk to his lawyer privately by phone.
Defendants in unrelated cases often sit together in a jury box until they are called, but Geilenfeld was kept in a room away from others until his case was up for review. Dressed in a khaki prison uniform and with his wrists and ankles shackled, he told the judge he is being held in isolation and only allowed out of his cell for two hours each morning.
Authorities in Haiti have long investigated sex abuse allegations against Geilenfeld and arrested him in September 2014 based on allegations made against him by a child advocate in Maine, Paul Kendrick. Kendrick accused Geilenfeld of being a serial pedophile after speaking to young men who claimed they were abused by Geilenfeld when they were boys in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital where he founded the orphanage in 1985.
Geilenfeld called the claims “vicious, vile lies,” and his case was dismissed in 2015 after he spent 237 days in prison in Haiti. At some point, Geilenfeld and a charity associated with the orphanage, Hearts for Haiti, sued Kendrick in federal court in Maine. The suit blamed Kendrick for Geilenfeld’s imprisonment, damage to his reputation and the loss of millions of dollars in donations.
Kendrick’s insurance companies ended the lawsuit in 2019 by paying $3 million to Hearts with Haiti, but nothing to Geilenfeld."
I4AWKD2DPP_BN40N14XCP12QT1,What the Tuvalu election means for China-Pacific relations,By KEIRAN SMITH,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/tuvalu-election-china-taiwan-pacific-islands-6c277f437138f0316674b1fe91d78a45,"SYDNEY (AP) — It’s a tiny Pacific island nation, one of the world’s smallest. But on Friday, elections in Tuvalu will be watched from Beijing and Taipei to Canberra, as voters choose a 16-seat parliament and, after negotiations, a prime minister.
A big part of the international attention is linked to the increasing importance of China in the region, and Tuvalu’s diplomatic ties to the government of Taiwan. A proposed security treaty with Australia could also hang in the balance.
Here’s what’s at stake:

Tuvalu consists of nine coral atolls in the South Pacific Ocean. It’s about halfway between Hawaii and Australia.
Tuvalu’s low-lying atolls make it particularly vulnerable to global warming, and there are worries that rising sea levels and strengthening storms will make it uninhabitable. Prime Minister Kausea Natano is trying to raise the islands 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) above sea level through land reclamation.
It has a population of about 11,500, making it one of the smallest nations in the world.
A former British colony, it gained independence in 1978. The British monarch is still the country’s head of state.
All candidates in Tuvalu run as independents, with the top two vote-getters in each of the eight island electorates going to parliament.
Polls open at 8.30am (2030 GMT) on Friday and close at 4 p.m. (0400 GMT) on Friday, The Guardian newspaper reported.
When the votes are in, the new parliamentarians split into groups, with the biggest electing the prime minister and forming a new government.
The current prime minister, Kausea Natano, is running for parliament again, but he would have to go through the selection process again even if he wins his parliament race.
Finance Minister Seve Paeniu is also interested in the job after winning his parliament seat by running unopposed.
Another potential new leader is the opposition leader, and former prime minister, Enele Sopoaga.
Only 12 countries, including Tuvalu, have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own territory. Nauru, also in the Pacific, recently switched its support from Taiwan to China.
This puts Tuvalu at the center of intense jockeying between Taipei and Beijing.
Prime Minister Natano favors strong ties with Taiwan, and is likely to continue that support. Sopoaga also favors close ties with Taiwan. Paeniu has said he wants to review Tuvalu’s ties with both Beijing and Taipei, according to The Guardian.
Sopoaga has also said he doesn’t support a new treaty between Tuvalu and Australia signed in November. That treaty, which commits Australia to assist Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, health pandemics and military aggression, has yet to be ratified amid an intense debate. The treaty gives Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country, including China."
IBM5SD26BR_7NAIYUDP26M1AX8,"Biden delays consideration of new natural gas export terminals, citing climate risk",By MATTHEW DALY,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is delaying consideration of new natural gas export terminals in the United States, even as gas shipments to Europe and Asia have soared since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The election year decision by President Joe Biden aligns with environmentalists who fear the huge increase in exports, in the form of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is locking in potentially catastrophic planet-warming emissions when the Democratic president has pledged to cut climate pollution in half by 2030.
“While MAGA Republicans willfully deny the urgency of the climate crisis, condemning the American people to a dangerous future, my administration will not be complacent,’' Biden said in a statement Friday. “We will not cede to special interests. We will heed the calls of young people and frontline communities who are using their voices to demand action from those with the power to act.’'
The current economic and environmental analyses the Energy Department uses to evaluate LNG projects don’t adequately account for potential cost hikes for American consumers and manufacturers or the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, the White House said.
Industry groups condemned the pause as a “win for Russia,” while environmentalists cheered an action they have long been seeking as a way to counter Biden’s approval of the huge Willow oil project in Alaska last year.

“This decision is brave, because Donald Trump (the man who pulled us out of the Paris climate accords on the grounds that climate change is a hoax) will attack it mercilessly,’' environmental activist Bill McKibben wrote in an online post.
“But it’s also very, very savvy: Biden wants young people, who care about climate above all, in his corner. They were angry about his dumb approval of the Willow oil project,’' McKibben added.
A proposed LNG export terminal in Louisiana would produce about 20 times the greenhouse gas emissions of Willow, McKibben noted.
“And of course everyone understands that if Biden is not reelected this win means nothing. It will disappear on Day One when (Trump) begins his relentless campaign to ‘drill drill drill,’” he said.
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the pause will not affect already authorized export projects and noted that U.S. gas exports reached record highs last year. The pause will not immediately affect U.S. supplies to Europe or Asia, Granholm said, since seven LNG terminals are currently in operation, with several more expected to come online in the next few years.
“We remain committed to ensuring our partners’ medium-term energy needs are met,’' she told reporters at a White House briefing late Thursday. If necessary, the Energy Department can allow exceptions for national security needs, Granholm said.
She and other officials declined to say how long the permitting pause will last, but said a study of how proposed LNG projects will affect the environment, the economy and national security will take “some months.’' A public comment period after that will likely delay any decisions on pending LNG projects until after the 2024 presidential election.
U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas began less than a decade ago, but have grown rapidly in recent years to the point that the U.S. has become the world’s largest gas exporter. Exports rose sharply after Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and Biden and Granholm have celebrated the delivery of U.S. gas to Europe and Asia as a key geopolitical weapon against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The American Petroleum Institute, the largest lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, turned those comments against the Democratic administration as it condemned Biden’s action.
“This is a win for Russia and a loss for American allies, U.S. jobs and global climate progress,” said Mike Sommers, API’s president and CEO.
“There is no review needed to understand the clear benefits of U.S. LNG (exports) for stabilizing global energy markets, supporting thousands of American jobs and reducing emissions around the world by transitioning countries toward cleaner fuels’’ and away from coal, Sommers said in a statement.
Biden’s action “is nothing more than a broken promise to U.S. allies, and it’s time for the administration to stop playing politics with global energy security,” he said.
Granholm, who has made it a point to work with oil and gas executives even as Biden has exchanged sometimes pointed barbs with them, said “a lot has happened” since LNG exports began about eight years ago.
“We need to have an even greater understanding of the (global energy) market need, the long-term supply and demand of energy resources and the environmental factors,’' she said. “So by updating the analysis process now, we will be better informed to avoid export authorizations that diminish our domestic energy availability, that weaken our security or that undermine our economy. ‘’
Granholm emphasized the delay “is not a retroactive review of already authorized exports,’' nor is it intended to punish the oil and gas industry.
“We are committed to strengthening energy security here in the U.S. and with our allies, and we’re committed to protecting Americans against climate change as we lead the world into a clean energy future,’' she said.
Jeremy Symons, an environmental consultant and former climate policy adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency, called Biden’s decision a “game-changer” in the fight against climate change.
“The president is drawing a line in the sand to put the nation’s interests first and listen to climate science,’' Symons said in an interview. ”The days of massive fossil fuel projects like the CP2 project escaping scrutiny from the federal government are over. We now have a president who cares about climate change.’'
Symons and other activists have targeted the $10 billion Calcasieu Pass 2 project, or CP2, along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, noting it would be the nation’s largest export terminal if built. The project in Cameron Parish would export up to 20 million tons (18.1 million metric tons) of chilled natural gas per year, creating more greenhouse gas emissions than even the Willow project, which environmentalists have decried as a “carbon bomb.’'
Symons called the gas project “bad for our nation, bad for our health and bad for our economy.’'
Shaylyn Hynes, spokeswoman for the project’s owner, Virginia-based Venture Global, said the Biden administration “continues to create uncertainty about whether our allies can rely on U.S. LNG for their energy security.’'
A prolonged pause on LNG exports “would shock the global energy market ... and send a devastating signal to our allies that they can no longer rely on the United States,’' said Hynes, who served as an Energy Department spokeswoman in the Trump administration.
“The true irony is this policy would hurt the climate and lead to increased (greenhouse gas) emissions, as it would force the world to pivot to coal’’ instead of natural gas, Hynes said.
Climate activists dispute that, calling LNG a leading contributor to climate change due to methane leaks and an energy-intensive process to liquefy gas."
IC89BIIVTX_UQHKMK1KL0FJ6KF,"Donald Trump must pay an additional $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll in defamation case, jury says","By LARRY NEUMEISTER, JAKE OFFENHARTZ and JENNIFER PELTZ",_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/trump-carroll-defamation-trial-e4ea8b93cdeb29857864ffd8d14be888,"NEW YORK (AP) — A jury awarded $83.3 million to E. Jean Carroll on Friday in a stinging and expensive rebuke to former President Donald Trump for his continued social media attacks against the longtime advice columnist over her claims that he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store.
The award, coupled with a $5 million sexual assault and defamation verdict last year from another jury in a case brought by Carroll, raised to $88.3 million what Trump must pay her. Protesting vigorously, he said he would appeal.
Carroll, 80, clutched her lawyers’ hands and smiled as the seven-man, two-woman anonymous jury delivered its verdict. Minutes later, she shared a weepy three-way hug with her attorneys.
She declined comment as she left the Manhattan federal courthouse, but issued a statement later through a publicist, saying, “This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she’s been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down.”

Trump had attended the trial earlier in the day, but stormed out of the courtroom during closing arguments by Carroll’s attorney. He returned for his own attorney’s closing argument and for a portion of the deliberations, but left the courthouse a half hour before the verdict was read.

“Absolutely ridiculous!” he said in a statement shortly afterward. “Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon.”
His attorney, Alina Habba, said the verdict resulted because Trump’s opponents were suing “in states where they know they will get juries like this.”
“It will not deter us. We will keep fighting. And, I assure you, we didn’t win today, but we will win,” she said.
The trial reached its conclusion as Trump marches toward winning the Republican presidential nomination a third consecutive time. He has sought to turn his various trials and legal vulnerabilities into an advantage, portraying them as evidence of a weaponized political system.
Donald Trump is facing four criminal indictments, and a civil lawsuit. You can track all of the cases here.
Though there’s no evidence that President Joe Biden or anyone in the White House has influenced any of the legal cases against him, Trump’s line of argument has resonated with his most loyal supporters, who view the proceedings with skepticism.
Nikki Haley, his last major rival in the Republican primaries, said on social media Friday that the verdict meant that people were “talking about $83 million in damages” rather than fixing the border or inflation.
With the Carroll civil case behind him, Trump still faces 91 criminal charges in four indictments accusing him of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, mishandling classified documents and arranging payoffs to a porn star.
It was the second time in nine months that a civil jury returned a verdict related to Carroll’s claim that a flirtatious, chance encounter with Trump in 1996 at Bergdorf Goodman’s Fifth Avenue store ended violently. She said Trump slammed her against a dressing room wall, pulled down her tights and forced himself on her.
In May, a different jury awarded Carroll $5 million. It found Trump not liable for rape, but responsible for sexually abusing Carroll and then defaming her by claiming she made it up. He is appealing that award, too.
Trump is also awaiting a verdict in a New York civil fraud trial, where state lawyers are seeking the return of $370 million in what they say were ill-gotten gains from loans and deals made using financial statements that exaggerated his wealth.
As for Trump’s ability to pay, he reported having about $294 million in cash or cash equivalents on his most recent annual financial statement, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. Testifying at his civil fraud trial last November, Trump boasted, “I have very little debt, and I have a lot of cash.”
Trump skipped the first Carroll trial. He later expressed regret for not attending and insisted on testifying in the second trial, though the judge limited what he could say, ruling he had missed his chance to argue that he didn’t attack Carroll. He spent only a few minutes on the witness stand Thursday, during which he denied assaulting Carroll, then left court grumbling “this is not America.”
This new jury was only asked how much Trump, 77, should pay Carroll for two statements he made as president when he answered reporters’ questions after excerpts of Carroll’s memoir were published in a magazine — damages that couldn’t be decided earlier because of legal appeals. Jurors were not asked to re-decide the issue of whether the sex attack actually happened.
In her closing argument Friday, Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan requested $24 million in compensatory damages and “an unusually high punitive award.” The jury awarded $18.3 million in compensatory damages and another $65 million in punitive damages — meant to deter future behavior.
Kaplan urged jurors to punish Trump enough that he would stop a steady stream of public statements smearing Carroll as a liar and a “whack job.”
She noted that Trump had boasted of at least $14 billion in assets and that his brand alone is worth $10 billion.
“Donald Trump is prepared to use his wealth and power to defame people whenever he wants,” she said. “He ignored the last verdict as if it had never happened.”
Kaplan said he didn’t show up at last year’s trial when a jury determined he had sexually assaulted and defamed Carroll, but “he made sure” to attend most of this year’s trial because it focused solely on damages.
“While Donald Trump may not care about the law, while he certainly doesn’t care about the truth, he does care about money,” the lawyer said.
Big punitive damages, she told jurors, was the only way “to give Ms. Carroll a chance at a normal life again where she is not regularly bullied and humiliated by one of the most powerful men on the planet.”
Trump shook his head vigorously as Kaplan spoke early in her summation, then suddenly stood and walked out, taking Secret Service agents with him. His exit came only minutes after the judge, without the jury present, threatened to send his attorney to jail for continuing to talk when he told her she was finished.
“You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,” the judge told Habba, who immediately complied.
Carroll testified early in the trial that Trump’s public statements had led to death threats.
“He shattered my reputation,” she said. “I am here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me.”
She said she’d had an electronic fence installed around the cabin in upstate New York where she lives, warned neighbors of the threats and bought bullets for a gun she keeps by her bed.
“Previously, I was known simply as a journalist and had a column, and now I’m known as the liar, the fraud, and the whack job,” Carroll testified.
Trump’s lawyer, Habba, told jurors that Carroll had been enriched by her accusations against Trump and achieved fame she had craved. She said no damages were warranted after Trump’s lawyers had established that Carroll didn’t suffer emotionally from Trump’s statements and “she certainly hasn’t suffered professionally.”
To support Carroll’s request for millions in damages, Northwestern University sociologist Ashlee Humphreys had testified that Trump’s 2019 statements had caused between $7.2 million and $12.1 million in harm to Carroll’s reputation.
When Trump finally testified, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan gave him little room to maneuver after saying Trump was not permitted to revive issues settled in the first trial.
“It is a very well-established legal principle in this country that prevents do-overs by disappointed litigants,” said Kaplan, who is unrelated to Roberta Kaplan.
“He lost it and he is bound. And the jury will be instructed that, regardless of what he says in court here today, he did it, as far as they’re concerned. That is the law,” Kaplan said shortly before Trump testified.
After he swore to tell the truth, Trump was asked if he stood by a deposition in which he called Carroll a “liar” and a “whack job.” He answered: “100 percent. Yes.”
Asked if he denied the allegation because Carroll made an accusation, he responded: “That’s exactly right. She said something, I consider it a false accusation.” Asked if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Carroll, he said: “No. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency.”
The judge ordered the jury to disregard the “false accusation” comment and everything Trump said after “No” to the last question.
Earlier in the trial, Trump tested the judge’s tolerance. When he complained to his lawyers about a “witch hunt” and a “con job” within earshot of jurors, Kaplan threatened to eject him from the courtroom if it happened again. “I would love it,” Trump said. Later that day, Trump told a news conference Kaplan was a “nasty judge.”

IJDXPHBPY4_XI7LG320TWHG2WZ,China confirms the 2022 conviction of a British businessperson on espionage charges,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-ian-stones-national-security-espionage-d1699d20ed7aeb1600a78f425466d667,"BEIJING (AP) — Beijing confirmed Friday that a longtime British businessperson in China was sentenced to five years in prison in 2022 on an espionage charge.
Ian J. Stones was convicted of being bought off to provide intelligence to “external forces,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked about the case at a daily briefing. He did not provide any specific details about the charges.
Both the United Kingdom and United States governments have warned about the risk of detention under China’s national security laws. A Japanese pharmaceutical company employee was detained last year on suspicion of spying. A new version of the law that took effect July 1, 2023, has heightened concerns about operating in China.
Stones’ case was not publicly known until reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. The American business newspaper said that Stones is about 70 years old and has worked in China for about 40 years. His employers included General Motors and Pfizer before he set up up a consulting firm, Navisino Partners, about 15 years ago, the Journal said.
Foreign business organizations and governments called for greater clarity last year on what foreign firms are allowed to do under what is now known as the anti-espionage law. Of particular concern are tighter restrictions on the transfer of data to other parties, and what data is considered related to national security under the law.

Raids on the offices of three foreign companies, two consultancies and one due diligence firm, have further unnerved the business community.
The British government warns about the risk of arbitrary detention in China and the broad scope of the national security law. “You may be detained without having intended to break the law,” it says in its foreign travel advice for the country.
The U.S. travel advisory says that Chinese authorities “appear to have broad discretion to deem a wide range of documents, data, statistics, or materials as state secrets and to detain and prosecute foreign nationals for alleged espionage.”
It says that foreigners who have been detained for alleged national security law violations include businesspeople, former government officials, academics, journalists and relatives of Chinese involved in legal disputes.
Stones appealed his conviction, but a court upheld the original ruling in September, Wang said.
He said that the case was handled “in accordance with the law, ensuring the legitimate rights and interests of both Chinese and foreign parties involved.”
The British Foreign Office declined to comment on the case."
ILSLEBRO6G_LIUNUVUYN0W1062,EU officials urge Bosnia to press ahead with reform in order to start accession negotiations,_,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/bosnia-eu-accession-talks-croatia-netherlands-69ef8101075fc8929a55875b8c8d08df,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — The European Commission chief and the prime ministers of the Netherlands and Croatia told Bosnia on Tuesday to press on with reforms and seize a chance to begin accession negotiations with the European Union before the 27-nation block holds a parliamentary vote in June.
The three officials said at a news conference in Sarajevo that while Bosnia has made progress in achieving the criteria to formally start the talks, the troubled Balkan nation must do more to win a positive recommendation in March from the European Commission.
“We have seen some progress, we have seen a real commitment to the accession goal with important laws adopted,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. “And the more you deliver, the more convincing you are and the better it is, the more you help me to produce a report that reflects this movement forward.”
Bosnia was granted candidate status in 2022 and the European Council said last year that the accession negotiations can start once the necessary degree of compliance is achieved. There will be “no shortcuts” for Bosnia, said Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte.
“EU accession has to be and always will be a merit-based process,” Rutte said. “Unfortunately, at the moment ... we have to see what happens in the next six weeks.”

Bosnia is among the six Western Balkan nations that have been seeking EU entry following a period of wars and crisis in the 1990s. The process was stalled for years but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has rekindled the prospects. EU officials are now offering a 6 billion euro ($6.4 billion) package for Western Balkan countries to encourage reform.
“It’s a huge opportunity to increase the prosperity of this country,” von der Leyen said. Bosnia, she said, could expect 1 billion euros in funds from the package when it carries out necessary economic reforms.
Reform laws that Bosnia still needs to pass to begin the accession talks relate to fighting corruption and money laundering, judicial reform and the rule of law. Bosnian Prime Minister Bojana Kristo promised “we will remain focused and work hard” to achieve the goals.
Bosnia is still ethnically divided and politically unstable long after the 1992-95 war that left more than 100,000 people dead and displaced millions. Pro-Russian Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has repeatedly threatened secession of the Serb-run half of the country from the rest of Bosnia.
Western officials fear that Russia could try to stir instability in Bosnia and the rest of the Balkans to divert attention from its attacks on Ukraine. They have said that stepping up the bloc’s engagement with Western Balkans nations is more crucial than ever to maintaining European security.
Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic urged Bosnia to grasp what he said were “tectonic” changes in EU policies because of Ukraine. He warned that “if we miss March, the whole year will be lost” because of the expected vote for the European Parliament on June 6-9.
“My message, my appeal to all our friends and partners, is to use this opportunity, this window that has been opened,” he said."
IOOHB73GC4_9UFM4KNHFG9VMX8,The trial of a Honolulu businessman is providing a possible glimpse of Hawaii’s underworld,By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/organized-crime-trial-hawaii-murder-8fcb3f725ccb58fbdc5a4e5f6250aa74,"HONOLULU (AP) — A U.S. prosecutor revealed a possible glimpse into Hawaii’s underworld on Monday as he outlined the crimes a Honolulu businessman is accused of orchestrating: the kidnapping of a 72-year-old accountant who owed a debt, the release of a toxic chemical into a rival’s nightclubs and the killing of his late son’s best friend, among them.
Michael Miske Jr. was arrested in 2020, along with seven people whom prosecutors described as associates. But following a series of guilty pleas by the others — including a plea deal signed by his half-brother on Saturday — the trial opened with Miske as the lone defendant.
“The defendant used fear, violence and intimidation to get what he wanted,” Assistant U.S. Attorney William Akina said in his opening statement. “What he wanted was money, control and revenge.”
Miske’s attorney, Michael Kennedy, painted a completely different picture of his client.
Miske, 49, wasn’t a crime lord, but rather a “self-made man” who, despite growing up “on the wrong side of the tracks,” successfully built a family business called Kamaʻaina Termite and Pest Control, Kennedy said in his opening statement.

The company saved iconic Hawaii structures and “cultural treasures,” including outdoor theater Waikiki Shell, ʻIolani Palace and the Polynesian Cultural Center, Kennedy said. Miske even fumigated a Honolulu concert hall for free after the city couldn’t afford the $200,000 estimate, Kennedy said.
Akina alleged that Miske also owned several nightclubs where disputes over bar tabs would be met with physical assault from his “thugs.” In addition, he made millions selling illegal commercial-grade aerial fireworks on the black market, Akina said.
The businessman also groomed people from his Waimanalo neighborhood to violently rob drug dealers and carry out other orders, the prosecutor said.
Akina said Miske ordered hits on people, and though many were never carried out, at least one was: the 2016 killing of Johnathan Fraser, best friend to Miske’s only son, Caleb. Miske had long thought Fraser was a bad influence on Caleb, and blamed Fraser when the friends got into a car crash in 2015 that led to Caleb’s death, Akina said.
“There could be only one price to pay for the death of the defendant’s son,” Akina said. “A life for a life.”
An indictment alleges that Miske purchased a boat to dump Fraser’s body into the ocean, though the body has never been found.
Kennedy told jurors on Monday that Miske didn’t blame Fraser for the crash and had nothing to do with his disappearance.
The people who will be testifying against Miske have something to gain from authorities, Kennedy said, referring to plea deals made by his alleged associates.
“Lies are going to rain down into this courtroom from that stand,” he said.
Testimony is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
Opening statements proceeded despite a motion filed Sunday night by Miske’s defense team. His attorneys argued that a new jury should be selected because Miske’s half-brother John Stancil pleaded guilty after a jury had been assembled and sworn and Miske’s daughter-in-law Delia Fabro Miske pleaded guilty after four days of jury selection.
Defense attorney Lynn Panagakos noted that Stancil pleaded guilty early Monday before the courthouse was even open to the public.
U.S. District Chief Judge Derrick Watson denied the motion."
JCO9MSOGG4_ZHCL1KKZXEBAOSN,FEMA devotes more resources to outstanding claims filed by New Mexico wildfire victims,By SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-fema-wildfire-claims-delays-7aa43db9909a4f9709c0081e55c2cb8e,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday that it is devoting more resources to processing outstanding claims filed by victims of the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history.
The 2022 blaze was caused by a pair of prescribed fires that were set by the U.S. Forest Service in an attempt to clear out vegetation to reduce the threat of a catastrophic wildfire. Officials have acknowledged that they underestimated the dry conditions that had been plaguing the region for years.
Hundreds of homes were destroyed, thousands of residents were displaced and mountains were charred, leaving behind damage that experts say will have environmental effects for decades to come.
FEMA officials said more employees have been placed on temporary assignment to help with the claims and the agency is prioritizing claims that were submitted some time ago.
The agency has received $518 million in claims with documentation and has approved $330 million in payments so far for people with property, financial and business losses, said John Mills, a spokesperson for the agency.

The federal government set aside nearly $4 billion last year to pay claims related to the wildfire. Lawsuits have been filed by residents who say FEMA has been slow to pay their claims.
The federal agency recently announced that it will be implementing new rules this year aimed at simplifying and speeding up the recovery process for natural disasters nationwide. FEMA officials called it the most comprehensive update to its individual assistance program in two decades.
The changes were the result of feedback from survivors, organizations that work in disaster recovery, and elected officials. New Mexicans have been among those calling for changes in the wake of the wildfire.
The announcement that more employees will be assigned to claims from the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire follows a letter sent Monday by members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation. U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández and U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan pointed to the failure of the claims office to meet a congressionally mandated 180-day deadline for settling each claim.
They said the deadline already has been missed on more than 100 claims and that the office is expected to reach the deadline on many more in the coming weeks.
Members of the delegation said it’s important that any new claim reviewers brought on to address the backlog understand their role is not that of insurance adjusters trying to save money but rather to use the resources provided by Congress to satisfy claims.
“The people of northern New Mexico endured unimaginable suffering at the hands of the federal government, which started the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire,” the lawmakers wrote. “We urge you to do everything in your power to expedite the process to compensate claimants.”"
JG69E5HBFG_A91Y85QKAW8VJT3,South African police arrest man who says he started a fire that left 76 dead to hide another killing,By GERALD IMRAY,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-deadly-fire-inquiry-1586af852facb5d355ec8feb67d6c60e,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A man was arrested Tuesday and will face 76 counts of murder after telling an inquiry that he started a deadly building fire in South Africa last year while trying to get rid of the body of someone he had strangled in the apartment complex on the orders of a drug dealer.
The shocking confession came when the man was testifying at the public inquiry into the causes of the nighttime fire in Johannesburg in August, which was one of South Africa’s worst disasters with its death toll of 76.
The 29-year-old man, who wasn’t named, said he had killed a man in the basement of the rundown building on the night of the fire by beating him and strangling him, according to South African media reports of the testimony. He said he then poured gasoline on the man’s body and set it alight with a match.
He testified that he was a drug user and was told to kill the man by a Tanzanian drug dealer who lived in the building.
Hours later, police said they had arrested the man after his testimony. He is also facing 120 counts of attempted murder and a charge of arson, police said in a statement. He would appear in court in Johannesburg soon, police said, without giving a date.

The inquiry he was testifying at isn’t a criminal proceeding and his confession came as a complete surprise. The inquiry is looking into what caused the fire and what safety failures might have resulted in so many people dying, and he testified because he was a resident of the building.
The panel in charge of the inquiry ordered that he not be identified after his testimony and a lawyer leading the questioning of witnesses said that his confession couldn’t be used against him because it wasn’t a criminal hearing.
South African media referred to him as “Mr. X” when reporting on his claim that he caused the fire that ripped through the dilapidated five-story building in the city’s Marshalltown district, killing dozens, including at least 12 children. More than 80 people were injured.
The fire drew the world’s attention to downtown Johannesburg’s long-running problem with “hijacked buildings,” rundown structures that have been taken over by squatters and abandoned by authorities. There are many of them in the old center of the city, officials say, illustrating the decay of parts of South Africa’s largest city and one of the African continent’s most important economic hubs.
The city of Johannesburg owned the building, but it had been taken over by illegal landlords, who were renting out space to hundreds of poor people desperate for somewhere to live. Many of the building’s occupants were immigrants suspected of being in South Africa illegally.
It also sparked anger in South Africa that authorities should seemingly be so powerless to stop the illegal takeover of such buildings.
In his testimony, Mr. X said that the building was a haven of criminality and was being run by drug dealers. He also claimed there were more bodies in the basement of the building — which he called a “slaughterhouse” — before the fire.
South African police opened a criminal case in the days after the fire five months ago but no one had been arrested until Tuesday.
Emergency services officials said that they found most of the fire escapes in the building had been locked or chained closed that night, making it even deadlier. Some people jumped out of windows — some as high as three floors up — to escape the inferno, according to witnesses and health officials.
Some said they had to throw their babies and children out, hoping they would be caught by people below. Many of the injured suffered broken limbs and backs from jumping out the windows.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered the inquiry into the disaster, which started in October by hearing testimony from emergency services personnel who first responded to the fire in the early morning hours of Aug. 31.

JQM59TDJN0_I9Q855UVDA9FHQG,"Company seeking to mine near Okefenokee will pay $20,000 to settle environmental violation claims",By RUSS BYNUM,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/okefenokee-swamp-refuge-mine-georgia-f92b87f151cbc65f45bfa39dc22d9c19,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — The company seeking permits to mine minerals near the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp and its vast wildlife refuge has agreed to pay a $20,000 fine to Georgia environmental regulators, who say the company violated state laws while collecting soil samples for its permit application.
The Georgia Environmental Protection Division’s assessment of a civil penalty against Twin Pines Minerals comes as the Alabama-based company waits for the agency to approve a final mining plan for how it would conduct mining operations and mitigate any environmental damage. The plan is required for Twin Pines to qualify for a permit. Regulators released a draft plan a year ago.
Since 2019, Twin Pines has been seeking government permits to mine titanium dioxide less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the southeastern boundary of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest U.S. refuge east of the Mississippi River.
Scientists have warned that mining near the Okefenokee’s bowl-like rim could irreparably harm the swamp’s ability to hold water and increase the frequency of withering droughts.
Twin Pines has insisted it can mine without harming the swamp. In a summary of the draft plan released in January 2023, Georgia regulators said their own analysis “concluded that water level in the swamp will be minimally impacted.”

A consent order issued by Georgia regulators Tuesday accuses Twin Pines of drilling soil samples at the mine site without having a professional geologist or engineer supervise the work, which is required by state law. The samples were taken in 2018 to collect data for the company’s mining application.
The document also says the company failed to provide a required letter of credit or a performance bond, which essentially acts as a security deposit that can be forfeited if drilling violates the law.
An attorney for Twin Pines said Wednesday the company denies any wrongdoing.
“The alleged infractions are based on EPD’s interpretation of ambiguous technical regulations,” attorney Lewis Jones said in a statement. He added: “We agreed to sign the consent order to put this matter behind us and move our project forward.”
One opponent of the mining project, Atlanta environmental attorney Josh Marks, called the $20,000 penalty “ridiculously low.” He said the collection of soil samples without the required professional supervision means information Twin Pines submitted in its applications can’t be trusted.
“If EPD insists on continuing to entertain this dangerous project, at the very least, it should force Twin Pines Minerals to redo its exploratory drilling in full compliance with state law and submit a revised permit application, no matter how long that takes.” Marks said. “Only then will EPD be able to accurately determine the impact of mining on the Okefenokee.”
Scientists who are critical of Twin Pines’ proposed mine have said they found other problems with the company’s application. Hydrologists for the National Park Service last year told Georgia regulators they discovered “critical shortcomings” and technical errors in computer modeling Twin Pines submitted to support its assurance that mining won’t harm the swamp. The company defended its work.
The National Park Service gave notice last year that it’s nominating the Okefenokee refuge for listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site — a rare distinction that would boost its profile as one of the world’s last intact blackwater swamps.
The refuge covers nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) in southeast Georgia and is home to alligators, bald eagles and other protected species. The swamp’s wildlife, cypress forests and flooded prairies draw roughly 600,000 visitors each year, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge.
In February 2019, the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote that the proposed mine could pose “substantial risks” to the swamp, including its ability to hold water. Some impacts, it said, “may not be able to be reversed, repaired, or mitigated for.”
The role of Georgia regulators is critical because the federal government, which normally weighs environmental permits in tandem with state agencies, has relinquished oversight of the Twin Pines project.
The Army Corps of Engineers declared in 2020 that it no longer had authority over the project because of regulatory rollbacks under then-President Donald Trump. Efforts by President Joe Biden to restore federal oversight failed. The Army Corps entered an agreement with Twin Pines to maintain its hands-off position in 2022."
JVHJ68R7FD_9BTQKMF70CUJECT,Maine Democrats who expanded abortion access now want to enshrine it in the state constitution,By DAVID SHARP,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/maine-abortion-constitutional-amendment-283630794490a7ecb344265a1a168016,"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Maine Gov. Janet Mills and other leading Democrats are pressing to end future legislative debate over abortions by amending the state constitution to enshrine the right to reproductive health care, just six months after lawmakers expanded access to abortions.
Maine is seeking to join four other states that have amended their constitutions to protect the right to abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
But the proposal faces another tough, passionate battle after a closer-than-expected outcome last year in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, which voted along party lines to give Maine one of the nation’s least restrictive abortion laws.
Amendment supporters say Mainers should have the final say, but it would take a two-thirds vote in each chamber to advance the amendment to a statewide vote at a time when many Republicans are still angry over last year’s loss.
“There’s no way it’s going to pass,” said Republican Sen. Lisa Keim, of Dixfield. “They shouldn’t be putting this political theater on stage again.”

On Monday, the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion, the governor lent her support to amending the Maine Constitution, saying the state must act to ensure the right to reproductive health care, regardless of which party is in control.
“No matter how strong our laws may be, they are subject to everchanging political tides and can be repealed,” she wrote in testimony to the Judiciary Committee. “That is why, without any such federal protection, it is critical that Maine people be assured that reproductive autonomy be protected to the greatest extent possible in the state — through an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Maine.”
Maine is one of more than a dozen other states that are considering ballot measures dealing with abortion for this year or in 2026. Most, in places including Arizona and Florida, would seek to ensure access, though in varying degrees. In Colorado, there are dueling efforts to get restrictions and access on the ballot.
Abortion questions have appeared on statewide ballots seven times since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In each case, the side backed by abortion-rights advocates prevailed — even in conservative states such as Kansas and Kentucky and swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.
Measures to enshrine the right to abortion are already on the ballots for November 2024 in Maryland and New York. Like Maine’s proposal, they don’t use the word “abortion,” but rather refer to “reproductive autonomy” or “reproductive freedom.”
On Monday, the sponsor of the proposal in Maine, Sen. Eloise Vitelli, of Arrowsic, warned that Maine isn’t immune to efforts to restrict abortions, noting there have been more than two dozen proposals in recent years in the Legislature.
“As we are seeing so clearly in state after state across this nation, laws can and do change,” Vitelli told supporters of her proposal Monday before the Judiciary Committee held an hourslong public hearing that wrapped up in the late afternoon.
That’s why it’s important, supporters said, for Maine to join California, Vermont, Ohio and Michigan, states that have made reproductive freedom explicit in the state constitutions after the U.S. Supreme Court action.
About 100 people supporting the proposal rallied in the State House, along with House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, Senate President Troy Jackson and others, but the tone was different from last year, when larger, boisterous crowds gathered in the halls.
Lisa Kushner of Belfast described her harrowing experience of entering a darkened building from an alley entrance to get an abortion in 1966, and she said lawmakers and the people of Maine should take additional steps to ensure that never happens again.
“Personal reproductive decisions have no place in state legislatures. Our elected representatives should never be orchestrating constituents’ reproductive lives,” she said. “Mainers deserve a right to vote and settle this issue,” she added.
The amendment follows a new law that allows abortions at any time if deemed medically necessary by a doctor. Maine’s previous law, adopted in 1993, made abortions legal until a fetus becomes viable outside the womb, at roughly 24 weeks.
The emotional debate included a public hearing that lasted 19 hours, driven mostly by a massive turnout by voters opposed to the proposal.
The bill was narrowly approved in the Maine House, passing 74-72, after the chamber took an hourslong break and the vote was held open for about 45 minutes.
Enraged Republicans accused Democrats of political shenanigans, but there were only a handful of abortion opponents present Monday. Keim said she didn’t encourage those opposed to the amendment to come to the State House in a show of force, calling it a waste of their time, given the significant hurdles to passage.
Several teenagers were among those who quietly held signs in opposition to the amendment.
Kristina Parker, an 18-year-old activist, said many Mainers share her view that abortion is wrong. “This is a constitutional amendment proposal to make personal reproductive autonomy a right, except I don’t think anyone has a right to kill anybody,” she said.

KBIF88Q7Q9_FLQTONTYB19GUH7,Alabama man shook violently on gurney during first-ever nitrogen gas execution,By KIM CHANDLER,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/nitrogen-execution-death-penalty-alabama-6d66344d3199f8c58f2408baa3df0738,"ATMORE, Ala. (AP) — A man put to death using nitrogen gas shook and convulsed for minutes on the gurney as Alabama carried out the first-of-its-kind execution that has ignited debate over the humaneness of the method.
Breathing through a nitrogen-filled face mask that deprived him of oxygen, 58-year-old convicted killer Kenneth Eugene Smith convulsed in seizurelike spasms for at least two minutes of the 22-minute execution by nitrogen hypoxia Thursday. The force of his movements at times caused the gurney to visibly shake. That was followed by several minutes of gasping breathing until his breath was no longer perceptible.
Smith’s supporters expressed alarm at how the execution played out, saying it was the antithesis of the state’s promise of a quick and painless death. But Alabama’s attorney general characterized the execution as “textbook” during a Friday news conference.
“As of last night, nitrogen hypoxia as a means of execution is no longer an untested method. It is a proven one,” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, extending an offer of help for states considering adopting the method.
Asked about Smith’s shaking and convulsing on the gurney, Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Q. Hamm said they appeared to be involuntary movements.

“That was all expected and was in the side effects that we’ve seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “Nothing was out of the ordinary from what we were expecting.”
Marshall said he anticipated Alabama “will definitely have more nitrogen hypoxia executions.” More than 40 death row inmates have selected nitrogen as their preferred execution method over lethal injection but did so at a time when the state hadn’t developed nitrogen procedures.
AP correspondent Sagar Meghani has the story.
Attorneys for those inmates have asked the court to order Alabama to turn over records and information about Smith’s execution. Litigation will almost certainly focus on Smith’s convulsions and movements during the execution.
“The State promised the world the most humane method of execution known to man. Instead, Mr. Smith writhed and thrashed before he died. No further executions should take place by this method until the events of this evening are examined by an independent body,” Assistant Federal Defender John Palombi, who represents death row inmates who requested nitrogen, said in a statement.
Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, agreed that the execution did not match the state attorney general’s prediction that Smith would lose consciousness in seconds followed by death within minutes.
“We didn’t see somebody go unconscious in 30 seconds. What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,” said Hood, who attended the execution.
Dr. Philip Nitschke, a euthanasia expert who designed a suicide pod using nitrogen gas and appeared as an expert witness for Smith, said the description of Smith’s thrashing matches what he would expect to happen when nitrogen gas is used in a mask and someone holds their breath or takes the smallest possible breaths.
“I think this outcome is inevitable if the nitrogen gas is to be used in execution where people do not want to die and will not cooperate,” Nitschke said.
Outside the country, the European Union and the U.N. Human Rights Office expressed regret Friday over the execution. The 27-nation EU and the Geneva-based U.N. rights office say the death penalty violates the right to life and does not deter crime.
Smith, who was paid $1,000 to kill an Alabama woman more than 30 years ago, said in a final statement: “Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards. I’m leaving with love, peace and light.”
He made the “I love you sign” with his hands toward family members who were witnesses. “Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,” Smith said.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said the execution was justice for the murder-for-hire killing of 45-year-old Elizabeth Sennett in 1988.
“After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr. Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes,” Ivey said in a statement. “I pray that Elizabeth Sennett’s family can receive closure after all these years dealing with that great loss.”
Mike Sennett, the victim’s son, said Thursday night that Smith “had been incarcerated almost twice as long as I knew my mom.”
“Nothing happened here today is going to bring Mom back. It’s kind of a bittersweet day. We are not going to be jumping around, whooping and holler, hooray and all that,” he said. “I’ll end by saying Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett got her justice tonight.”
Alabama had previously attempted to execute Smith in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldn’t connect an IV line.
The execution came after a last-minute legal battle in which his attorneys contended the state was making him the test subject for an experimental execution method that could violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Federal courts rejected Smith’s bid to block it, with the final ruling coming Thursday night from the U.S. Supreme Court.
Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.
“Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before. The world is watching,” Sotomayor wrote.
The White House also expressed concern over the execution method, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying during a media briefing Friday that reports about Smith and his death were “very troubling.”
Sennett was found dead in her home March 18, 1988, with eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck. Smith was one of two men convicted in the killing. The other, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
Prosecutors said they were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. The husband, Charles Sennett Sr., killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect, according to court documents."
KCJSULLRAL_FMYGX0OBZW52TMT,Memphis residents endure day 4 of water problems as freezing weather bursts pipes across the South,By ADRIAN SAINZ,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/winter-weather-freezing-temperatures-cold-memphis-water-948b57293a383883a99f5a0d6239cef7,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Memphis residents spent their fourth day boiling water for drinking, brushing their teeth and preparing food on Monday as repair crews worked to fix broken pipes in hopes of easing the stress caused by a week of subfreezing temperatures, snow and ice in this southern city.
The city’s water company issued a boil water notice on Friday to the more than 600,000 people it serves because low pressure in the system and breaks in water mains could allow harmful bacteria to contaminate the water supply.
“It’s frustrating for us homeowners, especially old folks, to have to deal with the snow and the water problem,” said 81-year-old William Wilkerson, who lost all water service between Thursday and Sunday.
Memphis was the largest, but not the only, water system in Tennessee to experience problems from the unusually cold weather that has caused dozens of deaths around the U.S. this month, many involving hypothermia or road accidents. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said on Sunday night that 28 other water systems were under boil water notices and 19 counties were reporting operational issues with their water utilities.
Meanwhile, the Tennessee Department of Health reported 34 weather-related fatalities across the state as of Monday.

Several days of below-freezing temperatures have also caused water problems for multiple cities around Arkansas, where freezing rain on Monday led to warnings of possible power outages as well.
In Tennessee, the several inches of snow and unusually low temperatures led the Tennessee Valley Authority to ask the 10 million people in its service area to conserve energy to avoid rolling blackouts. The utility saw its highest demand for electricity ever last week but the system remained stable.
Memphis, Light, Gas and Water CEO Doug McGowen told reporters Sunday that crews are making progress with repairs, and he expects most customers to have water service restored on Monday and Tuesday. They will still have to boil water, likely through Thursday, though.
Sarah Houston, executive director of Protect Our Aquifer, in Memphis, said she lost water service on Sunday night and still had no running water on Monday morning.
“I had filled up pitchers and water bottles and have some backup supply just for drinking,” she said. “Everybody’s going through it. It’s just unfortunate.”
While the majority-Black city is known more for its warm climate than freezing, icy weather, it has experienced winter storms in the past. But the storm last week was the fourth in past three years, showing that the city, like so many others, is feeling direct effects of climate change, Houston said.
“The first thing to recognize is that, having snow and multi-day deep freezes every year, is not normal,” she said.
Houston, known in Memphis as the city’s “water warrior,” said that water infrastructure in the South is not built for heavy snow, large ice accumulations and days of subfreezing temperatures.
“Our water lines are not buried beneath the frost line. They’re not insulated. And, they’re old,” she said. “If we had building codes like up North, they bury the lines deeper. Everyone’s plumbing is in the center of the house. Everything is insulated.”
She noted that Memphis Light, Gas and Water has poured at least $60 million into the water system since 2021 and said the situation would have been even worse without those improvements.
Earlier this year, the Environmental Defense Fund and Texas A&M University released the U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index. It found that Shelby County, which includes Memphis, is among the most vulnerable in the U.S. The measurements included food, water and waste management.
The Rev. Earle Fisher, a community activist and the pastor at Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church, said poorer neighborhoods have suffered years of infrastructure neglect.
“Even though the snowstorm exacerbates some of these issues, many of these issues have also been faced if there is a severe windstorm, if there was a severe rainstorm,” he said.
Fisher acknowledged severe weather can compound other problems poor people face. They may suffer if they lose workdays to road and business closures. If the cold weather makes them sick, they may not have access to health care. A lack of money and transportation could make it difficult to buy water or pick it up from a distribution center, he acknowledged.
In Tipton County, the fire department in Mason warned residents on Sunday to be prepared for a multiday water outage.
“There is no current time table on how long it will be before water services will be fully restored to all customers,” fire officials said in a Facebook post.
The recent winter storm was the fourth since 2021 to hit Memphis. Storms in February 2021 led to a week-long boil water advisory after water mains broke, wells failed, reservoirs froze, and motors at pumping stations overheated in a system with some parts dating to the 1930s.
An icy February 2022 storm spared the water system but led to more than 140,000 homes and businesses losing power in Tennessee. Some residents spent six days either staying with friends or family, in hotels, or huddled in their cold homes during the outage.
Ten months later, a December storm led to rolling blackouts and a long boil-water advisory in Memphis that also was caused by broken water mains in the city.
Memphis resident Pamela Wells had been without any water since Thursday morning when she noticed a trickle coming through on Sunday night.
“We kept praying that it was a sign that water was on the way,” she said. Family and friends have helped them over the past several days by delivering bottled water, she said, but she really missed things that she normally takes for granted like being able to wash her hands in the sink or take a shower.
She woke up Monday morning to find water pressure restored to about 40% of normal. “Hopefully we’re on our way to full restoration of our water.”

The 6-kilometer (4-mile) traffic jam happened after two trailers got stuck in the snow Wednesday, forcing soldiers to come in and help free the vehicles.
Japan’s Meteorological Agency said as much as 60 centimeters (24 inches) of snow could fall in the Tohoku region through Friday, according to Japan’s Kyodo news agency, with heavy snow also expected on the northern island of Hokkaido and in other areas.
The traffic jam occurred on the Meishin Expressway in Gifu prefecture. Two children in a stranded vehicle became sick and were taken to a hospital, Kyodo reported.
The Central Nippon Expressway Co. closed the road and mobilized snowplows and tow trucks to clear the stranded vehicles, while delivering snacks, drinking water and portable toilets for those trapped. The Ground Self-Defense Force, Japan’s army, dispatched troops to join relief efforts at the request of the governor of Gifu.
Cold air from the west formed a cold front that caused heavy snow to fall in Japan’s north-central region. The severe weather also led to accidents in a number of locations."

LJL17441SX_ZP5FKBLXY9U7EYO,Plagiarism probe finds some problems with former Harvard president Claudine Gay’s work,By MICHAEL CASEY,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/harvard-president-plagiarism-claudine-gay-14330935453134c7c9c9a9c496020568,"BOSTON (AP) — Harvard University has shed fresh light on the ongoing investigation into plagiarism accusations against former president Claudine Gay, including that an independent body recommended a broader review after substantiating some of the complaints.
In a letter Friday to a congressional committee, Harvard said it learned of the plagiarism allegations against its first Black female president on Oct. 24 from a New York Post reporter. The school reached out to several authors whom Gay is accused of plagiarizing and none objected to her language, it said.
Harvard then appointed the independent body, which focused on two of Gay’s articles published in 2012 and 2017. It concluded they “are both sophisticated and original,” and found “virtually no evidence of intentional claiming of findings” that were not her own.
The panel, however, concluded that nine of 25 allegations found by the Post were “of principal concern” and featured “paraphrased or reproduced the language of others without quotation marks and without sufficient and clear crediting of sources.” It also found one instance where “fragments of duplicative language and paraphrasing” by Gay could be interpreted as her taking credit for another academic’s work, though there isn’t any evidence that was her aim.
It also found that a third paper, written by Gay during her first year in graduate school, contained “identical language to that previously published by others.”

Those findings prompted a broader review of her work by a Harvard subcommittee, which eventually led Gay to make corrections to the 2012 article as well as a 2001 article that surfaced in the broader review. The subcommittee presented its findings Dec. 9 to the Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s governing board, concluding that Gay’s “conduct was not reckless nor intentional and, therefore, did not constitute research misconduct.”
Gay’s academic career first came under the scrutiny following her congressional testimony about antisemitism on campus. Gay, Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania and MIT’s president, Sally Kornbluth, came under criticism for their lawyerly answers to New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who asked whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate the colleges’ codes of conduct.
The three presidents had been called before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce to answer accusations that universities were failing to protect Jewish students amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and the fallout from Israel’s intensifying war in Gaza.
Gay said it depended on the context, adding that when “speech crosses into conduct, that violates our policies.” The answer faced swift backlash from Republican and some Democratic lawmakers, as well as the White House.
The House committee announced days later that it would investigate the policies and disciplinary procedures at Harvard, MIT and Penn.
The corporation initially rallied behind Gay, saying a review of her scholarly work turned up “a few instances of inadequate citation” but no evidence of research misconduct. The allegations of plagiarism continued to surface through December and Gay resigned this month."
LQ8IO0ZQS6_8WMX4ADZG6WFA7R,"With Trump closing in on nomination, the effective audition to become his vice president is underway",By JILL COLVIN and MICHELLE L. PRICE,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/trump-stefanik-vice-president-candidate-vance-scott-c193730f0786d5c71f980e2ab248710b,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — As she addressed a crushing crowd of volunteers and media at Donald Trump’s New Hampshire headquarters on Saturday, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik received a welcome chant.
“VP! VP! VP!” one man shouted across the room.
While vice presidential candidates typically aren’t picked until after a candidate has locked down the nomination, Trump’s decisive win in last week’s Iowa caucuses and the departure of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis from the race have only heightened what had already been a widespread sense of inevitability that he will be the Republican nominee. That has given the campaign trail stops by Stefanik and other Republicans the feel of a public tryout reminiscent of Trump’s days as a reality TV host.
Many Republicans covet a spot on the presidential ticket with Trump as a chance to serve in a high-profile role that has elevated many ambitious politicians from relative obscurity.
What to know about the 2024 election
That interest comes despite the fate of Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence. For four years, Pence was Trump’s most loyal defender, advocating for him at every turn. But in the final months of their administration, Trump turned on Pence, casting him as disloyal for refusing to go along with his unconstitutional effort to block President Joe Biden’s win.

Pence’s role in certifying the 2020 election not only threatened his life during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol but also sidelined his political career. He would end his own bid for this year’s GOP presidential nomination in October after failing to get traction. Many of Trump’s supporters still believe the former president’s lies about the election and view Pence as a traitor.
The Trump campaign has held several events in both Iowa and New Hampshire with high-profile surrogates.
Beyond serving as opportunities to display their loyalty and star power to Trump’s team, the events serve as a reward for volunteers as well as a recruiting tool that brings in new faces, senior Trump officials said.
Stefanik joined Trump on stage at his Friday night rally in New Hampshire and stopped by his campaign headquarters the next morning to thank volunteers and make calls. In both appearances, she stressed that she was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump’s comeback bid.
“I’m proud to be one of his strongest supporters, particularly at key moments,” she told reporters. Asked if she would consider being his running mate, Stefanik said, “Of course I’d be honored, I’ve said that for a year, to serve in a future Trump administration in any capacity.”
Others who have appeared in Iowa and New Hampshire on Trump’s behalf include Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Lake was at a rally Sunday night taking pictures with supporters and holding a baby in the crowd.
Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy appeared with Trump on stage in New Hampshire a day after dropping out of the race, also drawing “VP” chants from the crowd as he delivered a fiery speech.
And at the same rally where Stefanik spoke, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Trump’s former rival in the presidential race, announced his enthusiastic endorsement in what sounded like his own audition.
“We need Donald Trump!” said Scott, leading the crowd in an impassioned call-and-response full of the fervor many of his own campaign appearances seemed to lack. Trump stood behind him grinning.
Trump, too, has been stoking the speculation, saying during a recent Fox News town hall that he already knows “who it’s going to be.” He told Fox News host Bret Baier over the weekend that ”there’s probably a 25% chance” that he would ultimately pick the person he had in mind, adding: “The person that I think I like is a very good person, pretty standard. I think people won’t be that surprised.”

Jason Miller, a senior campaign adviser, declined to address vice presidential prospects or speculation about potential running mates. But he said those who have campaigned on Trump’s behalf in Iowa and New Hampshire “have drawn massive crowds and have all done a fantastic job of energizing voters to turn out for President Trump. So we’re very happy and very excited with both the jobs that they’ve all done but as well, the reception that they’ve all received,” he said.
Trump has been talking through potential choices since well before he formally launched his campaign, throwing out names, peppering friends and Mar-a-Lago members for feedback, and keeping a close eye on those jockeying for the post.
In those conversations, he has often indicated his interest in selecting a woman. Allies also say that while loyalty — and having a dependable attack dog who can effectively defend him — is paramount, Trump is also cognizant that he would enter a second term as a lame duck president and wouldn’t want a second-in-command who might overshadow him with immediate 2028 speculation.
Among those considered high on the list is Stefanik, a member of House Republican leadership who has seen her profile rise after her aggressive questioning of a trio of university presidents over antisemitism set in motion two of their resignations.
Mindful that aggressively angling for the job risked backfiring, the once-Trump critic has tried to position herself as a trusted ally of the former president, defending him in both of his impeachments and filing an ethics complaint in New York against the judge hearing his civil fraud case.
During a recent appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Stefanik referred to those imprisoned for crimes committed on Jan. 6 as “hostages.”
At a roadside country western saloon last week in the small town of Kingston, Vance, the senator from Ohio, offered a robust endorsement of Trump to a small crowd seated on bar tables nestled between whiskey barrels.
Vance once called himself a “never-Trump guy” and labeled Trump an “idiot.” But like so much of his party, he has rallied to Trump’s side. He says the two are now “very close” and talk “all the time.” And while he said he would “help out however I can” if he was offered the vice presidential ticket, he said Trump would also need allies in Congress.
“I think that’s the best place for me is to actually be an advocate of the agenda in the United States Senate. But certainly if the president asked, I would have to think about. I want to help him out in however I can,” he said.
Vance said he wouldn’t pretend to give Trump advice on the decision, but that Nikki Haley, Trump’s last remaining major Republican rival, would be a poor choice. “Stefanik’s great. Kristi Noem’s great. I think all these people are great. Tim Scott’s a very, very good dude and would make a great vice president,” he said.
Trump has already effectively ruled out Haley. He said at a rally in Concord last week that his former U.N. ambassador is “not presidential timber.”
Haley is staunchly opposed by many in Trump’s “MAGA” base, including his son, Donald Trump Jr., who said he would go to “great lengths” to prevent her from being offered the job.
Other potential contenders mentioned by Trump allies include Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former press secretary, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who recently endorsed Trump after dropping his own White House bid, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
Susan Ingrahm-Kelly, 64, from Bedford, New Hampshire, visited Trump’s campaign headquarters to see Stefanik in person Saturday and raved about the congresswoman’s questioning of Ivy League presidents.
“Oh, I think she’s fabulous!” she said. “I absolutely love what she did, this whole thing with the Harvard.”
Ingrahm-Kelly, who is leaning toward voting for Trump on Tuesday, said she also likes the idea of another woman vice president. “I like to see strong, educated, articulate women, don’t we? I think she’s fantastic.”"

Hungary now remains the only NATO ally not to have ratified Sweden’s accession.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson welcomed Turkey’s move, saying on X, formerly known as Twitter: “With this, a key milestone has been reached in Sweden’s path towards NATO membership.”
Turkey’s parliament endorsed Sweden’s accession in a vote held Tuesday after more than a year-and-a-half of delays that frustrated other allies who argued Sweden’s entry would strengthen NATO.
On Thursday, the parliament’s endorsement of Sweden’s membership and a presidential decree approving its accession protocol were published in Turkey’s official gazette, concluding the ratification process in the country.

Sweden, along with Finland, abandoned its traditional position of military nonalignment to seek protection under NATO’s security umbrella, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming NATO’s 31st member, after Turkey’s parliament ratified the Nordic country’s bid.

But Turkey held out on approving Sweden’s bid, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups that Ankara regards as security threats. It sought a series of concessions from Stockholm, including moves to counter Kurdish militants.
Turkey also had been angered by a series of demonstrations by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, in Sweden as well as Quran-burning protests that roiled Muslim countries.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later also linked the ratification to Turkey’s desire to buy fighter jets from the United States. He has also called on Canada and other NATO allies to lift arms embargoes imposed on Turkey over human rights concerns.
Ankara has requested 40 new F-16 fighter jets as well as kits to modernize its existing fleet. U.S. administration officials have said they expect relatively quick action on the F-16 sale after Turkey’s ratification.
During the vote on Tuesday, the ruling party said Sweden’s tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval.
Senior ruling party legislator Fuat Oktay said that Sweden has amended its anti-terrorism laws, curbed the PKK’s financial activities, convicted a terrorism suspect and extradited another, and lifted restrictions on arms sales to Turkey.
With Turkey finalizing its approval, all eyes have turned on Hungary.
A vote on the protocols for Sweden’s NATO accession hasn’t yet appeared on the Hungarian parliament’s agenda, and barring a surprise emergency session, the matter is unlikely to go before lawmakers until at least late February.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán says his government is in favor of bringing Sweden into NATO, though he also has suggested that members of his governing Fidesz party remain unconvinced because of “blatant lies” from some Swedish politicians about the state of Hungary’s democracy."

The Cabinet approved proposed legislation that would provide for fines as high as 50,000 euros ($55,000) in cases where manufacturers don’t clearly label products to indicate just what percentage of the sales would go to charity.
Recently, Italy’s antitrust authority fined fashion-blogger-turned-influencer Chiara Ferragni 1 million euros ($1.1 million) and cake-maker Balocco SpA 420,000 euros for allegedly leading consumers to believe that by buying the sweet they would be contributing to an Italian hospital.
Italy’s industry minister, Adolfo Urso, told reporters that the law would oblige manufacturers and professionals to put specific information on labels, including just how much of the proceeds, either in terms of a percentage or a flat amount, would go to charity.
“This way the consumer will know with certainty which part of the proceeds will go to solidarity initiatives,’' the Italian news agency LaPresse quoted the minister as saying.

Italian media quoted Ferragni as praising in a statement the Cabinet’s action, which she said filled “a legislative void.”
“What happened to me made me understand how it is fundamental to discipline with clear rules the activities of charity linked to commercial activities,’' Ferragni was quoted as saying.
Ferragni and Balocco President Alessandra Balocco are also being investigated by prosecutors in Milan for alleged aggravated fraud.
The antitrust authorities said that the cake-maker had made a one-time donation of 50,000 euros to a hospital in Turin in 2022, before the Ferragni-branded Christmas cakes were launched and didn’t make any further donations. It said Ferragni’s companies made 1 million euros to license her logo for the initiative, which saw the Ferragni-branded cakes sell for a higher price than usual.
The cake-maker said that it acted in “absolute good faith” in offering the special edition sweet known as a pandoro.
Ferragni has said she trusts that the criminal probe will show that she acted in good faith.
Since the Christmas cake flap erupted, a growing list of other deals involving the influencer with various companies has come under scrutiny."

The 2015 peace deal with Tuareg rebel groups is ending “with immediate effect” because the rebels have failed to comply with its terms and because of “acts of hostility” by Algeria, which has been the main mediator in the peace efforts, government spokesperson Col. Abdoulaye Maiga said on state television Thursday night.
Representatives of the rebel group did not immediately comment but Algeria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it “deeply regrets” Mali’s decision to end the agreement and denied working against it.
“The Malian people must know that such unfortunate and unwelcome decisions have proven in the past that the military option is the first threat to the unity and territorial integrity of Mali, that it carries within it the seeds of a civil war in Mali, that it differs national reconciliation instead of bringing it closer together and that it finally constitutes a source of real threat to regional peace and stability,” the statement said.
The campaign by the Tuareg rebels to create an independent state of Azawad in northern Mali threw the West African nation into a violent conflict for over a decade. In 2012, they dislodged the Malian military from the town of Kidal, setting into motion a series of events that destabilized the country.

The peace deal backed by Algeria and welcomed by the United Nations reduced hostilities in the northern region before it appeared to collapse last year after both parties accused each other of failing to comply with it. Malian authorities also announced the prosecution of some rebel leaders.
Maiga noted the “absolute inapplicability” of the peace agreement and “the inability of international mediation to ensure that the obligations incumbent on the signatory armed groups are respected.”
Analysts said the formal end of the deal did not come as a surprise following months of tension between the government and the rebel groups and after years in which both sides failed to fulfil its terms. Mali and Algeria have also fallen out over the deal.
The collapse of the agreement comes after the end of a U.N. peacekeeping mission deployed to help contain the rebellion. It also comes as Mali’s military leaders — in power for more than three years — struggle to contain an Islamic extremist insurgency that has ravaged the north since 2012.
“There is a high risk of even the jihadis strengthening their own forces because some of the groups that had signed the agreement may seek to work with the jihadis,” said Shaantanu Shankar, country analyst for Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, adding that the junta lacks the capacity to manage the situation.
Mali’s military leaders — under pressure to hand over power to civilians — could also be using the announcement “to deviate the public opinion in Mali from the struggles (the) Junta is facing,” according to Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South Moroccan think tank.
“As for accusations against Algeria, the junta has repeatedly blamed others for its internal problems, so this fits its narrative of what’s happening in Mali,” Lyammouri added."

(AP) — The former superintendent of the Chicopee Public Schools in Massachusetts pleaded guilty Tuesday to lying to federal agents investigating 99 threatening text messages sent to a candidate for police chief in 2021, prosecutors said Tuesday.
Lynn Clark, 53, of Belchertown, pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Mastroianni has scheduled sentencing for April 30.
Chicopee, a city of about 55,000 residents roughly 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Boston, was in the process of hiring a new police chief in December 2021 when law enforcement received a report that a candidate for the job had received texts from unknown numbers that seemed intended to force them to withdraw, prosecutors said.
The candidate pulled their application, and the city delayed the selection process. Clark was charged in April, 2022 and removed from her duties as superintendent a few weeks later.
Investigators said about 99 threatening messages threatening “reputational harm” were sent from fictitious phone numbers purchased through a mobile app. Phone and internet records revealed the numbers were purchased by Clark and that the accounts sent each of the threatening messages.

Investigators said Clark falsely said she received threatening text messages from unknown phone numbers, when, in fact, she sent the messages to herself.
She also falsely named other city workers who she felt may be responsible for sending the messages, according to prosecutors. They said Clark also denied that she had downloaded a mobile app with which she purchased the fictitious phone numbers to send the messages.
Clark later admitted that she sent the messages and downloaded the app, prosecutors said.
The charges of making false statements each carry a sentence of up to five years in prison, up to one year of supervised release, and a fine of up to $10,000."
MKO2YEFD6F_3L4AT8EBK6L8TLL,North Carolina state workers’ health plan ending coverage for certain weight-loss drugs,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-insurance-program-weight-loss-prescriptions-b08389eea18137e28799f1793d56a6a6,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The health insurance program for North Carolina government workers, teachers, retirees and their families soon won’t cover popular but expensive anti-obesity drugs, the result of a price fight with the manufacturer of two brand-name medications.
The North Carolina State Health Plan trustees board voted 4-3 on Thursday to exclude coverage effective April 1 of what are known as GLP-1 medications when used for the purpose of weight loss, news outlets reported. GLP-1-related prescriptions for diabetes treatment aren’t affected.
The State Health Plan, which covers more than 700,000 people, has been dealing with massive growth in prescriptions of these drugs and their resulting expense. The GLP-1 weight-loss medications cost the plan an estimated $102 million in 2023, plan officials say, or about 10% of what it paid for all prescriptions.
In October, the board had voted to permit what became nearly 25,000 people with prescriptions for Wegovy, Saxenda or Zepbound for the purpose of weight loss at the end of 2023 to continue receiving them. But no additional prescriptions would be allowed going forward.
But this shift in drug utilization meant the State Health Plan would lose a 40% rebate on the cost of Wegovy and Saxenda from their manufacturer Novo Nordisk through the contract with plan pharmacy benefits manager CVS/Caremark.

That would have resulted in the plan spending $139 million on the grandfathered prescriptions, instead of $84 million with the rebate. Even with the rebate, the state plan was paying $800 for a month of Wegovy.
By ending coverage for the weight-loss drugs after April 1, the plan said it could save nearly $100 million this year.
“We can’t spend money we don’t have, we just can’t,” said Dr. Pete Robie, a board member. Thursday’s vote ended the grandfather provision.
If no limits had been set, the State Health Plan would have spent an estimated $170 million on the weight-loss drugs, plan administrator Sam Watts said. That could have necessitated by 2025 a monthly surcharge of $48.50 on each plan member, the plan said, whether that member is using the drugs or not.
Board member Melanie Bush argued that the plan should maintain coverage of the existing prescriptions while negotiations continue with manufacturers and CVS/Caremark.
“This is a life-saving drug, and we’re talking about denying it,” said Bush, who also helps lead the state’s Medicaid program. Board members agreed the vote could be reconsidered if a compromise is reached.
“We have seen movement, but not enough movement to say, ‘Yes we have a solution,’” Watts said."
MQO369A7RA_F96YZAH89HEO92M,North Korea appears to demolish ‘reunification arch’ as Kim Jong Un turns against ties with South,By KIM TONG-HYUNG,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-cruise-missiles-nuclear-tensions-75814cce31eb3c0107c546b755d562e5,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea appears to have torn down a huge arch in its capital that symbolized reconciliation with South Korea, a week after leader Kim Jong Un dismissed decades of hopes for peaceful reunification with the war-divided peninsula’s south, according to satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press on Wednesday.
South Korea’s military also said Wednesday that North Korea fired several cruise missiles into waters off its western coast.
Kim last week described the Pyongyang monument as an “eyesore” and called for its removal while declaring that the North was abandoning long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered a rewriting of the North’s constitution to define the South as its most hostile foreign adversary.
Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC appeared to show the destruction of Pyongyang’s Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification, also called the Arch of Reunification. An image Tuesday clearly showed the arch missing along a roadway.
Clouds and snow cover made it difficult to ascertain when North Korea tore down the monument, but it appeared to be within the last few days. NKNews, a website focused on North Korea, first reported on the satellite images.

The arch was a 30-meter (about 100-foot) tall structure that looked over a highway leading to the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea.
The cruise missile launches were North Korea’s second known launch event of the year, following a Jan. 14 test-firing of the country’s first solid-fuel intermediate range ballistic missile, which reflected its efforts to advance its lineup of weapons targeting U.S. military bases in Japan and Guam.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korean militaries were analyzing the latest launches. It did not immediately confirm the exact number of missiles fired or their specific flight details.
“Our military has increased surveillance and vigilance and is closely coordinating with the United States while monitoring for further signs and activity from North Korea,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have increased in recent months as Kim continues to accelerate his weapons development and issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the United States and its Asian allies.
The United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises in response to the North’s missiles tests. Kim characterizes these drills as rehearsals for an invasion.
In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea said last week that it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan, as it blamed its rivals for tensions in the region.
Cruise missiles are among a broad range of weapons North Korea has been testing in recent years as it attempts to build a viable nuclear threat against the United States and its Asian allies.
Since 2021, the North has conducted several flight tests of what it describes as long-range cruise missiles, which it claims can cover ranges of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) and are nuclear-capable.
While North Korean cruise missile activities aren’t directly banned under U.N. sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan, as they are designed to fly like small airplanes and travel along landscape that would make them harder to detect by radar.
There are concerns that North Korea could dial up tensions in a U.S. election year. Experts say the North would aim to increase its bargaining power as it plans for eventual negotiations with whoever wins the November presidential vote.
North Korea also has a long history of ramping up pressure on rival South Korea when it doesn’t get what it wants from Washington.
During the speech at Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament where Kim announced that his country would no longer pursue reconciliation with the South, he accused South Korea of acting as “top-class stooges” of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.
Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its nuclear status.

MULVI2LGOS_5XJ07U4AE2B0C1D,Nepal asks Russia to send back Nepalis recruited to fight in Ukraine and the bodies of those killed,By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/nepal-fighters-russia-ukraine-war-e57a45645666d02651f6efed4e3f21ae,"KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Nepal has asked Russia to send back hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight against Ukraine and repatriate the bodies of those who died in the conflict, Nepal’s top diplomat said Thursday.
The Russian army is estimated to have recruited more than 200 Nepali nationals to fight in Ukraine and at least 14 of them have died there, Nepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud said in an interview with The Associated Press.
“We have asked Russia to immediately stop the recruitment of Nepali nationals in their army, immediately return those who are already serving in the army, repatriate the bodies of those killed, and treat and return those who were wounded in the fighting,” Saud said.
Nepal is also seeking monetary compensation from Russia for the families of those Nepali nationals who were killed in the fighting, Saud said.
Among the 14 confirmed killed Nepali nationals, Russia has said it is in possession of 12 bodies. Most Nepali people want the bodies of their deceased relatives to be cremated following religious rituals.

“We have information that five of our citizens who fought on behalf of the Russians are being held captive by the Ukraine side. We are asking the Russian side to take initiatives to get them freed,” Saud said.
Russian officials have not commented on the recruitment of foreign nationals for military service in Ukraine, but media reports have said that along with Nepal the Russian military has recruited some people from Cuba.
Russian law allows foreign nationals to enlist in its army after they sign a contract with the Defense Ministry.
In September, Cuban authorities arrested 17 people in connection with what they said was a network to recruit Cuban nationals to fight for Russia in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that speeds up a path to Russian citizenship for foreigners who enlist in the country’s military as Moscow tries to replenish its troops in Ukraine by various methods, including the recruitment of migrants.
Ukraine is also believed to have hired some Nepalis to fight as soldiers, but Saud said he did not have more information on this.
Nepal’s government has banned its citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for employment, saying many have been recruited by the Russian army to fight in the conflict in Ukraine.
Tens of thousands of Nepalis go abroad in search of work each year and are required to get a permit from the government before leaving the country for employment. Those who made it to Russia are believed to have traveled though a third country pretending to be tourists before flying to Russia.
Saud met with Russian officials on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement conference in Uganda earlier this month and discussed the issues with them.
“We have clearly conveyed to them that our citizens are not allowed to be recruited in the army and to immediately send them back,” Saud said.
For centuries, Nepali nationals were recruited by the British army to fight as famed Gurkha soldiers and later by India when it gained independence from Britain. That arrangement was made in 1816 after signing a treaty between Nepal and Britain."

Hundreds of unaccompanied minors were among a surge of around 10,000 people who tried to enter Ceuta, a Spanish enclave in North Africa, by scaling a border fence or swimming around it.
Many were believed to be sub-Saharan migrants seeking a better life in Europe. Morocco later took back most of the migrants.
Spain’s Interior Ministry defended sending the unaccompanied children back across the border, arguing that they wanted to go home. Spanish officials denied accusations by rights groups that the returns breached international law.
Spain is legally obliged to care for young migrants until their relatives can be located or until they turn 18, but officials said that a 2007 agreement between Spain and Morocco for assisted returns once children’s cases had been considered.

The Supreme Court judges rejected arguments that the 2007 agreement superseded Spanish law and said the mass return contravened the European Convention on Human Rights.
Tens of thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan countries try to reach Spain each year in large open boats launched from northwest Africa. Most go to the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, while others try to cross the Mediterranean Sea to mainland Spain or scale Ceuta’s fence.
Several thousand are known to die making the hazardous sea journeys.

N8Z6P6U9RB_D2KH1N0C7VN68KE,Sri Lanka passes bill allowing government to remove online posts and legally pursue internet users,By BHARATHA MALLAWARACHI,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-internet-bill-freedom-of-expression-wickremesinghe-527e0195a8f8f76573aa8d7185562b12,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka’s parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved an internet regulation bill that was highly criticized as a move to stifle speech in an election year while the Indian Ocean island nation copes with an economic crisis that required an international bailout.
The Online Safety bill would allow the government to set up a commission with a wide range of powers, which includes ordering people and internet service providers to remove online posts deemed “prohibited statements.” It can also legally pursue people who publish such posts.
The government led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe submitted the bill for debate on Tuesday, after which it was passed in the 225-member house, where the ruling coalition enjoys majority. Only 62 lawmakers voted against the bill.
Opposition lawmakers criticized the bill for creating “a very oppressive environment.” Media, internet and civil rights groups had asked the government to withdraw the bill, saying it would undermine freedoms.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said the bill would create a repressive law with broad and vague “speech-related offenses punishable by lengthy prison terms.”

The Asia Internet Coalition, which has Apple, Amazon, Google and Yahoo as members, said the bill “would undermine potential growth and foreign direct investment into Sri Lanka’s digital economy.”
The secretary of the Sri Lanka Professional Web Journalists Association, Kalum Shivantha, said the bill would severely impact how they do their job. “Online journalists might resort to self-censorship and even our news websites might get shut down,” he said.
However, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles, who introduced the bill in Parliament, said it would address problems related to online fraud, abuse and false statements that threaten national security and stability. He said more than 8,000 complaints were filed last year related to online crimes, including sexual abuse, financial scams, cyber harassment, and data theft.
Alles added that the bill was not drafted to harass media or political opponents.
Sri Lanka is still reeling from its worst economic crisis, which hit the island nation two years ago. The country declared bankruptcy in 2022 with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half of it to foreign creditors.
The crisis caused severe shortages of food, fuel and other necessities. Strident public protests led to the ouster of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The IMF agreed last year to a $2.9 billion bailout package for the hard-hit country.
After Rajapaksa fled, then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as president by parliament. The shortages of necessities have largely decreased over the past year, but public dissatisfaction has spiked after the government imposing new high taxes on professionals and businesses and raised energy bills.
Rights groups say Wickremesinghe has moved to stifle dissent, by cracking down on anti-government protests and arresting protestors and activists.
Sri Lanka’s presidential election is set to be held later this year.

The Swiss government on Wednesday selected Stefan Walter, a 59-year-old German national who was director-general of the European Central Bank for the last decade, to head the Swiss financial authority known as FINMA.
The agency played a key role, along with government officials and bank executives, in striking the megamerger worth 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.48 billion) after Credit Suisse customers rapidly pulled out their money following years of scandals. Swiss authorities feared the collapse of such a major lending institution could further roil global financial markets following the failure of two U.S. banks last year.
The troubles at Credit Suisse threatened to unhinge Switzerland’s position as a leading financial market, and the takeover left the country with only one internationally important bank: UBS.
A FINMA report issued last month laid out lessons from the brush with banking catastrophe, calling for a stronger regulatory toolbox that would pinpoint responsibilities with banks, grant the financial agency the power to impose fines, and impose tougher rules on corporate governance, among other things.

A parliamentary panel created after the government-orchestrated merger has been looking into the origins of the deal. Plus, Switzerland’s executive branch, known as the Federal Council, is expected this spring to issue a report on “too big to fail” rules that will inform parliament’s debate on whether and how to beef up banking regulations.
Walter takes over from an interim chief in place since the September departure of former FINMA CEO Urban Angehrn, who left citing the health consequences of a “high and permanent stress level” from being in the position.
Before Angehrn, British-Swiss national Mark Branson led the financial authority from 2014 to 2021.
Marlene Amstad, chair of the FINMA board, said Walter’s “knowledge in the area of large bank supervision and his links to international supervisory authorities will be a great asset for FINMA’s supervision of the systemically important Swiss banks.”
Amstad told Swiss public broadcaster SRF on Saturday that FINMA has been boosting its scrutiny of UBS, and about 60 staffers are now directly or indirectly responsible for supervision of the combined bank. In August, only 22 staffers were directly responsible for supervising UBS, she said.
Walter, who has a master’s degree in international banking from Columbia University in New York, will start the job on April 1, the Swiss government said."

(AP) — A jury on Thursday convicted a California man of murder for shooting to death a 6-year-old boy who was riding in the back of his mother’s car on a busy freeway.
Jurors in Orange County found 26-year-old Marcus Eriz guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Aiden Leos, who was strapped in a booster seat on his way to kindergarten. They also found him guilty of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle.
Authorities said Eriz and his girlfriend, Wynne Lee, were heading to work on May 21, 2021, when Lee cut off a car driven by Aiden’s mother, who responded with a rude gesture. Eriz pulled out a gun, reached out the window and fired a shot at the mother’s car that went through the trunk and pierced Aiden’s heart, authorities said.
The shooting shocked the county of 3 million, which relies heavily on a network of freeways to get to work and school, and drew international attention as authorities searched more than two weeks for the killer.
“If you shoot somebody or use violence in this county, and you harm an individual, you will pay the price,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer told reporters after the verdicts were read.

“Mr. Eriz is looking at 40 years to life. His life is over, and it’s because he took the life of this precious, innocent little boy,” Spitzer said, pointing to a large photo on display of a smiling Aiden.
Eriz looked directly at jurors as they were polled after the verdicts were read. He is being held without bail and scheduled to be sentenced on April 12. Eriz’s attorney, Randall Bethune, declined to comment Thursday.
Just over two weeks after the shooting, authorities arrested Eriz and Lee outside their apartment in the Orange County city of Costa Mesa after chasing leads to the white car she had been driving.
Eriz told police he pulled out his gun and fired the shot, knowing it was dangerous, Dan Feldman, senior deputy district attorney, told jurors during the trial.
Eriz’s attorney argued his client didn’t mean to kill anyone in what began as a road rage incident and didn’t know he had until days later when a co-worker commented that Lee’s car looked like the one authorities were searching for.
Lee, who has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact, is being tried separately.
Jurors began deliberations late Wednesday. They met for a little more than an hour Thursday when they announced they had reached a verdict, Feldman said.
Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard M. King thanked jurors and told them free counseling was available for them if needed.
“This has been a very trying case,” he said before dismissing them."
NUR523Z9YM_CDG2O9P0O1QV6QI,"A new, smaller caravan of about 1,500 migrants sets out walking north from southern Mexico",By EDGAR H. CLEMENTE,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-migrants-caravan-1fd24960cc3e6912ac8b27ba5be9f79f,"TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) — A new, smaller caravan of about 1,500 migrants started walking north from southern Mexico on Thursday, a week after a larger group that set out on Christmas Eve largely dissolved.
The migrants, most from Central and South America, said they had grown tired of waiting in Mexico’s southern city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border. They said processing centers there for asylum or visa requests are overloaded and the process can take months.
The migrants carried a sign reading “Migrating is not a crime, it is a crime for a government to use repression against migrants.”
The group managed to walk past two highway control checkpoints Thursday as immigration agents and National Guard troopers stood by.
Migrant Alexander Girón said he left his native El Salvador because his wages did not cover basic necessities.

In previous years, many people left El Salvador because of gang-related violence. But even though the Salvadoran government has brought down the homicide rate with a tough crackdown on gangs that has imprisoned tens of thousands, Girón said he still had to leave.
“Safety isn’t enough if there is no work,” said Gíron, who was traveling with his wife and two teenage sons in hopes of reaching the U.S. “Wages just can’t keep pace, everything is very expensive. We are going to look for work and to give our sons a better life.”
The earlier Christmas Eve caravan once numbered about 6,000 migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Central America. But after New Year’s Day, the Mexican government persuaded them to give up their trek, promising they would get some kind of unspecified documents.
By the next week, about 2,000 migrants from that caravan resumed their journey through southern Mexico, after participants were left without the papers the Mexican government appeared to have promised.
The migrants wanted transit or exit visas allowing them to take buses or trains to the U.S. border. But they were given papers restricting holders to Mexico’s southernmost Chiapas state, where work is scarce and local residents are largely poor. By last week, only a hundred or two had made it to the border between neighboring Oaxaca state and the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, mainly on buses.
Mexico in the past let migrants go through, trusting they would tire themselves out walking along the highway. No migrant caravan has ever walked the full 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the U.S. border.
U.S. officials in December discussed ways Mexico could help stem the flow of migrants at a meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
López Obrador confirmed that U.S. officials want Mexico to do more to block migrants at its border with Guatemala, or make it more difficult for them to move across Mexico by train or in trucks or buses — a policy known as “contention.”
Mexico felt pressure to address the problem after U.S. officials briefly closed two vital Texas railway border crossings, claiming they were overwhelmed by processing migrants. That put a chokehold on Mexican exports heading to the U.S. and on grain moving south for Mexican livestock.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said the spike in border crossings seen in December across the southwest U.S. border coincided with a period when the “immigration enforcement agency in Mexico was not funded,.”
López Obrador later said the financial shortfall that led Mexico’s immigration agency to suspend deportations and other operations had been resolved and some deportations were later resumed.

The alternative of a one-state solution “with such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of freedom, rights and dignity … will be inconceivable,” he said.
Guterres also warned that the risks of regional escalation of the conflict “are now becoming a reality,” pointing to Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan. He urged all parties “to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous costs” of a wider war.
Netanyahu’s rejection of a Palestinian state in any postwar scenario opened a wide rift with Israel’s closest ally, the United States, which says the war must lead to negotiations for a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace. That goal is supported by countries around the world, as ministers and ambassadors reiterated Tuesday.

Uzra Zeya, the State Department’s under secretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights, told the council, “A key component of U.S. diplomacy is to pursue a pathway both to a Palestinian state and normalization and integration between Israel and other regional states.”
“The goal is a future where Gaza is never again used as a platform for terror, and a future where Palestinians have a state of their own,” she said, reiterating the Biden administration’s call on Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov countered that American diplomacy “oscillates between vetoing resolutions about the ceasefire and at the same time calling for a reduction in the intensity of hostilities in Gaza.”
“Without a doubt this serves as carte blanche for the ongoing collective punishment of Palestinians,” Lavrov told the council.
Secretary-general Guterres repeated his longstanding call for a humanitarian cease-fire — an appeal with overwhelming global support.
But Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan again rejected a cease-fire, saying Hamas, which carried out a brutal attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, is committed to attacking again and destroying Israel, and a halt to fighting will only allow the militants “to regroup and rearm.”
He urged the Security Council to “eliminate the root” of the conflict, which he said was Iran.
Erdan strongly criticized the presence of Iran’s foreign minister at the council meeting, saying the country provides weapons to Hamas, to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and Houthi militants in Yemen, “and soon these acts will be carried out under a nuclear umbrella” and “Iran’s terror will reach all of you.”
Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons and insists its nuclear program is entirely for peaceful purposes. But the U.N. nuclear watchdog has warned that Iran has enough enriched uranium for nuclear bombs if it chose to build them.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian didn’t mention its nuclear program, but he warned Israel that it would not destroy Hamas, its stated goal.
“The killing of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank cannot continue on to the so-called total destruction of Hamas, because that time will never come,” he said. “Stopping the genocide in Gaza is the main key to security in the region.”
Riyad al-Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister, said Israel is carrying out “the most savage bombing campaign” since World War II, which is leading to famine and the massive displacement of civilians. “This is an assault of atrocities,” which has destroyed countless innocent lives, he said.
The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gazasays more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction, displaced an estimated 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and left one-quarter facing starvation.
Israel began its military campaign in response to the Oct. 7 attacks in which militants from the enclave killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 hostages.
Al-Maliki said Israel doesn’t see the Palestinians as a people and a “political reality to coexist with, but as a demographic threat to get rid of through death, displacement or subjugation.” He said those are the choices Israel has offered Palestinians, calling them tantamount to “genocide, ethnic cleansing or apartheid.”
Al-Maliki said there are only two future paths: One starts with Palestinian freedom and leads to Mideast peace and security, and the other denies freedom and “dooms our region to further bloodshed and endless conflict.”
France’s new foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, whose country holds the council presidency this month, presided at the meeting and warned that “a regional conflagration is real.”
He said the world should unite and deliver different messages to the warring parties.
Israel must be told that “there must be a Palestinian state” and that violence against Palestinians, including by West Bank settlers, must end, Séjourné said. And the Palestinians must be told that “There can be no ambiguity regarding Israel’s right to live in peace and security, and to exercise its right to self-defense against terrorism.”
But Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the argument that the war is about providing security for Israel “is far from being convincing.” He said supporters of this view never talk about the Palestinians’ right to security and self-defense.
Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the “ideology of hate embraced openly by Israeli ministers is normalizing the mass murder of Palestinians” and urged the council to stop it with a binding resolution.
Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and for blocking a Palestinian state, Safadi said. “The future of the region cannot be taken hostage to the political ambitions and the radical agendas of Israeli extremists. who described the Palestinians as human animals, unworthy of life, who enable settler terrorism against Palestinian people.”

(AP) — Remains recovered from the central Indiana estate of a presumed serial killer have been identified as those of a man reported missing in 1993, a coroner said Thursday.
The remains recovered in 1996 at the Fox Hollow Farm estate of Herbert Baumeister were found to match Manuel Resendez, who was 34 when he disappeared, Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison said.
Resendez was identified through a family reference sample provided in early 2023, Jellison said.
Approximately 10,000 charred bones and bone fragments have been found at Baumeister’s 18-acre (7.3-hectare) estate in Westfield, about 16 miles (25.75 kilometers) miles north of Indianapolis, Jellison has said.
Baumeister was 49 when he killed himself in Canada in July 1996 as investigators sought to question him about the remains discovered at Fox Hollow Farm.
Investigators believed Baumeister, a married father of three who frequented gay bars, lured men to his home and killed them. By 1999, authorities had linked him to the disappearance of at least 16 men since 1980, including several whose bodies were found dumped in shallow streams in rural central Indiana and western Ohio.
Jellison announced a renewed effort in 2022 to identify the charred bones and fragments by asking relatives of young men who vanished between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s to submit DNA samples. He said investigators believe the bones and fragments could represent the remains of at least 25 people."
O6XFKE5CA6_DI9LDI0I2RF8X6Z,Delaware governor proposes 8% growth in state operating budget despite softening revenue projections,By RANDALL CHASE,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/state-budgets-delaware-governor-state-spending-4bfc4a9619ba0aaeed771f580dca74a8,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — Gov. John Carney on Thursday proposed a state operating budget of more than $6 billion for the fiscal year starting July 1, an increase of more than 8% even amid a projected revenue decline of 2% this year.
The Democratic governor’s proposed spending plan is slightly higher than the benchmark recommended by the panel responsible for Delaware’s official revenue projections. It follows an increase of almost 10% percent in the current year’s budget.
Carney said much of the growth is due to spending on pay raises for state employees and rising health care costs for state employees and retirees.
Despite the growth in spending, administration officials warn that state revenues will soften over the next two years and that they may have to dip into reserve funds to balance the budget. If so, they will rely on a “budget stabilization fund” created by Carney in 2018 to set aside extra revenue for potential shortfalls in the future.
The stabilization fund, which currently totals $410 million, is separate from Delaware’s never-tapped “rainy day” fund, which totals about $329 million.

“It looks like we’ll need a budget stabilization fund to cover some shortfalls next year and the year after,” Carney said.
“One of our primary messages to legislators is to be careful in this year because of the softening revenues next year and the year after,” he added. “You don’t want to build in spending in the budget that you’re not going to be able to sustain in the out years.”
Finance Secretary Rick Geisenberger said revenues are projected to be “pretty flat” over the next two years, declining by 2% this year and growing by an equal amount in fiscal 2025.
“As we look out to fiscal year ’26, unless revenues bounce back significantly, … we may well need to draw parts of the budget stabilization fund next year,” he said.
Carney’s spending plan includes a 2% across-the-board pay raise for state employees, and what administration officials describe as a “historic wage increase” for school employees. Their goal is to increase starting pay for teachers to $60,000 by fiscal 2028.
Officials noted that the average salary for state government workers has increased by 31% since fiscal 2017. It is unclear how that compares to average wage growth in the private sector.
The proposed budget includes $2.1 billion for education, including $63 million in weighted funding for low-income students and English language learners, $45 million for salary increases, and $17 million for mental health services for students. Carney also is recommending more than $135 million for early childhood education.
Administration officials said health care spending accounts for nearly 40% of the proposed budget growth. They are recommending an increase of about $200 million for Medicaid and health care plans for state employees and retirees.
In addition to the operating budget, Carney is proposing a capital budget of $944 million for construction, maintenance, transportation and economic development projects. That’s roughly $500 million less than this year’s capital budget. The proposed capital budget includes $329 million for transportation projects.
Carney is also recommending a grants package of $66.5 million for community organizations, nonprofit groups and volunteer fire companies. That’s down slightly from this year’s record $72 million.
The final component of Carney’s proposed spending plan is a one-time appropriation of $92 million for various programs, including $56 million for non-pension retiree benefits.
Members of the General Assembly’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee will be holding hearings on Carney’s spending proposal next week."
O9PY8DESDC_WDNTJBDDXKL45DA,Elon Musk visits Auschwitz after uproar over antisemitic messages on X,By CZAREK SOKOLOWSKI,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/poland-holocaust-musk-auschwitz-64de614f79ab70de0c9f2ac8d509168e,"KRAKOW, Poland (AP) — Elon Musk, who has been accused of allowing antisemitic messages on his social media platform, X, visited the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp on Monday, saying afterwards that the tragedy of the Holocaust “hits you much more in the heart when you see it in person.”
Musk toured the most notorious extermination camp established by Nazi Germany during World War II before attending a conference on antisemitism organized by the European Jewish Association in the nearby Polish city of Krakow.
He admitted to having been “naïve” about the extent of antisemitism until recently, saying that is because most of his friends are Jewish and he has had little contact with it in his own life.
“In the circles that I move, I see almost no antisemitism,” Musk said at the conference in a discussion with conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire. “And, you know, there’s this old joke ‘I’ve got like this one Jewish friend.’ No, I have like two-thirds of my friends are Jewish. I have twice as many Jewish friends as non-Jewish friends. I’m like Jewish by association, I’m aspirationally Jewish.”
He defended his X platform as a place where freedom of speech flourishes, saying that a free exchange of ideas is something that ultimately helps to correct hatred, noting that the Nazis shut down freedom of press and information.

“The overarching goal for the X platform is to be the best source of truth in the world,” he said. The “relentless pursuit of the truth is the goal with X and allowing people to say what they want to say, even if it’s controversial, provided that it does not break the law.”
The billionaire has faced accusations from the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil rights organization, and others of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform, formerly known as Twitter, since purchasing it in 2022.
He sparked an outcry in November, including from the White House, when he responded on X to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism by posting, “You have said the actual truth.” He later apologized for the comment, calling it the “dumbest” post that he’s ever done.
Several big brands, including Disney and IBM, stopped advertising on the platform last year after liberal advocacy group Media Matters said that their ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content and white nationalist posts. X has since sued Media Matters, saying the Washington-based nonprofit manufactured the report to “drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.”
Musk visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau site with his 3-year-old son and others, including Shapiro and the founder and head of the European Jewish Association, Rabbi Menachem Margolin. The site, near the town of Oswiecim in southern Poland, is fenced off with barbed wire. Wooden barracks for the prisoners and the ruins of gas chambers endure as evidence of Nazi crimes. There is also a monument to the victims where remembrance ceremonies are held yearly.
“It was incredibly moving and deeply sad and tragic that humans could do this to other humans,” Musk said about the visit. “I’m a student of history, so I had seen the pictures, I’d seen the videos, but ... it hits you much more in the heart when you see it in person.”
Musk had been expected to make the visit on Tuesday and take part in a memorial service, together with political figures attending the EJA conference in Krakow, but showed up at the Nazi death camp on Monday instead.
“Due to schedule concerns, before Elon Musk’s arrival to the European Jewish Association conference, he took part in a private visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau with EJA Chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin, Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev. Musk laid a wreath at the wall of death and took part in a short memorial ceremony and service by the Birkenau memorial,” the EJA said in an email.
Oliver Bradley, an EJA media adviser, said the organization “challenged” Musk to come to Auschwitz during a Zoom conference on antisemitism in social media several months ago.
“Musk shrugged his shoulders at the suggestion stating that he already knew the history of the Holocaust ... as if visiting might not be an impactful experience,” Bradley said.
But Margolin, the EJA chairman, “successfully convinced Musk of the necessity of experiencing a place of genocide in order to even begin to truly fathom the dimension of the Holocaust,” Bradley said.
X, the social media platform that Musk bought when it was known as Twitter, didn’t respond to a request for comment about his trip, sending an automated message saying, “Busy now, please check back later.” SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, also didn’t respond to email requests for comment.
The EJA conference on the rise of antisemitism was held in Krakow before International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Jan. 27.
More than 1.1 million people were murdered by the Nazis and their henchmen at Auschwitz during World War II. Most who were killed were Jews, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others. In all, about 6 million European Jews died during the Holocaust. When the Soviets liberated the camp, they found about 7,000 survivors.
Musk said that had there been social media at the time of World War II, the Holocaust “would have been impossible to hide” and lives could have been saved.

OHGJVNVXRX_RY2E6B8V3PX8CB0,North Dakota judge won’t block part of abortion law doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution,By JACK DURA,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-abortion-d74cc62c964a872ed429d7aeda4d2790,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A North Dakota judge ruled Tuesday that he won’t block a part of a state law that doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution if they perform an abortion to save a patient’s life or health.
State District Judge Bruce Romanick said the request for a preliminary injunction “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.” The lawsuit will continue to play out in court, with a jury trial set for August.
The request asked the judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of complications that could pose “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”
Physicians face “the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in court arguments last month.
In a statement Tuesday, Mehdizadeh said, “Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans.”

North Dakota outlaws abortion except for cases in which women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.
The judge said the plaintiffs appeared to request that he, “by way of a preliminary injunction, change application of the exception from ‘reasonable medical judgment’ to ‘good faith medical judgment.’ Plaintiffs have cited the Court with no legal authority that would allow the Court to re-write the statute in this manner under the pretense of providing injunctive relief.”
The state’s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.
Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who brought the 2023 bill revising revising the laws, welcomed the judge’s ruling.
“I think we have something that’s very clear for physicians to see,” she said. “I think it’s common sense what we put in as far as the health exceptions, and it goes with the intent of the legislators, so I applaud this judge for reading into it and realizing that the authority lies with us, as far as writing the law, and interpreting it simply shouldn’t be that hard for the physicians.”
The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.
The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.
The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect in 2022, a decision the state Supreme Court upheld in March.
Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court’s decision that “it is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”
Soon afterward, North Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state’s abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed in April.
In June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine.
This story has been corrected to show that The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state in 2022, not last year."
OVWZZ9XOQJ_B29ZBV2WOEW5S7S,US expresses concerns over Sri Lanka’s controversial internet regulation law,By BHARATHA MALLAWARACHI,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sri-lanka-internet-media-freedom-financial-crisis-f15953c01b00e32b1ef661da15993ca2,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The United States expressed concerns over Sri Lanka’s online regulation bill Thursday, a day after it passed overwhelmingly in Parliament over protests by the media, opposition and rights activists.
The Online Safety bill allows the government to set up a commission with a wide range of powers, including ordering people and internet service providers to remove online posts deemed “prohibited statements.” It can also legally pursue people who publish such posts.
Julie Chung, the U.S. ambassador in Sri Lanka, said the United States has concerns about the potential impact of the legislation and urged “Sri Lanka to prioritize transparency and ensure any legislation does not stifle the voices of its people .”
“In addition to jeopardizing democratic values, vague and overly restrictive legislation can hinder investment and the development of a digital economy, undermining the economic growth that Sri Lanka needs,” Chung said in a statement posted on her X account.
Critics say the law is an attempt by Sri Lanka’s governing coalition to stifle speech in an election year as the Indian Ocean island nation copes with an economic crisis that required an international bailout.

The media, opposition lawmakers, internet and civil rights groups say the measure would undermine human rights and freedom of expression.
Human Rights Watch said Wednesday that the bill would create a repressive law with broad and vague “speech-related offenses punishable by lengthy prison terms.”
The Asia Internet Coalition, which has Apple, Amazon, Google and Yahoo as members, warned that the bill could undermine potential growth and foreign direct investment into Sri Lanka’s digital economy.
The government said the legislation addresses problems related to online fraud, abuse and false statements that threaten national security and stability. It denied the bill was drafted to harass media or political opponents.
Sri Lanka is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis, which hit the island nation two years ago. The country declared bankruptcy in 2022, with more than $83 billion in debt, more than half of it owed to foreign creditors.
The crisis caused severe shortages of food, fuel and other necessities, which fed strident public protests that led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. After Rajapaksa fled, then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as president by parliament.
The IMF agreed last year to a $2.9 billion bailout package for the hard-hit country.
Shortages of necessities have since abated, but public dissatisfaction has intensified as the government imposed new taxes on professionals and businesses and raised energy bills.
Rights groups say that with the presidential election coming later this year, Wickremesinghe has sought to stifle dissent by cracking down on anti-government protests and arresting protestors and activists.

(AP) — Dozens of Missouri Department of Corrections staff members are urging Gov. Mike Parson to grant clemency to a man scheduled to die in April for killing his cousin and her husband, with a former warden calling him a “model inmate.”
Sixty corrections officers and other staff members signed onto a letter to the Republican governor in support of Brian Dorsey, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported last week. The letter says Dorsey, 51, “has stayed out of trouble, never gotten himself into any situations, and been respectful of us and of his fellow inmates.” It says he is housed in an “honor dorm” at the Potosi Correctional Center, a housing area for inmates with good conduct, the Kansas City Star reported Monday.
“We are part of the law enforcement community who believe in law and order,” the group wrote in the letter urging Parson to commute the sentence to life without parole. “Generally, we believe in the use of capital punishment. But we are in agreement that the death penalty is not the appropriate punishment for Brian Dorsey.”
Dorsey was convicted in the 2006 killings of his cousin, Sarah Bonnie, and her husband, Ben Bonnie, in the central Missouri town of New Bloomfield. His scheduled execution on April 9 would be the first in Missouri this year after four were carried out in 2023.
A message seeking comment was left Monday with a spokesman for Parson.

Troy Steele, a former warden at Potosi, wrote in a review of Dorsey’s prison record that he was a “model inmate” — so much so that he’s allowed to serve as a barber. Steele said Dorsey has cut hair for prisoners, officers and even Steele, himself.
Dorsey’s execution also is opposed by his cousin, Jenni Gerhauser, who was also related to Sarah Bonnie.
“We’re very much living in the middle of eye-for-an-eye country. But I wish people would understand it’s not that black and white,” she told the Star.
In an 80-page petition filed last month, Megan Crane, an attorney for Dorsey, wrote that her client was denied effective counsel before he pleaded guilty. She also said Dorsey was “experiencing drug psychosis the night of the crime and thus incapable of deliberation — the requisite intent for capital murder.”"

Next stop Senate,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/czech-gun-law-tightened-mass-shooting-016ef997a7d1bee903592a36168810cf,"PRAGUE (AP) — The Czech Parliament’s lower house on Friday approved an amendment to the country’s gun law that tightens requirements for owning a weapon more than a month after the worst mass killing in the nation’s history.
The legislation now goes before the Senate and if approved there must then be signed by President Petr Pavel before becoming law.
On Dec. 22, a lone shooter killed 14 people and wounded dozens before killing himself at a Charles University building in downtown Prague. The assailant was a 24-year-old student who had a proclivity for firearms, with a license to own eight guns, including two long guns. Authorities said he had no criminal record and therefore did not attract the attention of authorities.
Parliamentary debate on the legislation had already begun before that shooting. Interior Minister Vit Rakusan has said it was hard to speculate whether the new rules would have prevented it if they had been in effect before it took place.
In the 200-seat lower house, lawmakers approved the changes in a 151-0 vote. If approved by the Senate, where the ruling coalition government has a majority, and signed by President Petr Pavel, it would then be possible for authorities to seize a weapon from private owners for a preventive reason.
It also includes a requirement for businesses to report to police suspicious purchases of guns and ammunition and gives doctor access to databases to find out if their patients are gun owners.
Gun owners would have to undergo a medical check every five years, not every 10 years, as it is now.
In the country of 10.9 million people, 314,000 had a gun license at the end of 2022 and owned almost a million weapons of various types."

Raids were carried out at 14 locations earlier this month and involved authorities in the Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Germany and Canada. Dutch fraud investigators coordinated the Jan. 9 operation with the support of European Union police and judicial cooperation organizations Europol and Eurojust.
The three suspects, two men, ages 56 and 57, and a 54-year-old woman, were detained in the Netherlands, the Dutch fraud office said. The office did not release their names and or the name of the company with which they were affiliated.
The raids followed “investigations into the illegal export of technological and laboratory equipment, which could be used for military purposes,” Eurojust said. “Such exports are illegal due to the EU-wide sanctions, which were imposed after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.”
Dutch authorities began investigating late last year and uncovered “a web of enterprises, which were used to circumvent the ban on exports to Russia,” Eurojust said in a statement.
The network was centered on a Dutch-registered company that Eurojust said was established in 2017 “for the import, export and sales of electro-technical and laboratory equipment, among other goods.”
The European Union has imposed waves of sanctions on Russia in response to the war in Ukraine, most recently targeting its lucrative diamond industry."
OYF44FTG8Q_J7V2TWYF1AH71XX,FTC opens inquiry into Big Tech’s partnerships with leading AI startups,By MATT O’BRIEN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ftc-antitrust-inquiry-openai-chatgpt-microsoft-anthropic-google-amazon-67feef411ef311f0be543f546ef34b3d,"U.S. antitrust enforcers are opening an inquiry into the relationships between leading artificial intelligence startups such as ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and the tech giants that have invested billions of dollars into them.
The action targets Amazon, Google and Microsoft and their sway over the generative AI boom that’s fueled demand for chatbots such as ChatGPT, and other AI tools that can produce novel imagery and sound.
“We’re scrutinizing whether these ties enable dominant firms to exert undue influence or gain privileged access in ways that could undermine fair competition,” said Lina Khan, chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, in opening remarks at a Thursday AI forum.
Khan said the market inquiry would review “the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”
The FTC said Thursday it issued “compulsory orders” to five companies -- cloud providers Amazon, Google and Microsoft, and AI startups Anthropic and OpenAI -- requiring them to provide information about their agreements and the decision-making around them.

Microsoft’s years-long relationship with OpenAI is the best known. Google and Amazon have more recently made multibillion-dollar deals with Anthropic, another San Francisco-based AI startup formed by former leaders at OpenAI.
Google welcomed the FTC inquiry in a statement Thursday that also took a not-so-veiled dig at Microsoft’s OpenAI relationship and its history of inviting antitrust scrutiny over its business practices.
“We hope the FTC’s study will shine a bright light on companies that don’t offer the openness of Google Cloud or have a long history of locking-in customers – and who are bringing that same approach to AI services,” Google’s statement said.
Microsoft’s Rimy Alaily, a corporate vice president for competition and market regulation, also said the company looks forward to cooperating with the FTC and defended such partnerships as “promoting competition and accelerating innovation.”
Amazon, Anthropic and OpenAI declined comment.
The European Union and the United Kingdom have already signaled that they’re scrutinizing Microsoft’s OpenAI investments. The EU’s executive branch said this month the partnership might trigger an investigation under regulations covering mergers and acquisitions that would harm competition in the 27-nation bloc. Britain’s antitrust watchdog opened a similar review in December.
Antitrust advocates welcomed the actions from both the FTC and Europe on deals that some have derided as quasi-mergers.
“Big Tech firms know they can’t buy the top A.I. companies, so instead they are finding ways of exerting influence without formally calling it an acquisition,” said a written statement from Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project.
Microsoft has never publicly disclosed the total dollar amount of its investment in OpenAI, which Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has described as a “complicated thing.”
“We have a significant investment,” he said on a November podcast hosted by tech journalist Kara Swisher. “It sort of comes in the form of not just dollars, but it comes in the form of compute and what have you.”
OpenAI’s governance and its relationship with Microsoft came into question last year after the startup’s board of directors suddenly fired CEO Sam Altman, who was then swiftly reinstated, in turmoil that made world headlines. A weekend of behind-the-scenes maneuvers and a threatened mass exodus of employees championed by Nadella and other Microsoft leaders helped stabilize the startup and led to the resignation of most of its previous board.
The new arrangement gave Microsoft a nonvoting board seat, though “we definitely don’t have control,” Nadella said at Davos. Part of the complications that led to Altman’s temporary ouster centered around the startup’s unusual governance structure. OpenAI started out as a nonprofit research institute dedicated to the safe development of futuristic forms of AI. It’s still governed as a nonprofit, though most of its staff works for the for-profit arm it formed several years later.
Microsoft made its first $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI in 2019, more than two years before the startup introduced ChatGPT and sparked worldwide fascination with AI advancements.
As part of the deal, the Redmond, Washington software giant would supply computing power needed to train AI large language models on huge troves of human-written texts and other media. In turn, Microsoft would get exclusive rights to much of what OpenAI built, enabling the technology to be infused into a variety of Microsoft products.
Nadella in January compared it to a number of longstanding Microsoft commercial partnerships, such as with chipmaker Intel. Microsoft and OpenAI “are two different companies, answerable to two sets of different stakeholders with different interests,” he told a Bloomberg reporter at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“So we build the compute. They then use the compute to do the training. We then take that, put it into products. And so in some sense it’s a partnership that is based on each of us really reinforcing what … each other does and then ultimately being competitive in the marketplace.”
The FTC has signaled for nearly a year that it is working to track and stop illegal behavior in the use and development of AI tools. Khan said in April that the U.S. government would “not hesitate to crack down” on harmful business practices involving AI. One target of popular concern is the use of AI-generated voices and imagery to turbocharge fraud and phone scams.
But increasingly, Khan made clear that what deserved scrutiny was not just harmful applications but the broader consolidation of market power into a handful of AI leaders who could use this “market tipping moment” to lock in their dominance.
The FTC’s three commissioners, all Democrats because two seats are vacant, voted unanimously to start the inquiry. Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said it should “shed some light on the competitive dynamics in play with some of these most advanced models.”
The companies have 45 days to provide information to the FTC that includes their partnership agreements and the strategic rationale behind them. They’re also being asked for information about decision-making around product releases and the key resources and services needed to build AI systems.

RODRIGUEZ,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/uc-california-campus-jobs-undocumented-students-451d70587475cffd514e7bf89467049b,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The University of California’s governing board on Thursday punted a decision of whether to allow immigrant students without legal status to apply for jobs on its 10 campuses, with the system’s president warning doing so would carry “significant risk” for the institution and students, including possible criminal prosecution.
The Board of Regents voted 9-6 to delay considering the plan until 2025 amid shouts of “Cowards!” from some in the audience.
Before the vote, University of California President Michael Drake told the board that the proposed legal pathway for the student work plan was “not viable right now” and said implementing such a plan would carry “significant risk for the institution and for those we serve.”
Drake said the policy could put immigrant students at risk of criminal prosecution and then deportation for working while lacking legal status. That, in turn, would put the university system at risk of fines and criminal penalties for employing them, and pose a potential threat to grants and other funding. He said the university system will continue to explore its options.
Regents who opposed delaying the plan shared their disappointment and called it a missed opportunity for the university system to lead in the fight for the rights of immigrant students who don’t have legal status.

“We are taking a pause at a crucial moment on an issue that requires our commitment,” said California Assembly Speaker Emeritus and UC Regent John A. Pérez. “If you stand and say this is the time for us to actually be bold, and take individual and institutional risks then you speak to a different sense of moral authority.”
The prestigious university system has more than 295,000 students. The policy could benefit as many as 4,000 immigrant students who would previously have been allowed to work under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
The federal policy implemented by former President Barack Obama prevents the deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. It was declared illegal by a federal judge in Texas in September. The judge’s ruling is ultimately expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, sending the program’s fate before the high court for a third time.
UC’s policy would also challenge a 1986 federal law prohibiting people without immigration status from legally working.
For years, students without legal immigration status have attended University of California schools while paying in-state tuition.
Department of Homeland Security officials did not respond to a request for comment on the proposal considered by the board of regents.
“I’m deeply disappointed that the UC Regents and President Drake shirked their duties to the students they are supposed to protect and support,” Jeffry Umaña Muñoz, UCLA student and leader at Undocumented Student-Led Network, said in a statement.
Ahilan Arulanantham, faculty co-director at the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law called it “deeply shameful” that the regents refused to adopt the policy now.
“Our legal theory, which we presented to the regents in October 2022, makes clear: the University of California has the legal right to authorize the hiring of undocumented students today,” Arulanantham said. “I have had the immense privilege of working with these students for the past couple of years, and I’ve seen firsthand how challenging it is to simultaneously pursue their studies and fight for their right to survive at the UC.”"

A military judge in Texas on Wednesday convicted and sentenced Lt. Col. Mark Patterson as part of a deal in which he pleaded guilty to assault consummated by a battery, sexual harassment, conduct unbecoming an officer, violation of a general order and other charges, said Army spokesperson Leah Garton. She said that the sentence was “consistent with the terms of a plea agreement.”
Defense attorney Joseph Jordan said his client owned up to his errors. He said the judge also took into consideration that Patterson had a brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.
“He took responsibility for exactly what he did wrong, and that is why his sentence was only a reprimand. It is important to remember that this is a decorated combat veteran who suffers greatly from documented PTSD and TBI,” Jordan said. “All of that was taken into account, yesterday.”
Patterson, of Weare, New Hampshire, was deployed with his unit to the southern border in October 2022 and assigned to support U.S. Border Patrol. In January 2023, the Army opened an investigation and Patterson, then commander, was reassigned, an Army spokesperson said previously. The investigation concluded in May and led to the court-martial at Joint Base San Antonio–Fort Sam Houston in which Patterson pleaded guilty.
The Army has not released details on the actions that led to Patterson being charged and did not immediately provide additional information Thursday.
Jordan described the circumstances as a “four-month situation” and said “there are absolutely no clean hands by any party to this case, including the alleged victims."
P1UTE8CL77_59H90QKSOD969KY,Mississippi ballot initiative proposal would not allow changes to abortion laws,By MICHAEL GOLDBERG,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-ballot-intiative-abortion-2da2169722fc76035d2200f9d3cc3e4c,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — After repeated failed attempts, Mississippi lawmakers will try again to revive a ballot initiative process, but their latest proposal would not allow changes to the state’s abortion laws through a statewide election.
The Republican-dominated House approved the resolution in an 80-39 vote Wednesday hours after an all-male group of Republican lawmakers advanced the resolution in a committee.
House Republicans said the state’s abortion restrictions should be off-limits because of the Mississippi House’s role in laying the groundwork for the U.S. Supreme Court to upend abortion rights nationwide.
“The abortion issue has been an issue that the majority of the House has championed for the past decade,” said Republican Rep. Fred Shanks of Brandon. “The House was the force that overturned Roe vs. Wade. It was no one else. It was us. And I just don’t think we want to be messing with it.”
In 2018, Mississippi enacted a law, which originated in the House, that banned most abortions after 15 weeks. The state’s only abortion clinic challenged the law, and that became the case that the U.S. Supreme Court used in 2022 to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling that established a nationwide right to abortion.

Democratic Rep. Cheikh Taylor of Starkville said the proposal deprives people of their right to weigh in on a critical issue, and direct democracy “shouldn’t include terms and conditions.”
“Don’t let anyone tell you this is just about abortion,” Taylor said. “This is about a Republican Party who thinks they know what’s best for you better than you know what’s best for you. This is about control. So much for liberty and limited government.”
Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters in seven states, including some controlled by Republicans, have backed access to abortion through statewide ballot initiatives.
Starting in the 1990s, Mississippi had a process for people to put proposed state constitutional amendments on the ballot. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled the process was invalid because it required an equal number of signatures from five congressional districts.
Mississippi dropped to four congressional districts after the 2000 Census, but initiative language was never updated. Shanks said the resolution remedies that issue. He told reporters that House Republicans would not approve the resolution without the abortion exemption.
The proposal will head to the Senate, where its fate is less certain. During 2022 and 2023, the House and Senate disagreed on details for a new initiative process.
Responding to a question during a Capitol press forum on Jan. 8, Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, said he does not think legislators should tell voters what issues they can pursue initiatives on.
“If we’re going to do a ballot initiative that had enough people sign on it ... then you ought to have a pretty clean ballot initiative,” Hosemann said. “I mean, if we’re doing one and you can’t do a ballot (initiative) on any of these things, then why are you doing it at all?”
In the opening weeks of this year’s legislative session, Hosemann replaced the chairman of the Senate committee that will likely consider the proposal. The former chairman, Republican John Polk of Hattiesburg, blocked a similar proposal last year. The new chairman, Republican David Parker of Olive Branch, said he would consider a proposal this year.
Under the resolution, an initiative would need more than 150,000 signatures in a state with about 1.9 million voters, according to Shanks.
In 2011, Mississippi voters rejected a “personhood” initiative that would have defined life as beginning at fertilization. The measure was promoted as a way to eliminate abortion rights, and its failure surprised many in the deeply conservative state.

(AP) — Authorities were evacuating homes Friday in northeastern Illinois after an ice jam break along the Kankakee River led to major flooding that was threatening about 200 homes.
A flash flood warning was in effect until mid-morning Saturday for Will and Grundy counties, specifically Wilmington, Illinois, located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of downtown Chicago.
An ice jam break caused the Kankakee River to rise about 3 feet (.91 meters), threatening areas between Wilmington and Phelan Acres, officials said.
Officials said about 12 miles (19 kilometers) of ice jammed up the river and as it melts, it not only is causing flooding along the river, but remaining chunks of ice could damage buildings and other structures as they float downstream.
Will County officials said Friday morning that the flooding occurred “suddenly” and alerts were sent to residents on their phones “advising them of the rising water levels and the need to evacuate.”

The Will County Emergency Management Agency was working to evacuate the area, where officials said about 200 homes along the Kankakee River are at risk and two roads were closed until further notice.
Resident Daniel Beck was among 14 people who were evacuated from their homes to a temporary shelter and he told WBBM-TV that the flooding was “devastating all these homes.”
Another resident, Julie Schmitke, said she had to be carried during her evacuation because she only has one leg.
“They had to carry me to a drier room, and I was just waiting there for the ambulance to come and transport me here,” Schmitke said."

He was 85.
The crash happened Wednesday afternoon as Coward and Bertha Brooks, 78, left a doctor’s appointment, North Carolina Highway Patrol Sgt. M.J. Owens said by telephone on Thursday. Coward pulled out onto U.S. Route 19 in front of a pickup truck, which hit his car, Owens said. Coward and Brooks as well as a Chihuahua and pet squirrel were killed, he said. Coward, who lived in Haywood County, was famous locally for having a pet squirrel, he said.
The 16-year-old driver of the truck was taken to a hospital as a precaution. Authorities don’t believe speed or distraction were factors in the crash, Owens said.
Coward had a small but memorable role in John Boorman’s 1972 classic “Deliverance.” The film starred Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox as a group of businessmen canoeing down a river in remote Georgia. Their adventure turns into a backwoods nightmare when local mountain men assault them.
Coward’s character, known as the “Toothless Man” for his missing front teeth, is one of the men who hold several of the paddlers at gunpoint during the assault. Coward became the indelible face to one of the most infamous scenes in 1970s cinema, contributing the line, “He got a real purty mouth, ain’t he?”"
PCWX720JZG_R247T55P1PVKEPX,"Georgia lawmakers, in support of Israel, pass bill that would define antisemitism in state law",By JEFF AMY,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-antisemitism-definition-israel-palestine-c1ce0f172a174769edeaca5c59af870c,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers passed a bill Thursday that would define antisemitism in state law, with Republicans uniting in support of Israel’s war on Hamas and some Democrats splitting over fears of suppressing support for Palestinians.
“Today we can fight a pervasive and escalating threat in our state and fight it together,” said Senate President Pro Tem John Kennedy, a Macon Republican who guided the bill to Senate passage, 44-6. The measure had stalled in a Senate committee in 2023.
The House later agreed to changes, voting 129-5 for passage. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said he would sign the bill, saying it “builds on our commitment to protect Georgians from criminal acts, including those based on hate.”
Sponsors say adopting the definition put forward by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance would help prosecutors and other officials identify hate crimes and illegal discrimination targeting Jewish people. Georgia has a hate crimes law that allows higher criminal penalties for crimes motivated by certain types of bias.
The definition, which is only referred to in the bill, describes antisemitism as “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”

Some lawmakers opposed the bill, saying they thought it would be used to censor free speech rights.
“The First Amendment guarantees our rights as citizens to criticize any government, foreign and domestic,” said Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Lawrenceville Democrat. “Does our Constitution not mean anything?”
But supporters say the definition will only come into play after someone has committed a crime.
“This legislation is not about stifling free speech,” Kennedy said. “Nor is it about the government stopping someone from simply sharing their views. It is about safeguarding the dignity and the safety of our Jewish friends and neighbors.”
In at least eight states nationwide, lawmakers are working on measures to define antisemitism, part of an upsurge of legislation motivated in part by the Israel-Hamas war. Arkansas passed such a law last year. New bills are pending this year in Indiana, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and South Dakota.
The measure grew only more fraught with the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanting “Free Free Palestine!” were dragged from a committee room by police Monday, prompting one arrest. That came after some Jewish residents of Georgia testified they had experienced a surge of bias incidents, including an antisemitic group that hung a Jewish person in effigy outside a Macon synagogue over the summer.
Ghada Elnajjar, a Palestinian mother from the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, said she was concerned the bill could embolden those seeking to stifle criticism of Israel.
She was particularly worried about her sons, saying they have been posting social media messages criticizing Israel for civilian deaths in Gaza. The sons have also worn keffiyehs, the black and white checkered scarfs that symbolize Palestinian solidarity.
The bill “might take a simple thing as wearing a keffiyeh or a social media post and take it a step further and criminalize it and jeopardize my boys’ future,” she said.
State Rep. John Carson, a Marietta Republican who sponsored the bill, told the House the bill shows “Georgia stands with our friends in the Jewish community.” Rep. El-Mahdi Holly, a Stockbridge Democrat, retorted, “I wish that was true of Palestinians as well.”
Some opponents said Thursday that they didn’t want to choose sides in the Israel-Hamas war.
“We can mourn the loss of both Israeli and Palestinian lives,” said Sen. Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat. “We can both condemn the unacceptable acts of antisemitism that are plaguing the Jewish community around our state and acknowledge that our citizens have the right to voice their dissent about the tremendous harm being visited upon Palestinian civilians.”
Some Democrats said that if Georgia moves to define antisemitism, then it should also define what prejudice against Muslims, African Americans or LGBTQ+ people looks like.
“If we’re going to define antisemitism in the law, then there a lot of other groups that experience racism, and they should also have definitions,” said Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who didn’t vote on the bill.
But other Democrats said they wanted to support Jewish constituents and allies, with some recalling the historic support of Jewish people in the struggle for Black civil rights.
“The Jewish community stood hand-in-hand with us,” said Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler, a Stone Mountain Democrat. “Today I return their favor and stand with them.”

PFVLB8KFRK_ASQSFVN1BK0B3D0,Prominent celebrity lawyer pleads guilty to leaking documents to reporters in Fugees rapper’s case,By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and LINDSAY WHITEHURST,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/fugees-lawyer-sentenced-pras-michel-contempt-case-b06cc0cab18fc45866c882a59fe66db6,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A prominent defense attorney whose star clients have included Snoop Dogg pleaded guilty Friday to leaking grand jury information to reporters about a political conspiracy case against a rapper from the Fugees.
David Kenner, a California-based attorney known for his representation of celebrities like Suge Knight and Tory Lanez, was sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor contempt of court charge. He also agreed to pay a $5,000 fine.
Federal prosecutors say Kenner was representing Prakazrel “Pras” Michel, a founding member of the Fugees, when he gave grand jury information and photos to two reporters for Bloomberg News for “defense-oriented” stories that ran in March 2023, shortly before the start of the Washington, D.C. trial. Michel’s trial included testimony from such figures as actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
As is typical in criminal cases, Kenner had gotten access to evidence in order to prepare Michel’s defense, but had been ordered by the court not to share the information, prosecutors said.
Kenner’s attorney said in court documents that the reporters originally agreed to sign a protective order, but later changed their minds. A Bloomberg News spokesperson declined to comment.

Kenner, 82, told the judge who sentenced him that he was reckless for not taking steps to terminate the reporters’ access to grand jury information. He described it as a “low point” in his 56-year legal career.
“Obviously, I made a terrible mistake,” Kenner said.
Michel was eventually convicted of all 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The Grammy-winning rapper faces up to 20 years in prison on the top counts.
Michel is now pushing for a new trial in the case. His new attorney, Peter Zeidenberg, says Kenner made a host of errors. That included bungling closing arguments by using an artificial intelligence program. Once touted as the first use of generative AI in a federal trial, the closing arguments included Kenner misattributing a famous lyric from a song by the rapper Diddy to the Fugees, according to court documents.
The charge to which Kenner pleaded guilty carries a maximum prison sentence of six months, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said a term of imprisonment or home detention wasn’t warranted. His probation term will be unsupervised under the terms of a plea agreement he struck with prosecutors.
Mehta initially expressed surprise that prosecutors agreed to a sentence without a fine. Mehta said a $5,000 fine — the maximum amount allowed under the statute — may be a “small but symbolic” addition to the sentence.
L. Barrett Boss, one of the defense attorneys, said Kenner was planning to retire after Michel’s trial. But Boss said Kenner is “very strained financially” because he spent $1.4 million “out of pocket” on Michel’s defense.
A spokeswoman for Michel said the conviction reflects a breach of client trust. “While Mr. Kenner argues that he was merely trying to mount the best possible defense for Pras Michel, his client, Mr. Kenner’s reckless actions crossed critical ethical lines, failed his duties as counsel, and ultimately have cost him dearly,” Erica Dumas said.
Michel was charged with funneling money from a Malaysian financier to Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign through straw donors, then trying to squelch a Justice Department investigation and influence an extradition case on behalf of China under the Trump administration.
The financer, Low Taek Jho, also helped finance Hollywood films, including “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which starred DiCaprio. Jho has since been accused of masterminding a money laundering and bribery scheme that pilfered billions from the Malaysian state investment fund known as 1MDB. He is now an international fugitive and has maintained his innocence.
Kenner had argued during the trial Michel simply wanted to make money and got bad legal advice as he reinvented himself in the world of politics.

PJH7C9KDWT_CWE91RZY0531ARK,More than 150 DWI cases dismissed as part of federal public corruption probe in New Mexico,_,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/albuquerque-police-dwi-fbi-corruption-investigation-4b733e1329664c54c5dafa61ddfccfd7,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — More than 150 cases alleging that motorists drove while intoxicated have been dismissed as part of a federal public corruption investigation, authorities said.
The FBI investigation led the 2nd Judicial District Attorney’s Office in Albuquerque to dismiss 152 misdemeanor DWI cases as of Friday morning, the office said. Those cases could still be refiled.
“We did this in deference to an ongoing federal investigation,” said Nancy Laflin, a spokeswoman for the office.
Search warrants were served at multiple locations last week, including at the homes of at least three Albuquerque police officers, the Albuquerque Journal reported. No one has been arrested or charged in the investigation as of late last week.
Three Albuquerque police officers combined filed 136 of the 152 DWI cases, according to court records. At least 107 of those were filed last year — making up 10% of such cases for the Albuquerque Police Department, records showed.

Some officers have been placed on standard administrative leave and others were reassigned, said Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos, who added Monday that “nothing has changed” concerning the status of the officers.
The fallout also led to the resignation of a prominent defense attorney, Thomas Clear III, as chairman of the New Mexico Law Offices of the Public Defender Commission. The 11-member panel operates as an independent agency. Clear served as chairman since August 2017.
Tessa DuBerry, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Mexico, confirmed federal law enforcement activity was conducted at Clear’s office “with the full cooperation of the Albuquerque Police Department.” She declined further comment, the Albuquerque Journal reported.
District Attorney Sam Bregman called the dismissals “a gut punch.”
“I’m sick to my stomach for dismissing more than 150 DWI cases, but my prosecutorial ethics require me to dismiss them,” he said in a statement."
PNH810E72M_Y83PIBUAMAUJMFB,Biden urges Congress to embrace border bill. But House speaker suggests it may be ‘dead on arrival’,By STEPHEN GROVES,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/congress-border-security-ukraine-058876834b48bacf5b3678b067d8dd9a,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Friday pressed Congress to embrace a bipartisan Senate deal to pair border enforcement measures with Ukraine aid, but House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested the compromise on border and immigration policy could be “dead on arrival” in his chamber.
The Democratic president said in a statement late Friday that the policies proposed would “be the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border we’ve ever had in our country.” He also pledged to use a new emergency authority to “shut down the border” as soon as he could sign it into law.
Biden’s embrace of the deal — and Republican resistance — could become an election-year shift on the politics of immigration. Yet the diminishing prospects for its passage in Congress may have far-reaching consequences for U.S. allies around the globe, especially Ukraine.
Senate Republicans had initially insisted that border policy changes be included in Biden’s $110 billion emergency request for funding for Ukraine, Israel, immigration enforcement and other national security needs. But the Senate deal faced collapse this week as it came under fire from Republicans, including Donald Trump, the likely presidential nominee, who eviscerated the deal as a political “gift” to Democrats.
Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, on Friday sent a letter to colleagues that aligns him with hardline conservatives determined to sink the compromise. The speaker said the legislation would have been “dead on arrival in the House” if leaked reports about it were true.

A core group of senators negotiating the deal were hoping to release text early next week, but conservatives already say the measures do not go far enough to limit immigration. The proposal would enact tougher standards on migrants seeking asylum as well as deny asylum applications at the border if daily migrant encounters grow to numbers that are unmanageable for authorities.
“Rather than accept accountability, President Biden is now trying to blame Congress for what HE himself intentionally created,” Johnson said in the letter.
The speaker’s message added to the headwinds facing the Senate deal, closing a week in which Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged to his colleagues that the legislation faced tough opposition from Trump that could force them to pursue Ukraine aid another way. He later clarified that he was still supportive of pairing border measures with Ukraine aid.
If the deal collapses, it could leave congressional leaders with no clear path to approving tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine. Biden has made it a top priority to bolster Kyiv’s defense against Russia, but his administration has run out of money to send ammunition and missiles. Ukraine supporters warn that the impasse in Congress is already being felt on battlefields and leaving Ukrainian soldiers outgunned.
Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead GOP negotiator in the border talks, has repeatedly urged lawmakers to refrain from passing final judgment on the bill until they receive legislative text and said some of the reports of its contents in conservative media are not accurate depictions of the bill.
The Republican speaker was already deeply skeptical of any bipartisan compromise on border policy. On Friday, he again pointed to a sweeping set of immigration measures that the House passed last year as being the answer to the nation’s border challenges. But that bill failed to gain a single Democratic vote then and has virtually no chance of picking up Democratic support now, which would be necessary to clear the Senate.
As they enter an election year, Republicans are seeking to drive home the fact that historic numbers of migrants have come to the U.S. during Biden’s presidency. His administration has countered that global unrest is driving the migration and has sought to implement humane policies on border enforcement.
“Securing the border through these negotiations is a win for America,” Biden said in the statement. “For everyone who is demanding tougher border control, this is the way to do it.”
Still, the speaker leaned into the Republican push on immigration, saying in his letter that the House would hold a vote on impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas “as soon as possible” after a committee advances articles of impeachment against him next week. Johnson also said he was standing with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has refused to give federal Border Patrol agents access to a riverfront park that is a popular corridor for migrants illegally entering the U.S.
But Johnson is also under potential pressure himself.
If the Senate were to pass an immigration and Ukraine package, he would face a decision about whether to bring the measure to the floor. And while the speaker is skeptical of continued funding for Ukraine, he has also expressed support for halting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s advance in Europe.
At the same time, hardline House conservatives have become vocal opponents of any compromise on immigration policy. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-right Republican of Georgia, has threatened to initiate an effort to oust Johnson if he put the Senate deal on the House floor.
“This bill represents Senate Republican leadership waging war on House Republican leadership,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, at a news conference this week.
Still, other Republicans have lamented that conservatives are throwing away an opportunity to gain a victory on an issue they have talked about far more than Democrats.
Opposition from the right has stymied efforts to reform immigration law in Congress for decades. Trump allies have argued that Congress does not need to act because presidents already have enough authority to implement tough border measures.
Johnson echoed that sentiment in his letter, arguing that Biden could start to fix the border problems “with the stroke of a pen.”
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, said earlier this month that conservative reports on the bill had “ginned up a lot of the base” voters against the proposals, even as the policy represented meaningful changes to immigration enforcement.
“This is a national security issue,” Mullin said. “And if you’re waiting until another president gets in, you’re playing politics with it.”

It includes promises to expedite citizenship applications, grant pensions to widows, offer more job training opportunities and allow easier access to Muslim places of worship, the government announced.
“Turkish Cypriots are citizens of the Cyprus Republic, we’re showing that in practice,” Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides told reporters Friday.
Cyprus was divided along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup aimed at uniting with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence over the island’s northern third, where it maintains more than 35,000 troops.
The package of 14 measures also includes providing urgently needed medication, expanded trade of goods between the breakaway north and the internationally recognized south, and easing north-south crossings at eight checkpoints along a 180-kilometer (120-mile) United Nations-controlled buffer zone.

It comes a few days before the U.N. secretary-general’s newly appointed personal envoy Maria Angela Holguin Cuellar, visits Cyprus to get a sense from both sides of whether there’s enough common ground for a resumption of peace talks after more than six years of complete stalemate.
Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar earlier this week dismissed the measures as a Greek Cypriot attempt to impose sovereignty and subjugate Turkish Cypriots while trying to impress Holguin.
Although Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, only the south where Greek Cypriots are located enjoys full membership benefits.
The fact that U.N. Chief Antonio Guterres has appointed an envoy to let him know whether talks are worth another try signals a large measure of caution following numerous failed attempts to produce an accord. The two sides have grown farther apart since the last major push for progress in the summer of 2017.
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots say the only way to peace is a two-state deal, ditching an agreement to reunify the island as a federation composed of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones.
The majority Greek Cypriots reject anything that would formalize partition, as well as demands for a Turkish Cypriot veto on all federal-level government decisions, a permanent Turkish troop presence and Turkish military intervention rights."
PTQAE0BR5J_SVQJO3RE53FM9YR,A Libyan delegation reopens talks in Lebanon on a missing cleric and on Gadhafi’s detained son,By BASSEM MROUE and ABBY SEWELL,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-libya-moussa-alsadr-hannibal-gadhafi-0610c01fa4002280005706b2ef210515,"BEIRUT (AP) — A Libyan delegation visited Beirut this week to reopen talks with Lebanese officials on the fate of a prominent Lebanese cleric who has been missing in Libya for decades, and on the release of late dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s son who has been held in Lebanon for years, officials said.
The talks were aimed at reactivating a dormant agreement between Lebanon and Libya, struck in 2014, for cooperation in the probe of the 1978 disappearance of Shiite cleric Moussa al-Sadr, judicial and security officials said.
The fate of the cleric has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. His family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume al-Sadr, who would be 94 now, is dead.
The late Libyan ruler’s son Hannibal Gadhafi has been held in Lebanon since 2015 after he was kidnapped from neighboring Syria, where he had been living as a political refugee. He was abducted by Lebanese militants demanding information about the fate of al-Sadr.
Lebanese authorities freed him but then detained him, accusing him of concealing information about al-Sadr’s disappearance.

A legal official familiar with the case said the Libyan delegation left Beirut after spending several days in Lebanon, where they met with the minister of justice and a judge heading a committee investigating al-Sadr’s disappearance.
The official described the talks as “positive” but did not elaborate or say if they achieved any results. The delegation is expected to return next week, he said, and added that Lebanese and Libyan authorities are treating the two cases as separate.
He said “there is no deal” so far for Gadhafi’s release.
All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.
The Libyan delegation’s visit was not publicly announced by either Lebanon or Libya. Libya’s internationally recognized government, seated in Tripoli, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Al-Sadr was the founder of the Amal group, a Shiite militia that fought in Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war and later became a political party, currently headed by the country’s powerful Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
Many of al-Sadr’s followers are convinced that Moammar Gadhafi ordered al-Sadr killed in a dispute over Libyan payments to Lebanese militias. Libya has maintained that the cleric, along with two traveling companions, left Tripoli in 1978 on a flight to Rome.
Last August, Libya’s judicial authorities formally asked Lebanon to release Hannibal Gadhafi because of his deteriorating health after he went on a hunger strike in June and was hospitalized several times.
Human Rights Watch this month issued a statement calling for Gadhafi’s release. The rights group noted that Gadhafi was only 2 years old at the time of al-Sadr’s disappearance and held no senior position in Libya as an adult.
Gadhafi’s “apparent arbitrary detention on spurious charges after spending eight years in pretrial detention makes a mockery of Lebanon’s already strained judicial system,” Hanan Salah, the group’s associate Middle East and North Africa director, said in a statement.
“It’s understandable that people want to know what happened,” Salah said. “But it is unlawful to hold someone in pretrial detention for many years merely for their possible association with the person responsible for wrongdoing.”

Q2EY0JPYPG_8WCHW04BXYRN30W,Maldives gives port clearance to a Chinese ship. The move could inflame a dispute with India,By KRISHAN FRANCIS,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/maldives-india-china-research-ship-0c12d6292f7709e72e1e1ce52e691828,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The Maldives government said Tuesday that it had given clearance to a Chinese ship to dock in its port, a move that could further irk India with whom the tiny archipelago nation is involved in a diplomatic spat.
The Maldives foreign ministry confirmed local media reports that research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3 was headed to the Maldives. It didn’t give a date of arrival.
A ministry statement said that “a diplomatic request was made by the government of China to the government of Maldives, for the necessary clearances to make a port call, for rotation of personnel and replenishment.” It said the ship won’t be conducting any research while docked in Male port.
“The Maldives has always been a welcoming destination for vessels of friendly countries, and continues to host both civilian and military vessels making port calls for peaceful purposes,” it said.
The ship arrives amid a diplomatic dispute between the Maldives and its giant neighbor India. There was no immediate comment from the Indian government.

The spat started when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted pictures on social media of himself walking and snorkeling in Lakshadweep, an Indian archipelago that looks nearly identical to islands in the Maldives. The Indian government believes that the white sand beaches of Lakshadweep have untapped potential for tourism.
However, some in the Maldives saw it as a move by Modi to lure tourists away from its famous beaches and island resorts. Three deputy ministers posted derogatory remarks on social media against Modi, which sparked calls in India for a boycott of the Maldives.
The dispute deepened when Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu visited China, India’s regional rival, and on his return, spelled out plans to rid his small nation from dependence on India for health facilities, medicines and import of staples.
The largest number of tourists who came to the Maldives last year were from India, and Muizzu said that Chinese visitors had been leading the way before the COVID-19 pandemic and that steps would be taken to double their numbers.
He also said in an indirect reference to India that his country’s smaller size didn’t give any other country the license to bully it, and added that China respects Maldives’ territorial integrity firmly.
India and China have been vying for influence on the Maldives as part of their competition to control the Indian Ocean. India, the closest neighbor to the Maldives, has considered the country to be in its sphere of influence. China, meanwhile, has enlisted Maldives as its partner in its Belt and Road initiative meant to build ports and highways to expand trade — and China’s influence — across Asia, Africa and Europe.
Pro-China Muizzu was elected to office in November on a platform to evict Indian military personnel stationed in the Maldives. On his return from China, he proposed a meeting with Indian officials that the troops be withdrawn by mid-March.
At least 75 Indian military personnel are said to be stationed in the Maldives, and Muizzu had accused his predecessor of compromising national sovereignty by allowing Indian personnel on Maldivian islands.
The known activities of the Indian military include operating aircraft and assisting in the rescue of people stranded or faced with calamities at sea.
Sri Lanka, another island nation close to India, recently declared a year-long moratorium on research ships docking in its ports. While the official stance of the government has been that it’s for the purpose of capacity building of local experts participating in joint research missions, the move is seen as a result of concerns raised by India over a planned visit of a Chinese ship."
Q5DWZCNFEB_2OYO8R6IIS6TTJ1,Floridians wait to see which version of Ron DeSantis returns from the presidential campaign trail,By BRENDAN FARRINGTON,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/desantis-florida-election-2024-3458da9397f9535949ba9a7bc343d4f0,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — When Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis first took office in 2019, he surprised many with actions indicating he’d be a much more moderate leader than anticipated: He corrected a decades-old racial injustice, took the side of medical marijuana supporters over GOP leaders and hired a liberal Democrat for a key state position.
But then he set his eyes on the White House and veered far to the right as he rolled to a 2022 reelection blowout and entered the presidential race. His message was loud and relentless and focused on how he had beaten down the “woke mob” with policies that upset Black and LGBTQ+ Floridians. Not even Republicans dared stand up to his iron-fisted governing style for fear of being punished.
Now that he’s dropped out of the presidential race and is returning to govern Florida for another two-plus years, which DeSantis will Floridians see? It’s a question Tallahassee insiders are speculating about, but one that likely won’t be answered immediately.
What to know about New Hampshire’s primary
“When you go through a life-changing event like running and losing a presidential primary, it gives you an opportunity to look at who is it that I really want to be and how do I get there,” said Jamie Miller, a Florida-based Republican political strategist. “And if that answer is still, ‘I want to be president,’ I think the one thing he may have learned is what worked for you in 2022 didn’t work for you in 2024.”
In the last three years, DeSantis built his national reputation through a well-publicized fight with Disney World over anti-LGBTQ+ legislation; his effort to limit discussions on race and inclusion; and his work with conservatives to keep the themes of gender identity and sexual orientation out of classrooms and school libraries.

The Florida Legislature is already in the third week of its annual 60-day session, and unlike most years, DeSantis has done little to set out a roadmap for the Republican supermajority to follow. Of course, as everyone else in the process was preparing for session, he was traipsing across Iowa.
“I thought that it was good that he was preoccupied and let us do our job,” said Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book. “It was very clear we were a distant afterthought. ... Hopefully they’ve learned a lesson that maybe you just don’t pile on on culture wars.”
While it’s not too late for DeSantis to put his imprint on the session, he might let the Legislature keep running its current course, where there’s less talk about abortion and guns and more focus on the priorities of the House speaker and Senate president. Those include improved health care access and restricting minors’ use of social media.
“Our Republican colleagues did not enjoy being told what do and having his agenda shoved down their throats,” said Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky. “I just don’t think he has the power anymore to require them to follow his agenda. They may agree with some of the policy things and the culture garbage, but I don’t think it will be at the same level.”
Because DeSantis will consider running for president again in 2028, he’s likely to think about why the rest of the country, or at least Iowa, wasn’t impressed enough with the way he ran Florida to help him beat former President Donald Trump.
“The real flaw for him is he hired a bunch of people who listened to him and he hired no one that he listened to,” Miller said. “You have to have those people who push you and it didn’t seem like he had anyone who did anything but really go along with anything he had to say.”
It’s not clear if DeSantis is going to appear with Trump, or even if the two have spoken since the governor suspended his campaign. Emails to his state and campaign staff asking about his plans weren’t immediately returned.
DeSantis has shown at least a hint of self-reflection. The idea of him admitting he made a mistake is as rare as snow in Florida, but as the campaign wound down, he acknowledged he shouldn’t have shut out mainstream media when he launched his presidential bid.
That’s the same governor who ran 2022 political ads showing him belittling reporters and hired and defended a communications staff that relentlessly and publicly attacked reporters and encouraged supporters to do the same.
“It’s probably one of the first time Floridians have heard him admit that maybe he was wrong about something,” Miller said. “This has been a growing process for him. Which I think that’s positive.”
As governor, DeSantis has shown, however briefly, that he could reach beyond his base.
In one of his first acts as governor, he posthumously pardoned four African American men falsely accused of raping a white woman in a 1949 case now seen as a racial injustice."
QAB2HENIPZ_3TX7AAADMNR4NPC,Mississippi restrictions on medical marijuana advertising upheld by federal judge,By MICHAEL GOLDBERG,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-medical-marijuana-advertising-lawsuit-6d99575c3792b080d1de22456ec84a6c,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the owner of a medical marijuana dispensary who sued Mississippi over state regulations that he says censor business owners by preventing them from advertising in most media.
In a Monday ruling, U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills said he agreed with Mississippi’s argument that since the possession of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, it is not a “lawful activity,” and therefore does not enjoy the constitutional protections granted to some forms of commercial speech.
After Mississippi legalized medical marijuana for people with debilitating conditions in 2022, Clarence Cocroft II opened Tru Source Medical Cannabis in Olive Branch, Mississippi. But he says he has struggled to reach customers because the state has banned medical marijuana businesses from advertising in any media.
Mills said unraveling Mississippi’s restrictions on marijuana advertising would be a “drastic intrusion upon state sovereignty.”
“This is particularly true considering the fact that, by legalizing marijuana to any degree, the Mississippi Legislature has gone further than Congress itself has been willing to go,” Mills wrote. “In light of this fact, on what basis would a federal court tell the Mississippi Legislature that it was not entitled to dip its toe into the legalization of marijuana, but, instead, had to dive headfirst into it?”

In a statement Tuesday, Cocroft maintained that Mississippi’s regulations violate the First Amendment rights of businesses. He plans to appeal the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
“I’m prepared to fight this fight for as long as it takes,” Cocroft said. “This case is bigger than me and my dispensary – it is about defending the right of everyone to truthfully advertise their legal business in the cannabis industry.”
Cocroft, who is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm, sued the state’s Department of Health, Department of Revenue and Alcoholic Beverage Control Bureau. Cocroft has said he cannot place ads in newspapers or magazines, on television or radio, or even on billboards that he already owns.
The state cannot prevent dispensaries from placing “appropriate signs” on their properties or displaying products they sell on their websites. All other advertising restrictions are up to the state Health Department, which prohibits dispensaries from advertising or marketing “in any media.” Those regulations are unconstitutional, Cocroft’s attorneys argue.
“When Mississippi legalized medical marijuana, it relinquished its power to censor speech by medical marijuana businesses,” said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney. “If a product is legal to sell, then it is legal to talk about selling it.”
While President Joe Biden pardoned thousands of people who were convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands, marijuana remains a controlled substance under federal law. As long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law, states have leeway to regulate how the substance is advertised, Mills ruled.
“Plaintiffs thus argue that Congress and President Biden have ‘all but’ made the possession of marijuana lawful, which strikes this court as a tacit admission that it still remains illegal under federal law,” Mills wrote.

QL7FSTPQGV_RIBW2N5IKGK37KE,"At United and Alaska airlines, frustration with Boeing’s manufacturing problems is boiling over",By DAVID KOENIG,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/united-airlines-ceo-boeing-manufacturing-problems-4090ea6176ef59e382dd18e9522596bc,"The leaders of United Airlines and Alaska Airlines took turns Tuesday blasting Boeing over manufacturing problems that have led to the grounding of more than 140 of their planes, with United’s CEO saying his airline will consider alternatives to buying a future, larger version of the Boeing 737 Max.
“I am more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry,” Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told “NBC Nightly News” in an interview that aired Tuesday night. “My demand on Boeing is, what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house?”
United CEO Scott Kirby said that Boeing needs “real action” to restore its previous reputation for quality.
Boeing said workers at its 737 factory would stop work on Thursday to hold a special session to focus on quality.
The strong and unusual criticism of Boeing by airline executives follows a Jan. 5 accident in which a panel called a door plug blew off an Alaska Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliner 16,000 feet (4,900 meters) above Oregon, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.

U.S. regulators grounded most Max 9s the following day, and investigators are probing whether bolts that help hold the panel in place were missing or broke off.
United, which has been unable to use its 79 Max 9s, disclosed on Monday that it expects to lose money in the first three months of this year because of the grounding.
Kirby said on CNBC that he believes that the Max 9s could be cleared to fly again soon, “but I’m disappointed that the manufacturing challenges do keep happening at Boeing.”
At times over the past few years, manufacturing flaws have held up deliveries of Max jets and a larger Boeing plane, the 787. Last year, United received 24 fewer Boeing aircraft than it expected.
United has a standing order for Max 10 jets, a larger version of the Max line. However, that model and a smaller one, the Max 7, are years behind schedule for being certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. The grounding of the Max 9 jets is likely to further complicate Boeing’s drive to get the new models approved.
Kirby said the Max 10 is at least five years behind schedule and could be pushed further into the future.
“I think this is the straw — the Max 9 grounding — is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” he told CNBC. “We’re going to at least build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”
Airlines rarely cancel orders, but sometimes they switch among various models in an order. Kirby wasn’t specific about what planes United could acquire instead of the Max 10 but said the airline would talk to Boeing. He noted that there is only one other global manufacturer of such large planes — Boeing’s European rival, Airbus.
Doing without the Max 10 probably means that Chicago-based United won’t grow as fast as it had hoped, Kirby added.
Minicucci said Alaska Airlines, which has 59 Max 9s, had planned to order Max 10s, but he suggested that could change.
“Everything is open at this point ... we are going to do what is best for Alaska long term, in terms of fleet mix,” he said.
Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, apologized for the Max 9 grounding and said the company is making changes.
“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” Deal said in a prepared statement. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance.”
Production workers at Boeing’s 737 factory in Renton, Washington, will spend Thursday taking part in “working sessions focused on quality.” The sessions will let workers “pause, evaluate what we’re doing, how we’re doing it and make recommendations for improvement,” Deal said.
The company promises similar sessions at all its commercial-plane factories.
The FAA has stepped up oversight of Boeing and is investigating whether the company and its suppliers — chiefly Spirit AeroSystems, which made the door plug — are following quality procedures in manufacturing.
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident on the Alaska jetliner. Pilots were able to turn around and make an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon, and no serious injuries were reported.
The Max, Boeing’s best-selling line of planes, has a troubled history, going back to crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. Those crashes — in Indonesia and Ethiopia — involved Max 8s and were attributed largely to an automated flight-control system that Boeing later overhauled.
All Max jets were grounded worldwide for 20 months after the crashes. Congressional investigators faulted Boeing for failing to fix design flaws and the FAA for weak oversight of the aircraft maker.
Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. rose 5% Tuesday, the first day of trading since the company said it would lose up to 85 cents per share in the first quarter because of the Max 9 grounding but earn $9 to $11 per share for the full year — a better 2024 outlook than analysts expected. Shares of Seattle-based Alaska Air Group gained 3%.
Shares of The Boeing Co., which is based in Arlington, Virginia, fell less than 2%."
QRSTN2ZRH9_QGQPFUVTVP8N1X5,GOP pressures Biden to release evidence against Maduro ally pardoned as part of prisoner swap,By JOSHUA GOODMAN,_,20231226,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-alex-saab-us-pardon-00682eda8afe81e189513e3e9cc926bd,"MIAMI (AP) — A group of Senate Republicans on Thursday urged the Justice Department to release its investigative file on a key fixer for Venezuela’s socialist government pardoned by President Joe Biden ahead of trial on money laundering charges.
Alex Saab, 52, was released from federal prison in Miami last month as part of a prisoner swap and was immediately welcomed to Venezuela as a hero by President Nicolás Maduro. Once freed, Saab launched into a tirade against the U.S., claiming he had been tortured while awaiting extradition from Cape Verde in a bid to make him turn on Maduro.
“History should remember him as a predator of vulnerable people,” says a letter sent Thursday to Attorney General Merrick Garland by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was also signed by Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the Republican vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence.
Saab’s release in a swap for 10 American prisoners and a fugitive Pentagon contractor held in Venezuela was seen as a major concession to Maduro as the Biden administration seeks to improve relations with the OPEC nation and pave the way for freer elections.
The deal came on the heels of the White House’s decision to roll back sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on Venezuela after Maduro was re-elected in 2018 in what the U.S. and other nations condemned as a sham vote.

The senators’ two-page letter cites U.S. government reports identifying Saab as Maduro’s “middle man” to Iran who helped the two oil exporting nations evade U.S. sanctions and also laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for corrupt officials through a global network of shell companies.
The senators set a Feb. 7 deadline for Garland to release the requested files.
“The United States government closed the case against Alex Saab when President Biden pardoned his crimes. There is no basis for withholding the evidence against Saab from the American public,” their letter says.
The Justice Department confirmed that it had received the letter but declined to comment further.
Any release of Justice Department records could shine a light on what the senators referred to as Saab’s “confessions” — a reference to his secret meetings with U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in the years before his indictment.
In a closed door court hearing in 2022, Saab’s lawyers said the Colombian-born businessman for years helped the DEA untangle corruption in Maduro’s inner circle. As part of that cooperation, he forfeited more than $12 million in illegal proceeds from dirty business dealings.
Saab, however, has denied ever betraying Maduro.
The value of the information he shared is unknown, and some have suggested it may have all been a Maduro-authorized ruse to collect intelligence on the U.S. law enforcement activities in Venezuela.
Whatever the case, Saab skipped out on a May 2019 surrender date and shortly afterward was charged by federal prosecutors in Miami with a bribery scheme in which he allegedly siphoned off $350 million through a state contract to build affordable housing.
He was arrested in 2020 during a fuel stop in the African nation of Cape Verde while flying to Iran to negotiate an energy deal. He was then extradited to the U.S.

(AP) — A performer who appeared naked in a show by world-renowned performance artist Marina Abramovic at New York City’s Museum of Modern Art is suing the museum, saying it failed to take action after he was sexually assaulted multiple times by attendees during the performances nearly 14 years ago.
The suit was filed in Manhattan on Monday under the New York Adult Survivors Act, a special state law that created a yearslong suspension of the usual time limit for accusers to sue. Although the law expired last year, the suit says the parties agreed to extend the window closing.
John Bonafede alleges in the suit that he was sexually assaulted by five public onlookers who attended a show he was hired by the museum to perform in as part of Abramovic’s retrospective “The Artist Is Present.”
Email messages sent to the museum this week were not returned. Abramovic is not named as a defendant and did not immediately return a request for comment.
The work, titled “Imponderabilia,” saw Bonafede and another performer standing face-to-face with each other in a doorway about 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) apart, fully nude, silent, and still. The exhibition, which ran from March 14, 2010 through May 31, 2010, was curated by the museum in a way that encouraged visitors to pass in between the performers as they went from one gallery to the next, the suit alleges.

The people who assaulted Bonafede were mostly older men, the suit says. One of the perpetrators was a corporate member of the museum, who was ultimately kicked out and revoked of his membership, according to the suit.
During the final weeks of the exhibition, another attendee non-consensually groped Bonafede’s private areas three times before they were finally stopped by security, the suit said.
Bonafede reported four of the individuals to the museum staff and security immediately, according to the suit, while the fifth was witnessed personally by the museum security staff.
At one point, Bonafede also witnessed a public attendee sexually assault his female co-performer by kissing her on the mouth without her consent, the suit said.
Prior to the exhibition, the performers had voiced their concerns about nude performers being subject to harassment in a letter to the museum during contract negotiations, the suit said.
Once it began, several news outlets including the New York Times reported on the inappropriate behavior by visitors, and the sexual assaults on “Imponderabilia” were discussed within New York City’s art and performance communities, the suit says.
But despite the museum having knowledge of the issue, it failed to take action to protect the performers and prevent further sexual assaults, such as telling visitors ahead of time that touching was not allowed. the lawsuit said.
About a month into the exhibition, the museum created a handbook outlining protocols for the performers to alert museum staff if they felt unsafe or were inappropriately touched.
Bonafede agreed to continue the performance after he was assaulted because of the “tough it out” culture of the exhibition, the suit says, but suffered for years from emotional distress, and his mental health, body image and career were damaged as a result.
The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Bonafede gave consent through his lawyer, Jordan Fletcher.
Fletcher declined to comment further on the suit, but said they will be seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.

RIR0KX4BZ2_KD1XRJ7WRAMH4C6,Heavy rains soak Texas and close schools as downpours continue drenching parts of the US,_,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/heavy-rain-flooding-texas-midwest-california-21506670c4f18bc35b234814194f7185,"HOUSTON (AP) — Heavy rains in Texas on Wednesday closed schools and elevated flooding risks around Houston in another round of soaking downpours that have made for a soggy and dangerous week across large portions of the U.S.
A stretch of wet and freezing winter weather has swept away vehicles in San Diego, led to high-water rescues in San Antonio and coated roads with ice in the Midwest. Rain was expected to continue pushing across the Gulf Coast on Thursday and Friday.
In San Antonio, a police vehicle on Wednesday was stuck on a heavily flooded access road to Interstate 35, with moving water reaching almost to the door handles. A police spokesman told KSAT television station that the officer was there to block traffic because of the rising waters, but ended up getting stuck. Police said the officer got safely out of the vehicle.
The morning downpours in Texas canceled classes in rural counties outside Austin, where some areas had received more than 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain within 48 hours. In Fayette County, the rain closed all local government offices and threatened to bring the Colorado River to minor flood stage.
Flood warnings were also in effect around Houston, snarling morning commutes.

Periods of showers and thunderstorms were expected in the area through Thursday morning, and the main concern is that the soil is already quite saturated, said National Weather Service meteorologist Cameron Self. Runoff from swollen rivers will also be a factor, he said.
“It’s just going to be one of those watch the radar kind of evenings and nights to see where those heavier showers and thunderstorms develop,” Self said Wednesday.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom this week declared a state of emergency for Ventura and San Diego counties, with the latter being hit by heavy rains and high surf that caused flooding. The rain had submerged streets and freeways, halted traffic, buses and trolleys, and caught many people off guard.
In Texas, Lake Conroe, located about 54 miles (90 kilometers) north of Houston, has been temporarily closed because of high lake levels. The San Jacinto River Authority said that after the heavy rainfall, many docks, bulkheads and small islands are submerged and that can be dangerous for boaters.
Residents of a subdivision of about 45 homes in Livingston, located about 70 miles (112 kilometers) miles north of Houston, were told to shelter in place after a road washed out Tuesday evening. By Wednesday afternoon officials had repaired the road enough that it was once again passable for residents, said Polk County Judge Sydney Murphy. The rains had caused severe road damage across the county, officials said."

(AP) — A federal appeals court has ordered the appointment of an independent examiner in the bankruptcy case of FTX amid concerns about widespread fraud preceding the collapse of the multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange.
A three-judge panel in Philadelphia issued the ruling Friday in an appeal filed by the U.S. bankruptcy trustee, who serves as a government watchdog in Chapter 11 reorganizations. Lawyers for the trustee had argued that FTX’s financial affairs and business operations, including allegations of unprecedented fraud leading to its collapse, should be reviewed by a disinterested person, not left to an internal investigation.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey denied the trustee’s request last February. He agreed with FTX and its official committee of unsecured creditors that an examiner’s work would be too costly and would duplicate investigations already under way by FTX’s new leadership, the creditors committee and several federal agencies. Dorsey also expressed confidence in John Ray III, who was appointed by FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried as the company’s new CEO on the same day the company sought bankruptcy protection.
Bankman-Fried is awaiting sentencing in March after being convicted in November on wire-fraud and conspiracy charges. Several other former FTX executives have pleaded guilty to similar charges. Prosecutors said Bankman-Fried siphoned billions of dollars from customer accounts at FTX into his cryptocurrency hedge fund, Alameda Research.
The appeals court reversed Dorsey’s ruling, agreeing with the trustee that the bankruptcy code mandates the appointment of an examiner.

“Sometimes highly complex cases give rise to straightforward issues on appeal,” Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo wrote for the panel. “Such is the case here.”
Restrepo also noted that an examiner is required to make his or her findings public, whereas a debtor or creditors committee conducting an internal investigation has no such obligation.
“The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its worldwide investors but also raised implications for the evolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry,” the judge wrote, noting that further scrutiny of FTX could alert potential investors to undisclosed credit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.
“In addition to providing much-needed elucidation, the investigation and examiner’s report ensure that the bankruptcy court will have the opportunity to consider the greater public interest when approving the FTX Group’s reorganization plan,” he added."
ROB9SCOWSQ_8U9PTMON99E6V9X,Antisemitic acts have risen sharply in Belgium and France since the Israel-Hamas war began,By SAMUEL PETREQUIN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/belgium-antisemitism-israel-hamas-war-holocaust-denial-5ff82ca75a001304fc1838bad023e0c7,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The number of antisemitic acts registered in France and Belgium rose sharply since Hamas’ attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, according to figures released Thursday in both countries.
In France, data from the Interior ministry and the Jewish Community Protection Service watchdog showed that 1,676 antisemitic acts were reported in 2023, compared to 436 the previous year.
According to the Council of Jewish Institutions in France — the country’s main Jewish interest group — the number of antisemitic acts in the three months that followed the Oct. 7 attack equaled those of the previous three years combined.
In neighboring Belgium, an independent public body fighting discrimination said it received 91 reports related to the Israel-Hamas conflict between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7 last year, compared to 57 reports for the whole of 2022.
Most of the reports were remarks or acts considered as antisemitic, including cases of Holocaust denial, the independent Unia said. In 66 cases, it was clear the target were Jewish.

Most of the cases involved hate messages, more than half of them online, but there were also comments made in public areas. Unia is also collaborating with the public prosecutor’s office and Belgian police in nine cases of assault and damage, it said.
The report cited cases of beatings, graffiti and the desecration of dozens of graves in the Jewish section of a cemetery close to the city of Charleroi.
“We can therefore speak of a clear increase in reports of anti-Semitic since October 7, 2023,” Unia said. It also received eight reports of discrimination or hate speech linked to the Palestinian origin, Arab origin or the Muslim belief of the people targeted between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7
Many European countries have registered a rise in reported antisemitic acts and comments since the outbreak of the war.
In Italy, antisemitic episodes last year hit unprecedented highs, with 216 incidents reported in the last three months of 2023, compared to 241 for all of the previous year.
The Antisemitism Observatory said 454 incidents were reported in Italy last year, the highest level ever reported in the country. They included violent clashes by anti-Israeli demonstrators trying to reach a trade-fair in the northern city of Vicenza on Saturday to protest the presence of an Israeli pavilion at the event.
Belgium has a Jewish population of about 29,000, according to the World Jewish Congress. Although most of the Jewish community in the capital, Brussels, is secular, the port city of Antwerp has a large ultra-Orthodox population and the largest Hasidic community in Europe.
In France, which has Europe’s largest Jewish and Muslim communities, the Council of Jewish Institutions in France said that 57.8% of anti-Semitic acts in 2023 were directed against individuals. They involved physical violence or threatening words and gestures. The group also noted “an explosion in the number of anti-Semitic acts in schools.”
“The perpetrators of anti-Semitic acts are getting younger. The school is no longer a sanctuary,” it said.
The Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 25,400 people have been killed and another 63,000 wounded in the enclave since the Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel in which militants from Gaza killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

RSRX3BQLK7_NVW1BXLMNE4MSJL,Washington state lawmakers consider ban on hog-tying by police following Manuel Ellis’ death,By HALLIE GOLDEN,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/washington-state-police-restraint-hog-tying-legislation-8d575c318367031496d5faa2ff34d028,"SEATTLE (AP) — Washington state lawmakers considered a proposal Monday to prohibit police from hog-tying suspects, nearly four years after Manuel Ellis, a 33-year-old Black man, died facedown with his hands and feet cuffed together behind him in a case that became a touchstone for racial justice demonstrators in the Pacific Northwest.
The restraint technique has long drawn concern due to the risk of suffocation, and while many cities and counties have banned the practice, it remains in use in others.
Monet Carter-Mixon, Ellis’ sister, described hog-tying as akin to what is done to animals before they are branded or when they are being prepared for slaughter.
“It’s inhumane for animals, so it should be inhumane to humans as well,” she said during the Senate committee hearing.
Democratic Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, who sponsored the bill, told The Associated Press she doesn’t want anyone else to experience the “dehumanization” Ellis faced before his death.

“How do we move through the need for folks to enforce the laws, but do it in a way where they’re treating people the way we expect, which is as human beings?” she said.
In the last four years, states across the U.S. have rushed to pass sweeping policing reforms, prompted by racial injustice protests and the death of George Floyd and others at the hands of law enforcement. Few have banned prone restraint, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California prohibited law enforcement in 2021 from using techniques that “involve a substantial risk of positional asphyxia,” in which the body’s position hinders the ability to breathe. That same year, Minnesota banned correctional officers from using prone restraint unless “deadly force is justified.”
The U.S. Department of Justice has recommended against the practice since at least 1995 to avoid deaths in custody, and many local jurisdictions bar it.
The attorney general’s office in Washington recommended against using hog-tying in its model use-of-force policy released in 2022. At least four local agencies continue to permit it, according to policies they submitted to the attorney general’s office that year.
The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department said it still allows hog-tying but declined to comment on the bill. One of the department’s deputies was involved in restraining Ellis, whose face was covered by a spit-hood when he died.
Ellis was walking home in March 2020 when he passed a patrol car with Tacoma police officers Matthew Collins and Christopher Burbank, who are white. Burbank and Collins said Ellis tried to get into a stranger’s car and then attacked the officers when they confronted him in the city about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Seattle.
Witnesses said the officers jumped out of their car as Ellis walked by and knocked him to the ground.
He was shocked and beaten. Officers wrapped a hobble restraint device around his legs and linked it to his handcuffs behind his back while he remained in the prone position, according to a probable cause statement filed by the Washington attorney general’s office.
After the hobble was applied, Ellis stopped moving, the statement said.
A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide caused by lack of oxygen. Collins, Burbank and a third officer, Timothy Rankine, were charged with murder or manslaughter. Defense attorneys argued Ellis’ death was caused by methamphetamine intoxication and a heart condition, and a jury acquitted them in December.
Jamika Scott, Tacoma city council member, testified Monday in favor of banning hog-tying, calling it an “inhumane practice.”
“This bends a body into a bow shape and as you can imagine this does not leave a lot of room for you to get oxygen into your lungs,” she said. “It makes it really hard.”
James McMahan, policy director at the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, asked the Legislature not to ban tactics needed in order for law enforcement to keep a person from hurting officers or themselves.
“We would suggest instead of banning this tactic entirely, the legislature facilitate the use of better alternatives,” he said. “We envision a grant program to acquire these alternatives, where grant recipients must agree to prohibit the use of hogties in their policies as a condition of receiving these funds.”
He did not specify which alternatives he was referencing, saying he didn’t want to promote a specific one.
Democratic Sen. John Lovick, who worked as a state trooper for more than 30 years, joined Trudeau in sponsoring the bill.
Republican Rep. Gina Mosbrucker, a member of the House public safety committee, said she looked forward to learning more about the legislation.
“If it does turn out that this form of restraint for combative detainees is dangerous in any way, then I think the state should put together a grant and some money to buy and train on alternative methods to make sure that the officer and the person arrested is safe,” she said.
The bill comes a few years after a wave of ambitious police reform legislation passed in the state in 2021.
The legislation included requirements that officers could use force only when they had probable cause to make an arrest or to prevent imminent injury, and required them to use appropriate de-escalation tactics if possible.
The following year, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee approved bills fixing some elements of that legislation, including making it clear officers may use force to help detain or transport people in behavioral health crises."
RVJBS6UKOT_0Z2C10MXQHO8JH4,"US warned Iran that ISIS-K was preparing attack ahead of deadly Kerman blasts, a US official says",By AAMER MADHANI,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/kerman-us-warning-isisk-bombings-bcb47f04165b3eb7b9bc7b4868c8399c,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government privately warned Iran that the Islamic State group’s affiliate in Afghanistan was preparing to carry out a terrorist attack before bombings in Kerman earlier this month that killed 95 people, a U.S. official said Thursday.
The official, who was not authorized to comment and insisted on anonymity to discuss the intelligence, said the U.S. was following its longstanding policy of a “duty to warn” other governments against potential lethal threats.
The official did not detail how the U.S., which does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, conveyed the warning about its intelligence on ISIS-Khorasan, known as ISIS-K, but noted that government officials “provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.”
Iranian state media did not acknowledge the U.S. giving Tehran the information, and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Jan. 3 attack on Kerman, about 820 kilometers (510 miles) southeast of Iran’s capital, Tehran. The dual suicide bombing killed at least 95 people and wounded dozens of others attending a commemoration for the late Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force, who had been killed in a 2020 U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

In the time since, Iran has been trying to blame the U.S. and Israel for the attack amid Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It has launched missile attacks on Iraq and Syria. It then launched strikes on nuclear-armed Pakistan, which responded with its own strikes on Iran, further raising tensions in a region inflamed by the Israel-Hamas war.
The Wall Street Journal was first to report that the U.S. had provided the warning to Iran.
ISIS-K was behind the August 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that left 13 U.S. troops and about 170 Afghans dead during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
ISIS-K has thousands of members and is the Taliban’s most bitter enemy and top military threat. The group has continued to carry out attacks in Afghanistan and beyond since the Taliban takeover.

RYZI5JIGI4_8UWKMAGOJQF8J8B,Donald Trump testifies for less than 3 minutes in defamation trial and is rebuked by judge,By JENNIFER PELTZ and JAKE OFFENHARTZ,_,20230125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/trump-carroll-defamation-lawsuit-trial-0f2618e7fa839ace26de76e1a6ce274f,"NEW YORK (AP) — He testified for under three minutes. But former President Donald Trump still broke a judge’s rules on what he could tell a jury about writer E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault and defamation allegations, and he left the courtroom Thursday bristling to the spectators: “This is not America.”
Testifying in his own defense in the defamation trial, Trump didn’t look at the jury during his short, heavily negotiated stint on the witness stand. Because of the complex legal context of the case, the judge limited his lawyers to asking a handful of short questions, each of which could be answered yes or no — such as whether he’d made his negative statements in response to an accusation and didn’t intend anyone to harm Carroll.
But Trump nudged past those limits.
“She said something that I considered to be a false accusation,” he said, later adding: “I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.”
After Judge Lewis A. Kaplan told jurors to disregard those remarks, Trump rolled his eyes as he stepped down from the witness stand. The former president and current Republican front-runner left the courtroom during a break soon after, shaking his head and declaring to spectators — three times — that “this is not America.”

Carroll looked on throughout from the plaintiff’s table. The longtime advice columnist alleges that Trump attacked her in 1996, then defamed her by calling her a liar when she went public with her story in a 2019 memoir.

While Trump has said a lot about her to the court of public opinion, Thursday marked the first time he has directly addressed a jury about her claims.
But jurors also heard parts of a 2022 deposition — a term for out-of-court questioning under oath — in which Trump vehemently denied Carroll’s allegations, calling her “sick” and a “whack job.” Trump told jurors Thursday that he stood by that deposition, “100%.”
Trump didn’t attend a related trial last spring, when a different jury found that he did sexually abuse Carroll and that some of his comments were defamatory, awarding her $5 million. This trial concerns only how much more he may have to pay her for certain remarks he made in 2019, while president. She’s seeking at least $10 million.
AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports.
Because of the prior jury’s findings, Kaplan said Trump now couldn’t offer any testimony “disputing or attempting to undermine” the sexual abuse allegations. The law doesn’t allow for “do-overs by disappointed litigants,” the judge said.
Even before taking the stand, Trump chafed at those limitations as the judge and lawyers for both sides discussed what he could be asked.
“I never met the woman. I don’t know who the woman is. I wasn’t at the trial,” he cut in from his seat at the defense table without jurors in the room. Kaplan told Trump he wasn’t allowed to interrupt the proceedings.
Trump was the last witness, and closing arguments are set for Friday.
Carroll, 80, claims Trump, 77, ruined her reputation after she publicly aired her account of a chance meeting that spiraled into a sexual assault in spring 1996. At the time, he was a prominent real estate developer, and she was an Elle magazine advice columnist who’d had a TV show.

She says they ran into each other at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury department store close to Trump Tower, bantered and ended up in a dressing room, teasing each other about trying on lingerie. She has testified that she thought it would just be a funny story to tell but then he roughly forced himself on her before she eventually fought him off and fled.
The earlier jury found that she was sexually abused but rejected her allegation that she was raped.
Besides Trump, his defense called only one other witness, a friend of Carroll’s. The friend, retired TV journalist Carol Martin, was among two people the writer told about her encounter with Trump shortly after it happened, according to testimony at the first trial.
Trump lawyer Alina Habba confronted Martin on Tuesday with text messages in which she called Carroll a “narcissist” who seemed to be reveling in the attention she got from accusing and suing Trump. Martin said she regretted her word choices and doesn’t believe that Carroll loved the attention she has been getting.
Carroll has testified that she has gotten death threats that worried her enough to buy bullets for a gun she inherited from her father, install an electronic fence, warn her neighbors and unleash her pit bull to roam freely on the property of her small cabin in the mountains of upstate New York.
Trump’s attorneys have tried to show the jury through their cross-examination of various witnesses that by taking on Trump, Carroll has gained a measure of fame and financial rewards that outweigh the threats and other venom slung at her through social media.
After Carroll’s lawyers rested Thursday, Habba asked for a directed verdict in Trump’s favor, saying Carroll’s side hadn’t proven its case. Kaplan denied the request.
Even before testifying, Trump had already tested the judge’s patience. After he complained to his lawyers last week about a “witch hunt” and a “con job” within earshot of jurors, Kaplan threatened to eject him from the courtroom if it happened again. “I would love it,” Trump said. Later that day, Trump told a news conference Kaplan was a “nasty judge” and that Carroll’s allegation was “a made-up, fabricated story.”
While attending the trial last week, Trump made it clear — through muttered comments and gestures like shaking his head — that he was disgusted with the case. When a video clip from a Trump campaign rally last week was shown in court Thursday, he appeared to lip-synch himself saying the trial was rigged.
The trial had been suspended since early Monday because of a juror’s illness. When it resumed Thursday, the judge said two jurors were being “socially distanced” from the others.
Trump attended the trial fresh off big victories in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday and the Iowa caucuses last week. Meanwhile, he also faces four criminal cases. He has been juggling court and campaign appearances, using both to argue that he’s being persecuted by Democrats terrified of his possible election.
The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done."
S070O6CXYT_BZLUSX2DA64503P,Here’s a look at the 6 things the UN is ordering Israel to do about its operation in Gaza,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/icj-ruling-israel-gaza-genocide-3fa0908d995cc104e8ab4674f5ee75cc,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — In one of its most closely-watched rulings since its creation in 1948, the United Nations’ top court issued a series of orders to Israel to protect Palestinians in Gaza to prevent genocide there.
Here is a look at the six so-called provisional measures, issued Friday by a panel of 17 judges at the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands. The decision was one step in a broader case that the court is considering about South Africa’s accusation that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation.
1. The court ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the U.N. convention on genocide. Referring to protecting Palestinian civilians, the court said Israel should work to prevent “killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.” Approved in a 15-2 vote.
2. The court ordered Israel to “ensure with immediate effect that its military does not commit any acts described in point 1 above.” Approved in a 15-2 vote.
3. The court said Israel “shall take all measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to members of the Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip.” Approved in a 16-1 vote.

4. Israel was ordered to “take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.” Approved in a 16-1 vote.
5. The court ordered Israel to “take effective measures to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence related to allegations of acts within the scope” of the relevant articles in the genocide convention. Approved in a 15-2 vote.
6. The court said Israel “shall submit a report to the court on all measures taken to give effect to this order within one month as from the date of this order.” Approved in a 15-2 vote.

The Northwest Territories Coroner’s Service did not say how many have died or give further details, saying it must first notify next of kin.
There was no word yet how many people were on board the plane, a British Aerospace Jetstream registered to Northwestern Air Lease, according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
The airline’s website says it has two of the planes in its fleet that can carry up to 19 passengers.
Mining company Rio Tinto said a number of its staff were on the plane headed to its Diavik Diamond Mine, 300 kilometers (about 180 miles) northeast of Yellowknife.

“As a company we are absolutely devastated by this news and offering our full support to our people and the community who are grieving today,” said a statement.
The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories said it has activated its mass casualty protocol after the morning crash.
The town of Fort Smith is about 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles) northeast of Vancouver, British Columbia near the border between Alberta and the Northwest Territories.
A representative for the company did not provide an immediate comment but confirmed it was a charter plane.
The safety board is sending investigators to the scene.
Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Trenton confirmed the military responded when the plane lost contact shortly after taking off near Fort Smith.
The Air Force, Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Rangers were all involved in the search-and-rescue, said David Lavallee, a public affairs officer with Search and Rescue Region Trenton.
Lavallee said a CC-130H Hercules aircraft travelled to the site from Calgary, Alberta and a CC-130J Hercules was sent from Trenton, Ont. A Twin Otter aircraft was sent from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.
“Canadian Rangers located the aircraft near the Slave River, and (search-and-rescue) … parachuted into the site,” said Lavallee."
S8M2BPZCW7_19D48YJ0AMFSKDG,"In Pennsylvania’s Senate race, McCormick elevates the Israel-Hamas war in a bid for Jewish voters",By MARC LEVY,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mccormick-casey-pennsylvania-senate-iran-israel-hamas-a94044b643d6b3b03e14c179dac3ad34,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A Republican running for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania is escalating criticism of Democrats over the Israel-Hamas war and has traveled to the Israel-Gaza border to make the case that the Biden administration hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.
The criticism by GOP candidate David McCormick reflects the delicate political challenge facing both President Joe Biden and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in a state Democrats can’t afford to lose in 2024.
Biden, who is seeking a second term as president, has been criticized from the left for being too pro-Israel in his response to its war on Hamas and for not doing enough to address the burgeoning humanitarian crisis among Palestinians in Gaza. Casey, meanwhile, has been a staunch Israel ally in Congress.
McCormick’s attacks echo those voiced on the GOP’s presidential campaign trail where candidates have portrayed Biden’s policy on Iran — a key financial backer of Hamas — as too weak to frighten what the U.S. calls the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.
McCormick said the U.S. should impose sanctions to cut off Iran’s oil sales and mount a more muscular response to attacks on U.S. targets in the Middle East to restore an order upended by what he called Biden administration mistakes going back to an incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan.

“The key to America’s role in the world is peace through strength,” McCormick said in an interview Thursday. “And so I think what we’re seeing is the failure of deterrence. I think what we’re seeing is a belief, across the world, among our adversaries, that America’s a little flat-footed. America’s weak.”
Neither Casey nor McCormick are likely to face serious opposition in Pennsylvania’s April 23 primary before facing off against each other in November’s general election.
McCormick’s focus on the issue comes as a barrage of U.S., coalition and militant attacks in the Middle East are compounding U.S. fears that Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza could expand.
The Biden administration’s support for Israel has been complicated politically in other states the president is counting on in his reelection bid. In Michigan, for example, Democrats worry that losing support among the state’s large Arab-American population over the war could damage their prospects. Michigan also has an open Senate seat on the ballot this year.
Pennsylvania and Michigan, along with Wisconsin, are indispensable parts of a “ blue wall ” of Rust Belt states that helped Biden defeat former President Donald Trump in 2020 after Trump won those states in 2016.
In the Senate, Democrats maintain a narrow majority, one that became more perilous late last year with the retirement of West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. That makes Casey’s seat even more pivotal to his party’s efforts to maintain control of the chamber.
McCormick’s effort to highlight his support for Israel is unique thus far in this year’s high-profile Senate contests, and it could become a test case for Republicans in fall general election contests.
McCormick hopes to peel off not only swing voters in Pennsylvania, but also members of the state’s relatively large Jewish community who vote predominantly Democratic — but could make a difference in a close election.
Even though the war has divided both Democrats and Jews, taking votes from Casey poses a formidable challenge. The incumbent senator is well-regarded by Pennsylvania’s Jewish community and has been a reliable ally in Congress for Israel and its fight against Hamas.
Vowing solidarity with Israel, McCormick took a two-day trip to Israel where he visited a kibbutz that was attacked by Hamas and met with government officials, hostage families and survivors of the Oct. 7 attacks.
McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO, told reporters that the fight against Hamas is between “the West versus evil.” He followed the trip with a media blitz and a letter to what his campaign said were tens of thousands of “persuadable” voters in Pennsylvania.
In the letter, McCormick quotes an orthodox rabbi known for his outreach to secular Jews and the Jewish scholar Hillel.
“Israel needs America’s firm and unequivocal support,” McCormick wrote. “Hamas must be destroyed. The lesson of October 7 is clear — the Middle East respects strength and that is why Israel must win. America’s mission must be to help Israel win. It’s that simple.”
McCormick did not mention Casey in the two-page letter. But he separately accused Casey and Biden of “appeasement” of Iran, going back to what he called the “original sin” of Casey’s support for the Iran nuclear deal under President Barack Obama in 2015 that critics say gave Iran the cash it needed to fund terror.
Casey countered that he has fought for years to back Israel in its fight against Hamas and that the Iran nuclear deal had been working — until Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement.
“That’s the type of reckless policy my opponent supports,” Casey said in a statement.
On policy, Casey’s and McCormick’s positions on Israel have a lot in common.
They both support military aid to Israel, backing Israel’s mission to destroy Hamas and putting aside allegations of Israeli war crimes, saying they are convinced Israel has gone to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.
Both have slammed the savagery of the Hamas attack, and accused it of using civilians as human shields. Arab nations that publicly criticize Israel’s counterattack on Gaza privately tell their Israeli, U.S. and European counterparts that they want Hamas gone, Casey said on CBS News’ podcast “The Takeout.”
“They’re all saying, ‘please take out Hamas,’” Casey said.
Casey has not joined some of his Democratic colleagues in calling for a ceasefire, putting conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel or criticizing Israel for a bombing campaign that the the Hamas-controlled government says has killed more than 24,000 Palestinians. He also has not echoed Biden administration unease over the scale of Israel’s military operation.
Casey, running for a fourth-term, is endorsed by the fundraising powerhouse, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and the former chairman of a Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Middle East has visited Israel six times over his 17-year Senate career.
In recent days and weeks, Casey visited a Jewish Community Center in Pittsburgh, attended the “March for Israel” on Washington’s National Mall and spoke at a synagogue in Philadelphia to denounce antisemitism.
For McCormick, foreign policy is a strength of his and a cornerstone of his campaign, something of a rarity in the current era. The decorated Army veteran held senior posts in the administration of President George W. Bush, including deputy national security adviser for international economic policy, and served on a defense policy board under Trump.
Republicans see Pennsylvania as a battleground state with a significant enough Jewish population — around 400,000, by their estimate — to swing an election decided by tens of thousands of votes.
For Jewish voters, Israel is not the only issue they care about, but it is a higher priority after the attack by Hamas, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Allentown.
Jewish voters typically vote overwhelmingly Democratic, and Democrats right now are trying to balance their interest in protecting Israel with that of younger voters, who have been sympathetic to Palestinians, he said.
“That’s something, of course, Democrats have to address in keeping their coalition together,” Borick said. “Jewish voters have been one of their most loyal supporter groups. Although not a gigantic segment of the population, it’s nonetheless crucial given the nature of tight elections in Pennsylvania.”

The rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernández, was ordered to pay a $510 deposit, undergo government counseling and meet with authorities every two months until they conclude their investigation into allegations that he assaulted his girlfriend, a Dominican rapper known as “Yailín.”
The judge, Fátima Veloz, also issued protection orders for both sides.
After the hearing, Tekashi 6ix9ine’s attorney, Waldo Pimentel, accused prosecutors of “fabricating” evidence against his client.
Meanwhile, prosecutor Ana Andrea Villa Camacho explained why she had requested that Tekashi 6ix9ine remain held.

“We know perfectly well why victims do not file a complaint, why victims recant,” she said.
It is the second time that Hernández is arrested in the Dominican Republic.
Authorities in the Caribbean country detained him in October after he was accused of assaulting a local music producer after he and his partner had been recording at his studio.
Hernández also was previously accused in the U.S. of using a violent gang as a “personal hit squad.” He avoided a lengthy prison sentenced by offering testimony against the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, which operate in the U.S. East Coast.
In March 2023, he was assaulted by several people at a gym in Florida.
Tekashi 6ix9ine had a multiplatinum hit song, “Fefe,” with Nicki Minaj in 2018. It hit No. 3 on the pop charts."
SHRDTU3G3J_NYRUQORSN0Q745G,US national security adviser will meet Chinese foreign minister as the rivals seek better ties,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-us-diplomacy-sullivan-wang-yi-bangkok-c887cc17ab26ad2f494219298a7450f2,"BANGKOK (AP) — Senior U.S. and Chinese representatives are expected to meet in the Thai capital as the two countries seek to cool tensions.
Officials from both sides said U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi would meet in Bangkok. The exact schedule for their talks was not announced, but both are scheduled to be in the city from Friday, where they’re meeting separately with Thai officials.
National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said their planned meeting “continues the commitment by both sides at the November 2023 Woodside Summit between President Biden and President Xi to maintain strategic communication and responsibly manage the relationship.”
That summit meeting was seen as an effort to patch up frayed relations due to quarrels over a range of economic and geopolitical issues.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin confirmed that Wang Yi plans to meet with Sullivan. Speaking at a news conference in Beijing, he said the Chinese foreign minister “will make clear China’s position on China-U.S. relations and the Taiwan issue, and exchange views with the U.S. on international and regional issues of mutual concern.”

An immediate issue of concern to both countries is tensions in the Red Sea that have upended global trade by forcing many shippers to avoid the Suez Canal.
China has been in “close communication with all parties concerned and making positive efforts to de-escalate” the conflict, during which Iran-backed Houthi rebels have attacked international ships with missiles, Wang Wenbin said Wednesday.
Washington has reportedly sought to have Beijing use its influence with Iran to address the attacks.
The meeting comes days after another senior Chinese diplomat traveled to North Korea.
Sullivan and Wang are separately holding bilateral talks with Thai officials, according to the U.S. and Chinese statements. Washington is contending with Beijing for influence with longtime U.S. ally Thailand, as Beijing has been flexing its diplomatic and economic muscle globally in recent years.
Sullivan, whose visit is scheduled to end Saturday, paid a courtesy call Friday on Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin and later held a bilateral meeting with Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara, the Thai foreign ministry said.
“During the discussions, both sides reiterated commitment to the long-standing treaty alliance between the two countries based on shared values of democracy, human rights, and human security,” said a Thai statement.
It said the talks also covered “ways to to further enhance partnership both at the bilateral and regional levels across diverse fields.” and discussion of regional and international crises in Myanmar, Ukraine and the Middle East.
The Thai foreign ministry announced that Wang Yi will meet with his counterpart on Saturday to sign an agreement exempting Thai nationals from requiring visas to visit China, and on Monday will meet with the prime minister."

SMCHBF9XPO_KFG16RC76LNMVRM,Israel vows to fight Hamas all the way to Gaza’s southern border. That’s fueling tension with Egypt,By SAMY MAGDY and MELANIE LIDMAN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-egypt-gaza-war-border-philadelphi-corridor-2b8c101ef0cb591552e264f11b1e99f8,"CAIRO (AP) — Israel faces a growing risk of damaging its peace with neighboring Egypt as its military pushes the offensive against Hamas further south in the Gaza Strip. Already, the two sides are in a dispute over a narrow strip of land between Egypt and Gaza.
Israeli leaders say that to complete their destruction of Hamas, they must eventually widen their offensive to Gaza’s southernmost town, Rafah, and take control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a tiny buffer zone on the border with Egypt that is demilitarized under the two countries’ 1979 peace accord.
In a news conference last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas continues to smuggle weapons under the border – a claim Egypt vehemently denies — and that the war cannot end “until we close this breach,” referring to the corridor.
That brought a sharp warning from Egypt that deploying Israeli troops in the zone, known in Egypt as the Salaheddin Corridor, will violate the peace deal.
“Any Israeli move in this direction will lead to a serious threat to Egyptian-Israeli relations,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said Monday.

Egypt fears that an Israeli attack on Rafah will push a massive wave of Palestinians fleeing across the border into its Sinai Peninsula.
More than 1 million Palestinians – nearly half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million — are crowded into Rafah and its surroundings on the border, most driven there after fleeing Israeli bombardment and ground offensives elsewhere in Gaza.
If Israeli troops assault Rafah, they have nowhere to flee. Palestinians have broken through before: In 2008, early in the blockade imposed on Gaza by Israel and Egypt after the Hamas takeover, Hamas blew open the border wall. Thousands of people stormed into Egypt.
Egypt told the Israelis that before any ground assault on Rafah, Israel must let Palestinians return to northern Gaza, a senior Egyptian military official involved in coordination between the two countries told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the internal discussions.
Israel says it has largely driven Hamas out of northern Gaza but is likely to resist allowing Palestinians back in the near term. Israel’s bombardment and ground assault have reduced much of the north to rubble, leaving many without homes.
The dispute puts Israel in a bind. If it stops its offensive without taking Rafah, it falls short on its top war goal of crushing Hamas. If its military pushes to the border, it risks undermining its peace deal with Egypt — a foundation of stability in the Mideast for decades — and upsetting its closest ally, the United States.
Israel and the U.S. are already divided over Gaza’s post-war future. The Israeli military is working to create an informal buffer zone about a kilometer (half a mile) wide inside Gaza along the border with Israel to prevent militants from attacking nearby communities. The U.S. says it opposes any attempt by Israel to shrink Gaza’s territory.

Israel vows to expunge the militants from the entire Gaza Strip and has done so by a strategy of systematic destruction, at a huge cost in civilian lives. Starting in north Gaza, it leveled large swaths of the urban landscape, saying it was eliminating Hamas tunnels and infrastructure while battling militants. It is working its way down the territory, doing the same in central Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis.
Netanyahu has said Israel intends to keep open-ended security control over Gaza to ensure Hamas cannot repeat its Oct. 7 attacks that triggered Israel’s assault. He has been vague on what form that would take but said ensuring control over the Philadelphi Corridor is crucial.
“There are a few options on how we can close it, we are checking all of them, and we haven’t made a decision, except for one thing: It must be closed,” he said.
Egypt warned Israel and the U.S. that any military operations in the zone “could tear apart our peace,” a second Egyptian official said. “We will not tolerate such a move.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.
The corridor is a narrow strip – about 100 meters (yards) wide in parts – running the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) length of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt. It includes the Rafah crossing into Egypt, Gaza’s sole outlet not controlled by Israel.
The corridor is part of a larger demilitarized zone along both sides of the entire Israel-Egypt border. Under the peace accord, each side is allowed to deploy only a tiny number of troops or border guards in the zone. At the time of the accord, Israeli troops controlled Gaza, until Israel withdrew its forces and settlers in 2005.
Hamas has had free rein of the border since its 2007 takeover.
Smuggling tunnels were dug under the Gaza-Egypt border to get around the Israeli-Egyptian blockade. Some of the tunnels were massive, large enough for vehicles. Hamas brought in weapons and supplies, and Gaza residents smuggled in commercial goods, from livestock to construction materials.
That changed over the past decade, as Egypt battled Islamic militants in the Sinai. The Egyptian military cracked down on the tunnels and destroyed hundreds of them, saying they were being used to funnel weapons into the Sinai. It bolstered its border wall above and below ground and cleared the population from a 5-kilometer-deep (3-mile) area adjacent to Gaza where only military and police forces are allowed.
During the fight against Sinai militants, Egypt negotiated with Israel and the U.S. to allow the deployment of its military in Zone C, as the demilitarized zone is known on its side of the border.
In mid-December, Israel made an official request to Egypt to deploy its forces in the Philadelphi corridor, the Egyptian military official said. Egypt rejected the request. Egypt’s main fear is that any ground operation in the area would result in thousands of Palestinians storming into Sinai, he said.
Since the war began, Egypt has pushed back hard against calls that it take in a mass exodus of Palestinians. It fears Israel won’t allow them to return to Gaza and says it doesn’t want to abet ethnic cleansing. It also warned that militants from Gaza could enter the Sinai with those fleeing, bringing the potential for cross-border exchanges with Israel that could wreck the peace accord.
Israel contends it must have control over the border to prevent weapons smuggling to Hamas.
Rashwan, of Egypt’s State Information Service, called Israeli claims of continued smuggling “lies” aimed at justifying a takeover of the corridor. After destroying 1,500 tunnels, Egypt has “complete control” over the border, he said.
Kobi Michael, senior researcher with Israeli think tanks Institute for National Security Studies and the Misgav Institute, said the quantity of Hamas weapons found during the offensive shows smuggling continues and Israel must have power to monitor the border.
“The only way such quantities of weapons could have reached the Gaza Strip are via the Philadelphi Corridor,” he said.
But Alon Ben-David, military affairs correspondent for Israel’s Channel 13 TV, said 90% of the weapons in Gaza were produced in Gaza and that Egypt’s crackdown largely shut down smuggling.
“The tunnels were really taken care of comprehensively by the Egyptians,” he said.

Early morning flooding hit the town of Guerneville, north of San Francisco, where a creek overflowed after more than 4 inches (10 cm) of rain fell in 24 hours. The local school district canceled classes for the day.
Later, the weather system unleashed a severe punch on the south end of the state in the second major rain event of the winter.
Floodwaters swept away vehicles and caused cars to pile on top of each other in parts of San Diego. Several feet of water inundated the Mountain View, Shelltown and Southcrest neighborhoods, and multiple highways including Interstate 15.
Eddie Ochoa, a resident of San Diego, said it was just sprinkling when he and his sister went out for breakfast Monday morning. When they returned to their family-owned auto body shop, the entire block was flooded and his sister’s parked car had been washed away.

“All that happened within an hour,” Ochoa said, guessing that the sewers had backed up. They later found his sister’s car about three miles (4.8 kilometers) down the street.
“It’s never been that bad, ever. It’s crazy,” he said.
Over a three-hour period, a whopping 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain fell at nearby National City, while 2 inches (5 cm) fell at San Diego International Airport, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. During the winter, the region typically averages around 2 inches of rain per month.
Deputies pulled people to safety after water rushed into homes in the Spring Valley and Casa de Oro neighborhoods, said San Diego County Sheriff’s Lt. Zee Sanchez. Other residents escaped by wading through waist-high water carrying their cats and dogs.

“Flooding is pretty widespread out there,” Sanchez said. The department aided in a swift-water rescue near Santee, he said. No injuries were reported.
The San Diego River was flooding, the National Weather Service said, warning that crossing roads would be unsafe. The city fire department said it had rescued at least 24 people from the rushing San Diego and Tijuana rivers.
San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria declared a state of emergency and the city set up shelters to house displaced residents.
The Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management issued an evacuation warning near Topanga Canyon effective through Tuesday morning due to possible mud or debris flow.
Up north, there’s an avalanche warning through Tuesday morning for the backcountry in the mountains around the Lake Tahoe area, which might see more than a foot (30 centimeters) of snow, according to The Sierra Avalanche Center in Truckee, California. The storm is expected to bring up to 8 inches (20 cm) of snow to the lake’s shores and up to 14 inches (35 cm) with winds gusting up to 60 mph (95 kph) in the highest elevations beginning late Monday.

In San Antonio, Texas, firefighters investigated whether five homeless people might have been swept away by rushing waters early Monday morning, according to fire department spokesperson Woody Woodward. They were camping in drainage tunnels next to a highway north of downtown, officials said.
Firefighters searched multiple locations, including drainage tunnels with the help of a boat, but did not find anyone.
“No individuals were found, so I cannot confirm if there were in fact five people swept away,” Woodward said, adding that the fire department had conducted 25 water rescue missions or investigation calls from late Sunday night through 8 a.m. Monday with no injuries being reported.

Some parts of the San Antonio area had received up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) of rain since Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service. Rainfall was also soaking Houston, Dallas, as well as various parts of north and east Texas.
In other parts of the country, as in Arkansas, there’s freezing rain. Forecasters warned that up to a half-inch (1.27 centimeters) of ice could coat parts of the state by Monday evening. That prompted an ice storm warning that includes much of the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas and the cities of Fayetteville and Fort Smith. A small part of northeastern Oklahoma was also under an ice storm warning Monday, the National Weather Service said.
The ice — combined with winds of up to 20 mph (32 kph) — could lead to power outages, the agency said.
Days of subfreezing temperatures have caused water problems in multiple Arkansas cities and in Memphis, Tennessee, due to broken pipes and equipment.
Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers responded to more than 400 crashes and at least 600 stranded motorists by 3:30 p.m. Monday, Capt. John Hotz of the patrol said. Three of the accidents were fatal, including one involving a vehicle that struck a Missouri Department of Transportation truck in rural northern Missouri. A transportation department spokeswoman said the truck driver was not hurt. Portions of interstates 70 and 44 were closed at the height of the icing, with officials describing the roadways as sheets of ice.
“Just lots of slide-offs,” said Dallas Thompson, a St. Louis-area trooper.
Around the country, the wintry weather and heavy rainfall was expected to continue this week.

Freezing rain and some snowfall was predicted for parts of the Midwest, the lower Great Lakes area and the Northeast, the National Weather Service said.
Parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and the Gulf Coast were predicted to have heavy showers and thunderstorms from Tuesday through Thursday, with some areas getting as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.

The issue began around 11 a.m. EST and grew rapidly in scope, according to outage tracker DownDetector. Users complained of an inability to access the service, delays in sending and receiving messages, and issues displaying graphics.
Microsoft said in messages on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, that it identified “a networking issue impacting a portion of the Teams service” and had moved some services to backup systems. At roughly 1:30 p.m. EST, the company reported that the backup transition was complete for Europe, Africa and the Middle East and that its tracking systems were showing improvements.
The company said backup switchovers for North and South America were ongoing. Outage reports on DownDetector fell to almost half their peak level as of 3 p.m. EST but subsequently leveled off, indicating continued issues.
Teams is a messaging and videoconferencing app with over 320 million monthly average users as of September 2023.

X users based in the U.S. continued to complain about Teams service issues, with several sarcastically thanking Microsoft for fixing the problem quickly in regions where the workday is already over. In a subsequent tweet, Microsoft acknowledged that its backup switchover “did not provide immediate relief to all end users in North and South America regions” but said its other attempts at mitigation aimed to “reduce customer impact as quickly as possible.”
Microsoft’s public tweets on the subject have pointed to additional detail available in a document posted in an administrative dashboard for Microsoft 365 software. When asked about that document, a Microsoft spokesperson at the public relations firm WE Communications said the company’s X posts were the only information it would share on the subject.
But Microsoft offered a somewhat bleaker outlook to its customers in that document, which was obtained by The Associated Press. The document detailed roughly a dozen different issues caused by the outage, including inability to log into the service, missing or delayed messages, and inability to access or view images, video, audio recordings and other media. In an update at 4:26 p.m. EST, the company said its efforts to route around problems had led to issues with backend parts of its system that effectively “throttled” data traffic.
At 5:02 p.m. EST, Microsoft also acknowledged that “many customers remain impacted by this issue” but said the company is seeing “a reduction in errors and an increase in (service) availability.” The company has also said was working to address specific failures of Teams functions in parallel with its broader network efforts.
According to DownDetector, reported issues with Teams continued to decline and were close to normal levels as of 7:45 p.m. EST."
T0MULJA11M_1WLWREXO9VA79T0,Judge says Canada’s use of Emergencies Act to quell truckers’ protests over COVID was unreasonable,By ROB GILLIES,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/canada-truck-protests-trudeau-court-covid-d7e6640f817ee12410bb99840a3df41b,"TORONTO (AP) — A Canadian judge has ruled that the government’s use of the Emergencies Act to quell weeks of protests by truckers and others angry over COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 was unreasonable and unconstitutional.
Up to thousands of protesters clogged the streets of the capital of Ottawa and besieged Parliament Hill, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government.
The act allowed authorities to declare certain areas as no-go zones. It also allowed police to freeze truckers’ personal and corporate bank accounts and compel tow truck companies to haul away vehicles.
Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest. Police arrested 11 people at the blockaded crossing at Coutts, Alberta, opposite Montana, after learning of a cache of guns and ammunition.
In the decision released Tuesday, Federal Court Justice Richard Mosley said the invocation of the Emergencies Act led to the infringement of constitutional rights.

“I conclude that there was no national emergency justifying the invocation of the Emergencies Act and the decision to do so was therefore unreasonable,” Mosley wrote.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government will appeal. Freeland said it was a hard decision to invoke the act but called the protests a serious threat to public safety, national security and Canada’s economic security.
“I don’t want to minimize the gravity of the actions we took. Neither do I want to minimize the gravity of the threats Canada faced,” Freeland said.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and several other groups and individuals argued in court that Ottawa ushered in the emergency measures without sound grounds.
The government contended the steps it took were targeted, proportional, time-limited and compliant with Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
A public commission led by another judge previously concluded most of the emergency measures were appropriate.
The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.
The Freedom Convoy shook Canada’s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was blocked. It sees more than 25% of trade between the countries."

The Netherlands has long wrestled with the legacy of the massacre, Europe’s only acknowledged genocide since the Holocaust. Dutch troops served as U.N. peacekeepers in the town during war in the Balkans but were overrun by Bosnian Serb forces who went on to kill more than 8,000 Bosniak — mostly Muslim — men and boys.
Victims’ remains are still being unearthed from mass graves and identified.
Rutte on Tuesday will join European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic for discussions about Bosnia’s bid to join the European Union.
Bosnia remains ethnically divided and politically unstable long after the end of the 1992-95 war that killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions.
In 2002, then-Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok resigned after a report harshly criticized Dutch authorities for sending soldiers into a danger zone without a proper mandate or the weapons needed to protect about 30,000 refugees who had fled to the Dutch base in eastern Bosnia.
In 2019, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that the Netherlands was partially liable in the deaths of about 350 Muslim men killed by Bosnian Serb forces during the massacre.
In Srebrenica, Rutte laid a wreath at the memorial site. He was accompanied by a delegation from the Mothers of Srebrenica group that represents survivors whose family members were killed."
TC8EB8QZ2B_SJIJLPRJYDM88O4,Chinese vice foreign minister visits North Korea in latest diplomacy between countries,By JIWON SONG,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-china-sun-weidong-3865d9b48657d9b1bbaa35adaf28d1dd,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Friday it was hosting a visit by a Chinese government delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, as it continues its efforts to strengthen ties with Beijing and Moscow in the face of deepening confrontations with Washington.
The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Sun’s delegation arrived in the capital, Pyongyang, on Thursday after crossing the land border between the countries. The report didn’t provide further details about the visit.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been trying to boost the visibility of its partnership with China and Russia as he tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his regional footing by joining a united front against the United States.
Kim traveled to Russia’s Far East in September for a rare summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and some experts say he is also likely seeking a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
While Kim has prioritized his ties with Russia, which has raised concerns about an arms cooperation that would help fuel Putin’s war on Ukraine, the North Korean leader has also invited senior Chinese officials to major state events in recent months while vowing to strengthen bilateral relations.

A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong attended the celebrations for North Korea’s 75th founding anniversary last September, shortly before Kim’s trip to Russia. In July, Kim invited Chinese ruling party official Li Hongzhong and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a major military parade in Pyongyang, where he rolled out his most powerful, potentially nuclear-capable missiles targeting the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Sun met with North Korean Vice Foreign Minster Pak Myong Ho last month in Beijing where they discussed strengthening bilateral ties and coordinating over unspecified “issues of common interest.” Pak then also met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, as they pledged to expand friendly exchanges and strengthening “strategic cooperation” in 2024, as the countries mark their 75th anniversary of establishing bilateral ties.
Sun’s visit to North Korea comes as U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan was planning talks with Wang in Bangkok this week in the latest high-level talks between Washington and Beijing amid tensions over trade, technology and China’s assertive foreign policy in the region.
As North Korea’s major ally and economic lifeline, China is a crucial partner for Kim’s efforts to revive an economy crippled by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons and missile program, which he has aggressively expanded in recent years despite limited resources.
As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, both China and Russia have been thwarting U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on the North over its intensified weapons testing activity in recent months, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Washington and Seoul have been urging Beijing to use its economic leverage on North Korea to help persuade Kim’s government to return to nuclear disarmament negotiations, which have stalled since 2019.
Experts say trade activities between North Korea and China are gradually expanding since North Korea eased its pandemic restrictions and reopened the border last year.

The farmers’ spreading movement for better remuneration for their produce, less red tape and lower costs, as well as protection against cheap imports is increasingly becoming a major crisis for the government. It echoes the 2018-2019 yellow vest demonstrations against economic injustice that rocked the first term of President Emmanuel Macron and lastingly dented his popularity.
This time, Macron’s new Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, his mettle being sorely tested just two weeks into the job, is hoping to assuage and win over demonstrating farmers with a series of measures he announced during a visit to a cattle farm in southern France on Friday afternoon. They include “drastically simplifying” certain technical procedures “starting today.” Some of the measures will reduce 14 rules to one, Attal said.
In another move to placate farmers, he announced the progressive end to diesel fuel taxes for farm vehicles.
The prime minister, wearing a suit and tie and reading from notes that rested on a bale of hay, said the government has decided “to put agriculture above all,” words he repeated numerous times. In an apparent nod to the far right, he said the “marching order” is “to protect our heritage and identity” because French agriculture defines “who we are.”

“We have to open a new chapter, change the mentality ... firstly that of the state,” he said, before heading to one of the first farmers’ blockades for a first-hand encounter with the anger.
Ranged against the government has been the well-organized and media-savvy movement by determined farmers. Using their tractors and sometimes hay bales as barriers, they’ve been blocking and slowing traffic on major roads. They’ve also dumped stinky agricultural waste at the gates of government offices.
Highway operator Vinci Autoroutes said two highways that are usually busy thoroughfares for road traffic through southern France and into Spain, the A7 and A9, were closed Friday morning by farmers’ blockades for long stretches totaling nearly 400 kilometers (250 miles). Blockades also severed more than a dozen other highways, Vinci said. Tractors also blocked some major roads leading toward Paris.
Farmer Nicolas Gallepin, who took part in a demonstration in his tractor at a traffic circle south of Paris this week, said thickets of regulations that govern how food can be produced are swallowing up chunks of his time and that fuel costs are eating into his bottom line.
“We’ve seen, in the last 10 years, one good year in 2022, but that’s it. We’ve not been paid what we deserve in 10 years,” he said. “What really hurts us is competing imports from other countries that don’t comply with the same regulations.”
The yellow vest protests held France in their grip for months, starting among provincial workers camped out at traffic circles to protest fuel taxes and subsequently snowballing into a nationwide challenge to Macron’s government. Likewise, farmers initially vented their anger more modestly, turning road signs upside down to protest what they argue are nonsensical agricultural policies.
But their grievances were largely unheard before they started to grab headlines in recent weeks with traffic blockades and other protests.
More widely, the unrest in France is are also symptomatic of discontent in agricultural heartlands across the European Union. The influential and heavily subsidized sector is becoming a hot-button issue ahead of European Parliament elections in June. Populist and far-right parties are hoping to make hay from rural disgruntlement against free trade agreements, burdensome costs worsened by Russia’s war in Ukraine and other complaints.

TXK1JA0FC3_8RH7E93OI5W69YM,US hits Iraq militia sites and anti-ship missiles in Yemen as fight with Iranian proxies intensifies,By TARA COPP and LOLITA C. BALDOR,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/iraq-us-strikes-target-iran-militia-41a0435545bb620d806c1fbbe9bf1519,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military struck three facilities in Iraq and two anti-ship missiles in Yemen operated by Iranian-backed militias that have attacked U.S. personnel and ships in the region as the United States tries to keep the Israel-Hamas war from spilling over into a wider conflict.
Both the strikes in Iraq and Yemen late on Tuesday targeted sites that the U.S. has said are involved in the attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria and were threatening U.S. military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the strikes in Iraq were at the direction of President Joe Biden and targeted facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq.
“These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against U.S. and Coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias,” Austin said. Those strikes hit militia facilities in Jurf al-Sakhar, which is south of Baghdad, al-Qaim and another unnamed site in western Iraq, two U.S. officials said.
Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said the strikes “blatantly violate Iraq’s sovereignty” and contribute to an “irresponsible escalation,” according to a statement from his office. The statement, signed by military spokesman Yahya Rasool, said Iraq considers the strikes “hostile acts” and is taking measures to protect the lives of Iraqis.

The Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, a coalition of armed mostly Shiite groups only nominally under Iraqi military authority, said the strike near the Syrian border killed one of its fighters and wounded two, while the strike south of Baghdad caused material damage.
AP correspondent Ben Thomas reports.
The U.S. Central Command announced it had also struck two anti-ship missiles belonging to the Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels that were being prepared for launch and were aimed at the southern part of the Red Sea.
“U.S. forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region,” Central Command said.
Both fronts — land attacks in Iraq and Syria, and sea attacks originating from Yemen — have seen a significant uptick in launches and counterstrikes over the last few days.
The U.S. strikes on the Kataib Hezbollah sites in Iraq came hours after the U.S. said militiamen fired two one-way attack drones at al-Asad Air Base, injuring U.S. service members and damaging infrastructure. And they followed the militia’s most serious attack this year on the air base, when it launched multiple ballistic missiles on Saturday.
U.S. Central Command said it targeted Kataib Hezbollah headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack drone capabilities.
In the drone attacks against al-Asad earlier Tuesday, U.S. defenses were able to intercept the first drone but it crashed on base while the second drone hit the base, U.S. officials said. Injuries, including traumatic brain injuries and smoke inhalation, were reported to be minor. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not been announced publicly.
The strikes on the Houthi missile launch sites in Yemen followed a joint operation on Monday night where the U.S. and Britain used warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets to take out Houthi missile storage sites, drones and launchers.
On both fronts, the Iranian-backed militias have employed ballistic missiles to target U.S. bases and ships, which marks an escalation, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who specializes in Iran.
The militias have typically used drones and rockets to attack. Tehran supplied Shiite militias in Iraq with short-range and close-range ballistic missiles in 2019, Taleblu said, but they had not been used until November’s attacks.
During Saturday’s larger-scale attack, multiple ballistic missiles and rockets launched by Iranian-backed militias targeted al-Asad, but most were intercepted by air defense systems there, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday. She said other munitions hit the base.
Al-Asad is a large air base in western Iraq where U.S. troops have trained Iraqi security forces and now coordinate operations to counter the militant Islamic State group.
Singh said Saturday’s attack was a “barrage” — the first time since Nov. 20 that Iranian proxy forces in Iraq had fired ballistic missiles at U.S. bases there.
A coalition of militias calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq has taken credit for a number of the attacks on U.S. forces. Kataib Hezbollah is one of the groups within that umbrella organization.
Iran has also supplied the Houthis with ballistic missiles, and that group is the first Iranian proxy to fire medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles, Taleblu said. “With Yemen, think of it as an intensification of the problem.”
Saturday’s ballistic missile attack on al-Asad injured four U.S. service members, all of whom have returned to duty. One member of the Iraqi security forces was also injured.
Since the Israel-Hamas war began in early October, there have been more than 151 attacks on U.S. facilities in Syria and Iraq. According to the Pentagon, two attacks took place on Monday and included multiple rockets fired at U.S. and coalition troops at Mission Support Site Euphrates in Syria and a single rocket fired at the Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria. Neither attack resulted in casualties or damage.
The U.S. struck back at the militia groups late last month, ordering a round of retaliatory strikes after three U.S. service members were injured in a drone attack in northern Iraq. Kataib Hezbollah claimed credit for the attack, carried out by a one-way attack drone.
The U.S., in response, hit three sites, destroying facilities and likely killing a number of the militia, the White House said at the time."
U3DBRFYZE0_X7YX7P1HRRWA3VR,"Annual count of homeless residents begins in Los Angeles, where tens of thousands live on streets",By CHRISTOPHER WEBER,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-homeless-count-d68f6ef1599485ec876133bdd953b175,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles County’s annual count of homeless residents began Tuesday night — a crucial part of the region’s efforts to confront the crisis of tens of thousands of people living on the streets.
Up to 6,000 volunteers with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority fanned out for the effort’s main component, the unsheltered street tally.
The so-called “point-in-time” count will take place over three days and aims to estimate how many people are unhoused and what services they may require, such as mental health or drug addiction treatment.
LA County’s undertaking is the largest among similar tallies in major cities nationwide. The tally, which also makes use of demographic surveys and shelter counts, is mandated by the federal government for cities to receive certain kinds of funding.
The AP’s Donna Warder reports on the Los Angeles homeless count.

The count this year comes amid increasing public outrage over the perceived failure — despite costly efforts — to reduce the surging population of people living in cars, tents and makeshift street shelters.
The 2023 effort reported more than 75,500 people were homeless on any given night in LA County, a 9% rise from a year earlier. About 46,200 were within the city of Los Angeles, where public frustration has grown as tents have proliferated on sidewalks and in parks and other locations.
Since 2015, homelessness has increased by 70% in the county and 80% in the city.
Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, joined city and county officials to kick off the count Tuesday night in the North Hollywood neighborhood of LA’s San Fernando Valley.
The count “is an important tool to confront the homelessness crisis,” Bass said in a statement. “Homelessness is an emergency, and it will take all of us working together to confront this emergency.”
On her first day in office in Dec. 2022, Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness. One year into her term, the mayor, a Democrat, announced that over 21,000 unhoused people were moved into leased hotels or other temporary shelter during 2023, a 28% increase from the prior year. Dozens of drug-plagued street encampments were cleared, and housing projects are in the pipeline, she said last month.
City Hall, the City Council and the LA County Board of Supervisors have said they intend to work together to tackle the crisis. Progress hasn’t always been apparent despite billions spent on programs to curb homelessness.
Homelessness remains hugely visible throughout California with people living in tents and cars and sleeping outdoors on sidewalks and under highway overpasses.
The results of the LA County homeless count are expected to be released in late spring or early summer."
U98OMSOZTX_LF3O15QP5Q668O4,Canada is preparing for a second Trump presidency. Trudeau says Trump ‘represents uncertainty’,By ROB GILLIES,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/canada-donald-trump-trudeau-trade-us-election-455da2048521f53acf3b857122e6d8de,"TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s government is preparing for the possibility that Donald Trump could reach the White House again and the “uncertainty” that would bring, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday.
Speaking at a Cabinet retreat, Trudeau said that Trump “represents uncertainty. We don’t know exactly what he is going to do.” He said that his government was able to manage Trump previously by showing that Canada and the U.S. can create economic growth on both sides of the border.
Trump is eyeing a win in New Hampshire’s Republican primary on Tuesday, which would be his second straight victory in his quest for the 2024 GOP nomination after a commanding triumph in Iowa.
Trudeau’s Cabinet has been discussing the Nov. 5 presidential election at its retreat in Montreal.
“We made it through the challenges represented by the Trump administration seven years ago, for four years, where we put forward the fact that Canada and the U.S. do best when we do it together,” Trudeau said.

Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, and a panel of experts were briefing the Cabinet to prepare a strategy. Trudeau said that his industry and trade ministers will lead the “Team Canada approach” with the business community.
Trump as president called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest” and attacked Canada’s vital trade. He threatened tariffs on cars and imposed them on steel. The unprecedented tone against one of Washington’s closest allies left a bitter taste, and most Canadians were relieved that Trump was defeated in 2020.
“Whether it was his attacks on farmers across Canada, whether it was his attacks on steel and aluminum workers, or whether it was his determination to tear up the free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, we were able to stand strong and renegotiate NAFTA,” Trudeau said. “That was difficult.”
Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and Trump’s move to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement and call for the imposition of a 25% tariff on the auto sector posed an existential threat. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.
The two countries, along with Mexico, eventually reached a revised agreement.
“What works with all American presidents is to demonstrate what is good for Canada is also is good for the United States and vice versa,” Trudeau said.
Trade between the U.S. and Canada totaled an estimated 1.2 trillion Canadian dollars ($890 billion) in 2022. Each day, about 400,000 people cross the world’s longest international border, and about 800,000 Canadians live in the U.S.
There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.
“Our integrated supply chains support millions of jobs,” François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, told reporters. “If there was one thing that President Trump understood, it’s jobs.”
Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trump’s mercurial style and unpredictable statements certainly would give Canadian officials headaches again.
“Unpredictable is not a word we want to utter in relationship to trade policy, which should be about fostering stability and predictability,” Béland said.
Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said the Trudeau government is anxious about the prospect of another Trump presidency.
“While Trump is unlikely to rip up the slightly revised NAFTA agreement that his government negotiated, a more protectionist U.S. government would be a major threat to the Canadian economy because two-thirds of Canada’s trade is with the U.S.,” Wiseman said.
“The impact would be greater on Canada than on any other country with the possible exception of Mexico,” Wiseman said.
This version corrects the date of the U.S. election."
UAXMGXRMUU_QCSQE8YQ68RR3LD,Trial starts in Amsterdam for 9 suspects in the 2021 slaying of a Dutch investigative journalist,By MIKE CORDER,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/amsterdam-journalist-shooting-trial-vries-8c4fcec73e1db1df64e27a5c813ee235,"AMSTERDAM (AP) — Suspects accused of involvement in the fatal 2021 shooting in Amsterdam of prominent Dutch investigative reporter Peter R. de Vries repeatedly refused to answer questions from judges and lawyers as their trial opened Tuesday with judges showing video of the attack and the fatally wounded journalist.
Among the nine suspects is Delano G., who is accused of gunning down De Vries in broad daylight on July 6, 2021. Under Dutch privacy law, suspects are identified only by their first name and the first initial of their family name.
De Vries, a popular reporter and television presenter, died nine days later of his injuries, at age 64.
His slaying sent shock waves through the Netherlands and triggered an outpouring of grief. Dutch King Willem-Alexander called it “an attack on journalism, the cornerstone of our constitutional state and therefore also an attack on the rule of law.”
His son and daughter, Royce and Kelly de Vries, were in court Tuesday to watch the proceedings.

They looked away as a video was shown of their father laying on a street in Amsterdam after he was shot. Other videos showed de Vries being followed before the shooting.
The judge also read out text messages police allege were sent between suspects before and after the shooting.
One of the messages asked how many times de Vries was shot. A response read: “Four or five times. He’s asleep, don’t worry.”
Prosecutors allege that two of the people standing trial were involved in filming the stricken journalist and posting the images online to amplify the shock caused by the shooting.
De Vries had been an adviser and confidant for a protected witness in the trial of the alleged leader and other members of a crime gang that police described as an “oiled killing machine.” The brother and lawyer of the witness were also murdered. A verdict in that trial had been planned for next month, but further hearings will likely delay it. The key defendant is alleged gangster Ridouan Taghi, once one of the Netherlands’ most-wanted fugitives until his 2019 arrest in Dubai.
Prosecutors have not charged anybody with directing de Vries’ killing.
“The fact that the person who ordered the killing is not known and is not on trial here naturally hangs like a shadow over this trial,” Annemiek van Spanje, a lawyer for the family, told The Associated Press.
The trial opened Tuesday in a packed, heavily guarded courtroom on the edge of Amsterdam, with armed police in body armor and ski masks patrolling the streets outside as cars carrying the suspects swept into the court’s underground parking lot.
Some of the defendants denied any involvement in the assassination while others asserted their right to remain silent. One after another, they took an oath to tell the truth in court before refusing to answer questions.
The alleged shooter was arrested less than an hour after the attack, along with a Polish national identified as Kamil E. who was the alleged getaway driver. Prosecutors told judges at Amsterdam District Court that the weapon used to shoot de Vries was found in their car.
The two suspects went on trial in 2022 and prosecutors demanded life sentences. However, the court never delivered verdicts because prosecutors introduced new evidence late in the case, following a string of arrests. The pair are now on trial along with seven other suspects arrested in the weeks and months after the slaying, all accused of involvement in planning and execution of the shooting.
The trial is scheduled to run until the end of February. Verdicts will likely be announced weeks later."
UJHXCSKE4I_KFMV2KQV0R8CQSR,Move to repeal new Virginia law on organized retail theft blocked for this year,By DENISE LAVOIE,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/retail-theft-virginia-law-repeal-d0bd556e030996ada00fcb1bbe40145c,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A move to repeal a new Virginia law that makes organized retail theft a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison was defeated for this year after members of a House subcommittee voted Monday to send the bill to the Virginia State Crime Commission for further study.
The new law, which went into effect in July, was passed by the state legislature last year with bipartisan support, including from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and state Attorney General Jason Miyares. It makes it a Class 3 felony for anyone to conspire or act in concert with one or more people to steal retail merchandise with a value exceeding $5,000 in a 90-day period, with the intent to sell the stolen goods for profit.
The Virginia law was passed at a time when viral videos on social media showed groups of thieves brazenly stealing bags of merchandise from stores around the country. The National Conference of State Legislatures said then that at least two dozen states had enacted laws to address organized retail theft.
Some Democrats and criminal justice advocates opposed the bill, arguing that it could ensnare people who resort to stealing to survive, including low-income people, the homeless and those struggling with addiction.
Brad Haywood, a public defender who founded Justice Forward Virginia, a group that advocates for criminal justice reform, said then that claims that retail theft has reached crisis levels in recent years have been exaggerated. Last month, the nation’s largest retail trade group pulled back on a claim that organized retail crime accounted for nearly half of the $94.51 billion in so-called industry shrink, which measures overall loss in inventory, including theft. It’s unclear how much money retailers broadly are losing due to organized retail crime or if the problem has worsened in recent years.

Haywood, who supported the repeal effort, said he wishes the bill would have received a full hearing but said he plans to push again next year for repeal.
“I think we lost an opportunity to essentially demand better from people trying to exploit the fear in criminal justice,” he said.
Del. Fernando “Marty” Martinez, the lead sponsor of the bill, said he asked for the repeal bill to be sent to the crime commission because the new law has only been in effect for six months and its effectiveness is not yet clear.
“I would like more data on whether the bill is working. I would like more data on why is it a class (3) felony,” Martinez said."
UNL77MFCR7_YLGRQI56UQ61QFT,Ukrainians worry after plane crash that POW exchanges with Russia will end,By HANNA ARHIROVA,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-pows-plane-crash-prisoner-exchanges-93799d66f85a09ed7b7931ffb314abeb,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — As Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over this week’s crash of a Russian military transport plane, one thing is clear: families’ fears that future prisoner exchanges may be in danger and loved ones could stay imprisoned.
Even the basic facts are being debated. Russian officials accused Kyiv of shooting down the plane Wednesday and claimed that 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war were on board as they headed for a prisoner swap. The Ukrainian side said it had no evidence of POWs and that Russia is just playing with Ukrainians’ psyche. It did say, however, that an exchange had been due to take place on Wednesday.
Neither side provided evidence for their accusations, leaving the relatives and loved ones in vulnerable states with no answers. Many Ukrainians were already in distress before the incident and had heard nothing from their loved ones in captivity for months.
Yevheniia Synelnyk’s brother has been in captivity for over a year and a half. She cried and worried through Wednesday as conflicting items appeared on the news.
“You don’t understand which of these is true,” she said.

The next day, exhaustion set in.
“There is no strength left to shed tears,” she said in a tired voice.
Synelnyk is also a representative of the Association of Azovstal Defenders’ Families, which was created in June of 2022, shortly after around 2,500 Ukrainian servicemen surrendered to Russia on the orders of the Ukrainian president during the siege of the Azovstal steel mill in May. According to the association, around 1,500 fighters from the steel mill remain in captivity. Thousands more taken in other battles also are being held in Russia, Ukrainian officials said.
Yevheniia Synelnyk says relatives’ concerns keep growing as returning POWs talk of torture and abuse.
Now, many families fear the exchanges will stop, Synelnyk said. Soldiers who returned usually shared any information they had about other captives with prisoners’ relatives. The last time she heard anything about her brother was a year ago.
The families supported each other throughout Wednesday.
“We’re together, we must stay strong because we have no other choice,” Synelnyk said, emphasizing they will keep organizing rallies. “As long as there is attention on these people, they are still alive there.”
A 21-year-old former prisoner of war, Illia, who uses the call sign Smurf and didn’t provide his surname because of security concerns, attends the rallies weekly and tries not to miss any. He feels it’s the least he can do for those who remain in captivity.
He vividly recalls his final day at the penal colony in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky in the Rostov region. It was Feb. 15 of 2023 when he heard his name being read aloud. He didn’t know he had been included in the exchange lists. First, he and a group of other POWs rode in a prisoner transport vehicle for three hours. Later, he was blindfolded and transported by plane for approximately four hours. The plane then made a stop to pick up more POWs whom he couldn’t see, but he understood as he heard the hands of other prisoners being taped. The trip finished with a four-hour bus ride toward the meeting point.
“These are emotions that I cannot convey in words, but I will never be able to forget,” he said of the moment he realized he had been exchanged.
After his return, he went through rehabilitation, yet the echoes of ten months of captivity linger in his daily life. He recently started losing weight and doctors cannot find the reason. He now weighs only 44 kilograms (97 pounds.)
Illia said he thinks that the incident puts future exchanges in danger, which would dash endless hopes.
“It’s a dream of every prisoner of war,” Illia said."
UONAWMVI9I_XSTN9C7K35PMH6I,"Tribes, environmental groups ask US court to block $10B energy transmission project in Arizona",By SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN and KEN RITTER,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/wind-energy-sunzia-transmission-lawsuit-f414b9c3e4d7fc0ae2aee4a0777be92f,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A federal judge is being asked to issue a stop-work order on a $10 billion transmission line being built through a remote southeastern Arizona valley to carry wind-generated electricity to customers as far away as California.
A 32-page lawsuit filed on Jan. 17 in U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona, accuses the U.S. Interior Department and Bureau of Land Management of refusing for nearly 15 years to recognize “overwhelming evidence of the cultural significance” of the remote San Pedro Valley to Native American tribes including the Tohono O’odham, Hopi, Zuni and San Carlos Apache Tribe.
The suit was filed shortly after Pattern Energy received approval to transmit electricity generated by its SunZia wind farm in central New Mexico through the San Pedro Valley east of Tucson and north of Interstate 10.
The lawsuit calls the valley “one of the most intact, prehistoric and historical ... landscapes in southern Arizona,” and asks the court to issue restraining orders or permanent injunctions to halt construction.
“The San Pedro Valley will be irreparably harmed if construction proceeds,” it says.

Government representatives declined to comment Tuesday on the pending litigation. They are expected to respond in court. The project has been touted as the biggest U.S. electricity infrastructure undertaking since the Hoover Dam.
Pattern Energy officials said Tuesday that the time has passed to reconsider the route, which was approved in 2015 following a review process.
“It is unfortunate and regrettable that after a lengthy consultation process, where certain parties did not participate repeatedly since 2009, this is the path chosen at this late stage,” Pattern Energy spokesperson Matt Dallas said in an email.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the Tohono O’odham Nation, the San Carlos Apache Tribe and the nonprofit organizations Center for Biological Diversity and Archaeology Southwest.
“The case for protecting this landscape is clear,” Archaeology Southwest said in a statement that calls the San Pedro Arizona’s last free-flowing river and the valley the embodiment of a “unique and timely story of social and ecological sustainability across more than 12,000 years of cultural and environmental change.”
The valley represents a 50-mile (80-kilometer) stretch of the planned 550-mile (885-kilometer) conduit expected to carry electricity from new wind farms in central New Mexico to existing transmission lines in Arizona to serve populated areas as far away as California. The project has been called an important part of President Joe Biden’s goal for a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.
Work started in September in New Mexico after negotiations that spanned years and resulted in the approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency with authority over vast parts of the U.S. West.
The route in New Mexico was modified after the U.S. Defense Department raised concerns about the effects of high-voltage lines on radar systems and military training operations.
Work halted briefly in November amid pleas by tribes to review environmental approvals for the San Pedro Valley, and resumed weeks later in what Tohono O’odham Chairman Verlon M. Jose characterized as “a punch to the gut.”
SunZia expects the transmission line to begin commercial service in 2026, carrying more than 3,500 megawatts of wind power to 3 million people. Project officials say they conducted surveys and worked with tribes over the years to identify cultural resources in the area.
A photo included in the court filing shows an aerial view in November of ridgetop access roads and tower sites being built west of the San Pedro River near Redrock Canyon. Tribal officials and environmentalists say the region is otherwise relatively untouched.
The transmission line also is being challenged before the Arizona Court of Appeals. The court is being asked to consider whether state regulatory officials there properly considered the benefits and consequences of the project.

UYY0BN5G4E_W4P361OYF1QHHF7,Gaza’s Health Ministry blames Israeli troops for deadly shooting as crowd waited for aid,"By NAJIB JOBAIN, JACK JEFFERY and LEE KEATH",_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-01-25-2024-e5592d58f88fd04a87363b0137025926,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Gaza’s Health Ministry and witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as a crowd of Palestinians gathered for humanitarian aid in Gaza City on Thursday, killing at least 20 and wounding dozens.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The Associated Press could not independently confirm the details of what happened.
Witnesses and health officials said the shooting took place at a roundabout on Gaza City’s southern edge, where a large crowd had gathered for distribution of food. Footage posted online and confirmed to have been taken on the main road near the roundabout showed hundreds of people fleeing, some carrying boxes of aid, as shots rang out in the background. Men loaded wounded Palestinians onto horse and donkey carts that took off charging down the avenue.
At Shifa Hospital, where casualties were treated, Mohammad al-Reafi lay on the floor, his bloodied leg bandaged, as medics worked on other wounded around them. He said Israeli troops fired into the crowd.
“We were going to get flour … young people were martyred and other young people were injured,” he said. Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said 20 people were killed and 150 others wounded by the shooting.

A number of aid agencies distribute food and other supplies in Gaza. It was not immediately known which one was operating in the area at the time of the incident. The United Nations refugee agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, and the U.N. World Food Program both said they were not involved.
Israeli troops and tanks pushed into Gaza City shortly after the ground invasion began in October and have been battling Palestinian militants there for nearly two months. The military says it has largely dismantled Hamas in northern Gaza but is still facing pockets of resistance, and large swaths of Gaza City and surrounding areas have been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombardment.
The U.N. has said it has been struggling to deliver aid to the north amid Israeli restrictions and continued fighting. Several hundred thousand people are believed to remain in the north after most of the population fled south. U.N. officials say a quarter of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million are facing starvation.
Israel launched its offensive in Gaza vowing to destroy Hamas after the Oct. 7 cross-border attack in which the militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others. One of the largest air and ground campaigns in recent history, the assault has killed over 25,900 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but the ministry says most of the dead are women and minors. It says the real toll is higher because many casualties were buried under the rubble or are in areas where medics can’t reach them.
Israel blames the high civilian toll on Hamas because the militant group positions fighters, rocket launchers and tunnels in dense, residential neighborhoods. The military says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing the basis for its count, and that 219 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive.
For weeks, heavy fighting has raged as Israeli troops push into the southern city of Khan Younis and in a cluster of built-up refugee camps in central Gaza that date back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.
The death toll from a strike on a crowded U.N. shelter in Khan Younis on Wednesday has risen to 12, with over 75 wounded, according to Thomas White, a senior official with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. He said 15 of the wounded were in critical condition.
UNRWA says two tank shells hit a building in a carpentry training center housing thousands of displaced Palestinians on Wednesday, causing the building to catch fire. It did not directly blame Israel, which is the only party to the conflict that has tanks.
The Israeli military said it has “currently ruled out” that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but was still investigating. It says the building might have been hit by a Hamas rocket.
Fighting has cut off the two main hospitals, Nasser and Al Amal, trapping hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people inside. White said another hospital, Al-Khair, was evacuated overnight and that among the patients who departed were women who had just undergone cesarean sections.
Israeli troops earlier in the week seized Al-Khair hospital, which is located in a coastal zone near Khan Younis that the military had previously said was a safe zone for Palestinians.
Thousands of Palestinians fled Khan Younis toward the Mediterranean coast Thursday to escape the fighting. Two women who spoke with the Associated Press said they were among a number of people that Israeli troops forced to evacuate from a school where they had been sheltering.
“Suddenly, they started calling from the microphones to evacuate the site within half an hour,” said one of the women, Amal, who said she gave birth three days earlier and fled the school with her newborn. “Now we are here, not knowing where to go,” she said. The troops detained young men at the school for interrogation, she said.
The Israeli military said its troops were engaging in close, urban combat with Hamas fighters in neighborhoods of Khan Younis, calling in airstrikes and attack helicopters to hit militants spotted with RPGs and weapons.
Footage released by the military showed paratroopers charging into the city’s municipal building, which was battered and punctured from shelling, while the area around it was reduced to dirt mounds. The soldiers scoured through empty offices and fired out of windows.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas, and to return all the hostages. The United States, Israel’s top ally, has provided crucial military support and shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire while urging it to scale back operations and facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid.
South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide before the U.N. world court at The Hague, which announced that it would issue a decision Friday on its request for an interim order telling Israel to halt the hostilities.

V2O786A2WI_WXY9Y1SV3LZ3ES0,Kerry and Xie exit roles that defined generation of climate action,By CHRIS MEGERIAN and SETH BORENSTEIN,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/john-kerry-xie-zhenhua-climate-change-7af155358898a7533946228e110caf50,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The United Nations climate summit in Dubai was wrapping up last month when John Kerry went to a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua only to find a surprise waiting for him. Xie’s 8-year-old grandson had brought Kerry a card for his 80th birthday.
The lanky American, who had signed the landmark Paris climate accord with his granddaughter on his knee almost a decade earlier, bent down to thank the boy and praise his grandfather, according to someone who described the private encounter on the condition of anonymity.
Just how overheated a planet those two grandchildren half a world apart will inherit has hinged in part on the unusually warm bond between Kerry and Xie, whose relationship for the past decade and a half helped forge the globe’s stutter-step progress in curbing climate change. Xie, 74, retired in December, and Kerry recently announced that he’s stepping down soon.
It was a partnership that defined one generation’s hopes of saving a future one.
At a glance, the two men make an odd pairing. Xie is balding and bespectacled, with a face as round as Kerry’s is narrow and angular. Xie got his start in the Chinese countryside during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution before climbing the ranks of the Communist Party in environmental and economic agencies. Kerry is a son of New England privilege and boarding schools who fought in the Vietnam War and later protested against it. He became a politician and a diplomat, marrying into fabulous wealth along the way.

But over the years, Kerry and Xie forged a remarkable level of trust and respect in the world of international climate negotiations. They checked in on each other when they were sick, met each other’s families and spent long hours debating, quarreling and compromising in the fight against global warming.
The result was a series of agreements despite rising tensions between the U.S. and China that have even raised fears of war. Kerry and Xie paved the way for progress at international summits that could have otherwise stagnated. Their passports read like a history of modern climate negotiations — Copenhagen, Lima, Paris, Glasgow, Sunnylands, Beijing, Dubai and many stops in between.
Christiana Figueres, a former United Nations climate chief who oversaw the Paris agreement in 2015, said she struggled to think of any parallel in recent history for the rapport between Kerry and Xie in terms of length and impact.
The two “trusted each other, trusted each other’s sincerity, trusted each other’s attempts, each other’s promises,” she said.
Before the Paris deal, Earth was on a trajectory for about 3.5 degrees Celsius  (6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming over pre-industrial levels, scientists projected. Now Climate Action Tracker projects warming of 2.1 degrees (3.8 degrees Fahrenheit) — if world leaders follow through on their promises, that is.
However, even that level of warming may be catastrophic, and the departures of Kerry and Xie are reshuffling climate diplomacy at a moment when scientists warn that the move toward clean energy is still happening too slowly. Xie’s successor has been named, but it’s unclear what will happen with Kerry’s position.
“If the U.S. and China do not get along with each other, then global climate progress will be delayed,” said Li Shuo, an analyst at the Asia Society who previously worked with Greenpeace in Beijing. “It is imperative to kind of align these countries as much as possible if we want to achieve global climate progress.”

Kerry was settling into a new role as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he traveled to Beijing in 2009. It had been five years since he lost the presidential election to George W. Bush, but now he had a fresh opportunity to shape foreign policy during Barack Obama’s administration.
The annual U.N. climate summit was being held in Copenhagen later that year, and Kerry was eager to talk about it with Chinese officials. Xie stood out to Kerry as someone who wanted to lean forward.
There was little progress at first, and the Copenhagen summit was widely viewed as a disappointment. Although China had become the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases around this time, it was reluctant to take any steps that could hinder its economic growth.
When Obama was reelected in 2012, he named Kerry secretary of state. Tackling climate change was a priority, and better relations with China was a key part of the strategy. The deadline was 2015, when the U.N. would hold a highly anticipated summit in Paris.
Todd Stern, then the top U.S. negotiator, described climate talks as “a hard Rubik’s Cube,” with every turn of the puzzle creating new challenges to solve. He found Xie to be a tough yet amenable interlocutor.
“He laughs, he finds things funny, he jokes back at you,” Stern said. “He also gets mad and indignant and all of that.”
China was facing environmental problems that were creating political headaches, such as thick smog that choked cities. It was the opening that the U.S. needed to push for progress, and negotiations advanced behind closed doors.
In 2014, Obama traveled to Beijing to announce a surprise bilateral agreement with President Xi Jinping. The U.S. set a more ambitious target for reducing emissions by 2025, while China promised to peak emissions by 2030.
Stern said the deal “ricocheted around the climate world” and convinced countries that “we can actually get this done.”
The importance of the deal became evident one month later. International negotiators were in Lima, Peru, to lay the groundwork for Paris, but they kept getting stuck. Figueres said Xie came to her office at 3 a.m. and asked, “Can we talk?”
Xie urged Figueres to use the earlier agreement between the U.S. and China to help break the gridlock. She spent the next two hours shuttling between the two countries’ delegations until a deal was reached.
The next year, the Paris summit produced a milestone agreement by obligating all countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, creating the foundation for every subsequent negotiation over climate change.
It was the relationship with China, Kerry said afterward, that helped “change the paradigm.”
——-
The warm feelings were short-lived. Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, and he promptly withdrew the U.S. from the Paris agreement after taking office. Kerry and Xie stepped away from government service.
The hiatus lasted four years. When Joe Biden defeated Trump in 2020, he asked Kerry to serve as special envoy for climate negotiations.
Xi responded by calling Xie out of retirement, seen as a clear signal that Beijing was ready to work together again.
“If your president hadn’t wanted you to come back, I wouldn’t have come back either,” Xie told Kerry, according to a person who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation. “I’ll be here roughly as long as you’re here.”
Despite Kerry and Xie’s rapport, it was slow going. The coronavirus pandemic made it difficult to travel. And even with Trump gone, tensions remained. Biden described China as a top foreign policy challenge, and disputes piled up over intellectual property, maritime access in the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan.
“These kind of things complicate the conversation,” said Jonathan Pershing, who worked for Kerry then and is now the environment program director at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. (The foundation also supports The Associated Press’ coverage of climate change.)
Kerry and Xie stayed in touch informally even after Beijing cut off communications with the U.S. after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. Although the island governs itself as a democracy, China views it as part of its territory.
More hurdles were around the corner. First Kerry was waylaid by COVID-19 during the U.N. summit in Egypt. Xie checked in, asking Kerry’s staff “how is my brother John doing,” according to a person briefed on the conversations.
Then Xie suffered his own health problems, believed to be a stroke, and Kerry returned the favor by calling and sending written messages.
“They obviously didn’t agree a lot of the time,” said John Podesta, a climate policy veteran who works in the White House. “You could only take a personal relationship so far.”
However, Podesta said, “having that level of trust and dialogue was important.”
Their work culminated in November, when Kerry and Xie met at the Sunnylands resort in California. China agreed to include methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas, as part of its emissions target.
The next month was their final U.N. summit in Dubai, which ended with a global agreement to transition away from fossil fuels. It was a better outcome than expected for a summit hosted by the oil-producing United Arab Emirates, but not the aggressive move that some wanted at a time of record temperatures.
When the negotiations were over, Kerry and Xie held a joint press conference.
Kerry described his counterpart as “a partner in this climate fight with many people for these years.” Xie said that “I feel so lucky that I can make such a good friend like Secretary Kerry.” Mentioning his grandson, Xie said he hoped “this cause will be carried forward, generation after generation.”
There was no hug, but they shook hands warmly. Kerry leaned toward the microphone one more time, cracking his widest smile, to say how impressive the young boy had been — “unbelievable, he’s great.”
It was the last public moment for the two grandfathers together.

VEY5195FUW_KGDJXBMOJY7ADUD,New Hampshire takeaways: Trump’s path becomes clearer. So does the prospect of a rematch with Biden,By STEVE PEOPLES and NICHOLAS RICCARDI,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/new-hampshire-primary-trump-biden-rematch-7d216918ba78324b25215878d3d95573,"WASHINGTON (AP) — This time, New Hampshire didn’t surprise.
Instead, its famously fickle voters stuck to the script of delivering a ringing ratification of the front-runner, Donald Trump, the former president. His victory over a defiant Nikki Haley cemented his hold on core Republican voters and substantially reduced the chances of any challenger overtaking him.
Never before has a presidential candidate won the first two contests on the primary nomination calendar — as Trump has now done — and failed to emerge as the party’s general election nominee, substantially increasing the already quite likely prospect of a rematch between him and President Joe Biden.
Even so, there were signs of restiveness among voters for both men. Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday’s New Hampshire Primary.
New Hampshire seemed like a state that Trump could lose.

The state’s moderate tradition, the participation of independents, a huge advertising disparity and even a popular governor were all working against the former president.
What to know about New Hampshire’s primary
He overcame all of that, somewhat easily, putting himself on a glide path to a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination that can likely be stopped at this point only by an unprecedented collapse or unforeseen external circumstances.
His base, immovable so far, has given him a structural advantage that few non-incumbents have ever had. He doesn’t need to persuade any new voters to win the nomination, he simply needs to ensure his people turn out. According to AP VoteCast, only about half of New Hampshire Republican voters identify with Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement. And about half disagree with Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
He won anyway.
Trump may be unstoppable in the primary campaign, but Tuesday’s vote offered evidence that he may have a more difficult time in the general election this fall.
Trump did not carry key groups of swing voters. Haley beat Trump among primary voters who identify as moderates, as well as independents. She also beat Trump among those with a college degree. And about half of New Hampshire Republican primary voters are very or somewhat concerned that Trump is too extreme to win the general election, according to AP VoteCast. Only about one-third say the same about Haley.
A significant number of voters in the Republican primary — about 4 in 10 — also believe that Trump broke the law either in his alleged attempt to interfere in the vote count in the 2020 presidential election, his role in what happened at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, or the classified documents found at his Florida home after he left the White House.
Such legal troubles helped unify core Republican voters behind his candidacy in recent months, but it’s hard to imagine those issues will be an asset with the much broader set of general election voters.
Trump is facing 91 felony counts across four criminal trials. And his court schedule is set up to ensure that voters won’t be able to forget about the legal drama, even if they want to. The federal trial over Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is tentatively set to begin March 4, the day before Super Tuesday.
Haley’s loss represents a significant defeat for anti-Trump forces that still exist within the Republican Party.
They finally got the head-to-head contest they had long been calling for. And it wasn’t enough.
Still, Haley strongly suggested she would stay in the race until at least her home state primary in South Carolina on Feb. 24.

“New Hampshire is first in the nation, it’s not last in the nation. This race is far from over,” Haley told cheering supporters in Concord.
Haley’s team was quick to note that roughly 5 in 10 primary voters do not support Trump. Her advisers insist she will stay in the race to serve as a vehicle for those anti-Trump forces who are still hoping he might be forced out of the race by his legal problems, or perhaps a health emergency.
And at least for now, the 52-year-old former South Carolina governor still has math and donors on her side.
Trump cannot mathematically secure the delegate majority he needs to become the presumptive nominee before Super Tuesday on March 5. And, in exactly one week, Haley is scheduled to embark upon a fundraising tour that includes stops in New York, Florida, California and Texas.
Her campaign is also launching a new $4 million advertising campaign in South Carolina that begins Wednesday.
But Trump made clear he’ll go full-out to bury Haley. “She didn’t win — she lost,” he said Tuesday night, slamming Haley’s concession speech. He later posted a message on Truth Social directed at Haley: “NIKKI CAME IN LAST, NOT SECOND!”
Trump was flanked by Haley’s home state Sen. Tim Scott and her antagonist in many of the GOP presidential debates, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom have endorsed him. He signaled a more punishing approach ahead. “I don’t get mad,” Trump said, “I get even.”

For months, Haley and former Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis offered only muted criticism of the former president, wary of his popularity with the GOP base.
Each was more frontal in attacking him as voting drew nearer, especially Haley in the closing days before New Hampshire. It was too late to help DeSantis, who suspended his campaign Sunday after finishing a distant second in Iowa. This weekend, Haley drew attention to the 77-year-old former president seeming to confuse her and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, directly taking on his mental fitness in ways she’d only vaguely alluded to before.
The punches didn’t land, but Haley continued them Tuesday night, digging again at Trump’s mental fitness during her concession speech. “Most Americans do not want a rematch between Biden and Trump,” Haley said. “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the party that wins this election.”
It was a road not taken until the last minute. Haley doesn’t have a lot of travel time left.
Joe Biden did not put his name on the ballot for the New Hampshire primary. The results are not binding for convention delegates. He won anyway, thanks to an aggressive write-in campaign. Biden muscled the Democratic National Committee into giving South Carolina, the state that set him on a path to the White House with a victory in 2020, the first official party primary. It’s on Feb. 3.
Like Trump, Biden could read good news in the results, with roughly 8 in 10 Democrats approving of his handling of the economy, along with a warning: About half say that, at age 81, he’s too old to run, and about half disapprove of his handling of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, according to AP VoteCast.
Both men are clearly in commanding positions ... for a rematch that many voters say they do not want."
VF96LUTQ91_6R8ZE1PP8FYODKS,Britain’s post-Brexit trade talks with Canada break down as they disagree over beef and cheese,By PAN PYLAS,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/britain-canada-trade-brexit-cheese-beef-ad49e6a35ddea2c9610cdf16ac12c5a3,"LONDON (AP) — The British government has called off post-Brexit trade talks with Canada after discussions broke down over disagreements related to the import and export of beef and cheese.
The two countries have been negotiating a new trade deal over the past two years since Britain fully left the European Union. Trade between the two has largely continued under the same deal that was originally brokered when Britain was a member of the bloc.
In a statement late Thursday, the U.K. government said it “remains open” to restarting talks in the future but that there was no progress so far. Annual trade between the two countries is valued at around 26 billion pounds ($33 billion).
Over time as the discussions pushed ahead, Canadian negotiators came under mounting pressure from their beef industry and domestic cheesemakers.
The beef industry wanted access to the United Kingdom for its hormone-fed beef while the cheesemakers warned about the economic impact of tariff-free cheese from Britain, primarily cheddar. Tariff-free cheese exports from Britain stopped at the end of 2023 after a time-limited side agreement expired, leaving British producers facing higher duties of 245%.

Canada’s trade minister, Mary Ng, said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the Canadian government “will never agree to a deal that isn’t good for our workers, farmers and businesses.”
Minette Batters, president of the Nation Farmers’ Union of England and Wales, praised the British government, especially its apparent refusal to allow hormone-linked beef to be allowed into Britain.
“Trade on agricultural products is always the first thing to be discussed and the last thing to be agreed,” she said. “I am pleased the government has stuck to its line and not given way,”
One of the main benefits that was being pushed during Britain’s 2016 referendum on its membership of the EU was that it would allow the country to pursue its independent trade policy.
However, few new trade deals have been negotiated since Brexit, and any ensuing benefits are widely considered to be modest when put against the impediments to trade that have now been put in place between Britain and the EU. Before Brexit, Britain could trade freely within the bloc.
Britain’s Conservative government, which negotiated the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, sought to downplay the breakdown in the talks with Canada.
“It is a benefit of our independent trading status that we are able to insist on the detail of each and every deal to ensure that it works, specifically in the U.K. interests,” said Camilla Marshall, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
“We are open to restarting talks with Canada in the future where we can build a trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides,” she added. “There is no schedule for those.”
With the talks breakdown, there are renewed worries British cars could see higher tariffs from April on exports, when another temporary tariff-free agreement — similar to the one involving cheese — is due to expire.
The British Chambers of Commerce said the breakdown in the talks was “unwelcome news” and urged the government to help sectors affected.
“For our dairy exporters and parts of our manufacturing industry the loss of key trade preferences puts them in a worse position than before 2020,” said William Bain, the chamber’s trade policy chief.
Britain’s main opposition Labour Party, which is far ahead of the Conservatives in polls ahead of a general election sometime this year, said the collapse of the talks was another “significant failure” by the government to deliver on its post-Brexit promises."
VF9HSZSLO6_ST8LY837AY9XQO5,"Western Balkans countries pledge support for new EU growth plan, as they seek membership in the bloc",By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/balkans-macedonia-european-union-enlargement-f220898c947a07aa672e1ac2ee50ff9e,"SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — The leaders of Western Balkan countries pledged Monday to make full use of the European Union’s financial support plan of six billion euros (about $6.5 billion) as they continue to seek membership in the bloc.
Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania are at different stages of the accession process. Their leaders gathered in North Macedonia’s capital, Skopje, and said in a joint statement they were committed “to the development of their countries to follow European standards.”
In November, the European Commission presented a Growth Plan for the Western Balkans to enhance economic integration with the EU’s single market, boost regional economic integration, accelerate fundamental reforms, and increase financial assistance.
The plan includes a proposed six billion euro reform and growth scheme to be given out over three years, 2024-2027, contingent on agreed reforms. Its main aim is to help double the Western Balkans’ economy throughout the next decade. The funding hopes to address frustration among residents of candidate countries with the slow pace of the membership process, as well as maintain the countries’ alignment with the West as Russia’s war against Ukraine continues.
Present at Monday’s meeting were Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, Kosvo’s Albin Kurti, Montenegro’s Milojko Spajic and the North Macedonian premier, Dimitar Kovachevski
The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, James O’Brien, and the Director General for Neighborhood and Enlargement Negotiations at the European Commission, Gert Jan Kopmann, were also present.
“Each country is responsible for its own reforms and for working with as many of its neighbors as it can,” O’Brien said. “So now, the countries that seize the initiative will get the benefits sooner and they will not have to wait until some unrelated dispute is resolved,” he said."

(AP) — A teenage boy who shot and wounded an Indiana sheriff’s deputy Tuesday while she and other deputies were conducting a welfare check at a home was later found dead inside the residence, authorities said.
Deputies arrived at the home in Martinsville, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Indianapolis, at around 7:30 a.m. after a 911 caller reported that he had seen a social media post suggesting a friend was possibly going to harm himself, Morgan County Sheriff Rich Myers said.
When deputies knocked on the front door, no one answered. Myers said Deputy Mallory K. Schwab was checking the home’s exterior to determine if anyone was inside when someone inside opened fire and she was shot once in her upper right shoulder.
Schwab, who joined the sheriff’s department earlier this month, was treated at an Indianapolis hospital and released, Myers said. “We were all breathing a sigh of relief,” he said.
After the shooting, SWAT teams from Morgan County and adjacent Johnson County arrived and surrounded the home. Numerous attempts were made to communicate with the young suspect inside, including calls to a cellphone, but they were unsuccessful, Myers said.
Tear gas was also fired into the home, he said. Officers later found a 15-year-old boy dead inside, Myers said, noting that a family is now mourning their son.
The sheriff said the county coroner’s office will determine how the teen died. He said it wasn’t clear how many shots had been fired inside the home but that no officers had fired their weapons.
Indiana State Police are overseeing the investigation of the shooting, which will include reviewing police body camera video, Myers said."
VZNDCSS0X3_44C7U4F3H7FENV8,Martin Luther King’s daughter recalls late brother as strong guardian of their father’s legacy,By SUDHIN THANAWALA,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/king-son-death-atlanta-e14ad655472626414473eb82cb5d057f,"ATLANTA (AP) — The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter remembered her late brother on Tuesday as a fierce and visionary steward of their father’s legacy.
The Rev. Bernice King choked back tears at times as she shared memories of her childhood and recent visits with Dexter Scott King, who died Monday at his home in Malibu, California, after a yearslong battle with prostate cancer. He was 62.
“As you can imagine, this is perhaps the hardest thing for me to do,” she said. “I love you Dexter.”
Bernice King said she spent meaningful time this year with her older brother — the third of four children raised by Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King.
“He often told me and I told him, ‘I love you,’” she said at The King Center in Atlanta, where she serves as CEO. “And he looked in my eyes and said, ‘I’m proud of you and the work that you’ve been doing. And you take it forward. I know you’re going to do a good job. Keep this legacy going. You got this.’”

Coretta Scott King launched the center in 1968 to memorialize her husband and to advance his philosophy of nonviolent social change. Dexter King was chair of the center’s board, which hasn’t yet announced a successor.
Bernice King said that from an early age, her brother showed interest in business. He would remind the family that Martin Luther King fought for copyright protection for his “I Have a Dream” speech, telling his siblings that they had to protect their father’s intellectual property, according to Bernice King.
“He had a vision to build something that would bring my father to life through technology,” Bernice King said, surrounded by other family members. She added, “Dexter was a strategist.”
The center offers virtual classes on Martin Luther King’s philosophy of nonviolence. Tuesday’s news conference started with a music video featuring Whitney Houston and other artists that was produced to celebrate the first Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday in 1986. Bernice King said her brother was instrumental in producing the song and video.
She also alluded to some of the pressure Dexter King experienced as the son of perhaps the country’s most prominent civil rights leader, whom he also closely resembled. Bernice King recalled that her brother went through a “rough patch” when he took a job with Atlanta police early in his life and had to carry a gun — something that was frowned upon in a family steeped in the philosophy of nonviolence.
He also faced criticism that he was trying to profit from their father’s legacy, which was not his intent, she added.
Dexter King and his siblings, who shared control of the family estate, didn’t always agree on how to uphold their parents’ legacy. In addition to Bernice King, he is survived by older brother Martin Luther King III. He was out of the country and unable to attend Tuesday’s event, Bernice King said.
The eldest of the four King siblings, Yolanda, died in 2007.
Bernice King downplayed her differences with Dexter King, saying she always agreed with her brother in principle. And she said the two of them remained close throughout his life.
“None of that destroyed our love and our respect for each other,” she said, of their differences.
The family honored Dexter King’s wishes and cremated him. They plan to hold additional events to memorialize him."
W43GACLMYR_T02K71QYFMFJNUG,Bid to overhaul New Mexico oil and gas regulations clears first hurdle amid litigation,By MORGAN LEE,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/new-mexico-overhaul-oil-gas-regulations-ed6541233647faa9ea6285f56d9d70a9,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — An effort to modernize state oversight of a thriving petroleum industry in the nation’s No. 2 state for oil production advanced past its first committee vetting Thursday at the New Mexico Legislature.
The bill would rewrite portions of the state’s 1930s-era Oil and Gas Act in order to help regulators keep pace with the industry’s meteoric growth in recent years — as well as increasingly assertive calls to hold the sector accountable for air pollution, spills and the costly cleanup of equipment and abandoned wells.
It advanced on 6-5 vote of the lead House committee on natural resources, over the objections of small and moderate sized oil producers but with the public endorsements of industry heavyweights Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources.
The initiative would increase financial assurances for well plugging and cleanups, while ratcheting up administrative fees and penalties for regulatory violations. The bill also would give regulators greater authority over applications to transfer ownership of wells that often change hands when oil and natural gas output declines.
Bill cosponsor Rep. Matthew McQueen of Galisteo urged colleagues to rally behind the bill, warning that a downturn in the industry could saddle the state with immense liabilities for orphaned wells.

“If we can’t put appropriate safeguards in place during record (oil) production then we’re never going to have those safeguards in place,” he said. “We’ve had boom industries in New Mexico before. We had uranium mining — they went bust. We’re still dealing with that legacy that was not cleaned up.”
Initial provisions were dropped from the bill that would have established no-drilling buffer zones around schools, residences, surface waters and critical habitats across New Mexico, to the dismay of environmentalists and community advocates who vowed to press legislators to reinstate setback requirements. The State Land Office recently imposed its own buffer around schools.
The Democratic-led Legislature and governor are being sued over alleged failures to meet constitutional provisions for protecting against oil and gas pollution, as fed-up residents living near oil wells and environmental groups turn to the judiciary for relief. The lawsuit filed in May 2023 seeks compliance with a “pollution control clause” of the New Mexico Constitution.
“This bill utterly fails to impose any real restrictions on the oil industry and does nothing to protect frontline communities from the toxic pollution they’re exposed to every single day,” said Gail Evans, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity and lead counsel in the lawsuit to plaintiffs including Indigenous Lifeways, Pueblo Action Alliance, Youth United for Climate Crisis Action.
Democratic state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces — the lead House budget negotiator — warned that deleted provisions from the bill “would make it extremely difficult and unlikely for these important fiscal protections to move forward.” He voted to advance the bill toward a second vetting before a possible House floor vote.
Ahtza Chavez, executive director of the Native American environmental and social justice group NM Native Vote, participated in working groups on the bill organized by Gov. Lujan Grisham over the past six months, alongside state oil-field regulators and industry representatives.
She called the elimination of setback requirements “devastating” but pledged support for the amended bill.
“They’ve had 90 years to do better and they have not protected our communities,” said Chavez, an Albuquerque resident who is Diné, tracing her ancestry to the Navajo as well as Kewa Pueblo.
The committee-endorsed bill would increase a common financial assurance to remediate multiple wells from a maximum of $250,000 to $10 million. The cap on daily penalties for regulatory violations would increase from $2,500 to as much as $25,000, with no cumulative limit.
Voting against the bill, Republican state Rep. Larry Scott of Hobbs, said the initiative represents an existential threat to small-scale oil and natural gas producers, echoing concerns raised by several businesses.
“The concern is that, with the stroke of a pen, financial assurances and penalties can put these small operators completely out of business,” said Scott, also a petroleum-industry engineer.
The bill would also expand the state’s regulatory authority over other types of well activity in anticipation of a gradual transition away from fossil fuel production — including geothermal projects that harness underground heat to produce electricity, or emerging underground systems of kinetic energy storage."
W6LWBBBOJP_BBXRSN7NP6XDMBI,Hungary’s Orbán takes step toward breaking deadlock over Sweden’s NATO membership,By JUSTIN SPIKE,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/orban-invites-swedish-leader-discuss-nato-membership-32d50b876dccded5c7c2f60ca7cf204b,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to discuss Sweden’s accession into the NATO military alliance, Orbán wrote Tuesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The invitation comes as Hungary and Turkey remain the only NATO members not to have ratified Sweden’s bid to join the alliance. Admission into NATO requires unanimity among all member countries, but more than a year of delays in Budapest and Ankara have frustrated other allies who want to expand the alliance amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Orbán, a right-wing populist who has been lukewarm in his support for neighboring Ukraine and maintained a friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has long promised that Hungary would not be the last NATO member to ratify Sweden’s bid.
Last month, the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee approved Sweden’s accession protocol, moving the Nordic country one step closer to joining the alliance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lifted his opposition to Sweden’s membership last year in response to efforts by Stockholm to tackle supporters of Kurdish militants and other groups in Sweden that Ankara views as security threats.
Erdogan has also openly linked Sweden’s NATO membership to Ankara’s efforts to purchase U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, and has called on Canada and other NATO allies to lift arms embargoes on Turkey.

While Orbán says his government supports Sweden’s admission into the alliance, he claims that lawmakers from his governing Fidesz party remain unconvinced because of what he called “blatant lies” by Swedish politicians about the condition of Hungary’s democracy.
Neither Orbán nor his senior officials have indicated what kind of redress they require from Stockholm to allay their reservations over Sweden joining the military alliance.
In his letter to Kristersson, Orbán wrote that “a more intensive political dialogue” could contribute to “reinforcing the mutual trust” between Sweden and Hungary, and invited his counterpart in Stockholm to exchange views on ”future cooperation in the field of security and defence as allies and partners.”
Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström declined to say Tuesday whether Kristersson would accept Orbán’s invitation.
“We must first think through what the letter signals,” Billström said. “What we hope is, of course, that Hungary will ratify the membership as soon as possible.”
Sweden and Finland abandoned their decades-long neutrality and sought membership in NATO amid heightened security concerns following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland became NATO’s 31st member last year after Hungary and Turkey were the last two countries to ratify its bid.
Unless an emergency session of Hungary’s parliament is called to debate the matter, its next scheduled assembly is expected on Feb. 26.

W7XGP0F3KS_LNM84VR42UPQGRR,"After stalling in 2023, a bill to define antisemitism in state law is advancing in Georgia",By JEFF AMY,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-antisemitism-bill-israel-palestine-1d2232b86433562a4107029821fe2149,"ATLANTA (AP) — A bill to define antisemitism in Georgia law stalled in 2023 over how it should be worded. But a revised version won unanimous endorsement from a key Senate committee Monday, backed by Republican support for Israel in its war with Hamas and a surge in reported bias incidents against Jewish people in the state.
“I think the whole world saw what happened on Oct. 7 and the fallout to Jewish communities around the world,” said Democratic state Rep. Esther Panitch of Sandy Springs, the only Jewish member of Georgia’s legislature. She is a co-sponsor of the measure that won the support of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
But fears of opponents who say House Bill 30 would be used as a shield to block criticism of Israeli war crimes against Palestinians are stronger than ever, showing how what was already a fraught topic in early 2023 has become downright raw with the Israel-Hamas war. Some protesters chanting “Free Free Palestine!” were dragged from the committee room by police officers after the vote. Other opposition witnesses told lawmakers they were privileging political support for Israel.
“What it does do is weaponize attacks and hatred against my community and to silence Palestinian and Muslim Georgians, making threats against me somehow more important than threats against my own neighbors and implying that my safety can only come at their expense,” said Marissa Pyle, who said she is Jewish. “Making other people less safe does not help me.”
The bill already passed the House last year and Monday’s vote signals the measure is likely to pass the state Senate and be signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp. The Republican governor has previously said he supports the measure.

The committee also advanced Senate Bill 359 on a split vote. The measure attempts to target the distribution of antisemitic flyers in residential neighborhoods by adding littering, illegal sign placement, loitering, misdemeanor terroristic threats, disorderly conduct and harassing communications to the list of crimes that draw enhanced sentences under Georgia’s hate crimes law. The law would also make any two crimes subject to Georgia’s hate crimes law eligible for prosecution under the state’s expansive anti-racketeering statute.
In at least eight states nationwide, lawmakers are working on measures to define antisemitism, part of an upsurge of legislation motivated in part by the Israel-Hamas war. Arkansas passed such a law last year, and like in Georgia, a South Carolina measure passed one chamber in 2023. New bills are pending this year in Indiana, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey and South Dakota.
Sponsors say a definition would help prosecutors and other officials identify hate crimes and illegal discrimination targeting Jewish people. But some critics warn it would limit free speech, especially in criticizing the actions of Israel. Others don’t oppose a law, but object to the measure defining antisemitism by referring to a definition adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
“When can we anticipate the legislature moving forward on a bill that addresses Islamophobia?” said Asim Javed of the Georgia Muslim Voter Project. Javed added that the bill “stifles our First Amendment rights by censoring any criticisms of Israel.”
But the warnings of free speech harms by the opponents were met by personal stories of harms suffered by the supporters, including Rabbi Elizabeth Baher of Macon’s Temple Beth Israel. She recounted how an antisemitic group hung a Jew in effigy outside the synagogue as worshipers were arriving for services in June.
“We the people of Georgia stand united against bigotry and discrimination. Our diverse tapestry is woven with threads of resilience, understanding and mutual respect,” Baher said.
Also among those who testified was David Lubin. He’s the father of Rose Lubin, who grew up in suburban Atlanta but moved to Israel, becoming a staff sergeant in the Israeli army before she was stabbed to death in Jerusalem on Nov. 6. Lubin said that when her daughter was a student at suburban Atlanta’s Dunwoody High School, she reported a student making antisemitic remarks and making “Heil Hitler” salutes.
“We need laws in place to deter the threat and convict those who commit the actions of hatred,” David Lubin said."
WB7BNL02DW_DQ3AAFPMRCOX6RV,Rhode Island Ethics Commission dismisses complaint against Gov. McKee filed by state GOP,_,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/rhode-island-governor-dan-mckee-ethics-investigation-a6f772d0475ca67bb29b6e638c2fa604,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The Rhode Island Ethics Commission has dismissed a complaint filed by the state Republican party against Democratic Gov. Dan McKee alleging he violated state campaign finance laws after a lobbyist picked up a tab for lunch.
An investigative report submitted to the commission found McKee “acted reasonably and in good faith relative to payment for the January 2023 lunch at the Capital Grille restaurant” and that there “does not exist probable cause to believe that (McKee) committed a knowing and willful violation of the Code of Ethics.”
The commission voted 6-0 Tuesday to dismiss the complaint.
The GOP complaint filed last year alleged that McKee violated state law by allowing Jeff Britt, a lobbyist representing the urban development firm Scout Ltd., to pay for the $228 meal at the Capital Grille in Providence last January. Scout Ltd. was hoping to move ahead with a plan to redevelop the Cranston Street Armory in Providence.
Under Rhode Island ethics law, public officials are barred from accepting items worth $25 or more from anyone seeking to do business with the state.

McKee said the complaint was driven by politics.
“I thank the ethics commission for their thorough review and unanimous dismissal of the politically motivated complaint filed against me by the Rhode Island Republican Party,” McKee said in written statement. “Just like the ethics commission, the people of Rhode Island saw this stunt for what it was.”
The lunch included Britt, McKee, McKee’s campaign fundraising chair Jerry Sahagian and two employees of Scout Ltd.
Britt said he paid for the lunch at the request of Sahagian. The governor’s campaign said last June that they reimbursed Britt for the lunch.
The governor canceled the state contract with the firm. A state-hired consultant found Scout’s redevelopment plan would cost the state about $10.5 million over 15 years.
Britt’s clients also gave McKee two $500 campaign donations the same day as the lunch, according to campaign finance records.
In March, Scout Ltd. alerted state officials to what it called “blatantly sexist, racist and unprofessional” behavior during a business trip by a top Rhode Island official, who later resigned. McKee has said that had no influence on his decision to end the contract with Scout Ltd.
When McKee was the state’s lieutenant governor, he was fined $250 in 2019 by the state Ethics Commission for failing to disclose a trip he took to Taiwan."
WBHL3E76GM_8TUQ6FQXOER97M8,Vice President Harris targets Trump as she rallies for abortion rights in Wisconsin,By CHRIS MEGERIAN and COLLEEN LONG,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-abortion-biden-2024-election-560bc2bbdf036c18b6601ced44a62b50,"WAUKESHA, Wisc. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris blasted Republicans as extremists for trying to ban abortions as she rallied women in the key battleground state of Wisconsin on Monday, marking the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade by leading Democrats’ charge for restoring reproductive rights.
She singled out Donald Trump, who is tightening his grip on the Republican presidential nomination, for saying he was “proud” of helping to limit abortions. Trump nominated three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court during his term in office, paving the way for the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
“Proud that women across our nation are suffering?” Harris said. “Proud that women have been robbed of a fundamental freedom? Proud that doctors could be thrown in prison for caring for their patients? That young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers?”
“How dare he?” she added.
The barrage reflects the White House’s intense focus on abortion rights during this year’s presidential campaign. Back in Washington, Biden convened a meeting of his reproductive health care access task force to discuss threats to emergency care and new steps for implementing executive orders on the subject.
The Democratic president described Roe v. Wade as “a fundamental right” that had been “ripped away.”

Biden, Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff are holding another rally focused on abortion in Virginia on Tuesday. In addition, Harris’ trip to Wisconsin is the first stop in a nationwide tour to talk about reproductive rights.
In her speech on Monday, Harris described abortion as an integral part of the country’s tradition of personal liberty.
“In America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right,” she said. “And that includes the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body — not the government telling you what to do.”
Harris shared stories of women who have miscarried in toilets or developed sepsis because they were denied help by doctors concerned about violating abortion restrictions.
“This is, in fact, a healthcare crisis,” she said. “And there is nothing about this that is hypothetical.”
Wisconsin faces an ongoing legal battle over abortion. When Roe v. Wade was overturned, Republicans argued that an 1849 law that was still on the books would effectively ban the procedure except in situations where a mother’s life was at risk.
“These extremists want to roll back the clock to a time before women were treated as full citizens,” Harris said.
Clinics across the state stopped offering abortions until a court ruled the law did not apply to abortions. Republicans have appealed the decision, and the case will likely be decided by the state supreme court. They’re also pushing for a voter referendum that would ban abortions after 14 weeks, holding a hearing on the proposal on Monday.
The White House is pushing against the limits of its ability to ensure access to abortion without new legislation from Congress, where control is split between Democrats and Republicans.
On Monday, Biden administration announced it was creating a team dedicated to helping hospitals comply with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires hospitals receiving federal money to provide life-saving treatment when a patient is at risk of dying.
The Department of Health and Human Services said it would beef up training at hospitals around the law and publish new information on how to lodge a complaint against a hospital.
Some advocacy groups have criticized HHS as not responding aggressively enough to such complaints. Last week, the Associated Press reported that federal officials did not find any violation of the law when an Oklahoma hospital instructed a 26-year-old woman to wait in a parking lot until her condition worsened to qualify for an abortion of her nonviable pregnancy.
The White House has repeatedly turned to Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president, to make its case on abortion. Her outspokenness contrasts with Biden’s more reticent approach. Although he is a longtime supporter of abortion rights, he mentions less often and sometimes avoids using the word abortion even when he discusses the issue.
“I think the real star from a messaging standpoint is the vice president,” said Mini Timmaraju, head of Reproductive Freedom for All, the activist organization formerly known as the National Abortion Rights Action League. “Look, Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris. Joe Biden has asked Kamala Harris to lead on this issue. This is going to set us up for a great contrast with the other side.”
While Harris and Democrats have embraced abortion as a campaign issue, Republicans are shying away or calling for a truce, fearful of sparking more backlash from voters.
Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, recently made a plea to “find consensus” on the divisive issue.
“As much as I’m pro-life, I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice, and I don’t want them to judge me for being pro-life,” she said during a primary debate in November.
Trump has taken credit for helping to overturn Roe v. Wade, but he has balked at laws like Florida’s ban on abortions after six weeks, which was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, another Republican candidate who dropped out of the race over the weekend.
“You have to win elections,” Trump said during a recent Fox News town hall.
Vice presidents are rarely decisive figures in reelection campaigns. However, Harris has faced additional scrutiny because of Biden’s age — he would be 82 at the start of a second term — and her status as the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve in her position.
Abortion has reshaped Harris’ tenure as vice president after earlier struggles when dealing with intractable issues like migration from Central America.
Jamal Simmons, a former communications director for Harris, said abortion “focused her attention and her office in a way that nothing had before.”
“Focusing on abortion rights tapped into the vice president’s legal background, her political values and her substantive knowledge in a way that I saw no other issue do while I was there,” he said.

WEJJD0WWBB_9HE4EQC288CLQZK,"Russia clashes with US and Ukraine supporters, ruling out any peace plan backed by Kyiv and the West",By EDITH M. LEDERER,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-united-states-clash-peace-gaza-united-nations-aeebfd51edbacb6b82550ebe3b47f2ac,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia’s foreign minister clashed with the United States and Ukraine’s supporters at a U.N. meeting Monday where Moscow ruled out any peace plan backed by Kyiv and the West, and China warned that further global chaos could impact the slowing global economy.
Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s top diplomat, claimed that Ukrainian forces have been “a complete failure” on the battlefield and are “incapable” of defeating or weakening Russia.
He told the U.N. Security Council that Moscow is always ready to negotiate peace, but he claimed peace plans presented by Ukraine and its Western “masters” are “only used as cover to continue war and continue getting money from Western taxpayers.”
“All of these formulas are a road to nowhere, and the sooner Washington, London, Paris and Brussels realize this the better for Ukraine and the West,” he said, warning that their “crusade against Russia has already created new, clear, reputational and existential risks.”
U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood dismissed Lavrov’s claims as “just blatant disinformation” and countered that it was Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine that started the war, and it is President Vladimir Putin ‘s “single-minded pursuit of the obliteration of Ukraine and subjugation of its people that is prolonging it.”

“Russia’s imperialist designs are obvious,” and “for Russia, anything other than capitulation — total capitulation by Ukraine is the only solution, and that’s just not acceptable to the international community,” Wood said. stressing that the war could end tomorrow if Moscow withdrew hundreds of thousands of troops in Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory.
Russia called the council meeting to again sharply criticize Western military aid to Ukraine. Just before it started, diplomats from more than 40 countries surrounded Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya who read a joint statement underscoring Russia’s “hypocrisy” in criticizing lawful arms transfers to help Ukraine defend itself.
Ukraine’s supporters called Monday’s meeting another Russian attempt “to distract from its war of aggression,” and they condemned military support to Moscow — drones from Iran and ballistic missiles from North Korea — in violation of U.N. sanctions, as well as military equipment from Belarus.
The council heard many calls for stepped up peace efforts, and there was growing concern from Russia’s ally, China, about the increasing threat to global security from the ongoing war in Ukraine at the same time that Israel and Hamas are at war in Gaza following the militant group’s surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7.
“We must spare no effort to stem the spillover of the (Ukraine) crisis at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli conflict drags on, and some hotspot issues are at the risk of flaring up,” China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said. “The world cannot afford to see further spreading of geopolitical clashes at the same time the global economy is slowing down.”
Zhang told the council “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected,” which Ukraine has insisted on and which Russia has violated by annexing four Ukrainian regions. But the Chinese ambassador criticized Ukraine for seeking to join NATO and warned Kyiv, without naming Russia, that this would deepen Moscow’s security concerns.
Zhang urged the resumption of direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations as soon as possible. He did not mention the peace plan China issued in February 2023 that called for a ceasefire, negotiations and an end to sanctions against Russia but he did focus on the war’s disruption to the world economy.
“The negative impacts of the Ukraine crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict have added snow to the icy cold global economy,” Zhang said. “Countries with significant influence should … refrain from politicizing, instrumentalizing or weaponizing the world economy, and should instead work together to maintain global food, energy and financial security as well as the stability and smooth functioning of industrial and supply chains.”
China was the third speaker from the 15-member council and Lavrov left immediately after Zhang spoke, giving his seat to a deputy. Lavrov didn’t hear Wood but he did hear Malta’s U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier who echoed the U.S. call for Russia to withdraw its forces and accused Moscow of violating its duty to maintain international peace and security, the Security Council’s primary mission.
“Today’s meeting is yet another attempt to justify the unjustifiable and seek to provide a narrative where the victim is the aggressor and the aggressor the victim,” Frazier said, decrying the killing of 10,200 Ukrainian civilians, including 575 children, and injuries to more than 19,300 others in Russian attacks since the war began, according to the U.N. human rights office."

(AP) — Alabama executed a convicted murderer with nitrogen gas Thursday, putting him to death with a first-of-its-kind method that once again placed the U.S. at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment. The state said the method would be humane, but critics called it cruel and experimental.
Officials said Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation. It marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since lethal injection, now the most commonly used method, was introduced in 1982.

The execution took about 22 minutes from the time between the opening and closing of the curtains to the viewing room. Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes. For at least two minutes, he appeared to shake and writhe on the gurney, sometimes pulling against the restraints. That was followed by several minutes of heavy breathing, until breathing was no longer perceptible.
In a final statement, Smith said, “Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards. ... I’m leaving with love, peace and light.”
He made the “I love you sign” with his hands toward family members who were witnesses. “Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,” Smith said.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said the execution was justice for the murder-for-hire killing of 45-year-old Elizabeth Sennett in 1988.
“After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr. Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes,” Ivey said in a statement. “I pray that Elizabeth Sennett’s family can receive closure after all these years dealing with that great loss.”
Mike Sennett, the victim’s son, said Thursday night that Smith “had been incarcerated almost twice as long as I knew my mom.”

“Nothing happened here today is going to bring Mom back. It’s kind of a bittersweet day. We are not going to be jumping around, whooping and holler, hooray and all that,” he said. “I’ll end by saying Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett got her justice tonight.”
The state had previously attempted to execute Smith in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldn’t connect an IV line.
The execution came after a last-minute legal battle in which his attorneys contended the state was making him the test subject for an experimental execution method that could violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Federal courts rejected Smith’s bid to block it, with the latest ruling coming Thursday night from the U.S. Supreme Court.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who along with two other liberal justices dissented, wrote, “Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before. The world is watching.”
The majority justices did not issue any statements.
The state had predicted the nitrogen gas would cause unconsciousness within seconds and death within minutes. State Attorney General Steve Marshall said late Thursday that nitrogen gas “was intended to be — and has now proved to be — an effective and humane method of execution.”
Asked about Smith’s shaking and convulsing on the gurney, Alabama corrections Commissioner John Q. Hamm said they appeared to be involuntary movements.
“That was all expected and was in the side effects that we’ve seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,” Hamm said. “Nothing was out of the ordinary from what we were expecting.”
Smith’s spiritual adviser, the Rev. Jeff Hood, said the execution did not match the state attorney general’s prediction in court filings that Smith would lose consciousness in seconds followed by death within minutes.
“We didn’t see somebody go unconscious in 30 seconds. What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,” said Hood, who attended the execution.
Some doctors and organizations had expressed alarm about the method, and Smith’s attorneys asked the Supreme Court to halt the execution to review claims that it violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserved more legal scrutiny before it was used on a person.
“There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person,” Smith’s attorneys wrote.
In her dissent, Sotomayor said Alabama has shrouded its execution protocol in secrecy, releasing only a heavily redacted version. She added that Smith should have been allowed to obtain evidence about the protocol and to proceed with his legal challenge.
“That information is important not only to Smith, who has an extra reason to fear the gurney, but to anyone the State seeks to execute after him using this novel method,” Sotomayor wrote.
“Twice now this Court has ignored Smith’s warning that Alabama will subject him to an unconstitutional risk of pain,” Sotomayor wrote. “I sincerely hope that he is not proven correct a second time.”
Justice Elena Kagan wrote a separate dissent and was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
In his final hours, Smith met with family members and his spiritual adviser, according to a prison spokesperson.
Smith ate a last meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Hood said by telephone before the execution was carried out.
“He’s terrified at the torture that could come. But he’s also at peace. One of the things he told me is he is finally getting out,” Hood said.
The execution protocol called for Smith to be strapped to a gurney in the execution chamber — the same one where he was strapped down for several hours during the lethal injection attempt — and a “full facepiece supplied air respirator” to be placed over his face. After he had a chance to make a final statement, the warden, from another room, was to activate the nitrogen gas. It would be administered through the mask for at least 15 minutes or “five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,” according to the state protocol.

Hamm, the corrections commissioner, confirmed afterward that the gas was flowing for about 15 minutes.
Sant’Egidio Community, a Vatican-affiliated Catholic charity based in Rome, had urged Alabama not to go through with the execution, saying the method is “barbarous” and “uncivilized” and would bring “indelible shame” to the state. And experts appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute people because the drugs used in lethal injections have become difficult to find. Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, but no state had attempted to use the untested method until now.
Smith’s attorneys had raised concerns that he could choke to death on his own vomit as the nitrogen gas flows. The state made a last-minute procedural change so he would not be allowed food in the eight hours beforehand.
Sennett was found dead in her home March 18, 1988, with eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck. Smith was one of two men convicted in the killing. The other, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
Prosecutors said they were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. The husband, Charles Sennett Sr., killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect, according to court documents.
Smith’s 1989 conviction was overturned, but he was convicted again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge overrode that and sentenced him to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury’s death penalty decision."
WZVVM6K0ES_XGM6XHR5LCMEU6C,Green River killer’s last known victim’s remains are identified,_,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/green-river-killer-gary-ridgway-tammie-liles-408b3636857b936df5465143ff49d7e2,"SEATTLE (AP) — The last known set of remains linked to the Green River serial killer in Washington state belonged to a teenage girl who had previously been identified as a victim, authorities confirmed on Monday.
The remains were identified as those of 16-year-old Tammie Liles, the King County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. She was from Everett, Washington, north of Seattle, according to local media reports.
Authorities had previously identified another set of partial remains as also belonging to Liles. There are no other unidentified remains believed to be connected to Gary Ridgway, known as the Green River killer, according to the sheriff’s office.
Ridgway preyed on girls and young women in the Seattle area who were in vulnerable positions, including sex workers and runaways, in the 1980s and 1990s. He was long a suspect in the Green River killings — so called because the first victims were found in the waterway, which runs through suburbs south of Seattle. Detectives were unable to prove his role until 2001, when advances in DNA technology allowed them to link a saliva sample they had obtained from him in 1987 to semen found on several victims.
King County sheriff’s spokesperson Eric White told The Seattle Times that officials feel a sense of relief that they’ve been able to give family members of Ridgway’s victims answers about what happened to their loved ones.

“It’s an immense feeling of satisfaction that in this case, that started in the early 80s, we are able to identify all of Gary Ridgway’s victims,” White said Monday. “All 49 of them.”
Law enforcement identified Liles as a victim of the Green River killer in 1988 by matching her dental records to remains discovered near Tigard, Oregon. Ridgway led authorities to the second set of Liles’ remains in southern King County in 2003.
Investigators took a DNA sample from that second set of remains and uploaded it to a national law enforcement database to search for matches at the time, but none were found. In 2022, the Sheriff’s Office contracted with Othram, a Texas-based genetic genealogy company that specializes in forensic DNA work.

XCREWHOQ5U_UHBY02RYJFWMQMR,A thinned-out primary and friendly voting structure clear an easy path for Trump in Nevada,By GABE STERN,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/nevada-caucus-primary-elections-7d2c8df07451f5c0145a75f89ade11c7,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A thinned-out primary field and a group of Nevada Republicans loyal to Donald Trump have put the former president on an easy path to sweep the state’s Republican delegates and made the third state in the GOP primary calendar a national non-factor.
Nevada will have two contests in February. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley will run in the Feb. 6 primary that the Nevada secretary of state is required to operate. Trump will run instead in the Feb. 8 caucuses operated by the state Republican Party, which has decided that only its caucuses will count for the purposes of awarding delegates.
The changes, which could confuse thousands of voters who receive primary mail ballots without Trump on them, also diminish the influence Nevada would have as any early, competitive nominating state.
Trump allies within the state Republican Party engineered changes last year that set them up for caucuses and imposed restrictions that rivals including Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis felt made the process unfair. They’re part of a broader pattern of state Republican parties closely aligning with Trump as he looks to quickly lock in the Republican nomination.
Haley, the last major contender against Trump, is bypassing Nevada altogether and instead campaigning in her home state of South Carolina, which holds a Feb. 24 primary.

“Talk to the people in Nevada: They will tell you the caucuses have been sealed up, bought and paid for a long time,” she told reporters in New Hampshire. ”That’s the Trump train rolling through that. But we’re going to focus on the states that are fair.”
Back in 2021, Democrats who controlled state government passed a law requiring the state to hold a presidential preference primary. The state’s elections are some of the most expansive in the country, with a universal mail ballot system sent to every registered voter unless they opt out.
But close allies of Trump in the Nevada GOP decided to bypass that process and hold their own caucus two days later — complete with on-site voter ID requirements, paper ballots and only same-day voting in a two-and-a-half hour window on a Thursday evening.
Michael McDonald, the Nevada GOP chairman, has told The Associated Press that the party pushed the caucus since Democrats in the state Legislature did not consider Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s election measures, particularly voter ID. Nevada Republicans have also held caucuses in the past when deciding their nominee.
Lombardo criticized the state Republican party’s decision to hold a caucus as confusing to voters, as have other Republicans across the state. But he still plans to caucus for Trump.
The state Republican Party also gave candidates an ultimatum: candidates who sign up for the Feb. 6 state-run primary would be barred from the Feb. 8 party-run caucus. Haley opted for the primary, while Trump chose the caucus.
While Trump is left off the primary ballot sent to Republican voters, he is the only major candidate eligible for Nevada’s 26 delegates. He’ll face longshot Ryan Binkley in the party-run caucus, who received about 0.1% of the New Hampshire vote.
“It’s been very confusing to me for quite a long time,” said Henry Vanderleest, a resident of Sparks, which neighbors Reno. “But as we get closer I’m starting to figure some of it out. But it shouldn’t be this confusing at this stage.”
Former Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Sen Tim Scott will also be on the primary ballot, since they declared for that contest before they dropped out. DeSantis, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie chose the caucus before they left the field.
Caucuses, which typically reward base support and organizing, are expected to benefit Trump given his solid grip on the GOP’s most loyal voters. While campaign staffers are allowed to try and sway voters during the caucus meetings, the state party passed rules when the primary field was more crowded to restrict super PACs, like the one DeSantis had been relying on, from trying to bolster support for candidates in a caucus.
The Nevada GOP is also run by Trump allies, three of whom have been indicted on felony charges related to their roles as so-called “fake electors,” who submitted certificates to Congress falsely declaring Trump the winner of the 2020 presidential election in Nevada when Biden was the actual winner. Transcripts released in late 2022 show that Trump communicated directly with McDonald in the elector scheme.
The primary mail ballot without Trump is sitting unopened on Vanderleest’s “semi-junk pile” on his desk, he said. None of the candidates appeal to him, and the voting process has stumped him. He knew that Trump would not be on the ballot but was not sure if he was allowed to vote in both contests — which he is.
“I just think for people that don’t follow this or don’t have time to follow this, it’s very confusing,” he said, laying blame on both the quality of candidates and the voting process for why he will sit this election out.

XE8ASC027O_VA535ZMA8WT0LGJ,Syria pushes back against Jordanian strikes on drug traffickers on Syrian territory,By ALBERT AJI and OMAR AKOUR,_,20240116,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/syria-jordan-drug-trafficking-captagon-strikes-223a1edf45ecd890be78408503c3f992,"DAMASCUS (AP) — Syria’s foreign ministry in a statement Tuesday condemned recent presumed Jordanian airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers on Syrian territory, including one last week that killed women and children.
In response, Jordan accused the Syrians of failing to take action to halt smuggling across the border.
The Syrian foreign ministry statement, its first to address the issue, “expressed its deep regret over the strikes directed by the Jordanian Air Force,” which it said had been justified “as being directed at elements involved in drug smuggling across the border into Jordan.”
Smugglers have used Jordan as a corridor over the past years to smuggle highly addictive Captagon amphetamines out of Syria, mainly to oil-rich Arab Gulf states.
The Syrian statement said there was “no justification for such military operations,” adding that “since 2011 (Syria) has suffered from the influx of tens of thousands of terrorists and the passage of huge quantities of weapons from neighboring countries, including Jordan.”

An airstrike in the province of Sweida in southern Syria early Thursday killed at least nine people and was probably carried out by Jordan’s air force, Syrian opposition activists said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said nine people, including two children and at least three women, were killed in the strike.
The Jordanian foreign ministry in a statement of its own said that “the smuggling of drugs and weapons across the Syrian border into Jordan is a threat to national security, and that Jordan will continue to confront this danger and all those behind it.” The statement did not specifically mention airstrikes.
The ministry said that Jordan was ready to coordinate with Syria to stop the smuggling operations. It also said it had provided the Syrian government “with the names of the smugglers and the parties behind them, and the places of drug manufacturing and storage and smuggling lines, which are under the control of the Syrian government, but any real action to neutralize this danger did not take place.”
Jordan helped to facilitate Syria’s return to the Arab League last year, 12 years after the league suspended Damascus because of the harsh crackdown on anti-government protesters in an uprising that quickly descended into a brutal civil war.
At the time of Syria’s readmission, the league expressed hope that its reintegration would help push it to combat drug trafficking. Jordan and the Arab Gulf countries, in particular, have been concerned about the mass production of Captagon in Syria.
The Jordanian authorities have recently cracked down on smuggling attempts, including some in which smugglers used drones to fly the drugs over the border.

XHL2A7TLIF_3E5DZKW4BG7OGRP,Governor eyes overhaul of Pennsylvania higher ed system that’s among the worst in affordability,By MARC LEVY,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-higher-education-budget-governor-shapiro-0db4757b03e14777161476a05caea112,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Gov. Josh Shapiro plans next month to propose an overhaul of a higher education system in Pennsylvania that is among the worst in the nation in affordability, his administration said Friday.
Aspects of the plan will include lowering tuition at state-owned universities, coordinating their degree programs with community colleges and funding institutions based, at least in part, on performance metrics. It also would mean more grant money, including for students who attend private universities in Pennsylvania.
The administration did not release many specifics and said the Democratic governor would give more details in his Feb. 6 budget address, using ideas that sprang from a working group of college and university presidents assembled by Shapiro last year.
In his budget address last year, Shapiro said it is time “to rethink our system of higher education – because what we’re doing isn’t working.”
The proposal will be received by Pennsylvania’s politically divided Legislature, where Democrats issued statements of support Friday and Republicans responded warily after years of partisan friction over funding.

The chancellor of the state system, Dan Greenstein, has worked to consolidate the universities and warned for years that Pennsylvania needs to greatly increase the number of adults with degrees for its economy to meet demand and keep pace with other states.
By just about every measure there is, Pennsylvania is ranked at the bottom among states in the level of higher education aid, size of student debt and affordability of its colleges. Pennsylvania ranks 48th in higher education affordability and spends less per capita on higher education aid than any other state except New Hampshire, Shapiro’s administration said.
This year’s state government spending of $2 billion on higher education is virtually the same as it was 16 years ago.
In a 2021 analysis, the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said Pennsylvania was neck-and-neck with South Carolina, Mississippi and Alabama for the highest price of a public four-year university as a share of median household income, at 34%. The lowest states were at less than half that share.
Meanwhile, enrollment at community colleges and state-owned universities slid by about one-third the past decade, the administration said. The system’s data shows a significant drop-off in students from families whose household income is below $100,000.
In his budget, Shapiro will propose “significant” aid for state-owned universities, community colleges and their students, the administration said. In addition, Shapiro will seek to raise grants by $1,000 — up from the maximum award of $5,750 — for Pennsylvania students who attend college in the state.
The 10 state-owned universities — including 14 campuses — and 15 independent community colleges should be united under a governance system that improves coordination between the schools and lowers costs by limiting the competition and duplication between them, the administration said.
After that, Shapiro wants to cut tuition and fees at state-owned universities to no more than $1,000 a semester for Pennsylvania students whose household income is below the state median of about $70,000.
The administration couldn’t immediately say how much money the plan would require, where Shapiro would get the money or where that amount of aid would place Pennsylvania in state rankings.
Tuition and fees at state-owned schools can run about $11,000 a year, not including the cost of a dorm room and meal plan that can run another $10,000. Students with family income below $70,000 likely receive financial aid that lowers their costs, the system said.
Eventually, the state would develop an aid formula rewarding higher education institutions for factors including growing enrollment and graduation rate, the administration said.
Schools would get incentives to help students earn degrees or credentials in growing fields and fields with workforce shortages, the administration said.
Much of the plan would not affect the state’s largest universities, including Penn State, Temple and Pitt, which are getting nearly $600 million in aid this year to help subsidize tuition for in-state students.
This story has been corrected to show the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education has 10 universities and 14 campuses, instead of 14 universities.

XIV72OQZ5O_U7WDR8YBNU8UUK4,Blinken pitches the US as an alternative to Russia’s Wagner in Africa’s troubled Sahel,By CHINEDU ASADU,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/africa-sahel-blinken-wagner-coups-nigeria-8e14621ee695dda7097f89783a3c42a2,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday pitched the United States as a better security partner for Africa in place of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, which he accused of exploiting coup-hit and conflict-hit nations in the continent’s Sahel region.
Blinken, who is visiting Nigeria as part of an Africa tour to strengthen bilateral relations, said the U.S. will continue to support Nigeria and other regional partners in their efforts to help stabilize the Sahel, the vast region south of the Sahara Desert that Islamic extremist groups have turned into a global terror hot spot as it struggles with a recent spate of coups.
“We hope it can make a difference in restoring the constitutional order and restoring a critical partner in trying to find security in the region,” Blinken told reporters in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, speaking in particular about Niger, where a coup has threatened years of support by Western and European nations.
Until Niger’s elected President Mohamed Bazoum was deposed by his elite soldiers in July, the country had played a critical role in U.S. counterterrorism activity in the Sahel and was seen as one of the last democratic nations in the region to partner with to counter jihadi violence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.
But as Niger faced sanctions from neighbors, the West and Europe, its new junta severed military ties with European nations and turned to Russia for security partnership. Neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali, which have also had two coups each since 2020, have also taken similar steps.

Wagner, which is active in parts of Africa including Mali, was also one of the first sources of help that Niger’s military leaders reached out to for support after the coup.
In those African countries where Wagner is offering security support, “what we’ve seen is actually a problem (of insecurity) getting manifestly worse and worse,” Blinken said.
“You see the exploitation of people and resources by Wagner … Having said that, it’s important that we’ve been working to support our partners who are trying to find effective ways of fighting insecurity,” he added.
Blinken said that one key aspect of U.S. support to Nigeria and the rest of the Sahel is to strengthen the capacity of their security forces in terms of equipment and technology, intelligence sharing, and technical support.
“It goes to having a comprehensive approach that genuinely focuses on citizens’ security, working with local communities in partnership, demonstrating the security forces that are there, first and foremost, to protect them and to support their needs,” he added.
At a time when observers say issues concerning Africa seem to have been pushed to the back burner under President Joe Biden’s administration, such a trip by Blinken presents an opportunity to “move partnerships forward in strengthening democratic institutions” in the continent, according to Oge Onubogu, director of the Africa Program at the U.S.-based Wilson Center think tank.
Beyond supporting regional efforts to reverse the recent coups, Onubogu said America must also help in addressing the root causes of the military takeovers seen by some citizens as “an opportunity to transition to something better.”
“This trip presents an opportunity for the U.S. to have real constructive discussions with civil society actors, think tanks in the region and some government actors about what how to adapt to systems that we currently have to transition to something that is in the best interest of African citizens,” she said.

XJRO88DPGF_C1Q31EYJB3RS093,Fox News allowed to pursue claims that voting firm’s defamation suit is anti-free speech,By JENNIFER PELTZ,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/smartmatic-fox-news-lawsuit-election-2020-d8c21fa122841784beb5213b149f0d62,"NEW YORK (AP) — A judge refused this week to toss out Fox News’ claims that voting technology company Smartmatic is suing the network to suppress free speech. The ruling means that both Smartmatic’s multibillion-dollar defamation lawsuit and the network’s counterclaims can continue toward an eventual trial.
Smartmatic says Fox News spread ruinous lies that the voting company helped rig the 2020 election against then-U.S. President Donald Trump. The network denies the allegations and is countersuing under a New York law against launching baseless litigation to squelch reporting or criticism on public issues — known as “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP, in legal parlance.
Smartmatic’s nearly 3-year-old suit is separate from, but similar to, the Dominion Voting Systems case that Fox settled for $787 million last year. Fox didn’t apologize but acknowledged that the court in that case had found “certain claims about Dominion to be false.”
Both sides in the Smartmatic case have tried unsuccessfully to get the other’s claims tossed out. Trial and appellate courts already gave Smartmatic the green light to continue. On Wednesday, trial Judge David B. Cohen said Fox News’ counterclaims also could go ahead.
Fox’s argument — essentially, that Smartmatic’s $2.7 billion claim is so inflated that it could only be meant to silence the network — “has not yet been adjudicated in any court,” Cohen wrote in his decision, filed Tuesday.

The Associated Press sent email messages seeking comment to the network and to Smartmatic’s attorneys.
Florida-based Smartmatic says that in the 2020 presidential election, its technology and software were used only in California’s Los Angeles County. The Democratic bastion — not seen as an election battleground — went for the Democratic nominee, current President Joe Biden.
But in Fox News appearances after Election Day 2020, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed Smartmatic as part of a broad scheme to steal the vote from the Republican incumbent. Giuliani asserted that the company had been “formed in order to fix elections.” Powell called it a “huge criminal conspiracy,” and the two claimed that proof would be forthcoming.
Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump’s own attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Trump’s allegations of fraud also were roundly rejected by dozens of courts, including by judges whom he had appointed.
A Delaware judge presiding over the Dominion lawsuit ruled last March that it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations that Trump allies made on Fox News about that company were true. The case was going to trial when Fox settled.
The Dominion case involved some of the same broadcasts and statements as the Smartmatic suit, and Smartmatic argued that the Delaware ruling should blow Fox’s counterclaims out of the water. Cohen said otherwise, citing — among other things — particulars of legal doctrine about when decisions in one case apply to another.
“Not all elements of plaintiff’s defamation claims have been already been determined” against Fox, he wrote.
Smartmatic blames Fox for ruining its reputation and business. Its value declined to “a fraction of what it was,” and support lines, customer-service inboxes and company officers were deluged with threats after the broadcasts, the voting company has said in court papers.
Fox News has said it was simply covering influential figures — the president and his lawyers — making undeniably newsworthy allegations of election fraud. The network also maintains that Smartmatic is greatly overstating its losses and Fox’s responsibility for them.
In its counterclaims, Fox is seeking attorneys’ fees and costs."
XSK17RYT8C_87VGHBXGNJ763WT,What you should know if you’re about to fly on a Boeing Max 9,By Associated Press,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/boeing-max-grounding-airline-safety-dda05383ea65cd78eb9f3078830cc677,"Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners are carrying passengers in the United States again for the first time since they were grounded after a panel blew out of the side of one of the planes.
Alaska Airlines resumed a limited number of flights with its Max 9s on Friday. United aims to follow suit on Sunday, but a spokeswoman said the airline might use them as spare planes Friday or Saturday.
Those are the only two U.S. airlines that operate this particular model of the Boeing 737.
After seeing video of the frightening flight of a plane with a gaping hole in its side, passengers might reasonably be asking questions about safety.
The Federal Aviation Administration has detailed the process that airlines must follow to inspect — and if necessary, repair — the panels called door plugs, one of which broke loose on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on Jan. 5. The plugs are used to seal holes left for extra doors on the Max 9 when an unusually high number of seats requires more exits for safety reasons.

FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker says his agency’s review of everything that has happened since the accident, including gathering information about inspections of door plugs on 40 other planes, gives him confidence that they will be safe so long as the new inspection process is followed.
Alaska Airlines grounded all 65 of its Max 9 jets within hours after one of the two door plugs in the back half of the cabin of flight 1282 blew away while 16,000 feet above Oregon. The FAA grounded all Max 9s in the U.S. the day after the blowout.
Even though none of the passengers were seriously injured, regulators acted quickly because the accident could have been far worse.
By a stroke of luck, the two seats closest to the panel that blew off the plane were empty when flight 1282 took off from Portland, Oregon. And the plane had not yet reached cruising altitude of more than 30,000 feet, when passengers and flight attendants might have been walking around instead of being belted into their seats.
Airlines found problems on other planes. Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci told NBC this week that “many” of the planes they inspected had loose bolts that are supposed to help secure the door plug to the airframe of the jet. United Airlines made similar similar findings.
The FAA is requiring airlines to conduct “detailed visual inspections” of the door plugs and other components, adjust fasteners and fix any damage they find before putting Max 9s back into service. The agency says the process was developed by what they learned from inspections of 40 grounded planes.
United says the process involves removing an inner panel, two rows of seats and a sidewall liner from the cabin. Technicians open the door plug, inspect it and the surrounding hardware, and make any necessary repairs before resecuring the panel.
Alaska Airlines officials said Thursday that they have lost a few sales among people purchasing flights into February — a phenomenon called “booking away” in the airline business. They didn’t say how many people have booked away from the Max 9, but they predicted it would only last a few weeks.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File)
Minicucci, the Alaska CEO, said “at first, people will have some questions, some anxiety,” but that “over time” confidence in the plane’s safety will be restored.
Travelers returned to the Boeing 737 Max 8 after two of them crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. In that case, Boeing had to redesign an automated flight-control system before the FAA would let Max 8s and Max 9s resume flying after a 20-month grounding.
Most people don’t bother to look up the type of plane they are booked to fly, although there was an uptick after flight 1282. Scott Keyes, founder of the travel site Going, said once FAA clears the planes to fly — and if there are no more incidents — the public’s memory will quickly fade.
Airline websites typically now include the type of aircraft to be used on a particular flight, but finding the information varies.
On American Airlines’ website, the type of plane shows up right on the search-results page. On the United and Alaska sites, however, you will need to take one more step: Click on “details.” On Southwest Airlines, you’ll have to click on the flight number — it’s in blue — to see the aircraft type.
It’s much safer than driving and also safer than rail travel on a per mile basis, according to U.S. Department of Transportation figures.
Airline officials and aviation regulators like to point out that there has not been a fatal crash of a U.S. airliner since 2009. However, in the past year there has been an sharp increase in close calls being investigated by federal officials.
The FAA is investigating whether Boeing and its suppliers followed proper safety procedures in manufacturing the part that blew off the Alaska jet. That could lead to sanctions.
In addition, the FAA says it won’t let Boeing expand production of Max jets until it’s satisfied that quality-control concerns about the company have been resolved.
Rival Airbus has pulled far ahead of Boeing, beating the U.S. company last year in both orders and deliveries of new passenger planes. Boeing’s latest crisis could make things worse. United CEO Scott Kirby says his airline will consider alternatives to the upcoming Max 10 because of uncertainty about when and whether the FAA will certify the plane, which is already years behind schedule."
Y26ZWINTRT_VBEBQT1V7OO2EBT,Tensions simmering in the South China Sea and violence in Myanmar as Laos takes over ASEAN chair,By DAVID RISING,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/laos-asean-2024-chair-china-sea-myanmar-32f8e7c97d03e439f8bb91b499e4a824,"BANGKOK (AP) — Simmering tensions in the South China Sea between China and several Southeast Asian nations now regularly spark direct confrontation. Fighting in Myanmar against the military government that seized power three years ago has grown to the point that most say the country is now in a civil war.
Hopes were high that Indonesia might be able to make significant inroads on both issues during its 2023 chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, using its clout as the bloc’s largest country, but little progress was made. Now Laos, the bloc’s poorest and one of its smallest countries, has taken over the rotating chair.
As foreign ministers gather in Luang Prabang for this year’s first top-level meetings over the weekend, many are pessimistic that ASEAN can keep its biggest challenges from festering and growing.
“There were so many expectations when Indonesia started its presidency and some of those expectations fell short,” said Shafiah Muhibat, an expert with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Indonesia.
“So with Indonesia moving on to Laos, I think the expectations are quite low in terms of what Laos can actually do.”

After the military seized control of Myanmar in February 2021 from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, ASEAN — comprised of Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Brunei and Laos — came up with a “Five-Point Consensus” plan for peace.
The military leadership in Myanmar has so far ignored the plan. At the same time, a humanitarian crisis is growing, with more than 2.6 million people forced from their homes due to escalating violence, according to the United Nations.
Indonesia, despite touting more than 180 “engagements” with stakeholders in Myanmar, was unable to achieve a breakthrough.
ASEAN’s plan calls for the immediate cessation of violence, a dialogue among all concerned parties, mediation by an ASEAN special envoy, provision of humanitarian aid through ASEAN channels, and a visit to Myanmar by the special envoy to meet all concerned parties.
“ASEAN actually has very little leverage on Myanmar; Myanmar doesn’t care about ASEAN at all,” said Muhammad Faizal, with the Institute of Defense and Strategic studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “They don’t give a hoot about the five-point consensus.”
During its ASEAN chairmanship, Indonesia established an official office of the special envoy, increasing the resources for the position, and the veteran Laotian diplomat who assumed the role has already been to Myanmar and met with the head of the ruling military council and other top officials. To ensure continuity in dealing with Myanmar, Indonesia also established a troika mechanism made up of the past, current and next chair of ASEAN — currently Indonesia, Laos and Malaysia.
The troika will provide “capacity and support” for Laos during its year as chair, meaning the country won’t have to go it alone, said Peter Haymond, former United States Ambassador to Laos from 2020 to 2023 who is now with the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii.
“ASEAN only really carries weight if it’s able to speak as one group … so this troika is put together specifically by the ASEAN partners with Lao concurrence,” he said on the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Southeast Asia Radio podcast in November.
“I think Lao was looking for help.”
Still, it’s likely Laos will approach the situation in Myanmar from its own perspective as the first ASEAN nation since the military takeover to share a border with the country, Faizal said.
“They want to maintain the cross-border security cooperation with the Myanmar junta, and think that it is probably in their interest to make sure that the junta remains the authority in Myanmar. Though, in reality, that may not be the case,” he said in a telephone interview.
At the moment, the Myanmar military is losing ground to a concerted offensive launched in October by three powerful militias that have since been joined by several others around the country.
China is seen to be at least tacitly supporting the initial group, known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance, stemming partially from Beijing’s growing irritation at the flourishing drug trade and other criminality across its border with Myanmar. It also has strong influence with the country’s military rulers.
Communist Laos is one of the ASEAN countries with the closest ties to Beijing, so it will be interesting to see whether it tries to enlist Chinese support in resolving the Myanmar conflict, Faizal said.
“It’s quite obvious that both the junta and the other groups are trying to gain the support or the favor of China,” Faizal said.
Beijing maintains it will not interfere in the internal affairs of other states, so it’s unclear whether it would want to take on a greater role in trying to end the conflict in Myanmar, even if it were acceptable to other ASEAN members.
Many are locked in maritime disputes with China over its claims of sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea, one of the world’s most crucial waterways for shipping.
The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei, all have their own claims over islands, reefs and undersea resources in the region. Indonesia has also expressed concern about what it sees as Beijing’s encroachment on its exclusive economic zone in the waters.
In 2012, China and ASEAN agreed to a declaration on conduct in the South China Sea, seeking to “enhance favorable conditions for a peaceful and durable solution of differences and disputes,” but there has been little sign of goodwill recently.
The decades long territorial dispute escalated between Beijing and Manila last year, sparking fears it could degenerate into a major conflict that could involve the United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines.
Chinese coast guard ships and accompanying vessels used military-grade laser and water cannons against Philippine coast guard and supply vessels and undertook dangerous maneuvers near disputed shoals, prompting the Philippines to file a large number of diplomatic protests against China.
In December, China vowed to keep up its military pressure on the Philippines, and Philippine officials have grown increasingly discontented by what they see as a lack of support from other ASEAN countries.
The situation is unlikely to change under landlocked Laos’ leadership, especially given its ties to Beijing, Faizal said.
During its past chairmanship in 2016, Laos was able to strike a balance between all sides, coming up with a compromise that officials later characterized as making everyone equally unhappy.
However, Laos, with a population of 7.4 million, has since grown increasingly beholden to its giant neighbor to the north, Faizal noted, with massive amounts of debt to Chinese state banks for multiple infrastructure projects, including a new high-speed rail line across the country.
“They will have come under a lot of pressure from China, because they’re basically dependent upon China for everything,” he said. “I believe they will probably just try to maintain the status quo — not doing more, but just maintaining what is there now.”"
YJA9BXUSLI_PD8CBPH4ROD3UFJ,UN court to issue ruling Friday on South Africa’s request for order to halt Israel’s Gaza offensive,By MIKE CORDER,_,20240124,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-genocide-africa-court-fa3e8aca5c2b90871c6c78b10bc276b6,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Nations’ top court will issue a decision Friday on South Africa’s request for interim orders in a genocide case against Israel, including that Israel halt its offensive in Gaza.
The decision is a preliminary stage of a case filed by South Africa at the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel’s military action in its war with Hamas in Gaza amounts to genocide. Israel strongly rejects the accusation and has asked the court to throw out the case.
The court in The Hague, Netherlands, announced the timing of the interim ruling on Wednesday. South Africa’s Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor would travel to The Hague to represent the country at Friday’s ruling.
Israel launched its massive air and ground assault on Gaza soon after Hamas militants stormed through Israeli communities on Oct. 7 and killed some 1,200 people, mainly civilians.
Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But the country’s leaders sent a high-level legal team to two days of hearings earlier this month. That was a sign of how seriously they regard the case and an indication of likely concerns that any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country’s international standing.

If the court grants some or all of South Africa’s eight requests for so-called provisional measures, it is unclear if Israel will comply.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the offensive until “complete victory” against Hamas, which started the war with its assault across the border on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250.
Gaza’s Health Ministry says the offensive has killed at least 25,490 people — the majority women and children — and wounded another 63,354. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. U.N. officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Israel’s attacks have driven nearly 85% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million from their homes. Much of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, has been reduced to rubble.
Friday’s ruling will not be on the merits of South Africa’s claims. Israel can still challenge the court’s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the case before any hearings on the legal merits of the case.
For it to order so-called “provisional measures,” the 17-judge panel must decide that the court appears to have jurisdiction in the case, that there is a dispute between South Africa and Israel about the 1948 Genocide Convention and that there is an urgent need to order emergency measures while the case continues.
At hearings earlier this month, South African lawyers said that acts by Israel’s military and statements by senior officials demonstrated intent to commit genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.
“The scale of destruction in Gaza, the targeting of family homes and civilians, the war being a war on children, all make clear that genocidal intent is both understood and has been put into practice. The articulated intent is the destruction of Palestinian life,” said lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
He said the case’s “distinctive feature” was “the reiteration and repetition of genocidal speech throughout every sphere of the state in Israel.”
Malcolm Shaw, part of Israel’s legal team at hearings in The Hague, rejected the accusation of genocidal intent and called remarks cited by South Africa “random quotes not in conformity with government policy.”
Israeli legal advisor Tal Becker told the court that the country is fighting a “war it did not start and did not want.”
“In these circumstances, there can hardly be a charge more false and more malevolent than the allegation against Israel of genocide,” he added, noting that the horrible suffering of civilians in war was not enough to support an allegation of genocide.
The case strikes at the national identity of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.
South Africa’s own identity is key to it bringing the case. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to “homelands” before ending in 1994."
YJQ9P2FPQM_6QVOV1MRL2X1CUN,"Humana warns that rising care costs will persist through 2024, surprises Wall Street with forecast",By TOM MURPHY,_,20240125,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/humana-medicare-advantage-higher-costs-f0fe0eab945bebd1489ab083c3a54d6d,"Humana still doesn’t know why more people were admitted for short hospital stays than it expected late last year, and that is casting a shadow over health insurers early in 2024.
Shares of several companies sank again Thursday after Humana debuted an earnings forecast for the new year that fell about $13 short of analyst expectations. Insurer stocks also dropped last week when Humana first disclosed the hospitalization spike and scaled back expectations for 2023.
Health insurers typically see a rise in claims toward the end of each year as flu cases climb and people schedule surgeries before their coverage deductibles renew in January and their out-of-pocket costs rise.
But Humana executives told analysts Thursday that the jump in costs they saw in November and December for Medicare Advantage customers wasn’t tied to respiratory illnesses like the flu or COVID-19.
The company saw a rise in patients being admitted to hospitals instead of being held for observation and then released. Chief Financial Officer Susan Diamond said they were still studying claims, but since they don’t see signs that the trend was temporary, they had to assume that it will persist through 2024.

The health insurer also is seeing more growth in care that doesn’t involve a hospital stay, like doctor visits and outpatient surgeries and the use of supplemental benefits.
Medicare Advantage plans are privately run versions of the federal government’s Medicare program mostly for people age 65 and older. Humana has nearly 6 million people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.
Humana leaders said in a statement Thursday that they believe the rising medical costs were an “industry dynamic” that was not specific to Humana. They also said that the costs “may persist for an extended period or, in some cases, permanently reset the baseline.”
Rival UnitedHealth Group Inc., the only insurer with a bigger Medicare Advantage enrollment, also has struggled with cost hikes and its shares tumbled two weeks ago after saying that its medical costs soared 16%.
But UnitedHealth leaders also have stressed that the rising costs wouldn’t affect their expectations for 2024.
Humana Inc. said Thursday that it expects adjusted earnings of about $16 per share for the new year. Analysts had been projecting per-share earns of $29.14, according to the data firm FactSet.
Jefferies analyst David Windley said he thought Humana’s earnings could drop in 2024, maybe to between $20 or $21 per share.
“We did not think $16 was possible,” he said in a research note.
Windley noted that the company appears to be forecasting conservatively by assuming that there will be little moderation in the medical cost trend.
Humana also said Thursday it was backing off a previously announced goal of adjusted earnings of $37 a share for 2025 as it prioritizes improving profitability over enrollment growth.
Shares of Humana, based in Louisville, Kentucky, shed $50 in midday trading. They sank more than 12% to $352.40 while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose slightly.
UnitedHealth dropped 5%. The Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurer Elevance Health also was down even though it reported on Wednesday a medical cost trend that was better than analysts expected."
YL5QD1V8OA_R8BZ4QBPKRY7TG0,"NRA chief Wayne LaPierre takes the stand in his civil trial, defends luxury vacations",_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/nra-wayne-lapierre-lawsuit-trial-fraud-1b3a5644943482d532fb188a878ba5d9,"NEW YORK (AP) — Longtime National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre took the stand in his New York civil trial Friday, defending himself against allegations that he violated the trust of the group’s 5 million members by spending tens of millions of dollars to enrich himself and close associates.
Under questioning from lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James, LaPierre said he didn’t consider luxury vacations to be “gifts” when he accepted them from a couple who did millions of dollars of business over the years in contracts with the NRA.
James brought the lawsuit under her authority to investigate nonprofits registered in New York. Days before the trial began, LaPierre, 74, announced he would step down Jan. 31.
In the Manhattan courtroom, LaPierre acknowledged taking vacations with Hollywood producer David McKenzie, whose company has done business with the NRA. He said he met McKenzie in a business context but considers him a friend.
The state’s lawyers laid out for the jury a series of trips that the two men’s families took together, which McKenzie paid for and LaPierre didn’t disclose in financial forms.

“At the time you didn’t consider a trip to the Greek Isles to be a gift, right?” Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Conley asked LaPierre, in one of many exchanges over the undisclosed vacation travel, lodging and food.
“No, I did not,” LaPierre said.
Conley showed jurors photos of multistoried white yachts LaPierre vacationed on with McKenzie in the Bahamas and the Mediterranean, as well as photos from a trip to India. LaPierre acknowledged that McKenzie paid for commercial flights, hotels and food for many of the trips.
At the time he was making those trips, LaPierre helped McKenzie’s media company secure a 9-year contract with the NRA worth millions, he acknowledged. Conley also noted that McKenzie personally collected $1.8 million alone in property rental fees for filming NRA content in a home he owns in Los Angeles.
Under LaPierre’s leadership, the NRA became a powerful political lobby group, in addition to its role as a firearms training organization. In recent years it has faced financial troubles, dwindling membership and a leadership crisis.
After reporting a $36 million deficit in 2018, the NRA cut back on core programs like training and education, recreational shooting and law enforcement initiatives. Experts have said LaPierre was behind much of the misspending that led to the fiscal downturn, including on employee perks and an unprofitable television venture.
The New York attorney general sued LaPierre and three co-defendants in 2020, alleging they cost the organization tens of millions of dollars by authorizing lucrative consulting contracts for ex-employees and expensing gifts for friends and vendors.
The state is asking the judge to limit the work they can do for the NRA and New York-based nonprofits, and also to make them repay the NRA and even forfeit any salaries earned while misallocating funds.
LaPierre is accused of dodging financial disclosure forms while spending NRA money on travel consultants, luxury car services, and private flights for himself and his family. He has acknowledged spending over $500,000 of the NRA’s money on private airfare for family trips to the Bahamas, but says flying commercial would have put him in danger."
YQZWP91KBX_YJHVBMKLONR6S2D,Rhode Island transportation officials say key bridge may need to be completely demolished,By STEVE LeBLANC,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/washington-bridge-closure-repairs-rhode-island-a6c9263ddc6ace8abd54367f14f24e7b,"Repairs to a critical Rhode Island bridge that was partially shut down over safety concerns last month could include the demolition of the span, state transportation officials said Monday.
Peter Alviti, director of the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, said all options are being considered, including the possibility of a complete rebuild of the bridge that carries Interstate 195 over the Seekonk River from Providence to East Providence and serves as a key gateway to Providence.
He didn’t give any cost estimate but said the repairs would be completed as quickly as safely possible.
“We have several consultants that are assessing the condition of the full bridge structure,” Alviti said. “What they find will determine the scope of the work that we need to do to correct any deficiencies on the bridge.”
Alviti said there are several options available.

“It could be a repair of the existing structure, although extensive. It could be a reconstruction of various components of the bridge structure, or it could be a complete rebuild of the entire bridge,” he said.
The goal is to get traffic flowing as quickly as possible, in phases if necessary, Alviti said. He said the state will give the project priority over all other transportation projects.
He said testing of tension rods has begun, including forensic and chemical analysis.
“We are preparing for all contingencies in terms of funding,” he said.
Gov. Dan McKee also sought to reassure those who depend on the bridge.
McKee said everything that can be done is being done to speed the project along.
“Expert engineers are doing a thorough review of the bridge. That work is ongoing as we speak. We want Rhode Islanders to know that the direction we take with this project will be driven by the facts,” McKee told reporters at an afternoon news conference.
The bridge carries nearly 100,000 vehicles every day.
The sudden westbound closure in mid-December wreaked havoc on traffic, turning a 40-to-45-minute drive into several hours. stranding commuters for hours and sending others veering off their normal path. Some schools closed and held classes remotely.
Westbound traffic was directed to two lanes on the eastbound side. State authorities described the problem as a critical structural failure.
Built in 1969, the westbound portion of the Washington Bridge was rated as “poor” according to the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inventory released in June.
The overall rating of a bridge is based on whether the condition of any one of its individual components — the deck, superstructure, substructure or culvert, if present — is rated poor or below.
Alviti had warned of the bridge’s poor condition in a 2019 grant application to rehabilitate the bridge and make improvements to traffic flow, writing that it was “nearing a permanent state of disrepair.”
The bridge has an inspection frequency of 24 months, according to federal data. State officials said it was last inspected in July."
YW13IWNU7Q_RVISR87U63DQMKQ,Poland’s prime minister visits Ukraine in the latest show of support for Kyiv against Russia,By ILLIA NOVIKOV,_,20240122,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-poland-tusk-visit-65b802f45006832c0a067af8310ac558,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk vowed Monday to keep supporting Ukraine against Russia’s nearly 2-year-old invasion, announcing a new military aid package that includes a loan to buy larger weapons and a commitment to find ways to manufacture them together.
Meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, Tusk said they had reached “an understanding” to resolve through talks any differences between their countries over grain shipments and trucking. Those issues recently soured ties between the neighbors.
Ukraine’s allies have recently sought to reassure the country that they are committed to its long-term defense amid concerns that Western support could be flagging. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France’s new foreign minister also traveled to Kyiv in the new year.
Tusk, who returned to power last month and is keen to show that a change in government won’t alter its Ukraine policy, also met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal.
Kyiv was the first foreign capital he visited since becoming prime minister again, Tusk said. He returned to Polish politics after serving as president of the European Council — one of the European Union’s top jobs.

He framed the war as a wider struggle between Europe and Russia that had repercussions beyond Ukraine, making it a priority for Poland.
“Today Ukraine is shouldering the security matters of the entire European continent, today Ukraine is paying the huge price of blood for the values that are fundamental to the free world,” he said. “Poland’s security is also at stake in this struggle.”
Zelenskyy described the talks as “very productive” and said Poland’s new military aid would include a loan allowing Ukraine to purchase big-ticket weapons. They also assessed opportunities for joint arms production, he said, in line with similar discussions with other allies.
Tusk’s visit came a day after Moscow-installed officials in eastern Ukraine reported that Ukrainian shelling killed 27 people on the outskirts of Russian-occupied Donetsk. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it a “monstrous terrorist act,” and the Russia-backed local authorities declared a day of mourning.
The Ukrainian military, however, denied it had anything to do with the attack.
It was not immediately possible to verify either side’s claims.
Located on NATO’s eastern flank, Poland has been one of Ukraine’s strongest allies. Warsaw has provided weapons and humanitarian aid, and opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.
But relations soured last year as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers angered Poles who said their livelihoods were under threat. Polish farmers and truckers blocked border crossings, causing backups and threatening the flow of some aid to Ukraine.
Polish farmers complained that imports of Ukrainian foods had caused prices to fall, hurting their incomes, while truckers said they were being undercut by their Ukrainian counterparts. The issue surfaced during the war as Ukrainian ports were blocked and food producers turned to road routes through Europe to get their products to market.
At one point, Poland and some other European nations banned Ukrainian grain imports because of the trade dispute.
Poland’s farmers and trucks have ended the protests for now. Tusk has said Warsaw wants to help Ukraine economically but not at the expense of Polish businesses. He has previously suggested that Kyiv needs to better regulate its trucking industry.
Tusk was also scheduled to honor the country’s fighters and attend observances of Ukraine’s Day of Unity, which commemorates the merger in 1919 that brought together its eastern and western regions.
As part of the celebration, Zelenskyy signed a decree that, among other things, instructs the government to preserve the national identity of Ukrainians living in border regions that are now part of Russia, such as Belgorod, Kursk and Briansk. Some of those areas have recently been targeted by Kyiv’s forces.
The decree also aims to establish a center for investigating crimes against Ukrainians on those territories, including forced Russification, political persecutions, and deportations.
In other war-related developments, Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted all eight Shahed drones that Russia launched overnight over southern and central regions of Ukraine.
Debris from three drones shot down over the central Dnipropetrovsk region started a fire at an unidentified business but no casualties were reported.
Elsewhere, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi visited Kharkiv on the third day of his tour of the country. The second-largest city was among the targets of a Jan. 16 Russian missile attack that injured 17 civilians.
Later, Grandi visited children at a school that has relocated to the city’s subway system.
Meanwhile, major Ukrainian digital banking platform Monobank said it came under a massive denial-of-service attack by unidentified hackers. The attack was successfully repelled, the bank said, with no major consequences.

(AP) — Authorities have identified three people killed in an eastern Pennsylvania house fire as two adults and a 7-year-old girl.
The Dauphin County coroner’s office on Monday said the people killed in the early Sunday blaze in North Londonberry Township as 87-year-old Paul Garman of North Londonderry Township, and 60-year-old Cynthia Weatherholtz and 7-year-old Kristi Dougherty, both of Swatara Township, which is in Dauphin County.
The causes of death are still being investigated and autopsies are planned for Tuesday, the coroner’s office said.
Crews were dispatched just after 1:30 a.m. Sunday to the home near Palmyra. The victims were pronounced dead at Hershey Medical Center, said Chief Kevin Snyder of the North Londonderry Township Police Department.
Family members said two adults and another child were taken to the Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center, where a representative declined comment on their condition. The coroner’s office didn’t say whether those who died were related to each other or to the injured victims.
The state police fire marshal’s office is investigating the cause of the fire, Snyder said. He told the Lebanon Daily News that the blaze began in the garage of the home."
YX26IM5TWI_2INXRQU4PCKMPLW,Plea agreement may shorten further time at Guantanamo for 2 in connection with Bali bombings,By ELLEN KNICKMEYER,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/guantanamo-bombings-bali-sentencing-trial-88d54ffb112346f4ee786b977aaeb382,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A military panel at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, recommended 23 years in detention Friday for two Malaysian men in connection with deadly 2002 bombings in Bali, a spokesman for the military commission said.
However, under a previously secret provision of the plea agreement disclosed after the panel’s recommendation Friday, and a separate sentence reduction Friday by the presiding judge, both men may face a far shorter sentence: about five years.
Mohammed Farik Bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep already have spent about 17 years awaiting trial at Guantanamo.
The winding down of the case against them marks comparatively rare convictions in the two decades of proceedings by the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo.
The extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah killed 202 Indonesians, foreign tourists and others in two nearly simultaneous bombings at nightspots on the resort island of Bali in October 2002.

The two defendants denied any role or advance knowledge of the attacks but under the plea bargains admitted they had over the years conspired with the network of militants responsible. The sentence recommendation still requires approval by the senior military authority over Guantanamo.
The two are among a total of 780 detainees brought to military detention at Guantanamo under the George W. Bush administration’s “war on terror” following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S. There have been only a handful of convictions over the years — eight, according to one advocacy group, Reprieve.
Defendants in some of the biggest attacks, including 9/11, remain in pretrial hearings. Prosecutors are seeking negotiated agreements to close that case and some others.
The prosecutions overall at Guantanamo have been plagued by logistical difficulties, frequent turnover of judges and others, and legal questions surrounding the torture of detainees during CIA custody in the first years of their detention.
The military’s head of defense for the Guantanamo prosecutions on Friday blamed the Bush administration’s early handling of the detainees — which included holding at secret “black sites” and torture in CIA custody — for the more than 20-year delay in the trial.
The slow pace “was extremely distressing and frustrated the desire of everyone for accountability and justice,” Brig. Gen. Jackie Thompson said in a statement.
Thirty detainees remain at Guantanamo. Sixteen of them have been cleared and are eligible for transfer out if a stable country agrees to take them. “The time for repatriating or transferring the cleared men is now,” Thompson said. He said the same for three others held at Guantanamo but never charged.
As part of their plea bargains, the two Malaysian men have agreed to provide testimony against a third Guantanamo detainee, an Indonesian man known as Hambali, in the Bali bombings.
Under military court rules, Bin Amin and Bin Lep normally would receive no credit for the roughly two decades they have already spent in detention. The pre-trial agreement disclosed Friday would spare them from serving the much longer recommended sentence on top of their years awaiting trial, the defense lawyers for the two men said.
Relatives of some of those killed in the Bali bombings testified Wednesday in a hearing in advance of sentencing, with the two accused in the courtroom and listening attentively.
“The reach of this atrocity knew no bounds, and has affected very many people,” testified Matthew Arnold of Birmingham, England, who lost his brother in the attacks.
A panel of five military officers delivered the recommendation after listening to the sentencing testimony.
The U.S. and Malaysia may agree to transferring the two to their home country, said Brian Bouffard, the attorney for Bin Lep."

(AP) — Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott on Tuesday proposed an $8.6 billion budget for fiscal year 2025 and, as he has done before, urged lawmakers not to raise taxes or fees for Vermonters, saying it will be a tough budget year.
The budget proposal makes investments in the priorities the governor focused on earlier this month in his state-of-the-state address: affordability, public safety and housing.
“I also understand the realities of a supermajority, which means you don’t have to listen, or even consider, my priorities or objections,” he told lawmakers assembled in the House chamber for his budget address. “But I bet many of you do hear, and maybe even share, some of my concerns. More importantly, I’m pretty sure the majority of our constituents certainly do.”
Scott urged lawmakers to work with the administration to fix, not just fund, the problems.
Last year, Scott vetoed the $8.5 billion budget bill that was largest spending plan in state history. But the Democratic-controlled legislature overrode his veto.

He said Tuesday that he doesn’t believe there will be a lot of disagreement about what is in his budget plan but likely in what is not included. Federal pandemic-era funds have ended, and the state has returned to pre-pandemic spending levels, he warned. While the state had a recent increase in revenues, it has had unexpected costs, too, he said.
House Speaker Jill Krowinski, a Democrat, said Vermont has challenges, but it also has opportunities. “I think his speech was long on fear and short on hope,” she told WCAX-TV.
Among the investments are $4.9 million of the opioid settlement funds to increase the amount of staff and hours in three or more hubs for drug treatment and to support the work of re-entry and recovery centers for those leaving incarceration, according to the budget summary. He also suggests investing $1.7 million for 20 mental health workers in state police barracks and $6 million in a program that provides grants to improve vacant rental housing units and add housing units to existing buildings.
After catastrophic flooding hit Vermont in July, Scott proposes using $12.5 million to help communities with their state match requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance to mitigate flood hazards and $500,000 for a state match for federal funding to evaluate future flood measures for the Winooski River."

With just over 11,500 people, Tuvalu is one of the smallest nations in the world, but the election for the 16-seat parliament was being closely watched. After the vote count, parliamentary negotiations will form a new government and elect the prime minister. Polls opened at 8 a.m. and were to close at 4 p.m.
Prime Minister Kausea Natano is running again, but even reelection to parliament won’t guarantee him the top post.
Finance Minister Seve Paeniu is challenging him, and opposition leader Enele Sopoaga is hoping to again be prime minister, after losing out to Natano after the 2019 election.
The elections come as China, the United States and others wrangle for influence in the strategically crucial region.

Tuvalu, a British colony until 1978, is one of only 12 countries that have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island that China claims as its own territory.

But China has been pushing those Taiwan allies to switch their alliance. Natano has so far rebuffed Beijing, but that could change after this election. Nauru, another small Pacific nation, recently switched its support from Taiwan to China.
Paeniu has said he wants to review Tuvalu’s relationships with both Taiwan and China.
Global warming is another big issue, as Tuvalu’s low-lying atolls routinely flood.
A proposed security treaty between Tuvalu and Australia could also hang in the balance. The treaty commits Australia to help Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, health pandemics and military aggression. The treaty gives also Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country, including China.
Debate on the treaty has been divisive and it has yet to be ratified. Sopoaga has said he would reject it.

At least 10 bullets struck the truck, which was seen by The Associated Press after Israeli investigators examined it. Most hit the back windshield and truck bed, supporting 16-year-old Mohammed Salameh’s account of the incident that killed his friend, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17, a Louisiana native.

(AP Photo/Nasser Nasser)
In an initial statement, Israeli police said Friday’s shooting targeted people “purportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities along Highway 60,” a main West Bank thoroughfare. Police didn’t identify who fired the shots but described the incident “ostensibly involving an off-duty law enforcement officer, a soldier and a civilian.”
Salameh denied suggestions he and Abdel Jabbar had been throwing stones and said there had been no attempt to arrest him.

Salameh — interviewed Tuesday along with Abdel Jabbar’s father, Hafeth, in the family’s ancestral village of Al-Mazra’a Ash-Sharquiya — said he and his friend were driving on a dirt road several hundred meters from Highway 60. He said shots suddenly hit the back of the truck, striking Abdel Jabbar.
Salameh said the pickup overturned several times, and he managed to get out and run back to the village for help.
Hafeth Abdel Jabbar said that when he arrived, he found his son’s lifeless body in the pickup, amid shattered glass and blood stains. He rejected claims that his son had thrown stones as “a big lie.” Even if the teens had thrown rocks, he said, they posed no imminent threat — to police, military, or civilians — as they drove through the brush.

An Israeli police official told AP on Wednesday that the witness account and bullet holes in the back of the truck represented only one side of the story and that the investigation is ongoing. He declined to comment further. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the case with news outlets.
The White House has demanded a transparent investigation into the death, which came after repeated U.S. warnings that Israel must rein in rising violence against Palestinians in the territory. The teen’s family said U.S. embassy officials visited the village, photographed the car and interviewed relatives.
Salameh said the events leading to the shooting began Friday afternoon, when he and Abdel Jabbar decided to have a picnic in the family’s fields — a typical thing to do on sunny days.
They jumped in the family truck and headed out, he said, but realized they’d forgotten charcoal. Abdel Jabbar turned the car around, heading back to the village on a dirt road perpendicular to the highway — that’s when shots began hitting the back windshield, Salameh said.
He said he ducked as bullets pounded the vehicle, the fourth one hitting Tawfic in the head. The car skidded off the road and flipped several times before coming to a stop, Salameh said.
Hafeth Abdel Jabbar said that when he and other relatives arrived, Israeli soldiers trained their guns on them and made two of them take their shirts off to show they weren’t a threat.
He said he ignored the soldiers and ran to the car, which had landed upright. He described his son’s body as splayed on the passenger side of the car, where blood pooled onto the floor and spread to the backseat.
He said he and others began extricating his son’s body, loading him into an ambulance.
Tawfic Abdel Jabbar was pronounced dead upon arrival at a Ramallah hospital. Video his father provided shows the car about 500 meters from the highway.
“It’s a scene that I hope never happens again,” Hafeth said Tuesday. “You have six or seven Israeli soldiers pointing the gun at you. Telling you not to go see your son. Your 17-year-old son is inside the car, dead from them, shot from the back.”
The killing shocked the village, where most inhabitants carry American passports and split their time between the West Bank and the U.S.
The Abdel Jabbar family’s roots there run back almost 200 years. Tawfic’s parents, Hafeth and Mona, grew up in the village. They moved to Gretna, Louisiana, where they married. The extended family owns a chain of shoe stores in the U.S.
The family returned frequently to their ancestral home, an ornate stone compound perched on a village hilltop. During summers, Tawfic and his siblings took part in traditional village life.

He was in his senior year in high school when he was killed. Studying remotely over the past few months, he hoped to finish in February and eventually attend college in the U.S, his father said.
Immediately after the shooting, Palestinian health officials identified the teen as Tawfiq Ajaq, but his parents said the family goes by the last name Abdel Jabbar and their son’s first name is Tawfic, an unusual spelling.
After Israeli investigators examined the vehicle Saturday, the family took it back to the village, where it sat under tarp. AP saw the truck Tuesday. Bullet holes had been marked with Hebrew stickers left by a police forensics team. Later Tuesday, investigators took the truck, Abdel Jabbar said.
According to figures from the Israeli watchdog Yesh Din, killings of Palestinians in the West Bank rarely result in investigations — and when they do, indictments are uncommon.
Also Tuesday, Abdel Jabbar said, he accompanied Salameh to provide witness testimony to Israeli investigators.
Four days after the shooting, friends and relatives clustered into the family home to pay their respects, piling hummus and falafel onto platters and gathering around fires with cups of Arabic coffee.
Tawfic’s uncle, Rami, said that in Louisiana, Tawfic had refused to work in the family’s shoe stores — spending time instead studying. Abdel Jabbar said his son wanted to become an engineer.

His mother, 36-year-old Mona, said she wants to see those who killed her son prosecuted and punished in Israel, and added that she’s furious at U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration.
“How many children have to get killed for the U.S. to stop supporting Israel?” she said.
Biden’s administration has provided military and diplomatic support for Israel’s war against Hamas. Over 25,000 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.
The administration has condemned rising violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. Since Oct. 7, 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, according to Palestinian health officials. Most have been killed in clashes during near nightly Israeli army raids aimed at suspected militants.
“My son, he was killed by — I don’t want to say American bullets, but at least by American money,” Mona Abdel Jabbar said. “We live there, we work there. Our business is there, we pay in taxes there. So my taxes are going to the bullet that killed my son.”"
ZEJIMWG2XZ_3U7VDJDNOLBKFPI,Ex-Army soldier charged in Capitol riot was convicted of manslaughter for killing Iraqi man in 2004,By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/edward-richmond-manslaughter-iraq-capitol-riot-adff1bfd6c80cd7316a97f3f5f7dc06e,"A former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting a handcuffed civilian in Iraq was arrested Monday on charges that he attacked police officers with a baton during the U.S. Capitol riot three years ago.
Edward Richmond Jr., 40, of Geismar, Louisiana, was wearing a helmet, shoulder pads, goggles and a Louisiana state flag patch on his chest when he assaulted police in a tunnel outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to an FBI agent’s affidavit.
Richmond was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is scheduled to make his initial court appearance Tuesday on charges including civil disorder and assaulting, resisting or impeding police with a dangerous weapon.
Richmond’s Louisiana-based attorney, John McLindon, said he hadn’t seen the charging documents and therefore couldn’t immediately comment on the case.
Richmond was 20 when an Army court-martial panel convicted him of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to three years in prison for killing the handcuffed Iraqi civilian near Taal Al Jai in February 2004. Richmond also received a dishonorable discharge from the Army.

Richmond initially was charged with unpremeditated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. But the panel of five officers and five enlisted soldiers reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter.
The Army said Richmond shot Muhamad Husain Kadir, a cow herder, in the back of the head from about six feet away after the man stumbled. Richmond testified that he didn’t know Kadir was handcuffed and believed the Iraqi man was going to harm a fellow soldier.
During the Jan. 6 riot, body camera footage captured Richmond repeatedly assaulting police officers with a black baton in a tunnel on the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace, the FBI said. Police struggled for hours to stop the mob of Donald Trump supporters from entering the Capitol through the same tunnel entrance.
A witness helped the FBI identify Richmond as somebody who had traveled to Washington, D.C., with several other people to serve as a “security team” for the witness for rallies planned for Jan. 6, according to the agent’s affidavit.
More than 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related crimes. About 900 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials. Over 750 have been sentenced, with nearly 500 receiving a term of imprisonment, according to data compiled by The Associated Press."
ZIQNIH0G33_OOZIVDLSBFZ8RWT,"At his old school, term-limited North Carolina governor takes new tack on public education funding",By GARY D. ROBERTSON,_,20240123,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-term-public-schools-104d3c96d74256b78411dbaddb5ad6b0,"NASHVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Blocked by Republican legislators at most every turn to advance his education agenda, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said on Tuesday he’d seek in his final year on the job to build a coalition to prod the General Assembly to improve public schools toward his policy preferences.
Visiting his boyhood elementary school before formally proclaiming 2024 as “The Year of Public Schools,” Cooper said he would attempt to bring outside pressure upon General Assembly leaders to boost K-12 spending, salaries and other programs.
“We’re going to talk about the great work that our public schools are doing and how they can get even better,” Cooper said at Nashville Elementary School, which he attended through seventh grade and lived blocks away. Nashville is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Raleigh, the state capital.
While highlighting statewide high graduation rates, a strong pre-kindergarten program and teacher accomplishments, the governor said North Carolina’s continued economic vibrancy is threatened by low per-pupil spending and beginning teacher pay. And a dramatic expansion of the state’s private-school voucher program will cost $4 billion in cumulative taxpayer dollars over the next decade, he said.
More than eight out of 10 school-age children attend public schools, Cooper’s office said.

“Our success in economic development today is a direct result of the reverence of public education over the decades,” Cooper said in the school’s library, but “our strong public schools are at risk, and if we don’t act, our children and grandchildren, our businesses and our community will bear the consequences.”
Cooper likened his effort in part to his campaign since taking office in 2017 to get the GOP-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of low-income adults. That included building an alliance of health leaders, county sheriffs, commissioners and business owners from both major parties.
Expansion just took effect just last month.
Cooper is term-limited from seeking reelection, and the General Assembly likely will adjourn for the year by early summer. And since Republicans hold narrow veto-proof majorities, they are under no obligation to work with Cooper on legislation.
He acknowledged the education effort likely will continue after he leaves office.
“There’s no question this is a long-term battle because it’s going to be a long-term fix,” Cooper told reporters. “We need to highlight the positives of public schools, which are numerous, and on top of that understand that they’re operating on a shoestring budget and that they won’t stay good if we don’t provide the proper funding.”
The governor’s reframed pitch comes a year after taking another tack that Republicans responded to with ridicule and resulted in few successes within the final two-year state budget. Last May, Cooper declared an unofficial “state of emergency” for public education and urged the public to tell their legislators to reject GOP-backed education policy, spending and tax measures.
But in the end, the budget enacted in October will greatly expand what’s known as the state’s K-12 Opportunity Scholarship program to attend private schools so that families of any income level could receive financial help.
“I am not against private schools. But I am against taxpayer money going to private schools at the expense of public schools,” he said on Tuesday.
Republican Rep. Allen Chesser of Nash County said he attended the event in his legislative capacity and out of respect for Cooper’s office. Disappointed with the governor’s critique, Chesser defended the GOP’s record on education and rejectied Cooper’s argument that the scholarships siphoned money away from public schools.
Republicans argue it’s appropriate for the state to provide financial help to families to ensure their children can succeed in private or religious schools.
While Cooper and Republicans “disagree on some nuanced funding mechanisms ... we totally agree on the importance of public education,” Chesser said. “I think (the GOP) budget has done that. We can always do better and we will endeavor to do better.”
The governor will propose budget adjustments as the legislature begins its work session in late April. A Cooper administration document asks the public to tell legislators to halt funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program until public schools are “fully funded” and to “pay teachers like the professionals they are.”
The teacher raises in the two-year budget were far below what Cooper wanted — average K-12 teacher salaries would grow by at least 7% over two years, compared to the 18% that Cooper had proposed.
The North Carolina Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that hundreds of millions of dollars could be transferred without the General Assembly’s express approval from government coffers to carry out a plan to address longstanding education inequities. But a new edition of the Supreme Court — now with a majority of Republican justices — will consider the matter again next month."

(AP) — A Vermont woman charged with planning the killing of her husband, who police say was lured to a parking lot and shot multiple times in 2019, has changed her plea to guilty.
Angela Auclair was charged with her son, Kory Lee George, in the death of David Auclair in July of 2019. On Tuesday, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.
David Auclair, 45, of Williston, was shot in a trailhead parking lot in Hinesburg. His body was found partly under his pickup truck.
The morning after he was killed, Angela Auclair called police to report her husband missing. She said he had been called in to work the night before and never came home, but the investigation found there had been no emergency at his workplace.
A witness later told investigators that a week before David Auclair’s death, his wife and her son discussed killing him.
Angela Auclair is scheduled to be sentenced on April 29 Chittenden County criminal court in Burlington.
George pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in his stepfather’s death."

Only 34 of the 71 Senators present in the upper house of the Czech Parliament late Wednesday voted in favor of the treaty known as the Istanbul Convention. The result was two votes short of the majority needed to pass.
After the vote, the lower house of Parliament will likely not deal with the treaty and the Czech Republic will be among those countries that have signed the document but not ratified it.
The Council of Europe adopted the document in 2011 in a bid to deter violence against women throughout Europe.
The Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, signed it in 2016.

The vote reflected a split between conservative and liberal lawmakers. Conservatives have argued the document challenges traditional roles for men and women in society and that its ratification in other countries didn’t help reduce violence against women there.
Several churches also opposed it.
The rejection came despite a last-minute appeal from President Petr Pavel who said the country should have ratified it sooner and that there was no reason to delay.
Slovakia is another European Union member state that rejected the treaty, doing so in 2020, while Bulgaria rejected it two years before that."
ZWT6P4HUFF_IAD4M4OOXFZMXO4,Australians protest British colonization on a national holiday some mark as ‘Invasion Day’,_,_,20240126,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/australia-day-indigenous-rights-british-colonization-90fe7059a986e2f5c02f4d7be855e698,"SYDNEY (AP) — Thousands of Australians protested the anniversary of British colonization of their country with large crowds Friday urging for Australia Day to be moved and for a day of mourning on the holiday some call “Invasion Day.”
The holiday marks the arrival of 11 British ships carrying convicts at Port Jackson in present-day Sydney on Jan. 26, 1788. For many activists, the day marked the beginning of a sustained period of discrimination and expulsion of Indigenous people from their land without a treaty.
Thousands of people, many of whom waved Indigenous flags, rallied in front of the Victoria state parliament in Melbourne, calling for an official day of mourning to be declared across Australia. Roads and tram lines were shut down for more than four hours.

Large crowds in Sydney chanted for the Australia Day date to be moved. Thousands of protesters also rallied in Brisbane, and the second day of Australia’s cricket match against the West Indies was briefly disrupted by demonstrators.

Major sports have stopped calling the holiday Australia Day, and the Australian Football League Players Association, several clubs and hockey teams have called for the date to change.
On Thursday, two monuments symbolizing Australia’s colonial past were damaged in Melbourne. A statue of British naval officer James Cook, who in 1770 charted Sydney’s coast, was sawn off at the ankles, and a Queen Victoria monument was doused in red paint.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people represented 3.8% of Australia’s population of 26 million, according to a Bureau of Statistics census in 2021. Indigenous people are the nation’s most disadvantaged ethnic minority.
Tensions are high after Australian voters in October resoundingly rejected a referendum to create an advocacy committee to offer advice to parliament on policies that affect Indigenous people. The government had proposed the first constitutional change since 1977 as a step forward in Indigenous rights.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday that the national day was an opportunity for Australians to “pause and reflect on everything that we have achieved as a nation.”
