Palestinians should "mobilize" and attack Israelis, Hamas said on Sunday.Â "We are mobilizing all cities, villages, and camps to ignite the fire against the occupation and to block the settlers' roads by all means. We call on everyone who bears arms to direct their bullets at the chests of the occupiers, who continue to commit massacres against our steadfast people in the Gaza Strip," the statement read.
