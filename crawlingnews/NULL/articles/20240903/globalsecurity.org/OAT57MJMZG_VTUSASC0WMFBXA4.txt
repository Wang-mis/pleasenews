While in Singapore, Minister Sikorski gave a lecture on Europe: Confronting 21st Century Imperialism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which is a renowned authority on global security, political risk, and military conflicts. In his speech, he mainly focused on the colonial and imperial nature of Russia's war against Ukraine.
In this context, he noted that the successes of Poland and Singapore would not be possible without a wider framework, based on the principles of international order which superseded the imperialist play of powers. By supporting Ukraine, we are also defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which may be beneficial for all of us.
As Minister Sikorski assessed, we all live in the neighbourhood of large, powerful, and sometimes unpredictable states with global ambitions. But to ensure the right to follow our own path, revisionist powers must be prevented from overthrowing the system based on international law. It may be flawed and outdated, but the answer to these weaknesses is reform, not war.
While in Singapore, Poland's top diplomat recalled that imperialism in Europe, South America, Africa, and here in Asia always rewarded the few and oppressed the many. In contrast, multilateralismâthough imperfectâis the only viable and just alternative for the global community.
