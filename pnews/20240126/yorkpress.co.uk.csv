Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, also a former UK defence secretary, argued that, despite his Russia-friendly rhetoric, Mr Trump actually bolstered American defences and Nato contributions as US president.
The Labour peer recalled Republican members of US congress also insisting that Mr Putin’s plan is flawed during a visit to the UK.
Lord Robertson told the House of Lords: “Now at the moment, with no real Russian progress, Putin, it would appear, can only wait it out until Donald Trump gets elected, who he hopes will do some grubby deal to end the war.
“But even that strategy, if that is what it can be called, is incorrect.
“Republican members of the United States congress were here with the Marshall Fund and they were very keen to articulate that that strategy is flawed.
“When he was in office, and in spite of his rhetoric, President Trump sent missiles to Poland, increased funding to Nato and robustly increased the power of his own military.
“And, therefore, it begins to look like yet another Kremlin miscalculation.”
By contrast, a former top diplomat has argued that tens of billions of pounds’ worth of support for Ukraine will be at risk if Donald Trump is elected.
Independent crossbench peer Lord McDonald of Salford, a former ambassador who headed the Foreign Office from 2015 to 2020, said: “The United States has provided at least 50% of the military capability that the Ukrainians have been using.
“Donald Trump will change American policy, no matter that groups of American politicians agree with their President (Joe Biden), the US constitution makes the President of the United States the key player in foreign and defence policy.
“So if Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we face the prospect of the disappearance of the majority of military persistence that Ukraine needs to continue and to win this fight.
“So the question for us and the rest of the West is: are we prepared to make up the huge difference? This is tens of billions of pounds and these are necessary for the fight to continue.”
Former head of the Armed Forces, Lord Stirrup, argued that Western Europe should not rely too much on the US and that, with the proper investment, could outmatch Russia, even without its ally across the Atlantic.
The independent crossbench peer and former RAF commander said: “If the outcome in Ukraine is as critical as the Government – rightly in my view – claims, then the countries of Western Europe simply cannot allow their safety and security to be subject to the vagaries of American politics.
“They need to increase defence expenditure significantly, expand defence industrial capacity and coordinate their efforts, both to support Ukraine and to strengthen Nato more widely.
“Together, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and all the other countries within Nato have more than enough economic and industrial muscle to overmatch Russia, even with the latter on a draconian war footing.
“What is required is the will to do it – and that is not yet evident. The UK should be offering a greater lead in this regard – we have to match our grand words with decisive and sustained actions, backed with the appropriate resources.”
Tory peer Lord Camoys used his maiden speech to urge the Government to keep the US in the fight, which he argued involves Europe showing its own commitment through defence spending.
He said: “Western support must be non-negotiable, as others have said, it saddens me that maintaining American support for Ukraine should even be something that we are worrying about.
“We should use all our diplomatic skills to keep America on-side and part of that probably involves Europe being prepared to pay more for our own defence.”
Former Nato chief Lord Robertson added that, from his personal experience working with Mr Putin, his inner circle is more fragile than people may think, citing the march on Moscow by Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group in June last year.
Whilst the uprising was swiftly quashed, it gave Russians – and the rest of the world – a glimpse into the internal conflicts in Mr Putin’s camp, and saw Prigozhin dismiss the President’s claim that the invasion of Ukraine was for “denazification”.
Lord Robertson told peers: “In my personal view, and I dealt with Putin in better times, there is a weakness inside the secret enclave in the walls of the Moscow Kremlin.
“From the outside we, and indeed the Russian people too, cannot know how fragile is the morale in the circle around Putin.
“But from the Prigozhin incident, here was a man invented, organised by, used by Putin, brutally exposing the truth of this disaster.
“And there we got a glimpse of the unseen tensions of the ruling elite in Russia.
“And what we saw in Prigozhin’s march on Moscow was the revelation of a serious weakness, a chink in the armour of a gambling authoritarian.
“By continuing to build our supplies to Kyiv, by maintaining Western unity and by giving the strongest possible message of our continuing resolve, the man in the Kremlin may yet see that there is a way out for him and this Russian-made, Putin-made disaster.”"
0HLALQZGA7_P9EEYWOH9E9QYN2,Landslide of contaminated soil threatens environmental disaster in Denmark,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24077016.landslide-contaminated-soil-threatens-environmental-disaster-denmark/,"Authorities in Denmark are working against the clock to stop a slow-moving landslide of contaminated soil from reaching a nearby water source, as public officials and the company that operated the site argue over who should pay for the massive clean-up.
The 250ft-tall mountain of dirt at the Nordic Waste reprocessing plant south of the town of Randers in north-western Denmark contains some 100 million cubic feet of soil contaminated with heavy metals and oil products.
It is moving at a pace of up to 16 inches per hour towards a stream connected to the Baltic Sea via the Randers Fjord.
The landslide started on December 10.
Nine days later, Nordic Waste gave up trying to get it under control, leaving the task up to Randers council, which has been re-routing the stream by laying pipes, allowing it to pass the site safely.
Environment minister Magnus Heunicke said on Friday that authorities are extending those pipes and that a sheet pile wall is being constructed, along with several basins for the contaminated water.
Water from rain and melting snow are the biggest problems, Mr Heunicke said. In the past week, western Denmark has seen huge amounts of snow and rain.
“It’s about separating the polluted water from the clean water,” he told a news conference, adding that the work is “enormously difficult.”
On Monday, a report by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, or GEUS, said the continuous deposit of soil on top of a sloping clay pit at Nordic Waste was the main cause for the landslide.
GEUS added that there had been landslides in the region since 2021.
United Shipping and Trading Company, or USTC, which is behind Nordic Waste, earlier blamed the landslide on climatic conditions beyond its control.
The area “has been exposed to enormous amounts of rain, as 2023 has been the wettest year ever in Denmark. This has resulted in a natural disaster of a calibre never before seen in Denmark”, it said.
It is still unclear who will have to pay for the clean-up.
Nordic Waste was declared bankrupt earlier this week after the Danish Environmental Protection Agency ordered it to provide security of more than 200 million kroner (£23 million) to prevent an environmental disaster.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who visited the site on Monday, said it would be unfair if Danish taxpayers had to pay.
Nina Ostergaard Borris, Nordic Waste’s chief executive, said it would take up five years to restore the site and it could potentially cost billions of kroner.
She said the situation “is far more serious than anyone could have imagined, and the task of saving the area is far greater than what Nordic Waste or USTC can handle”.
The case has started a debate about whether Nordic Waste has a moral responsibility to pay.
The government has criticised Denmark’s sixth-richest man, Torben Ostergaard-Nielsen, who is behind USTC, for not paying."
0LLEDJ0S1X_ZRBCI8T3XYU1IGC,Kate Middleton's hospital is '5-star luxury like the Ritz',By Emilia Kettle EmiliaKettle SEO Journalist,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24072645.kate-middletons-hospital-5-star-luxury-like-ritz/,"A former patient of the same private hospital where Kate Middleton is being treated has shared it's like a five-star luxury hotel.
Asad Ashraf, 64, spent one night in the London Clinic in March 2022 and compared it to the Ritz.
His stay cost £4,000 - covered by insurance - featured plush bedding, gourmet food and silver service.
The Princess of Wales is staying at the Marylebone Hospital following abdominal surgery.
Asad, a retiree, said the entire experience was ""luxurious"" and it is fit for royalty.
The dad-of-two from Hounslow, west London, said: ""My stay was incredible.
""Even if you're only there for a day, they really treat you fantastically.
""You'd expect it because of their reputation.
""I had no complaints at all and I shouldn't imagine Kate would either - but then, she's probably used to staying in places like that!""
Asad spent one night in the hospital.   (Image: SWNS)
Asad went to the hospital for a planned abdominal procedure as he wanted treatment from a specific specialist working there.
He was discharged the following day and saw his treatment as ""an overall smooth experience"".
Over his one-night stay, he saw people cater to his every need, sharing: ""The room was well-kitted and air-conditioned with an extra fan. It had a big TV with all Sky channels.
""The furniture was posh, made from real birch, and mahogany, and it had leather chairs.
""The bathroom had high-quality toiletries and Egyptian cotton towels.
""The ceiling even had stars on like the night sky.
""I drank a pot of tea from a China cup and saucer with posh biscuits too.""

In terms of food, Asad said he was offered salt and pepper squid, steamed ginger sea bass, wild mushroom risotto and truffle fries.
Asad said: ""There was a concierge and food was available round the clock at a price for guests.
""I didn't want much food after my surgery, but if you're there for a long period of time like Kate, it would be very nice.""
Asad added: ""You can compare a stay at The London Clinic to The Ritz or another five-star hotel.""
Buckingham Palace announced last week that Kate had undergone successful abdominal surgery.
She was expected to stay in the hospital for up to two weeks while she recovered."

As reported in The Press, the proposed cut in the council’s contracted funding for Explore York Libraries and Archives is part of a planned £14.3 million in savings the council’s Labour administration wants to make in the next year as part of attempts to plug a £40 million black hole in the authority’s finances.
Opposition Lib Dem councillors organised a petition opposing the library cuts - and say it has gathered more than 2,000 names in a week.
Lib Dem councillor for Haxby and Wigginton Andrew Hollyer said: “York residents have not been consulted on Labour’s heartless budget.
“Perhaps this is why over 2,000 residents have come out in support of our petition.
“We have four more weeks to save York’s libraries and I would encourage all residents to sign our petition to reverse this heartless cut.”
The petition comes as Explore bosses continue to insist the council cannot unilaterally cut their funding without consulting them first.
That’s because Explore is an independently-run mutual organisation which has a 15-year contract with the council, signed in 2019, to run the city’s libraries and archive for a contractually-agreed sum each year.

- Council can't just cut our budget, say York library bosses
When Labour announced its proposals last week, Explore chief executive Jenny Layfield issued a statement on behalf of her board of directors.
It said: “As part of the contract there is an agreed contract sum which is paid to Explore each year.
“Explore is not therefore part of the council and does not have a council budget which can be subject to cuts.
“In any contract of this nature there are agreed mechanisms for changing the terms of the contract, including the level of services provided and the costs associated with that. However, those changes require the agreement of both parties.”
Quizzed about this, the council said it had tried to discuss the contract with York Explore for months and was ‘rebuffed’.
Ms Layfield insisted, however, that there had never been formal discussions.
She told The Press: “The directors and I meet with City of York Council regularly as part of the normal management of our contract.
“They have spoken to us informally about their wish to reduce the amount they pay Explore. But they have not, as yet, put their proposals in writing or entered into formal discussions.
“We remain committed to working constructively with (the council) to ensure York’s much loved library and archives service continues to thrive.”
Cllr Jo Coles, Labour’s executive member for health and wellbeing, said: “Council officers first raised this issue with York Explore in August last year and I attended a meeting in mid-November where their chief executive said the Explore board was unprepared to discuss the matter until the council issued a notification of change of contract.
“We’ve not reached that point yet but will do soon.
“We hope once this happens York Explore will engage with us so we can work through a plan to ensure the city’s libraries continue to flourish long into the future, while contributing to the budget reductions other essential council services are experiencing.”

15XE6H8RJ5_WXPXNJGFNBWA143,Parents may ‘miss out’ on childcare offer in April due to funding uncertainty,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24072525.parents-may-miss-out-childcare-offer-april-due-funding-uncertainty/,"Parents could “miss out” on the Government’s flagship childcare offer in April as many councils have not yet published the funding rates needed by settings, early years leaders have warned.
Families are “in limbo” as many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders in England are still unable to confirm whether they can offer places under the Government’s new 15 hours of funded childcare scheme for two-year-olds.
Some local authorities are not planning to confirm their final funding rates with childcare providers until March, which could mean eligible parents may not benefit from the Government’s scheme in April.
Eligible working parents have been able to apply for the scheme since the start of January, but many remain in the dark over whether their preferred setting will actually offer a funded place when it starts in just over two months’ time.
One leader of a pre-school – who described the situation as “dire” – has decided not to offer the scheme to parents in April as the local authority is not publishing the funding rates needed to budget until March.
Bianca Gaubert, manager and owner of Brick By Brick Pre-School in Beckenham, south-east London, told the PA news agency: “To provide the two-year-old working parents’ funding from April will actually be an impossibility. I’m not committing myself to anything with that limited timescale.”
She added: “The phone has been ringing off the hook (from parents). But I can’t go in blind and say ‘yes, yes, yes’ when I don’t even know what the funding amount will be.”
Findings from a PA survey suggest that final funding rates required by early years settings have not been published in a number of areas across England.
As of Wednesday morning, only six of 20 local authorities in England, which responded to requests for information by PA, said they had sent out their final funding rates to providers.
Some local authorities have issued proposed funding rates to settings but they have not yet been formally approved, while others have not started the consultation process on rates.
Bedford Borough Council told PA it will begin consulting its early years settings on funding rates next week – and it expects to share the confirmed rates in early March.
Meanwhile, Sandwell Council in the West Midlands and West Berkshire Council do not plan to confirm final funding rates with providers until mid-March – just weeks before the scheme starts.
On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the Government’s record on free childcare as he questioned why parents are being told they will not get the funded hours promised by the Prime Minister.
It came after Rishi Sunak insisted that all eligible children in England will be able to benefit from the childcare reforms being phased in from the spring.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced in March 2023 that some families of children as young as nine months will be able claim 30 hours of free childcare a week.
Under the plans, working parents of two-year-olds will be able to access 15 hours of free childcare from April. This will be extended to working parents of all children older than nine months from September.
From September 2025, working parents of children under five will be entitled to 30 hours’ free childcare per week.
Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance (EYA), said: “This policy is a prime example of Government’s ‘announce first, think later’ approach to the early years – and once again it is providers and families who are paying the price.”
He added: “It is unthinkable that we are just weeks away from one of the biggest early years expansions of modern times, and yet many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders still haven’t actually been told what funding rate they will be given to deliver these new places.
“How on Earth is Government expecting providers to be able to budget and plan without this critical information?
“As a result, many settings still aren’t in a position to confirm whether or not they’ll offer places under the new two-year-old scheme, leaving both them and parents in limbo – and in some cases, providers may decide to opt out of the offer entirely, meaning that parents miss out on the offer altogether.”
Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), said the organisation is concerned that the “vast majority of nurseries do not yet know their funding rates” for offering funded places from April because childcare providers need to plan ahead.
She said: “We know there are a significant number of nurseries who are still undecided about whether they can offer the new two-year-old places and, if they can, how many they can afford to offer because they do not have their funding rates yet.
“Councils have until the end of March to publish their funding rates. If they leave it this late, the result could be that a number of nurseries may not be able to offer places at all from April or reduce the number of places they can offer.
“We know that many can’t supply sufficient places to satisfy local demand so, yes, it’s likely some children may miss out on a place.”
During an urgent question on childcare in the Commons on Monday, children and families minister David Johnston said he would reserve the right to “name and shame” local authorities who have yet to publish their funding rates.
Louise Gittins, chairwoman of the Local Government Association’s (LGA) Children and Young People Board, said: “The LGA and councils have repeatedly raised concerns regarding the timelines for the Government to publish information to councils.
“Local authorities have a series of internal processes to work through before they can announce funding rates to providers and are moving through these as quickly as possible.
“Unfortunately, information for local authorities and providers has only recently been made available by central Government and this has left them with little time to ensure the practical arrangements are in place to expand before the start of the April rollout.
“Local authorities should not be scapegoated for Government delays and subsequent challenges for the expansion.”
A DfE spokesperson said: “We are rolling out the single-largest expansion in childcare in England’s history, ensuring working parents receive 30 hours of free childcare a week, starting at nine months old all the way up to their child starting school.
“Thousands of parents are accessing codes and securing places every day, and we are confident in the strength of the market to deliver the offers, thanks to our £204 million cash boost last September and more than £400 million in April to create more places and help more families make savings.
“We published local authority hourly funding rates in November, now local authorities need to confirm rates for providers in their areas.
“A number have already done so, and we expect the remainder to confirm their rates in the coming weeks.”"
16B9H1MBJB_IWZM5IWIRX0K9SA,Blood test for brain cancer being tested by UK researchers,By Katie Collier Kate_Collier21 SEO Journalist,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/24075114.blood-test-brain-cancer-tested-uk-researchers/,"A “world-first” blood test which can diagnose certain types of brain cancer is being tested by UK researchers.
Experts said the simple test could reduce the need for invasive and risky surgery currently needed to diagnose some brain tumours.
They added that it could also result in earlier diagnosis which could speed up treatment and potentially increase survival rates for patients with one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer.
Brain tumour experts have welcomed the news saying the test is inexpensive and would be easy to introduce to clinics.
Our Centre of Excellence at @ImperialCollege London and @ImperialNHS has recently published a study on a blood-test that can diagnose brain tumours 🔬     If you are interested in reading more about this exciting breakthrough read our blog ➡️ https://t.co/HPVPwkqsyI #Research pic.twitter.com/tNijbLncez
Patients with “inaccessible” brain tumours who could benefit from starting treatment as soon as possible would find the liquid biopsy particularly beneficial, experts said.
Researchers at the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence, which is run by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, have performed the first studies to assess whether the test can accurately diagnose glial tumours including glioblastoma (GBM), the most commonly-diagnosed type of high-grade brain tumour in adults, astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
According to a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, they found the test had “high analytical sensitivity, specificity and precision”.
Now, scientists hope to conduct larger studies in the UK to validate the results and if successful, experts estimate that patients could benefit from the new test in as little as two years.
TriNetra-Glio blood test, by Datar Cancer Genetics, works by isolating glial cells that have broken free from the tumour and are found circulating in the blood.
The isolated cells are then stained and can be identified under a microscope.
Dr Nelofer Syed, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Imperial, said: “A non-invasive, inexpensive method for the early detection of brain tumours is critical for improvements in patient care.

“There is still some way to go, but this solution could help people where a brain biopsy or surgical resection of the tumour is not possible due to the location of the tumour or other constraints.
“Through this technology, a diagnosis of inaccessible tumours can become possible through a risk-free and patient-friendly blood test.
“We believe this would be a world-first as there are currently no non-invasive or non-radiological tests for these types of tumours.”
Kevin O’Neill, consultant neurosurgeon at Imperial College Healthcare and honorary clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence alongside Dr Syed, said: “This test is not just an indicator of disease, it is a truly diagnostic liquid biopsy.

“It detects intact circulating tumour cells from the blood, which can be analysed to the same cellular detail as an actual tissue sample.
“It’s a real breakthrough for treatment of brain cancers that rarely spread around the body.
“This could help speed up diagnosis, enabling surgeons to apply tailored treatments based on that biopsy to increase patients’ chances of survival. I’m very grateful to everyone who has contributed to this study, especially the patients involved.”
Brain Tumour Research said that the findings are “significant” as less than 1% of patients with GBM live for more than 10 years and, for many, the prognosis is as little as 12 months.
Dan Knowles, chief executive of the charity, said: “This ground-breaking research could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes for brain tumour patients.
“The research undertaken in UK universities is world class and something we should all be proud of, but we need so much more.
Recommended reading:
“There is an urgent need for novel approaches, particularly in the treatment of GBM, which is fatal in most cases.
“Brain tumours kill more people in the UK under the age of 40 than any other cancer and we have to find a cure for this devastating disease.
“It is scandalous to think that there have been no improvements to treatment options for this type of tumour in two decades and the standard of care for GBM patients – surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – remains unchanged.
“This is why we are campaigning for the Government and larger charities to invest more and we will keep up the pressure until patients and their families get the help they so desperately need.”"

Teenagers and Year 11 students were offered opportunities to experience life as apprentices in the construction industry at a range of local businesses last week, in addition to work done last year.
A City of York Council spokesperson said: “Many of this year’s opportunities were provided by three construction companies, each delivering a significant project in the city.

“Students got the opportunity to visit Caddick Construction, working on Passivhaus housing developments, John Sisk and Sons, working on the York Central project, and Simpson of York, working on York Minster.
“York teenagers worked with construction staff employed by community interest company Volunteer It Yourself (VIY) to breathe new life into grassroots music venues.”
In November last year, a team made up of local tradespeople and students installed a new ramp at the Fulford Arms, making the venue more accessible for gig-goers with mobility issues, as well as building a sound booth to provide a safer experience for audiences and music tech teams.
This month has seen a second cohort of students team up with VIY to renovate the Vaults, on Nunnery Lane, gaining City and Guilds qualifications in carpentry, painting and decorating.
The council spokesperson said the projects have been part-funded by City of York Council through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF).
Councillor Pete Kilbane, the council's deputy leader and executive member for economy, including skills, said: “We’re delighted that partners from across the construction industry have offered these opportunities to the next generation, and I’d like to extend my thanks to all involved for taking the time to give our young people the chance to experience the world of construction first-hand.
“There really is no substitute for on-site experience and face-to-face mentorship.
“These schemes are helping the construction workers of tomorrow learn skills that go far beyond the classroom, inspiring them to pursue rewarding careers that will contribute to building our local economy for the future.
Matt Mellor, programme manager at VIY, said: ""It's been great to see our mission expand across Yorkshire - all working together to boost grassroots music and arts venues so desperately in need at the moment - whilst helping local young people in York to learn trade and employability skills with hands-on experience, gaining City and Guilds accreditations too."""
1JB2CSRU05_N19JM3NJGIBZWUW,Consultation on Boroughbridge High School sixth-form future,By Harry Booth Reporter,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24060985.consultation-boroughbridge-high-school-sixth-form-future/,"A CONSULTATION is underway on the proposed permanent closure of a sixth-form at a North Yorkshire high school.
In 2022, entries to Boroughbridge High School were suspended - in response to a declining fall in the number of pupils over the past several years.
Earlier this month (January 9), North Yorkshire Council’s executive member for education, learning and skills, Cllr Annabel Wilkinson, agreed to start a consultation on the potential permanent closure of the school’s sixth-form.
A public meeting has been arranged at Boroughbridge High School at 6pm on Thursday, February 8, for people to have their say about the future of the school’s sixth-form.
Cllr Wilkinson said: ""This is an important consultation, and it is essential we take everybody’s views into account.
READ NEXT:
""Boroughbridge High School has worked in collaboration with King James’s School to ensure that students have access to a wide post-16 offer and to try to maintain sixth-form provision at the school.
""However, the school have identified that a decline in pupil numbers has made it more difficult to maintain viable sixth-form class sizes in terms of quality of experience, subject breadth and financial viability.
""I would urge parents and residents of the Boroughbridge community to share their views during the consultation period.""
In an Ofsted report from early May, 2023, pupils numbers were listed as 440 for all pupils between ages 11 and 18. At the time, the small number of sixth form pupils at the high school travelled to King James' School for their lessons.
If approved, the sixth-form provision at Boroughbridge High School would permanently shut from August 31 this year. North Yorkshire Council have confirmed there would be no changes to staffing."
1YL46MO0HJ_3C1DTX6CC6AWW58,"Homeowners made an average £100,000 on property sales in 2023 – study",By PA News Agency,_,20230122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064738.homeowners-made-average-100-000-property-sales-2023---study/,"The average homeowner in England and Wales who sold up last year made around £100,000 more than the amount they had originally paid for their property, according to analysis.
Estate agent Hamptons, which carried out the research, looked at householders selling in 2023 who had bought their homes in the past 20 years.
It found those who had bought a property within this timeframe and sold it last year sold for an average of £102,650 more than they paid.
This was down from a record gross profit of £112,930 in 2022, according to the research, which used Land Registry data.
More than nine in 10 (93%) of those selling a home in 2023 sold for more than they had paid, having owned their home for an average of nearly nine years.
In percentage terms, the average seller in England and Wales last year made a 48% gain, down from 54% in 2022.
The decrease in average gains is partly due to small house price falls last year, but also because more households moved home sooner, researchers said.
The average 2022 seller had owned their home for 9.0 years, but this fell slightly to 8.9 years in 2023.
One in 12 (8%) of those who sold in 2023 had bought their home two years earlier, increasing from 5% of those who sold in 2022 who had made their purchase two years earlier.
Households who had bought in 2021 and sold in 2023 were disproportionately likely to be selling a home in the suburbs or countryside, Hamptons’ research indicated, suggesting some of those who had purchased properties in the “race for space” during the coronavirus pandemic had had second thoughts.
Despite the quick turnaround, the average vendor who bought in 2021 still sold their home in 2023 for £56,170 or 23% more than they had initially paid.
Slower house price growth in London in recent years has meant that sellers in Wales are now making bigger percentage gains than Londoners, the report also said.
In 2023, the average home in Wales sold for 53% more than its purchase price, surpassing the London average of 51%.
This reflects the tail end of the housing market cycle, where Wales has had stronger price growth in recent years, in part due to the slower recovery in house prices in Wales following the 2008 financial crash, the report said.
The South Wales Valleys was home to some particularly big percentage gains made by home sellers last year, Hamptons found.
House sellers in Merthyr Tydfil made a 69% or £60,640 average gross profit in 2023.
Those selling in Rhondda Cynon Taff last year made an average gain of 65% or £54,530.
Sellers in Blaenau Gwent, meanwhile, made an average gross gain of 67% £46,390.
The north west of England was also home to hotspots where particularly big house seller gains were made in percentage terms in 2023.
In Manchester, sellers last year made a gross profit of 63% or £84,930; in Trafford they gained 65% – £145,730 – and in Oldham they gained 62% or £66,020.
Higher average property prices mean that London home sellers continue to typically make the biggest gains in cash terms.
The average London homeowner sold their home last year for £204,190 more than they paid for it.
London sellers also tend to have owned their homes for longer, which partlyreflects a cohort of would-be sellers whose homes are not currently worthwhat they paid, researchers said.
Having owned for 10.8 years on average, households in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea made the biggest cash gains in 2023, with sellers last year achieving an average £680,580 more than they initially paid.
Sellers in the north east of England continued to make the smallest gains in both cash and percentage terms. The average householder who sold in 2023 achieved £40,410 or 33% more than they initially paid.
Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “Despite falling house prices last year, 93% of households still sold their home for more than they paid, netting themselves just over £100,000 on average.
“These proceeds are mostly reinvested back into the housing market and go towards the purchase of another home, so they’re rarely realised in cash terms.
“However, the numbers illustrate how the scale of historic price growth sheltered movers last year, freeing up cash to cover moving costs.
“Double-digit house price increases since Covid have meant households moving within two years can achieve a higher price than they paid. Historically these are people moving due to a change in circumstances.
“However, the spike in the share of households moving within two years goes beyond that and suggests an unwinding of ‘the race for space’.
“Most of these sellers are selling larger homes in the country, often in favour of a move back to the suburbs or city.
“Households rarely move when they’re faced with the prospect of selling their home for less than they paid. Generally, the chances of selling at a loss peak within the first few years of ownership.
“But for some Londoners, that stretches back to when parts of the market peaked in 2016. Many households who bought a home between 2014 and 2016, predominantly in prime central London, face selling at a loss, which has reduced sales numbers over the last few years.
“However, we expect prices to start rising in London later this year which may start to unlock some of these moves.”
Hamptons used Land Registry price paid data to match homes that were sold in 2023 with their previous purchase. The data looked back 20 years and Hamptons said, if anything, this may understate overall gains, since generally homeowners who have owned a property for more than 20 years will likely have seen stronger house price growth.
The average gains it calculated were across all sales – including homes sold for a profit as well as those sold for a loss.
The gains do not take into account any money spent on properties.
Here are average 2023 seller gains, according to Hamptons, with the percentage of people selling their home for more than they paid, the average cash difference between the sale and purchase price, the average percentage difference between the sale and purchase price and the average years of ownership:
– London, 88%, £204,190, 51%, 9.5
– South East, 94%, £134,870, 48%, 9.0
– East of England, 95%, £115,310, 49%, 8.7
– South West, 95%, £110,510, 48%, 8.3
– West Midlands, 94%, £79,350, 46%, 8.6
– East Midlands, 95%, £78,130, 49%, 8.6
– Wales, 95%, £71,470, 53%, 8.9
– North West, 92%, £66,570, 48%, 8.9
– Yorkshire and the Humber, 93%, £63,800, 44%, 8.9

The party warned that not making the most of public money could “bankrupt the health service” as it launched a “war on waste”.
Labour vowed to bring in reforms that focus on ill health prevention, bolstering access to healthcare and upgrading NHS technology, which it said would require a “genuine partnership” between business and government.
Shadow health minister Karin Smyth delivered a keynote speech at the Institute for Government conference in London, filling in for shadow health secretary Wes Streeting, who was unable to attend due to illness.
She said: “Every patient sees that there is waste in the system. Whether it’s appointments missed because the letter arrived too late in the post, tests that are already being done at the GP having to be repeated at hospital, or wasting a day’s work to go to an outpatient appointment at a hospital that could have been done more locally, more conveniently.
“Everyone knows the inconveniences and inefficiencies, especially those working in the NHS. They see it every day, from frozen computers at the end of a long shift to the unnecessary box-ticking exercise that wastes staff time.”
Labour claims billions of pounds are being wasted across the NHS, including £3.5 billion paid to recruitment firms it says was caused by a Conservative failure to “train enough staff over the last 14 years”.
A further £1.7 billion is being wasted on delayed discharges, Labour said, with £626 million being paid to management consultants by the Department of Health and Social Care.
It also said the £1 billion the NHS claims to have saved through bulk-buying equipment is also being wasted, with some hospitals paying twice as much as others for the likes of scanners and surgical tools.
Ms Smyth said it “is a cultural problem, set from the top”, adding: “You could fill 26 hospitals with patients in hospital beds today, unable to be discharged because there is no care available for them in the community.”
She added that the £2 billion bill for NHS strikes is “almost certainly more than it would have cost to settle a junior doctors’ strike at the start”.
“We have to do better with the money the public gives to the NHS. If we don’t, then the pressures coming down the track caused by our ageing population and rising chronic disease could overwhelm and even bankrupt the health service.”
If it wins the next general election, Labour pledged to remove red tape for GPs and tackle “unnecessary bureaucracy and targets which GPs say take up their time and take some away from the things that really matter”.
Ms Smyth also said the party would “end the Department of Health’s expensive addiction to management consultants” and get “consulting nurses, doctors and staff on the ground”.
“Cutting out waste shouldn’t be outsourced,” she added. “Every part of the NHS must have a collective focus on getting more out of what we put in. This is critical – not just to keeping costs down, but to improving care for patients.”
The party also announced plans to provide tests and follow-up appointments at high street opticians in a bid to slash NHS waiting lists.
Labour claimed there are 619,000 patients waiting for NHS eyecare and said it would seek to negotiate a deal to carry out more routine outpatient checks on the high street, using existing funds.
Appointments would include operation follow-ups, cataract pre-assessments, diagnostic tests and glaucoma monitoring.
“The money that’s wasted today can be used to get the NHS back on its feet tomorrow, and Labour has a serious plan to do just that,” Ms Smyth told delegates.
Ms Smyth said reforms will “require a genuine partnership, business and government working together, to get Britain back on track”.
“Developers of new technology and treatments are banging on the door to the NHS.
“They have the potential to transform healthcare for millions of patients. Those who can afford it go private and they are already seeing the benefit.”
She said the party will “hold the door open” for tech companies “so every patient can benefit from the fruits of the technological revolution, not just the wealthy”.
“Around the world, the NHS is envied for its potential for fast adoption of new medicines, technology and use of data. It’s about time the NHS realised that potential.”"

The Canal & River Trust, a charity that maintains more than 2,000 miles of canals and navigable rivers in the UK, issued the warning as it counted the cost of the recent barrage of storms on the nation’s waterways.
The trust said it is braced for a mammoth clear-up operation when floodwater levels begin to recede.
At Naburn Lock, near York, the entire complex has been submerged for weeks.
A Canal & River Trust spokeswoman said: “Extreme weather has battered the country, including the nation’s 250-year-old canal network.

“As water levels recede, and another clear-up gets under way, the Canal & River Trust is counting the cost to our nation’s unique waterways heritage.
“Today, Naburn Lock is facing one of its greatest challenges in its 267-year history as sustained heavy rainfall has left the site under water for weeks.

“As water levels recede, the Canal & River Trust waterways charity has been out checking water levels and signs of damage.”
Naburn Lock, which is part of the River Ouse navigation, forms the barrier between the tidal and non-tidal river and the area is no stranger to flooding.

The first lock at Naburn was built in 1757 and remains one of the UK’s earliest examples of canal engineering, the charity said.
On Tuesday afternoon, a flood warning remained in place for the River Ouse at Naburn Lock and also for riverside properties in the centre of York.
The Environment Agency flood warning said flooding was forecast to affect locations near the river Ouse, with low lying land expected to be most affected, particularly around Naburn Lock buildings and Lock Cottages.
It added: ""Further rainfall is falling today (Tuesday) associated with Storm Jocelyn and levels are expected to remain high and rise further tomorrow (Wednesday).
""Our incident response staff are closing flood gates and checking defences. Start acting on your flood plan if you have one. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water.""
City of York Council said it had closed a number of car parks in the city centre due to rising river levels, as well as Rowntree Park.

The council said: “York is open for business but if you are planning on visiting please think about using buses, including park and ride.
“We are continuing to monitor the situation with our partners. Pumps and defences are also in place if needed.”"
248AZH9VHK_XT15TENWV6NVW1O,More than one million vehicles built in UK last year,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073205.one-million-vehicles-built-uk-last-year/,"The number of vehicles built in the UK topped one million last year for the first time since 2019, new figures show.
A total of 1,025,474 cars and commercial vehicles were built, an increase of 17% on the previous year, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
The easing of pandemic-related issues such as chip shortages and lockdowns, as well as increasing electrified model production, combined to drive the increase in production, said the SMMT, adding that the industry’s fortunes have been “revived”.
A number of new models entered production in 2023, while around £23.7 billion of private and public investment commitments were made.
Production of battery electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid (HEV) vehicles increased to 346,451 units, up 48% on the year before, to account for almost two-fifths of overall output.
The EU remained the sector’s biggest global market, taking 60% of exports, with the United States the next biggest destination, followed by China.
Exports to Turkey increased, making it the UK’s fourth biggest global market.
SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: “Receding supply chain challenges, new model introductions and a massive £23.7 billion of investment put UK vehicle production firmly back on track in 2023.
“Industry will now focus on the delivery of these commitments, transitioning the sector at pace to electric and scaling up the supply chain.
“With global competition as fierce as it has ever been and amid escalating geopolitical tensions, both government and industry must remain singularly focused on competitiveness, with all the jobs and growth this will bring.
“We are in a much better position than a year ago, but the challenges are unrelenting.”
The SMMT added that specialist, luxury and performance car makers had another “bumper” year, with combined volumes increasing by more than 6% to 34,613 units, worth an estimated £7.1 billion."

Tristan Abbott, 23, also had a lock knife on him, York Magistrates' Court heard.
A police drugs test revealed he was cannabis driving – the second of three times he was caught driving with the drug in his system in three months.
Today his scrap metal business has collapsed and he is off the roads for 15 months.
Abbott, of Giles Avenue, Tang Hall, denied three charges of having a blade in public but was convicted at a trial.
He pleaded guilty to three charges of cannabis driving, one each of possessing cocaine, possessing cannabis, driving without insurance, driving without a licence and one of driving a vehicle subject to a notice banning it from the roads until it was free of defects.
He was made subject to a 22-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months on condition he does 25 days’ rehabilitative activities and 100 hours’ unpaid work in addition to the 15-month driving ban. He must also pay £250 prosecution costs and a £154 statutory surcharge.
Defence solicitor Kevin Blount said Abbott used the axe, machete and lock knife in his scrap metal business and still had them with him when police spoke to him in his van at 2am in Albert Street, off Walmgate, on April 23.
He had not secured them as he should have done at the end of the working day.
“They were not intended for an unlawful purpose. There was a legitimate reason for having them,” said Mr Blount.
He had not used them other than for his work.
Police were on the lookout for a vehicle with the same registration as Abbott’s van which had been seen earlier in the day in a street where a member of the public had seen two men running with a weapon.
Abbott’s scrap metal business had collapsed because he needed to be able to drive and he had been given an interim disqualification when he admitted the driving offences. He now lived on universal credit.
The court heard that Abbott was caught cannabis driving at Howden near Goole on February 21 last year. He was arrested in Albert Street on April 23 when as well as the knife offences, he was cannabis driving and driving without insurance and had cocaine and cannabis on him. The van he was in had been made subject to a prohibition notice by South Yorkshire Police because it had defects and couldn’t be driven legally until they were repaired.
He was caught drug driving for a third time in Selby Road, Eggborough on May 18 when he was also driving without a licence.
He had no previous convictions."

It comes nearly three years after he was indicted on murder, gang and racketeering charges in Atlanta.
The rapper, whose given name is Rayshawn Bennett, was one of a dozen people charged in a wide-ranging indictment targeting alleged members of the Bloods gang in April 2021.
He was charged with murder in January that year after police said he was the driver in a gang-related drive-by shooting which killed a man.
As part of the plea deal, prosecutors dropped 12 of 13 counts against Bennett and he pleaded guilty to a single count of violating the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, his lawyers said.
“After three years of pretrial litigation, more than two weeks of jury selection and three years of incarceration waiting for his jury trial, today, the prosecution finally relented and dismissed the murder and Rico (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations) charges against Rayshawn Bennett,” defence lawyers Drew Findling, Gabe Banks and Marissa Goldberg said.
“As he has maintained for three years now, Mr Bennett will not co-operate in any other case.”
The plea deal will allow the rapper to be eligible for parole as soon as four months from now, and prosecutors agreed he should be released early on parole, which “will allow him to get back to his children, family and career”, his lawyers said.
Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis’s office did not immediately have a comment about the plea deal.
Among Bennett’s biggest hits is the 2016 song Key To The Streets, featuring the Atlanta rap group Migos."

DUP MP Gavin Robinson called on ministers to change the law so people born in the Republic who had lived all their lives in Northern Ireland could easily claim British citizenship.
Home Office minister Tom Pursglove gave the Government’s backing to Mr Robinson’s British Citizenship (Northern Ireland) Bill, on the condition that its benefits could cover Irish-born people living across other parts of the UK and not just Northern Ireland.
Mr Robinson told MPs that the change in the law had long been debated in Parliament.
The 1997 Belfast Good Friday Agreement offered Northern Ireland’s residents the ability to claim either British or Irish citizenship, or dual nationality.
But Belfast East MP Mr Robinson said: “What was not settled at that time, however, was reciprocation in the other direction. This Parliament will know that our history and relationship is intertwined and this Bill seeks to provide the final piece of that relational jigsaw.
“Anyone born in the Republic of Ireland but who lives in the United Kingdom and satisfies the residency test should be able to avail of UK citizenship.
“Those who say ‘Sure, just apply for naturalisation in the normal way’ fail to recognise or respond to the special relationship that our nations have.”
He gave the example of DUP peer Lord Hay of Ballyore, who was born in Donegal in the Republic and has an Irish passport, but who has lived and worked for most of his life in Northern Ireland.
The peer has refused to pay the fee to become a British citizen, which can currently cost up to £1,580, and has claimed he is being discriminated against for not automatically being allowed to claim UK nationality.
Mr Robinson assured MPs his Bill was not “a coercive move”, adding: “Nothing contained within this Bill requires someone to avail of citizenship should that not be their desire.
“Some will conclude that with the same rights and entitlements already it is unnecessary. We also know through House of Commons Library research that some proceed to pay the naturalisation fee and complete a Life in the UK Test, no matter how offensive or inappropriate that may appear.
“But each year the number remains in single figures, if any.”
He cited official census figures, and said there were 40,400 people born in the Republic living in Northern Ireland, approximately 30,000 of whom could “could avail of this Bill”.
Shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock said arguments in favour of the Bill had been “heard in the House many times before”, and gave Labour’s backing to it.
Mr Pursglove said the Government would support the law change to progress through Parliament, but only if changes were made as MPs continue to scrutinise it.
He told the Commons: “What that will mean is that the Bill will become one which is marginally broader and more inclusive. It will firstly be available to Irish nationals regardless of how they became Irish and not just those born in Ireland.
“Secondly it will not have a requirement that an Irish national must have been born after a certain date.
“Thirdly, qualifying residents can be from any parts of the United Kingdom, and not just Northern Ireland.
“We are confident that this would both address equality concerns with the version of the Bill currently before the House but also still benefit those that he wanted to cover.”
Mr Robinson said he was “totally content” with the changes the Government had proposed.
MPs will continue consideration of the Bill at a later date."

Nottingham Crown Court was told Valdo Calocane, who has admitted three counts of manslaughter and three of attempted murder, has no previous convictions or cautions despite being involved in incidents of criminal damage and trying to force his way into flats.
It also emerged that he was involved in an alleged assault on two colleagues while working in a warehouse a month before the “uncompromisingly brutal” killings.
The court was told on Tuesday that Calocane was born in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa, coming to the UK aged 16 with his family in 2007, having lived in Lisbon in Portugal.
Although he chose not to take A-levels, he later “studied well” and became a student at Nottingham University, graduating in June 2022 after completing a degree in mechanical engineering.
A brother of Calocane told investigators that he became aware of his sibling’s mental health problems during his degree studies – with the 32-year-old student “believing that he was being spied on by his housemates and by MI6 and that his family was under threat.”
During his opening of the facts of the three killings, which took place in Nottingham on June 13 last year, prosecutor Karim Khalil KC said: “The theme of (Calocane) being prescribed medication but declining to take it is a constantly recurring one.”
On May 23 2020, Calocane attended hospital believing he was having a heart attack, and was arrested after returning to his flat and causing damage to a door.
An assessment under the Mental Health Act 1983 was carried out at a Nottingham custody suite by psychiatric services, who concluded that Calocane was psychotic but that his risk to others was low.
He was then referred to a crisis team for review at home and he was released without charge.
Mr Khalil said: “Upon his return to his apartment, an hour later, however, he knocked down another door to a different apartment in the block.
“He was arrested for criminal damage, and following a re-assessment was detained under the Mental Health Act and was admitted to in-patient psychiatric services at the Highbury Hospital.”
Calocane was discharged from Nottingham’s Highbury Hospital on June 17 2020 into the care of the Nottingham City Crisis Team.
He was advised to take the medication for a minimum of six to nine months, and to seek medical advice if he wished to stop taking it.
The court heard he was the readmitted to hospital for a period during July 2020, after attempting to force his way into a flat, having stopped taking his medication.
Anti-psychotic medication was “restarted and increased”, Mr Khalil said, and in August 2021 Calocane was believed to have actively concealed symptoms of psychosis during a home visit by a mental health worker.
He then evaded contact with the community team, and a warrant under the Mental Health Act was secured to gain entry to his property in order that an assessment could be conducted.
The warrant was executed on September 3 2021, when Calocane assaulted a police officer.
Mr Khalil added: “A bag of unused medication dating from February 2021 was discovered in the flat.
“He was admitted to in-patient services (under the Mental Health Act) and managed between September and October 2021.
“Thereafter he had limited contact with his community team, appearing confrontational and missing appointments.”
In mid-January 2022, the defendant was involved in an altercation with a flat-mate and a mental health assessment concluded that he could continue to be treated in the community.
At the end of January 2022 Calocane was again admitted as an inpatient under the Mental Health Act, being discharged on February 24.
He was then reviewed in March 2022 in an outpatient clinic and in July 2022 claimed, it is believed falsely, that he was not in the country.
Mr Justice Turner, hearing the Crown’s opening ahead of sentencing, was told Calocane was recorded as not being at home in August 2022 following a visit to his discharge address, with a resident saying no-one of that name lived there.
It also emerged at the hearing that in early May 2023 – around five weeks before he killed three people – Calocane started working in a warehouse in Kegworth, Leicestershire, where he attacked two employees.
Following that incident, efforts were made to contact Calocane to tell him that he was not allowed back on the premises, but he did not respond.
For approximately six months before the multiple stabbing and van attacks, Calocane was living in a multi-occupancy house in Burford Road, Forest Fields, Nottingham, where a housemate found him to be “somewhat distant, never speaking unless spoken to and only then giving short responses”.
He was also noted to be using the same plate but never cleaned it."
2XV2P75571_ITSRZ8YH12G9WBW,Fears of renewed violence as Mali terminates peace deal with Tuareg rebels,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24078171.fears-renewed-violence-mali-terminates-peace-deal-tuareg-rebels/,"Mali’s junta has terminated a crucial agreement with local rebels that helped maintain a fragile peace in the country’s north, the government announced, raising concerns about a possible escalation of violence.
The 2015 peace deal with Tuareg rebel groups is ending “with immediate effect” because the rebels have failed to comply with its terms and because of “acts of hostility” by Algeria, which has been the main mediator in the peace efforts, acting prime minister Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga said on state television on Thursday night.
Representatives of the rebel group did not immediately comment but Algeria’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that it “deeply regrets” Mali’s decision to end the agreement and denied working against it.
“The Malian people must know that such unfortunate and unwelcome decisions have proven in the past that the military option is the first threat to the unity and territorial integrity of Mali, that it carries within it the seeds of a civil war in Mali, that it differs national reconciliation instead of bringing it closer together and that it finally constitutes a source of real threat to regional peace and stability,” the statement said.
The campaign by the Tuareg rebels to create an independent state of Azawad in northern Mali threw the West African nation into a violent conflict for over a decade.
In 2012, they dislodged the Malian military from the town of Kidal, setting into motion a series of events that destabilised the country.
The peace deal backed by Algeria and welcomed by the United Nations reduced hostilities in the northern region before it appeared to collapse last year after both parties accused each other of failing to comply with it.
Malian authorities also announced the prosecution of some rebel leaders.
Analysts said the formal end of the deal did not come as a surprise following months of tension between the government and the rebel groups and after years in which both sides failed to fulfil its terms.
Mali and Algeria have also fallen out over the deal.
The collapse of the agreement comes after the end of a UN peacekeeping mission deployed to help contain the rebellion.
It also comes as Mali’s military leaders — in power for more than three years — struggle to contain an Islamic extremist insurgency that has ravaged the north since 2012."

Muhammad Hassam Ali died from his injuries after being attacked in Victoria Square, close to the city’s Council House, shortly before 3.30pm on Saturday.
Officers are working on the theory that Muhammad, who was visiting the city centre with a friend, was the victim of mistaken identity.
Police have declined to comment on whether more than than one offender is believed to have been involved in the offence.
Speaking near the scene on Monday, the chief inspector for Birmingham city centre, Mark Lacey, said Muhammad died on Saturday evening.
Asked if officers still believe the stabbing to be a case of mistaken identity, Chief Inspector Lacey said: “That is our current working theory… although we are keeping our mind open about that, as we do with any investigation.
“We are open to any and all intelligence or information that the public might have, that they could provide to us.”
In a direct appeal for those responsible, the officer added: “My message would be please hand yourself in.
“I know that may be a difficult thing to do, but please do so.
“The police are progressing this investigation and I am very confident that we will find any and all persons that are involved.
“For the good of your family, for the good of the family of Muhammad, I would say please hand yourself in to the police so that we can move this investigation forward and give some closure to the family.”
Describing the stabbing as a rare scenario, the senior officer offered his condolences to the family of the victim, telling the PA news agency: “Being a father myself, I cannot imagine what they are going through.
“I have a team who are devastated that this could happen on their area.
“That said, Birmingham is a safe city. We have reduced violence in the city over the last 12 months and we will continue to do so.
“Over the next few days and over the next week we will be putting (in) extra patrols to just reassure the public.
“We have no information to say something like this is necessarily going to happen again, but we want to reassure the public and also send a clear message to those that seek to conduct any criminality in the city centre that they will be dealt with by the police and by our partners.”
Detectives are reviewing CCTV and carrying out other forensic enquiries to establish who was responsible for Muhammad’s death, which is not being treated as gang-related."

Known for its pick 'n' mix sweets and bargain prices, Woolworths is perhaps the ultimate blast of high street nostalgia.
In 2009 when its British shops closed after the financial crisis, the brand in Germany, where it is known as Woolworth, was saved by HH Holding.
Current HH Holding chief Roman Heini seeks to expand internationally and says the UK is on his ""bucket list"" of destinations.
Good morning. I’m pleased that #Woolworths might return to the UK 16 years after they went bankrupt. This was the store in my home town of Hastings as I remember it 60 years ago. My baby name for the escalator was the ‘whim’. ‘That’s the wonder of good old Woolies’ 😂 pic.twitter.com/2oreaaBNlU
Popular chain Wilko, which filled the gap left by Woolworths, infamously collapsed just last year in 2023.
Mr Heini - who has worked in executive positions in both Aldi and Lidl and has been Woolworth's chief executive since 2020 - told trade magazine Retail Week that despite the challenges of a cost-of-living crisis he had the opportunity to ""make Woolworth great again"".
If ""Woolies"" were to return to UK High Streets, it is unclear how it would be spelt.
Woolworth Germany told the BBC: ""The brand name 'Woolworth' (without the 's') is owned by us throughout Europe. Should we ever plan to return to the UK, we would scrutinise the naming rights to minimise the risk of confusion. A transfer of rights could help if necessary.""
Woolworths originated in the US and operated for 100 years in the UK, having opened its first store in Liverpool in 1909. It had 807 British stores and its closure left more than 27,000 people unemployed.
It suffered from the economic downturn of 2008-09 and cheaper competitors eating into its market share. Some analysts say it was also not able to keep up with online shopping.
Woolworth Germany said it was ""unable to confirm any plans for Woolworth to return to the UK market"" but that such a move was not ruled out in principle.
""Britain is on his [Roman Heini's] bucket list, although nothing is imminent,"" a spokesperson said, adding ""but it may be in the mix for the mid- or long-term future"".
Previously, it was known for its variety of items including children's clothing brand Ladybird, CDs and confectionery.
However, with Mr Heini at the helm, Woolworth Germany now sells predominantly clothing and homeware, which he says is at ""unbeatable prices""."
3FW3PEW2ID_EJ7SDNR6K5BQIXY,Weight loss drug could be supplied to UK ‘in weeks’ after new format approval,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075943.weight-loss-drug-approved-four-dose-injection-pen-format-mhra/,"A weight loss drug newly approved in a four-dose injection pen format by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) could be supplied to the UK “within weeks”.
Mounjaro, also known as tirzepatide, is a diabetes drug that was authorised by the MHRA to help obese and overweight adults with weight management and loss in November last year.
US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro “KwikPen” gives four doses of the drug for once-a-week treatment over a month.
President and general manager of UK and Northern Europe at Lilly, Laura Steele, said: “The MHRA is the first major regulator in the world to issue marketing authorisation for the alternative KwikPen presentation for tirzepatide, demonstrating their clear focus on speeding innovation to help patients.
“This will enable Lilly to begin supply to the UK within weeks.”
Mounjaro KwikPen has been approved to treat adults with type 2 diabetes and for weight management in obese adults, as well as overweight adult patients who have weight-related health problems like prediabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart problems.
Julian Beach, MHRA interim executive director of healthcare quality and access, said: “The public health importance of safe and effective treatments to help manage diabetes and obesity, which can have a significant impact on people’s health, is clear.
“This approval enables access to the approved Mounjaro pen in a more convenient presentation of a month’s treatment, of one dose per week.”
The jab was given the green light for NHS use in September last year by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) as an option for patients with type 2 diabetes who do not have the condition under control, but Nice has yet to approve the use of the drug in the NHS for obesity.
The active ingredient in the drug helps to reduce sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes when their levels are high, and works as a weight management drug by making a patient feel full and less hungry, and making them experience fewer food cravings.
The MHRA’s newest authorisation is based on the results of a bridging study which showed the efficacy and safety of the multidose Mounjaro KwikPen are expected to be the same as those for the single-dose pen.
Douglas Twenefour, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: “We hope the MHRA’s approval of this device will help people living with type 2 diabetes, who are eligible, to access this effective treatment.
“Supporting people with type 2 diabetes to lose weight and manage their blood sugar levels is key to reducing the risk of diabetes-related complications, and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) expands the range of treatment options available to help people achieve this.”
The MHRA warned the drug may affect how well the contraceptive pill works in obese or overweight female patients.
It also listed potential side effects of the medicine, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting – which usually goes away over time – and constipation.
Low blood sugar is also “very common” in patients with diabetes, the agency added.
The MHRA said it will keep the safety and effectiveness of Mounjaro under close review."
3ILPN7M8W5_JX3B63OWDV25AUG,UK pushes back at Netanyahu and says two-state model can provide ‘lasting peace’,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24066132.uk-pushes-back-netanyahu-says-two-state-model-can-provide-lasting-peace/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state is “disappointing”, No 10 has said.
The UK Government has vowed to continue with its support for a two-state solution in the Middle East for “as long as it takes” in the face of Israel’s premier saying he would “not compromise” on Tel Aviv control over Palestinian territories.
Mr Netanyahu’s stance also puts him at odds with the US, Israel’s most powerful and closest ally. Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden spoke on Monday evening, with the two leaders agreeing “that a two state solution which allows Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security is more important than ever”.
Right-wing leader Mr Netanyahu doubled down on his rejection of Palestinian sovereignty as part of any post-war plan, saying his country needs full security control over the Palestinian territories when the Israel-Hamas conflict is over.
He wrote on X, formerly Twitter, late on Saturday: “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area west of Jordan – and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.”
The remarks, rebuked by UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and senior Labour Party figures, deepened a public rift with the US, which has argued a two-state solution is essential for long-term stability.
Asked about the Israeli leader’s stance, Prime Minister Mr Sunak’s official spokesman told reporters on Monday: “It is disappointing to hear this from the Israeli prime minister.
“The UK’s position remains that a two-state solution with a viable and sovereign Palestinian state living alongside a safe and secure Israel is the best route to lasting peace.
“Clearly there will be a long road to recovery and lasting security in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel.
“But we will continue our long-term support for a two-state solution for as long as it takes.”
Downing Street said Mr Sunak used the call to stress “that supporting Israel in its efforts to defeat the threat from Hamas does not detract from the need for the IDF to take greater care to protect civilians and operate within International Humanitarian Law”.
It comes amid concern internationally about Israel’s conduct of the war and the ever-growing number of civilian causalities.
The current war between Israel and Hamas, the fifth and by far the deadliest, began when Palestinian militants broke through Israel’s defences and rampaged through several nearby communities, killing some 1,200 people, and taking around 250 people hostage.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 25,105 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 60,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
The two men “resolved to continue working together to encourage further humanitarian pauses to get hostages out of Gaza and allow more aid to enter”, Number 10 said.
The pair also discussed Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, agreeing to “continue efforts alongside international partners to deter and disrupt those attacks”.
The US has launched seven rounds of air strikes on Houthi military sites in recent days, targeting air bases under the rebels’ control and suspected missile launch sites.
On Monday afternoon, Mr Sunak also met family members of Israeli hostages who are still being held in Gaza following Hamas’s raids on October 7.
Asked if Mr Sunak had given a message to hostages’ families at an event organised by the Conservative Friends of Israel, the PM’s spokesman said: “Our message continues to be one of support for the families going through unimaginable pain and suffering, both those who still have hostages held by Hamas and those who have had them returned.
“We have a clear message for Hamas that they can return these hostages at any moment, and we would continue to urge them to do so.”
According to online news outlet Politico, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will also speak with those who have flown to London.
The three-day visit by the families is designed to put pressure on Britain to encourage Qatar, which has facilitated negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group in order to help secure hostage releases, to “pick a side” in the conflict.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has announced sanctions against five figures who it says are involved in the financial networks of Hamas and another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The combined action by the UK and US is the third round of such sanctions imposed on the two groups since the war broke out almost four months ago.
Mr Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas and to return all of the remaining hostages after more than 100 were released in a ceasefire deal in November in exchange for scores of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense residential areas."
3RYKRAAH4U_TSEQ4S3CYK5570A,"What is croup? Symptoms, when to call 999 and treatment",By Katie Collier Kate_Collier21 SEO Journalist,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24072651.croup-symptoms-call-999-treatment/,"If you’ve noticed your baby is coughing, they might have a condition called croup but what is it and what should you do?
Knowing the symptoms to look out for and the treatment that is needed to help them can be handy of your little one ever suffers with croup.
To help you out, here are the symptoms of croup, how to look after your child when they have croup and when you should seek medical attention for your child.
The NHS website explains that croup is a condition that is common and mainly affects the airways of babies and young children.
Remember that other people, such as older neighbours, friends, and family members, may need a bit of extra help this winter.     There’s lots you can do to help others ➡️ https://t.co/Mxkt5xn6Qs pic.twitter.com/3yU35hjqxf
Although croup is usually mild, parents are urged to call NHS 111 if they think their child has it because they may need some treatment to help them.
Croup symptoms include a barking cough which can sound like a seal and if you’re not sure if your child’s cough is croup, the NHS says you can find examples online to listen to.
Your child might also have a hoarse voice or difficulty breathing.
When your child breathes in, you might notice a high pitched and rasping sound.
Usually, a child gets cold-like symptoms before developing croup which include a temperature, runny nose and cough.

The NHS website adds: “Croup symptoms usually come on after a few days and are often worse at night.”
If you don’t know if your child has croup, there are similar conditions that they may have instead, including a cold, bronchiolitis and whooping cough.
The NHS encourages you to ask for an urgent GP appointment or call NHS 111 if your child could have croup as they might give your child some medicine.
You should also seek medical advice if your child is getting worse or not improving after seeing a GP.
If you’re child is more seriously ill or they’re under three months old, you might find that they get referred to hospital.
Here’s when you should call 999 or take your child to A&E if they’re suffering with croup:

Within 48 hours, croup normally improves on its own but the NHS has shared some things you can do to help your child at home.
You should make sure your child sits upright and if you can, avoid them from lying down.
If they’re distressed, comfort them and try to keep their calm as crying can worsen symptoms.
Recommended reading:
Give your child plenty of fluids and check on them regularly including during the night.
If they have a high temperature or are experiencing discomfort, you can give them either paracetamol or ibuprofen.
The NHS warns parents not to put their child in a steamy room or make them inhale steam."
4F6KOPYWOA_TW4XFLURN8MJAMC,"Royal Mail could deliver letters just three days a week, says Ofcom",By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24071290.royal-mail-deliver-letters-just-three-days-week-says-ofcom/,"Royal Mail could cut postal deliveries to as few as three days a week and save up to £650 million a year under options put forward to reform the service by the industry regulator.
In a long-awaited report, Ofcom outlined options for overhauling Britain’s universal postal service, warning that it risks becoming “unsustainable” without reform.
The regulator set out two possible proposals, including cutting Royal Mail’s letter delivery service from six days to five, or even three, a week.
It could save Royal Mail £100 million to £200 million if the service was cut to five days and £400 million to £650 million if it was reduced to three, according to Ofcom.
But the Government would have to change the law for this to happen and Downing Street has already said it would “not countenance” scrapping Saturday deliveries, given the importance of a six-day service, particularly to businesses.
The other option is to extend how long it takes letters to be delivered, meaning that it would take three or more days for most letters to arrive, but with a more expensive next-day delivery service available when required.
This could save the company £150 million to £650 million.
It comes amid calls from Royal Mail to ditch Saturday letter deliveries due to slumping demand and as it battles to turn itself around after suffering hefty financial losses.
The group has warned it may need a Government subsidy to survive.
Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said Britain’s universal postal service was “getting out of date and will become unsustainable if we don’t take action”.
She said: “Postal workers are part of the fabric of our society and are critical to communities up and down the country.
“But we’re sending half as many letters as we did in 2011, and receiving many more parcels.”
She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We have to respond to that because if we don’t the service will become either too expensive, or worse, it could become unsustainable.”
But Ofcom stressed that downgrading Royal Mail’s delivery targets “was not an option”.
“Under any scenario, Royal Mail must modernise its network, become more efficient and improve its service levels,” the regulator said.
Ofcom now wants to spark a “national debate” on the future of the UK’s postal service, with a consultation on the proposals open until April 3.
It plans to provide an update in the summer.
Under its universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail must deliver letters six days a week to all 32 million addresses in the UK for the price of a stamp.
Royal Mail has urged the Government and Ofcom to review its obligations, arguing that it is no longer workable or cost effective, given the decline in addressed letter post.
The firm, which is owned by International Distributions Services (IDS), recorded a £419 million loss in its previous financial year, while it was also fined £5.6 million last year for failing to meet its delivery targets.
Ofcom estimates that delivering the universal service cost Royal Mail £325 million to £675 million in 2021-22.
IDS said on Wednesday that reform was “urgently needed”.
Martin Seidenberg, group chief executive of IDS, said: “We have been calling on Government and Ofcom to tackle this issue for four years, and the lack of action means that we are now facing a much more serious situation.”
Ofcom does not have the power to scrap Saturday letter deliveries and ministers have been quick to dismiss any suggestion that the Government would sanction such a move.
Postal affairs minister Kevin Hollinrake said the Government was committed to a six-day service from Royal Mail.
He told Times Radio: “The Prime Minister has been very clear on this, six-day delivery is really important for many people in this country, many of our citizens, but also for many of our businesses.”
The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said a three-day delivery service would “destroy” Royal Mail.
CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: “We are not resistant to change, but we will not sign up to a three-day universal service obligation, which would destroy Royal Mail as we know and would impact thousands of jobs.”
He also claimed Ofcom had produced the report without asking for input from frontline workers or the union.
Ofcom’s director of post, Marina Gibbs, said “this is the time” for unions and other parties to get in touch with their views.
She told the PA news agency the option of extending delivery times was “more within our gift” as it can make that change within its own regulation, but insisted it did not have a “front-runner” proposal."
4QTER897CH_B4XATICP2B4WAP2,Four men facing jail after violence outside asylum seeker hotel,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24066217.four-men-facing-jail-violence-outside-asylum-seeker-hotel/,"Four men who were convicted of violent disorder following a protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers are likely to face prison sentences, a judge has warned.
Thomas Mills, 47, sobbed and collapsed in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday after he was found guilty of violent disorder, along with co-defendants Brian McPadden, 61, Paul Lafferty, 42, and Jonjo O’Donoghue, 21.
The defendants had all admitted being present at a demonstration outside the Suites Hotel in Knowsley, Merseyside, on February 10 last year but denied being part of the violence which resulted in three police officers being injured and a police van being set alight.
A fifth defendant, Daniel Fulham, 39, who told the court he was in the area walking his Jack Russell dog, was found not guilty of violent disorder and of a lesser offence of abusive or threatening behaviour with intent to provoke violence.
The court was adjourned after the verdicts were returned so medical assistance could be given to Mills, who had suffered seizures in the dock twice during the two-week trial.
When the court resumed, after Mills left with paramedics, judge Denis Watson KC ordered pre-sentence reports for the defendants.
Granting them bail until the sentencing hearing, on a date to be fixed, he said: “This is a serious offence and the likelihood is that there will be sentences of immediate custody, but I will not pre-judge things until I know rather more about your background.”
Police were made aware on February 9 last year that a protest, said to have been organised by the English Defence League (EDL), was expected to take place outside the hotel, which was providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers, the following day.
There was “ill-feeling” in the local area after a video was shared on social media appearing to show an asylum seeker from the hotel asking a 15-year-old girl for her phone number and a kiss, the court heard.
The jury was told social media posts were made about the planned demonstration and leaflets were delivered.
On the Friday evening, members of a right-wing group and a left-wing group gathered outside the hotel on the outskirts of Kirkby.
Detective Constable David Williams, of Merseyside Police, told the court that a large group of people had arrived at the scene on foot at around 7pm.
He said: “At that time it seemed that tensions changed somewhat.”
Footage showed crowds chanting “Get them out” and throwing fireworks at a cordon of police officers, as a police van burned.
Rocks and paving slabs were also thrown, with one police officer needing hospital treatment and another two suffering less serious injuries.
Mills could be seen in footage, standing on top of the van before it was set alight and holding a banner which said: “Let’s shout, get them out.”
McPadden was heard in the footage saying: “We protect our own, youse are not from Kirkby, we are. These are twats, the lot of them.”
There was no evidence that any of the defendants were members of a far-right group.
The four defendants, all from Kirkby, Merseyside, apart from O’Donoghue, who is from Liverpool city centre, will be sentenced along with five other men who pleaded guilty at earlier hearings to violent disorder.
Seven youths, aged between 13 and 17, have already been sentenced after they admitted violent disorder.
Six were given referral orders and one was fined.
Jared Skeete, 19, was sentenced to three years’ detention last April after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder, having thrown fireworks and snorted ketamine while shouting abuse at police.
Three women – Cheryl Nicholls, 44, Nicola Elliott, 52, and Jennifer Knox, 41 – were found not guilty of violent disorder halfway through the trial following a direction to the jury from the judge, who said there was “insufficient evidence”."

Mr Blair, the former Labour prime minister, and the ex-Conservative leader have set out more than 40 recommendations on regulation and state support to help the UK stay at the forefront of growth in biotechnology and artificial intelligence.
They say a “national purpose” to support new discoveries will be central to economic growth.
Writing in The Times, they said: “An extraordinary age of gene therapies, new antibiotics and molecular factories is beginning.
“Biotech is promising a future of new cures and treatments for many diseases, more personalised and effective healthcare, and many new materials and transformed manufacturing processes.”
The former rivals’ report says the NHS is a valuable source of data and a new approach is needed to provide commercial access to records, via a separate company.
They said the company “would strictly preserve privacy while bringing massive benefits to research, public health and patient treatment” while free from government interference.
“Nothing will be more important to British jobs, living standards and security in the coming years than leading the world in science and innovation,” they wrote.
“We will have to keep moving quickly if we are to be one of the main homes of changes so dramatic that they will alter forever the way we live and restructure much of the global economy.
“Whatever our political differences on more traditional issues, we both believe that this is the crucial task that, more than anything else, will determine the future prosperity of Britain.”
They say the data from millions of NHS records would provide a platform for artificial intelligence which could monitor patients via wearable technology and alert doctors of problems.
The plan also includes access to a cloud-based “personal health account” through the NHS app to book appointments and manage treatment, creating a laboratory of biodesign, helping biotech companies to scale up and creating strong international biosecurity.
The report on biotechnology is the third published by Mr Blair and Lord Hague after addressing innovation and artificial intelligence last year."
51VPFYNTMI_FSUHCSDNKW1RBWA,Econ Engineering of Ripon in first with wholly-electric gritter,By Darren Greenwood Business Editor,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24070228.econ-engineering-ripon-first-wholly-electric-gritter/,"A Ripon-based company has created what is believed to be the world’s first fully electric-powered gritter.
Now, Econ Engineering has secured landmark contract with UK highways specialist Ringway signing up to take delivery of the revolutionary E-QCB (Electric Quick Change Body).
The first ever completely electric vehicle of its kind on the market promises the very latest in sustainable technology without diminishing performance, helping customers cut their emissions footprint.
As the UK’s leading manufacturer of winter maintenance and highways vehicles, Econ Engineering supplies gritters, hot boxes and tippers to hundreds of local councils and contractors, spanning the length and breadth of the UK.
READ MORE:
The E-QCB enables the vehicle’s bodywork to be switched between gritter, tipper or caged body modes, with easy transformation taking no longer than 15 minutes.
With more than 300 local authorities, including North Yorkshire and City of York Councils, having declared a climate emergency, the Government has already issued guidance on how those councils, and other UK businesses, should be looking to switch their fleets to zero emissions vehicles ahead of 2035.
Ringway, responsible for looking after more than 50,000kms of the UKs highways network, has a long-term strategic fleet partnership with Econ and is the first contractor to sign up to a deal for the E-QCB.
Both sustainable and practical, the E-QCB 19-tonne Volvo FE Electric, comes with a range of demountable body options including gritter, tipper & caged body, which can be switched within just 15 minutes.
The vehicle can be fully-charged in less than 2 hours and has a range of up to 170 miles. It has been tested in snowy Yorkshire, gaining praised and endorsements whilst gritting rural roues.
Dave Olley, operations manager at Ringway said: “Working with Econ Engineering we trialled the fully electric E-QCB multi-purpose vehicle and are now looking forward to adding it to our fleet and putting it to use on the UK’s road network.”
Jonathan Lupton, Managing Director at Econ Engineering, said: “We have spent a long time developing the E-QCB, undertaking comprehensive redesigns and trials across the UK, to ensure that we can offer a fully electric solution for our customers that can be used 52 weeks a year.
“We are delighted to extend what is already a strong relationship with Ringway by adding the E-QCB to its fleet. We are confident the vehicle will continue to impress and that its benefits will soon result in more deals of this kind.”
North Yorkshire Council commented: “The E-QCB was tested to the limit on a cold, snowy day at Sutton Bank which has a hill gradient of 1 in 4, and includes plenty of tight bends. The vehicle undertook two 40-mile gritting runs and an NYC spokesperson said: “The vehicle impressed us especially coping with the hills and had excellent range for an electric vehicle.”"
5UJQGU0LH5_JGDE3GMGID3Z1BM,Woman to be freed from prison after pregnancy discovery,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075169.woman-freed-prison-pregnancy-discovery/,"A woman jailed for concealing a handgun who later discovered she was pregnant will be released from prison after the Court of Appeal reduced her sentence.
The woman was jailed at Woolwich Crown Court on June 15 last year after admitting to stashing a self-loading pistol and three bullets belonging to her then-boyfriend for around a fortnight in February 2023.
At a hearing in London last week, the Court of Appeal heard that she had since been found to be pregnant and is due to give birth in February this year.
Lawyers for the 22-year-old argued that this made the sentence disproportionate and posed risks to the health of the baby and the mother.
Three appeal judges agreed and quashed her sentence, instead giving her a two-year sentence, suspended for two years.
In a judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Andrew Baker, who heard the case with Lord Justice Holroyde and Mr Justice Garnham, said: “We are satisfied that when the appellant’s pregnancy and its specific attendant consequences and risks, for the appellant and her unborn baby, are added to the other personal mitigation available to the appellant, there are exceptional circumstances relating to the appellant and her particular offence that, taken together, render it unjust to impose a custodial term of at least five years.
“The experience of custody was going to be, and has proved, traumatic and dangerous for this appellant beyond any kind of norm.
“By the date of the appeal hearing, she had in fact served the equivalent of a 14-month sentence, but the weight of punishment that has constituted for her will have been qualitatively equivalent to a much stiffer sentence.”
He added: “In all those circumstances, and on balance, we concluded that it was in the interests of justice to take the very exceptional course, for an offence of possessing the weapon involved in this case, of suspending the appellant’s sentence.”
The three judges deemed that the woman became pregnant between her entering a guilty plea in March last year and her being sentenced almost three months later.
They said that the woman only became aware that she was pregnant during routine testing at the start of her prison sentence, which would have “undoubtedly” influenced the sentencing judge’s decision “if it had then been known”.
Since discovering she was pregnant, the woman was being held in a mother and baby unit at her prison, which she could have stayed on until her child was 18 months old.
Pippa Woodrow, representing the woman, told the court that while pregnancy did not automatically mean a prisoner should be released, it made the five-year sentence “arbitrary and disproportionate”.
The court heard that the woman – who had no previous convictions – had “impeccable prospects of rehabilitation” and “has experienced real joy at being pregnant”, with the interests of the unborn baby a “weighty factor” in the judges’ decision.
While the judges said that gun crime had “devastating seriousness”, they accepted that pregnancy made prison an “unusually onerous punishment”."
5XT9Y64DXW_6T6F5VXW3MUW1YO,Blood test for brain cancer being tested by UK researchers,By Katie Collier Kate_Collier21 SEO Journalist,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24076096.blood-test-brain-cancer-tested-uk-researchers/,"A “world-first” blood test which can diagnose certain types of brain cancer is being tested by UK researchers.
Experts said the simple test could reduce the need for invasive and risky surgery currently needed to diagnose some brain tumours.
They added that it could also result in earlier diagnosis which could speed up treatment and potentially increase survival rates for patients with one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer.
Brain tumour experts have welcomed the news saying the test is inexpensive and would be easy to introduce to clinics.
Our Centre of Excellence at @ImperialCollege London and @ImperialNHS has recently published a study on a blood-test that can diagnose brain tumours 🔬     If you are interested in reading more about this exciting breakthrough read our blog ➡️ https://t.co/HPVPwkqsyI #Research pic.twitter.com/tNijbLncez
Patients with “inaccessible” brain tumours who could benefit from starting treatment as soon as possible would find the liquid biopsy particularly beneficial, experts said.
Researchers at the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence, which is run by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, have performed the first studies to assess whether the test can accurately diagnose glial tumours including glioblastoma (GBM), the most commonly-diagnosed type of high-grade brain tumour in adults, astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
According to a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, they found the test had “high analytical sensitivity, specificity and precision”.
Now, scientists hope to conduct larger studies in the UK to validate the results and if successful, experts estimate that patients could benefit from the new test in as little as two years.
TriNetra-Glio blood test, by Datar Cancer Genetics, works by isolating glial cells that have broken free from the tumour and are found circulating in the blood.
The isolated cells are then stained and can be identified under a microscope.
Dr Nelofer Syed, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Imperial, said: “A non-invasive, inexpensive method for the early detection of brain tumours is critical for improvements in patient care.

“There is still some way to go, but this solution could help people where a brain biopsy or surgical resection of the tumour is not possible due to the location of the tumour or other constraints.
“Through this technology, a diagnosis of inaccessible tumours can become possible through a risk-free and patient-friendly blood test.
“We believe this would be a world-first as there are currently no non-invasive or non-radiological tests for these types of tumours.”
Kevin O’Neill, consultant neurosurgeon at Imperial College Healthcare and honorary clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence alongside Dr Syed, said: “This test is not just an indicator of disease, it is a truly diagnostic liquid biopsy.

“It detects intact circulating tumour cells from the blood, which can be analysed to the same cellular detail as an actual tissue sample.
“It’s a real breakthrough for treatment of brain cancers that rarely spread around the body.
“This could help speed up diagnosis, enabling surgeons to apply tailored treatments based on that biopsy to increase patients’ chances of survival. I’m very grateful to everyone who has contributed to this study, especially the patients involved.”
Brain Tumour Research said that the findings are “significant” as less than 1% of patients with GBM live for more than 10 years and, for many, the prognosis is as little as 12 months.
Dan Knowles, chief executive of the charity, said: “This ground-breaking research could lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes for brain tumour patients.
“The research undertaken in UK universities is world class and something we should all be proud of, but we need so much more.
Recommended reading:
“There is an urgent need for novel approaches, particularly in the treatment of GBM, which is fatal in most cases.
“Brain tumours kill more people in the UK under the age of 40 than any other cancer and we have to find a cure for this devastating disease.
“It is scandalous to think that there have been no improvements to treatment options for this type of tumour in two decades and the standard of care for GBM patients – surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy – remains unchanged.
“This is why we are campaigning for the Government and larger charities to invest more and we will keep up the pressure until patients and their families get the help they so desperately need.”"

6DOQ394H34_1DEUGKNV6BO2VJ3,"Terrible things happen when we are polarised, Holocaust survivor says",By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070328.terrible-things-happen-polarised-holocaust-survivor-says/,"A Holocaust survivor has warned about the dangers of “polarisation” in the wake of the Hamas-Israel conflict.
Joan Salter, who was just three months old when Belgium was invaded by the Nazis, said “terrible things can happen” once interfaith relations start breaking down.
The 84-year-old said the Hamas attack on October 7 has had a divisive effect on Jewish and Islamic communities – Just as the terrorist group intended.
Speaking at her home in north London ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day on Saturday, she said: “I and most of the other Holocaust survivors speak in the hope of changing things to make people understand the dangers of propaganda and where it can lead to.
“And then came October 7. What is going on there is horrific.
“Instead of people realising what Hamas did, the hatred has turned either against the Jews or there’s a lot of Islamophobia, and that polarises our two communities.
“It’s what Hamas intended. It’s what they did with the intention of creating this hatred between the Jews and the Muslims.
“Once the polarisation sets in, that’s when terrible things can happen.
“I’m a great believer of interfaith, and so much of it has virtually evaporated within days.”
Born Fanny Zimetbaum in Brussels in 1940 to Polish Jewish parents, Mrs Salter was three months old when Belgium was invaded by the Nazis.
Following the invasion, she escaped to France with her mother and sister before being taken by the Red Cross to the USA in 1943.
Mrs Salter remained in foster care in America until being reunited with her parents – Jakob and Bronia – in 1947 in London, where she has lived since.
Speaking about her early life, she said: “My parents were Polish Jews who lived in France most of their adult lives.
“My father thought Belgium would stay neutral, so they moved into Belgium.
“When the Nazis invaded they started targeting the Polish men. My father was taken but he jumped from the train and managed to escape.”
Having moved back to Paris, Mrs Salter’s mother decided to cross the Pyrenees to the safety of Spain.
She said: “A policeman warned her that we were going to be rounded up.
“My father escaped over the mountains, into Spain, but we didn’t turn up and he thought we had died.
“Then my mother climbed over the mountains with my sister and myself.
“It was thought Spain would fall so my mother gave us up to the Red Cross and an American organisation took us across to America.”
In 1947, having lived with an American foster family, Mrs Salter was reunited with her parents.
On Saturday, Mrs Salter and thousands of others will light a candle and put it in their window as a form of collective commemoration.
Chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust Olivia Marks-Woldman said: “On the Holocaust Memorial Day itself, we’re inviting everyone to light a candle and put it in their window so that the light spills out.
“Holocaust Memorial day is for everybody, regardless of background, age, faith, no faith.
“We are so inspired when we see people from all backgrounds coming to events.
“Sadly even in the UK prejudice against Jewish people has rocketed, and anti-Muslim hatred has increased.
“We all need to be aware of that kind of prejudice and to be able to take responsibility for challenging it.
“That’s what we ask everyone to do on Holocaust Memorial Day to learn from the Holocaust and genocides and play a part in making a better future.”
On the importance of sharing her story, Mrs Salter added: “When we’re in a room with young people or adults, we can feel the interface between us and know that what we’re talking about is influencing them and making them understand where prejudice leads, and that is the one reason I speak.”"
6DPC2AOD5U_BZRNR6O27LUH83T,Tory infighting breaks out after former minister calls on Sunak to step down,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070423.tory-infighting-breaks-former-minister-calls-sunak-step/,"Tory infighting broke out into the open with senior party figures warning against “divisive self-indulgence” after a former minister called for Rishi Sunak to step down ahead of the general election.
Former ministers urged colleagues to put their duty to the country ahead of “tribalism” following a challenge to the Prime Minister’s authority launched by Sir Simon Clarke.
Writing in the Telegraph, the former levelling up secretary insisted “extinction is a very real possibility” for the party if Mr Sunak leads it into the election this year.
Sir Simon, who also served in the Treasury while Mr Sunak was chancellor, said the Conservatives face being “massacred” with him at the helm.
Other senior party figures immediately hit back, urging colleagues to “unite and get on with the job”.
Former Brexit secretary Sir David Davis said: “The party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK’s best interests.”
Former home secretary Dame Priti Patel said: “At this critical time for our country, with challenges at home and abroad, our party must focus on the people we serve and deliver for the country.
“Engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence only serves our opponents, it’s time to unite and get on with the job.”
Former defence and trade secretary Sir Liam Fox said those attempting to “destabilise the Government in an election year should understand the consequences”.
Former prime minister Liz Truss, whose 2022 leadership bid Sir Simon threw his support behind before serving as levelling up secretary in her Cabinet, does not back his intervention, it is understood.
Downing Street has been contacted for comment.
Sir Simon was among 11 Conservative MPs who voted against the Prime Minister’s Rwanda Bill at its third reading earlier this month, despite Mr Sunak seeing off a wider Tory rebellion.
His comments come amid a slew of wider challenges facing the PM, including opinion polls that show a healthy Labour lead and making progress on pledges to “stop the boats” and revive Britain’s sluggish economy.
Sir Simon’s attack has given Sir Keir Starmer plenty of ammunition as he faces Mr Sunak for Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, with Labour having accused the Tories of embroiling themselves in a “circular firing squad”.
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper branded the intervention “utterly ludicrous” and said voters were “sick and tired of this never-ending Conservative Party soap opera.”
Despite the intervention by Sir Simon, Mr Sunak is not believed to be in immediate danger of a leadership challenge.
A contest would only be triggered if 53 Tory MPs submit no confidence letters to the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee."

Grace O’Malley-Kumar, 19, was fatally knifed by Valdo Calocane in June last year, alongside fellow Nottingham University student Barnaby Webber, as they returned from a night out.
Calocane also stabbed to death school caretaker Ian Coates and on Tuesday, prosecutors accepted his plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to “serious” mental illness.
Ms O’Malley-Kumar’s 17-year-old brother, James O’Malley-Kumar, told Sky News that he thing he missed the most about his sister is her smile.
He said: “Knowing that I’ll never see that (smile) again is something really hurts me.
“I have her earring in now, which I always keep in, because again it’s a part of her, and that’s how I try and get as close as I can to her.”
He added: “Grace’s last moments were in pain and that’s something that really hurts me to think about and she was a hero, that was her character.
“She tried her best to save her friend. That was how Grace lost her life in the most vulnerable manner. She would never leave a friend, never, and that was very evident from her last moments. She passed fighting.”
She was studying medicine at the university at the time."

Jackiey Budden travelled all the way to Newcastle to see her grandson take part in the Strictly Come Dancing Live! tour.
She could be seen standing and waving to Bobby as he lifted the Glitterball Trophy alongside his dance partner Dianne Buswell.
This comes after reports that she has been ""banned"" from attending the Strictly studio because of an apparent feud with Jeff Brazier.

Jade Goody's mum was also said to have been ""very upset"" at spending Christmas alone and ""would do anything"" to see Bobby Brazier and his brother.
A source close to the family told the Mail on Sunday that Jackiey spent Christmas at her London flat instead of being with Bobby and Freddie.
They said: ""It’s tremendously sad for Jackiey, the boys are really the only family she has left since Jade died,"" adding: ""She would give anything to be with them on the day, to give them their presents and tell them how much she loves them.""
Speaking of the tumultuous relationship between Jackiey and Jeff, the source said: ""Jeff and Jackiey haven't got on for a long time and it has been hard.
""It has meant that Jackiey hasn't been able to be in the audience to watch Bobby, things are just too bad between her and his father.
""He and his brother Freddie are her only grandchildren and she adores them, there is nothing she would love more than to be there to watch him live.""

""That's the best thing in the world. I love it and I love that so much to be able to bring my best friends or my friends to cool things that I'm able to do. That's what makes it fun because otherwise - I don't really know.""

6TJR1Q9ME8_5FW4KOKZ9E6A0U1,Man convicted of murdering woman who pulled into his driveway after wrong turn,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070464.man-convicted-murdering-woman-pulled-driveway-wrong-turn/,"A man was convicted of second-degree murder on Tuesday for fatally shooting a young woman when the SUV she was riding in mistakenly drove into his rural driveway in upstate New York.
After deliberating for less than an hour, a jury found Kevin Monahan, 66, guilty of shooting 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis on a Saturday night last April after she and her friends pulled into his long, curving driveway near the Vermont border while they were trying to find another house.
Mr Monahan was also convicted of reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence.
Donald Boyajian, an attorney and spokesperson for the Gillis family, said they were thankful for the trial’s outcome.
“Obviously it’s a just result, but a very sad time for the family,” he said. “It doesn’t change what is going to be forever, which is the loss of their beautiful daughter.”
The murder conviction carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to life, which Washington County district attorney J Anthony Jordan said prosecutors would be seeking at Mr Monahan’s sentencing, scheduled for March 1.
Ms Gillis was killed days after the shooting of 16-year-old Ralph Yarl in Kansas City.
Ralph Yarl, who is black, was wounded by an 84-year-old white man after he went to the wrong door while trying to pick up his younger brothers.
On the night of Ms Gillis’ death, the group of friends were traveling in a caravan of two cars and a motorcycle looking for another person’s house party, when they mistakenly turned into Mr Monahan’s driveway in the rural town of Hebron, about 40 miles (64 kilometres) north of Albany.
They began leaving once they realised their mistake, but Mr Monahan came out to his porch and fired twice from his shotgun, with the second shot hitting Ms Gillis in the neck as she sat in the front passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend, authorities said.
During closing arguments earlier on Tuesday, the prosecution told jurors Mr Monahan was motivated by irrational rage toward trespassers.
“He acted out of anger. That’s the only thing that can be inferred from shooting at people within 90 seconds of being on his property,” said assistant district attorney Christian Morris.
“He grabbed his shotgun and intended to make them leave as fast as possible and he didn’t care if they were hurt or killed.”
Mr Monahan and his attorney maintained the shooting was an accident involving a defective gun.
Mr Monahan himself took the stand in his own defence, saying he believed the house he shared with his wife was “under siege” by intruders when he saw the vehicles approach.
He said he first fired a warning shot to scare the group away.
He said he then tripped over nails sticking up from the porch, lost his balance and the shotgun struck the deck. That, he said, accidentally caused his gun to fire at the Ford Explorer carrying Ms Gillis.
“I didn’t mean to shoot the second shot,” Mr Monahan testified last week. “The gun went off.”
Prosecutors also presented evidence during the trial that Mr Monahan claimed to have been sound asleep when police showed up at his house later that night.
Ms Gillis’ father, Andrew Gillis, has described his daughter as someone who loved animals and had dreams of becoming a marine biologist or a veterinarian."

The first test will come on Monday with a debate on a motion seeking to delay the Rwanda treaty.
Many peers have already expressed deep unease about the stalled scheme to put some asylum seekers on a one-way flight the east African nation.
But the Prime Minister has urged the Upper House not to block the “will of the people”.
Monday’s debate will centre on a report by the Lords International Agreements Committee recommending Parliament should not ratify the Rwanda treaty until ministers can show the country is safe.
The Government agreed the legally-binding treaty with Kigali in December, saying it addressed concerns raised by the Supreme Court about the possibility of asylum seekers deported to Rwanda then being transferred to a country where they could be at risk.
But the committee said promised safeguards in the agreement are “incomplete” and must be implemented before it can be endorsed.
The debate will give Mr Sunak a first indication of the level of resistance to his flagship policy in the Lords.
The treaty underpins the Government’s Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill which compels judges to regard Rwanda as safe.
Downing Street is likely to face attempts by peers to introduce a range of amendments to the proposed legislation.
The Bill is likely to receive its second reading by the end of January, with a third reading possible around the middle of March.
Mr Sunak was warned by a former Tory Cabinet minister to tone down threats to peers.
Nicky Morgan, now a Conservative peer, on Sunday told the BBC: “The last prime minister who used the ‘will of the people’ language, it wasn’t a happy precedent.”
Last week, Mr Sunak endured turbulence in Westminster after a significant cohort of Tory MPs rebelled to back amendments to the Rwanda Bill before largely folding and agreeing to back the plan in a crunch third reading vote."

Annie from Middlesbrough was last seen on Thursday, January 4, when she boarded a train at 2.09pm from James Cook Train Station in Middlesbrough arriving in Battersby in the Moors at 2.38pm.
She is described as white, around 5ft 10ins tall and of slim build. She has dark hair with a distinctive blonde fringe and a scar above her top lip. When she was last seen Annie was carrying a black and green backpack.
Today (Wednesday, January 24) the Metropolitan Police has joined the search for Annie.
Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Fionna McEwan said Annie has links to south east London.
“The focus of our search is still very much in the North Yorkshire and Cleveland areas where the last confirmed sightings of Annie were. We do not want people in these areas to stop looking out for Annie or not report any potential sightings of her,” she said.
“However, as Annie has not yet been located in these areas and we know she has links to south east London we wanted to extend our appeal to those in this area.
“Although the appeal to find Annie has been prominent in the North East of England and Yorkshire, if Annie has travelled to south east London she may not be fully aware of the coverage, which is why we are now asking for our appeal to be shared in this area.”
DCI McEwan urged anyone who knows where Annie is to phone 999 “as a matter of urgency”.
“Annie if you are in London and are reading this appeal for the first time, please do get in touch and let us know you are safe,” she added.
DCI McEwan said Annie is “very familiar” with the outdoors and wild camping (when someone sleeps in a tent in the countryside not in a campsite or caravan park) but added the force is “very concerned for her safety”.
“If she is still outside, she is likely to be wet and muddy and in desperate need of supplies, especially after the recent adverse weather conditions across the country,” she said.
North Yorkshire Police published this additional message to Annie: “Annie we know from speaking to your family, you would not like the media attention, or your photograph being published.   “We needed to do this to help find you. Once we know you are ok, we will remove your image from our website and social media channels and will work with the media to do the same.”
As The Press reported, Annie’s family previously issued a message to her through North Yorkshire Police urging her to make contact."
7PEJLYKOE9_Q7JX686DJJ60LL9,Two US-flagged cargo ships come under attack off Yemen,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24072573.two-us-flagged-cargo-ships-come-attack-off-yemen/,"Two American-flagged ships carrying cargo for the US Defence and State departments have come under attack off Yemen, officials said.
Suspicion immediately fell on Yemen’s Houthi rebels for carrying out the assault in the Red Sea.
The attacks on container ships Maersk Detroit and Maersk Chesapeake further raise the stakes of the group’s ongoing attacks on shipping through the vital Bab el-Mandeb Strait.
The US and the United Kingdom have launched multiple rounds of air strikes seeking to stop the attacks.
Meanwhile, Qatar, one of the world’s top exporters of liquified natural gas, warned that its deliveries were affected by Houthi attacks over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Danish shipping firm Maersk said the US Navy was accompanying its ships at the time of the attacks.
“While en route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the US Navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles,” Maersk said. “The crew, ship, and cargo are safe and unharmed. The US Navy has turned both ships around and is escorting them back to the Gulf of Aden.”
Maersk said both vessels carried cargo belonging to the US Defence and State Departments, as well as other government agencies, meaning they were “afforded the protection of the US Navy for passage through the strait”.
The ships were operated by Maersk Line, a US subsidiary of Maersk that is “suspending transits in the region until further notice”, the company said.
The Houthis, who have been launching attacks on ships since November over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, did not immediately acknowledge the incident.
Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, harming shipping in a key route for global trade.
The US and the UK have launched rounds of air strikes targeting suspected missile storage and launch sites used by the Houthis in their attacks. The rebels now say they will target American and British ships as well.
Meanwhile, Qatar announced its shipments of liquified natural gas had been affected by the Houthi attacks. Previous shipments had been delayed previously before heading through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.
Qatar, which has served as a key mediator between Hamas and Israel, has yet to see any of its ships attacked, however.
A statement from its state-owned QatarEnergy producer said that its “production continues uninterrupted, and our commitment to ensuring the reliable supply of LNG to our customers remains unwavering”.
“While the ongoing developments in the Red Sea area may impact the scheduling of some deliveries as they take alternative routes, LNG shipments from Qatar are being managed with our valued buyers,” the statement said.
The statement suggests QatarEnergy’s cargos are traveling around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, likely adding time to their trips."

TransPennine Express (TPE) said its Unity Train featuring the Pride Progress flag will be “a beacon of hope for the diverse communities” it serves in northern England and Scotland.
It is celebrating a week of inclusion to “embrace the individuality of both its employees and customers”, the Government-owned operator added.
The latest update of the Progress Pride flag is a redesign of the original rainbow Pride flag, featuring additional stripes to represent ethnic minorities, transgendered people and those with HIV/Aids, with a yellow triangle and purple circle to incorporate an intersex flag.
TPE managing director Chris Jackson said: “We strive to make sure everyone in our business feels included, that every individual, of every background and culture, feels heard and celebrated for what they bring to our team.
“The launch of our Unity Train is a historic moment for TPE.
“We want people of all backgrounds and characteristics to feel welcome, whether that’s using our services, applying for jobs or whilst at work.
“I’m thrilled that our Nova train featuring the Pride Progress flag will now shine brightly as it travels throughout the North and Scotland and I’m looking forward to celebrating the diversity of our colleagues and customers.”
Lisa Harvey Nebil, chief executive of LGBT+ youth charity The Proud Trust, which has formed a partnership with TPE, said: “Seeing the Unity Train in all its glory fills myself and our team with huge pride and we can’t wait for the LGBT+ community to see the train.
“We’ve already received fantastic support from TPE and we’re looking forward to doing more inspiring work together.”"

During a meeting in Jerusalem on Wednesday, the Foreign Secretary warned of “unimaginable” suffering in the territory as urged Israel to allow in more aid trucks.
He also called for the protection of medics and hospitals after the destruction in Gaza caused by the war triggered by Hamas’s bloody attack on Israel on October 7.
Lord Cameron also met Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the West Bank, during his diplomatic mission to the Middle East.
Mr Netanyahu has maintained his objection to Palestinian statehood despite calls from the US to work towards the two-state solution after the conflict.
The leader of a far-right government, he said last week that the idea would “endanger the state of Israel” as he criticised the “attempt to coerce us”.
On Thursday, the Foreign Office said Lord Cameron reiterated the UK’s support for Israel’s attempts to secure the release of the remaining hostages, believed to number about 130, still being held by Hamas.
But he also underlined to Mr Netanyahu during their meeting in his office that Britain believes long-term peace must be based on achieving a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

In a statement, Lord Cameron said: “The scale of suffering in Gaza is unimaginable. More must be done, faster, to help people trapped in this desperate situation.
“As I said to PM Netanyahu yesterday, far more trucks need to be able to enter Gaza and more crossings need to open.”
The former prime minister added to broadcasters: “What I was saying is, look, it’s time for an immediate pause in the fighting because we’ve got to not only get the aid in, but, crucially, we’ve got to get those hostages out.
“And what I think we can do now is plan for how you turn that pause into a permanent, sustainable ceasefire without a return to fighting. That’s what I was pushing on him. And that’s what I’ll be talking about here today.”
He said the Hamas leadership must leave Gaza for a cessation, but that the Palestinians must also be shown there is a “route to having a Palestinian state, to having a new future”.
I’m in Israel to discuss three key goals.
Securing the immediate release of hostages.
Increasing aid into Gaza through more crossing points.
An immediate humanitarian pause then progress towards a sustainable ceasefire.

The Foreign Office announced that a 17-tonne consignment of family-sized tents was being flown to Gaza on Thursday in a first joint consignment from the UK and Qatar.
During his visit, Lord Cameron will witness the aid being loaded on to a plane destined for Egypt, where it will go by road to Gaza.
The Rafah crossing between Egypt and the strip has been the major lifeline to get essential supplies in for starving Palestinians.
Lord Cameron pushed Israeli leaders for the city of Ashdod to be used to deliver aid.
The Foreign Office said Israel must open more routes into Gaza and fully restore water, fuel and electricity supplies."

8QBY964RZA_LS3S7OFHX6HJFH8,"Social housing residents’ vulnerabilities too often missed, says ombudsman",By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067587.social-housing-residents-vulnerabilities-often-missed-says-ombudsman/,"Grief and financial distress must be considered among factors that can make a social housing resident vulnerable, according to a new report calling for a Royal Commission with the aim of forming a long-term plan for the sector.
The Housing Ombudsman Service said it has seen evidence of landlords failing to consider such vulnerabilities, giving examples of insensitive comments made to a woman about her terminally-ill daughter and landlords losing the ashes of residents’ family members.
In its latest report focused on attitudes, rights and respect, the ombudsman said it had assessed what it means to be vulnerable in social housing in 2024 and how social landlords can better respond to the needs of those residents.
It has called for a new Royal Commission – a type of committee appointed for a specific investigatory or advisory purpose – for housing, which it said could be “transformative” because such a probe would be independent of Government and “not impeded by politics”.
The report – made up of more than 1,663 public responses from a call for evidence and hundreds of ombudsman cases – said that, while vulnerability is defined under the Care Act, not everyone who is vulnerable will meet this legal definition.
It said landlords must note that some vulnerabilities can be short term and include factors such as grief and financial distress.
On misconceptions around social housing tenants, the report cited the experiences of Grenfell Tower residents, and the family of two-year-old Awaab Ishak who died from a respiratory condition caused by prolonged exposure to mould in his housing association flat.
The ombudsman said a “skewed perception about the make up of social housing residents has created an environment where social housing tenants can be stigmatised and ‘othered’”.
In its report it also gave anonymised examples of situations where there had been disregard for things like bereavement and loss, including one case where a landlord was ordered to pay compensation after pests caused damage to the resident’s late daughter’s belongings, and “more than one case where the landlord has lost the ashes of residents’ family members”.
In one case it is understood a resident had temporarily moved out after a relative died and returned to find the landlord had changed the locks and disposed of all of her belongings, despite knowing she would return, while another saw the residents’ belongings go missing in transit.
The report stated: “This shows an inappropriate level of carelessness, as well as a lack of consideration and respect.”
Another example saw a domestic abuse survivor advised by the landlord to return to her property, and a resident’s mental health problems blamed for the landlord missing repair appointments.
The ombudsman noted examples of “disrespectful and unprofessional” remarks being made about residents, as it warned internal communications “should be factual, respectful and avoid opinion or judgments”.
Other recommendations include the need for a “vulnerability strategy”, which would include how it is defined, who assesses it, and what the review process is; a specific reasonable adjustments policy; and minimum staff training on customer care, mental health, learning disabilities, and sight and hearing loss.
It also suggested landlords set out a “resident of the future” forecast for the next 10 years, taking account of the ageing population and volatility in the labour market caused by technology and artificial intelligence, which it said “could create more fragile livelihoods for social tenants to a greater extent” than since the global financial crisis.
Ombudsman Richard Blakeway said: “This sector has a proud history of tackling social injustice and this housing crisis speaks to new social injustices in health, equality and race and it can rise to this challenge for the benefit of the country.
“Our calls for a Royal Commission, which is independent of Government and not impeded by politics, could be transformative.
“Central to our report is what it means to be vulnerable in social housing today, how landlords can respond effectively, and how to do so without stigma or marginalisation.
“Too often in our casework, residents’ vulnerabilities are missed or the response is inappropriate. Too often the concept of vulnerability is ill-defined by the landlord.
“Disrepair in homes or poorly handled anti-social behaviour in neighbourhoods is creating – or exacerbating – vulnerabilities.”
The ombudsman said there have also been instances of good practice by landlords, with some restructuring their housing departments to better meet the needs of their residents, and added that the sector could also do with more help on things like being supported to capture data on the full range of vulnerabilities which exist.
A spokesperson for the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the Government is taking “significant action” to improve the quality of social housing accommodation and to give tenants a “proper voice”.
They said: “The Social Housing (Regulation) Act will deliver transformative change across the sector, rebalancing the relationships between landlords and tenants and ensuring landlords are held to account for their performance.
“Tragic cases such as that of Awaab Ishak must never happen again, that’s why we’ve introduced Awaab’s Law to force social landlords to address hazards such as damp and mould within strict timeframes.
“Landlords must consider the Ombudsman’s report carefully and ensure they are taking the needs of vulnerable residents into account.”"

He allegedly sparked the blaze while trying to get rid of the body of someone he had killed.
The man’s apparent confession came as a shock when he was giving evidence at an ongoing inquiry in the Johannesburg fire’s cause.
In a surprise development, he said he had strangled a man in the basement of the rundown apartment complex before setting his body on fire, according to South African media reports of the evidence.
Police said later on Tuesday they had arrested a 29-year-old.
The man, who has not been named, is facing 76 counts of murder and 120 of attempted murder, and arson, police said in a statement.
The inquiry he was giving evidence at was established to look into the possible cause of the blaze.
It is not a criminal proceeding and the man’s confession was entirely unexpected."

The online retailer, which also had a shop on Bondgate Green, went into administration last April with the loss of about 70 jobs.
Fortunately, a consortium led by former Asda chief executive Andy Clarke and Chilli Marketing founder Gareth Whittle bought the business from the administrators for an undisclosed sum later that month, with the business re-opening soon afterwards.
A recently published employment tribunal document reveals 32 employees of the former company filed a claim for a protective award.
READ MORE:
Protective awards are given as compensation when an employer did not consult with staff before making people redundant. They are paid by the government’s Insolvency Service.
The document said all 32 claimants were staff at Farmison’s HQ at Bondgate Green and were dismissed on April 6.
It added “there was no recognised trade union and that there was no election of representatives”.
The case was heard in Leeds on November 7. The document added the administrator did not attend but gave permission for the protective award claims to proceed.
In his judgement, employment judge Phil Lancaster said:”The respondent has failed to comply with the provisions of section 188 of the Trade Union & Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 by not electing or consulting with appropriate employee representatives.
“The claimants are each entitled to a protective award for a period of 90 days beginning on 6th April 2023.”
A statement issued by the ‘new’ Farmison said: “This tribunal relates to the process undertaken when the administrator was responsible for the company, before the current investors acquired the business.
“Since taking on the business we’ve worked hard on beginning Farmison’s turn around, and we’re pleased we’ve been able to re-employ a significant number of Farmison colleagues who were made redundant by the administrator as well as other new colleagues from Ripon and surrounding areas."""

Vanishing Tory pledges
Tory North Yorkshire Mayor wannabe Keane Duncan has pledged millions towards dualling of the A64 (Mayoral candidate pledges A64 millions, January 23).
Well Mr Duncan, we have all seen how Tory promises vanish like summer snow. Look at HS2, 3he £350 million per week into the NHS, the TV licence for over 75s, illegal immigration still up (real figures, not made-up Tory ones).
No one should have to sell their homes to pay for care. And what about building 40 new hospitals?
ALL these plus many more have promises have vanished in a mesh of Tory lies.

Labour’s Baldrick
Sir Keir Starmer, the Baldrick of the Labour Party, has come up with a cunning plan.
In one fell swoop if he achieves office in No10 he will solve the national debt, reorganise the NHS, find a solution to the migrant crisis, give everybody a tax cut and wage rise, make woke law regardless of the people’s thoughts and ensure all our energy is produced by a green process.
The biggest problem is that he hasn’t shared his cunning plan with anybody else.

9T0JSA00IX_RZ7JXWJMGQKJN5V,Trump ordered to pay writer extra £65m for saying sex attack claim was a lie,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24078629.trump-ordered-pay-columnist-additional-65m-defamation-case/,"A jury has awarded an additional 83.3 million US dollars (£65.5 million) to former columnist E Jean Carroll, who says former president Donald Trump damaged her reputation by calling her a liar after she accused him of sexual assault.
Friday’s verdict was the second time in nine months that a jury addressed Ms Carroll’s claim that Mr Trump assaulted her in a New York City department store in 1996.
Another jury last May found Mr Trump liable for sexual abuse and ordered him to pay 5.0 million dollars.
Ms Carroll smiled as the verdict was read. By then, Mr Trump had left the building in his motorcade.
“Absolutely ridiculous!” he said in a statement shortly after the verdict was announced. He vowed to appeal.
“Our legal system is out of control, and being used as a political weapon,” he said.
This defamation trial was over things Mr Trump said about Ms Carroll while he was president.
Mr Trump continues to insist he was falsely accused.
The verdict was delivered on Friday by a seven-man, two-woman jury in a trial regularly attended by Mr Trump, who abruptly left the courtroom on Friday during closing arguments by a Carroll lawyer before returning to hear his own lawyer’s closing and the full rebuttal argument by another Carroll attorney.
He stayed in place to hear the judge’s instructions to the jury as well.
It was the second time in nine months that a jury returned a verdict related to Ms Carroll’s claim that a flirtatious, chance encounter with Mr Trump in 1996 at a Bergdorf Goodman store ended violently. She said Mr Trump slammed her against a dressing room wall and forced himself on her.
In May, a different jury awarded Carroll 5.0 million US dollars (£3.93 million). It found Mr Trump not liable for rape, but responsible for sexually abusing Ms Carroll and then defaming her by claiming she made it up. He is appealing that award.
Mr Trump skipped the first trial. He later expressed regret for not attending and insisted on testifying in the second trial, though the judge limited what he could say, ruling he had missed his chance to argue that he was innocent.
He spent only a few minutes on the witness stand on Thursday, during which he denied attacking Ms Carroll, then left court grumbling “this is not America”.
This new jury was only asked how much Mr Trump, 77, should pay Carroll, Ms 80, for two statements he made as president when he answered reporters’ questions after excerpts of Ms Carroll’s memoir were published in a magazine – damages that could not be decided earlier because of legal appeals. Jurors were not asked to re-decide the issue of whether the sex attack actually happened.
Ms Carroll’s attorneys had requested 24 million dollars (£18.8million) in compensatory damages and “an unusually high punitive award.”
Her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, urged jurors in her closing argument on Friday to punish Mr Trump enough that he would stop a steady stream of public statements smearing Ms Carroll as a liar and a “whack job”.
Trump shook his head vigorously as Ms Kaplan spoke, then suddenly stood and walked out, taking Secret Service agents with him. His exit came only minutes after the judge, without the jury present, threatened to send Mr Trump’s attorney Alina Habba to jail for continuing to talk when he told her she was finished.
“You are on the verge of spending some time in the lock-up. Now sit down,” the judge told Ms Habba, who immediately complied.
The trial reached its conclusion as Mr Trump marches toward winning the Republican presidential nomination a third consecutive time. He has sought to turn his various trials and legal vulnerabilities into an advantage, portraying them as evidence of a weaponised political system.
Though there’s no evidence that President Joe Biden or anyone in the White House has influenced any of the legal cases against him, Mr Trump’s line of argument has resonated with his most loyal supporters who view the proceedings with scepticism.
Ms Carroll testified early in the trial that Mr Trump’s public statements had led to death threats.
“He shattered my reputation,” she said. “I am here to get my reputation back and to stop him from telling lies about me.”
She said she had had an electronic fence installed around the cabin in upstate New York where she lives, warned neighbours of the threats and bought bullets for a gun she keeps by her bed.
“Previously, I was known as simply as a journalist and had a column, and now I’m known as the liar, the fraud, and the whack job,” Ms Carroll testified.
Trump’s lawyer, Ms Habba, told jurors that Ms Carroll had been enriched by her accusations against Mr Trump and achieved fame she had craved. She said no damages were warranted.
When Trump finally testified, Judge Kaplan gave him little room to manoeuvre, because Mr Trump could not be permitted to try to revive issues settled in the first trial.
“It is a very well-established legal principle in this country that prevents do-overs by disappointed litigants,” Judge Kaplan said.
“He lost it and he is bound. And the jury will be instructed that, regardless of what he says in court here today, he did it, as far as they’re concerned. That is the law,” Judge Kaplan said shortly before Trump testified.
After he swore to tell the truth, Mr Trump was asked if he stood by a deposition in which he called Ms Carroll a “liar” and a “whack job.” He answered: “100 percent. Yes.”
Asked if he denied the allegation because Ms Carroll made an accusation, he responded: “That’s exactly right. She said something, I consider it a false accusation.”
Asked if he ever instructed anyone to hurt Ms Carroll, he said: “No. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency.”
The judge ordered the jury to disregard the “false accusation” comment and everything Mr Trump said after “No” to the last question.
Earlier in the trial, Mr Trump tested the judge’s tolerance. When he complained to his lawyers about a “witch hunt” and a “con job” within earshot of jurors, Judge Kaplan threatened to eject him from the courtroom if it happened again.
“I would love it,” Mr Trump said. Later that day, Mr Trump told a news conference that Judge Kaplan was a “nasty judge.”"
9YVJT0JKRI_GBX7DX6AFY47T3A,Councils to receive £500m emergency bailout to avert cash crisis,By PA News Agency,_,20230124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24071194.councils-receive-500m-emergency-bailout-avert-cash-crisis/,"Councils are set to receive an emergency bailout from the Government following recent warnings of further bankruptcies.
The PA news agency understands a ministerial statement due to be made this afternoon will confirm upper tier councils will be handed an additional £500 million for children’s and adult social care in 2024/25.
Communities Secretary Michael Gove is also expected to announce lower tier districts will receive a funding boost of approximately £30-£40 million.
A senior council source said a change to local finance settlement at this late stage is unusual, but added the extra funding will stave of the immediate threat of many councils issuing section 114 notices, declaring effective bankruptcy.
The move comes after Rishi Sunak came under pressure from Tory MPs to boost the funding settlement for on-the-brink councils.
More than 40 Conservative backbenchers signed a letter to the Prime Minister, which was organised by the County Councils Network, warning that without emergency cash, many councils will be forced to cut crucial frontline services and hike council tax in an election year.
District council leaders also held an emergency meeting in Westminster on Tuesday to urge the Government to rethink the settlement due to the rising costs of tacking homelessness.
However, councils believe the level of new funding will only prevent a financial crisis in the short term, PA understands.
The local government finance settlement for next year included a £64 billion funding package.
The Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said this was a real terms increase of 6.5% for councils on average.
However, the total spending power available to councils includes council tax increases, meaning residents pay more for everyday services.
The funding would “ensure (councils) can continue making a difference alongside our combined efforts to level up,” the department said.
Finance bosses at seven councils have issued at least one section 114 notice since 2020, with three doing so last year.
The notices are an acknowledgment that the local authority cannot balance its books as required by law and lead to a freeze on non-essential spending on services.
Responding to the expected announcement, Cathie Williams, joint chief executive of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the extra funding was “much needed” and would be welcomed by people who receive and provide support.
But she added the scale of the pressures on budgets means more needs to be done to enable independence at home, support unpaid carers and address workforce shortages. Ms Williams said: “We need to move from treating the symptoms to addressing the cause of the challenges we see in adult social care, like long waiting times and people missing out on care altogether.
“We look forward to working with Government to develop a long-term, fully funded plan for adult social care that focuses on enabling people to live as healthily as possible, for as long as possible.”"

Carlton Primary School has been judged to be 'good' by Ofsted inspectors, having joined Selby Educational Trust in January of 2021 with a legacy ‘requires improvement’ judgement.
Inspectors visited again in November last year and judged the school to be ‘good’ in all areas. Inspectors noted that pupils were ‘happy’ and ‘adults had high expectations for learning.’
Read next:
When it came to areas where the school, which has 166 pupils, can improve inspectors said that in some foundation subjects, such as history, curriculum leaders have not had enough subject-specific training to help them enhance how their subject is taught. This means that teachers do not have a developed enough understanding of the specifics for these subjects. They said that the school needs to further develop the training requirements of these leaders.
Head, Jon Watson, said: “I am delighted, but not at all surprised, that we have now received the external validation from Ofsted that we are a ‘good’ school. I am incredibly proud of our school and of our wonderful pupils. We have made huge progress over recent years and will continue to do so moving forward.
""I am truly grateful for the consistent hard work of my talented and caring staff team, for the genuine support and appropriate challenge from both our Local Governing Board and Selby Educational Trust colleagues, and of course for the support from our families and local community. Carlton Primary School is a great place to be.""
Chair of governors, Julia Costello, said: ""It is great to see that all the hard work and progress made by Jon and the staff at Carlton Primary School has been recognised formally. It is clear from the feedback from parents and pupils that they were already aware of the great work that has been done and what a great school Carlton Primary School is and will continue to be.”
Ian Clennan, chief executive of Selby Educational Trust, said: ""We are delighted to have confirmation of what we have all known, that Carlton Primary School is ‘good.’
""The hard work of leaders, staff, pupils and parents has really paid off. This is a growing school, with more pupils and classes than ever before, experiencing a great school that is at the heart of their local community.”"

An inquest opening into the death of Lee Anthony Harding, of Bootham Square, York, heard he was staying with friends on October 29 last year when he was found unresponsive. He was 47.
As The Press reported at the time, Harding was previously in court having broken into a property in St Hilda’s Terrace, York, early on June 25, 2019.
A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said at the time: “At around 5.15am, the victim saw a man leaving his property from a patio door directly below the balcony he was looking over and started to film him on his mobile phone.
“Shortly after, he saw the man leaving a neighbour’s property carrying a laptop and called the police. Harding was arrested shortly after by officers but refused to comment during police interviews.
“Clothing and footwear recovered from Harding at the time of his arrest matched clothing and footwear worn by the person in the victim’s mobile phone footage and he was charged with two counts of burglary.
“Forensic evidence was later used to conclude that Harding’s clothing showed a strong association to that worn by the person in the footage.”
After Harding was sentenced to four and a half years jail at York Crown Court, having pleaded guilty, investigating officer PC Andrew Chapman said the victim had been left ""very shaken from the shock of seeing a burglar leaving his home"" but he would like to praise the man for his quick thinking actions.
“His description allowed us locate and arrest Harding in just under 15 minutes and the mobile phone footage that he provided enabled us to link Harding to the crime,” he said.
“Whilst no one was hurt in this case, burglary has a devastating impact on victims and so I’m pleased with the sentence handed down today and satisfied that another burglar is now off our streets.”
An inquest was opened at Northallerton Coroner’s Court today (January 22) and the court heard that at the time of Harding's death drugs and drugs paraphernalia were found at the address in Tennyson Avenue in Clifton.
Assistant coroner, Richard Watson, said the provisional cause of death was drugs overdose.
The inquest was opened and adjourned to a later date after a short hearing."

In his toughest language yet on the Israeli-Hamas conflict, secretary-general Antonio Guterres told a ministerial meeting of the UN Security Council that “the right of the Palestinian people to build their own fully independent state must be recognised by all, and a refusal to accept the two-state solution by any party must be firmly rejected”.
The alternative of a one-state solution “with such a large number of Palestinians inside without any real sense of freedom, rights and dignity … will be inconceivable”, he said.
Mr Guterres also said the risks of regional escalation of the conflict “are now becoming a reality”, pointing to Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan.
He urged all parties “to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous costs” of a wider war.
Mr Netanyahu’s rejection of a Palestinian state in any post-war scenario opened a wide rift with Israel’s closest ally, the United States, which says the war must lead to negotiations for a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace.
That goal is supported by countries around the world, as ministers and ambassadors reiterated on Tuesday.
The UN secretary-general also repeated his longstanding call for a humanitarian ceasefire — an appeal supported by almost all nations.
But Israel’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan again rejected a ceasefire, saying Hamas, which carried out a brutal attack on southern Israel on October 7, is committed to attacking again and destroying Israel, and a halt to fighting would only allow the militants “to regroup and rearm”.
He urged the Security Council to “eliminate the root” of the conflict, which he said was Iran.
Mr Erdan strongly criticised the presence of Iran’s foreign minister at the council meeting, saying the country provides weapons to Hamas, to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and Houthi militants in Yemen, “and soon these acts will be carried out under a nuclear umbrella”.
Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons and insists its nuclear programme is entirely for peaceful purposes.
But the UN nuclear watchdog has said Iran has enough enriched uranium for nuclear bombs if it chose to build them.
Riyad al Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister, said Israel is carrying out “the most savage bombing campaign” since the Second World War, which is leading to famine and the massive displacement of civilians.
“This is an assault of atrocities,” which has destroyed countless innocent lives, he said.
The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction, displaced an estimated 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and left a quarter facing starvation.
Israel began its military campaign in response to the October 7 attacks in which militants from the enclave killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 hostages.
Mr al Maliki said Israel does not see the Palestinians as a people and a “political reality to coexist with, but as a demographic threat to get rid of through death, displacement or subjugation”.
He said those are the choices Israel has offered Palestinians, calling them tantamount to “genocide, ethnic cleansing or apartheid”.
Mr al Maliki said there are only two future paths; one starts with Palestinian freedom and leads to Middle East peace and security, and the other denies freedom and “dooms our region to further bloodshed and endless conflict”."
ANC4IEKBID_VWCDJ8UQ5N4IAYI,Labour promises knife crime crackdown with ‘comprehensive’ ban,By PA News Agency,_,20230124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070803.labour-promises-knife-crime-crackdown-comprehensive-ban/,"Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour would oversee a “total crackdown” on the availability of knives on British streets, promising a comprehensive ban to tackle knife crime.
The Labour leader hit out at ministers’ delay in bringing forward a promised ban on zombie-style knives, pledging to instead extend the ban to a wider range of weapons and toughen current rules on serration and length.
The Government put forward plans to ban some zombie-style knives in August last year, but it has yet to be implemented.
An announcement on legislation to enforce the ban is expected shortly.
Sir Keir said the Conservatives are “letting a generation down” by failing to fulfil “grand promises of action”.
Labour said it would target the sale of dangerous knives online, with rambo knives, swords and machetes among the weapons too easily available at the moment.
It said it would close current loopholes by making any online site indirectly selling knives criminally liable for sales.
Sir Keir said: “The number of these deadly weapons on Britain’s streets is terrifying, and unacceptable.
“For years, the Tories have made grand promises of action, but by failing to bring a proper ban on these killer knives and to crack down on online sales to kids, they’re letting a generation down.
“The tragic cost is being felt by too many. Young people are being killed or maimed, and communities are blighted by fear.
“Labour will act. There will be nothing short of a ban by my Labour government. And we won’t stop there – we’ll crack down on online sales, too. No child should be able to buy a deadly weapon as easily as they can online today.”
The party, if it wins the next general election, said it would carry out an end-to-end review of online knife sales from the point of purchase to delivery.
This would include a review of the effectiveness of ID checks and verification measures, including checks conducted by Royal Mail and Border Force."

Money raised at Race for Life enables scientists to find new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer - moving closer to a world where everyone can live longer, better lives free from the fear of cancer.
The city’s Race for Life events take place at The Knavesmire, York Racecourse, on Sunday 30 June and are open to all ages and abilities. Mums, dads, sons, daughters, grandmas, granddads and friends can choose from 5k and 10k events. There is also a chance to take part in Pretty Muddy, a 5k mud-splattered obstacle course, and there’s a Pretty Muddy Kids option.
Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life, in partnership with headline sponsor Standard Life, part of Phoenix Group, raises millions of pounds every year across the UK to help beat cancer by funding crucial research. Lisa Millett, Cancer Research UK’s spokesperson for North Yorkshire, said: “No matter how cancer affects us, life is worth racing for.
“Sadly nearly 1 in 2 of us will get cancer in our lifetime, but Race for Life has the power not only to transform lives, but to save them. We’re proud that Race for Life has already helped double survival rates in the UK.
“We’d love for as many people as possible to join us at Race for Life. There is a race for everyone and we mean everyone. Walk, jog, run or take on the course however it suits best. It’s a chance to feel the power of moving together with fellow Race for Lifers and have fun with it.
“January is the perfect time to commit to getting a little more active. Whether people are living with cancer, taking part in honour of or in memory of a loved one with cancer, in it for the medals or just for the fun of fundraising, there is a place for everyone.”
Since it began in 1994, more than 10 million people have taken part in Race for Life, funding 30 years of hope and progress. Money raised has helped develop radiotherapy which benefits more than 130,000 people with cancer in the UK every year. Cancer Research UK funded scientists led the development of the Human Papillomavirus Virus vaccine, which is expected to prevent almost 90 per cent of cervical cancers in the UK. The charity also funded many large clinical trials looking at the effectiveness of the drug tamoxifen and the research shaped the way the drug is used to treat breast cancer today.
Andy Curran, Chief Executive of Standard Life, part of Phoenix Group, said: “We are incredibly proud to continue as headline sponsor for Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life, with the opportunity to encourage participation across the country.
“By working to raise funds for life-saving research, we can move towards a future where people live longer and healthier lives, free from the fear of cancer.”"

Ryan Vincent was on holiday with his partner, Chloe Edwards, and their two children at Primrose Valley Holiday Park in Filey in May 2017.
On the night of May 22 the 22-year-old was stopped by security guards Tony Walpole and Peter Conway after driving back to the caravan where he was staying
The guards stopped him after they saw a speeding driver earlier that night, the inquest at Northallerton Coroner’s Court on Friday (January 26) heard.
Mr Vincent got out of his car and handed Mr Walpole the keys.
During the exchange Mr Walpole, who was 55 at the time, said he smelled alcohol on Mr Vincent’s breath and asked for the police to be called, the inquest heard.
A blood test showed the level of alcohol in Mr Vincent’s system at the time was over the legal limit for driving, the inquest heard.
After the exchange Mr Vincent ran off and Mr Walpole followed him, the hearing was told.

Mr Walpole caught up with him and, after a struggle, took Mr Vincent to ground and sat on his back with his knees either side of his body and his hands on his shoulders.
Coroner Jon Heath said Mr Vincent was restrained for at least 11 minutes but probably 16 minutes.
Witnesses told the inquest they heard Mr Vincent say he could not breathe multiple times while being restrained.
Anne Marie Nicholas, a charity worked who was staying in a caravan nearby, said she saw Mr Vincent laid face down flat on the ground and heard him say: “Please mate can you just let me turn round I can’t breathe.”
Mr Vincent was not turned over while being restrained, the inquest heard.
Mr Conway arrived on the scene and put his hand on Mr Vincent’s arm while his colleague continued to sit on him.
In a statement, Mr Walpole said he planned to keep Mr Vincent on the ground until police arrived and did not intent to hurt him.
Police officers arrived on the scene and Mr Vincent was unconscious.
An officer carried out CPR on Mr Vincent but could not resuscitate him so called for an ambulance.
Paramedics performed CPR but were also unable to resuscitate him.
Mr Vincent was taken to Scarborough hospital by ambulance and died four days later from bronchopneumonia after suffering a cardiac arrest.
The coroner said he was satisfied the criteria for gross negligence manslaughter had been met.
Both security guards held Security Industry Authority licenses at the time.
They attended four-day training sessions but did not complete a physical intervention course as it was not a mandatory requirement, the inquest heard.
This element has since been made mandatory by the Security Industry Authority.
Speaking after the inquest, a spokesperson for Haven, which runs Primrose Valley Holiday Park, said: “Our deepest sympathies are with the friends and family of Ryan Vincent.
""We have provided our full assistance throughout the investigation and our thoughts remain with everyone affected.”
At the time of Mr Vincent’s death his family released a statement which said: ""Words cannot express the level of grief and loss we as a family feel.
“Ryan was very much loved and will be so missed by his family and friends.
“He was a very family orientated man and an amazing father, partner, son and brother.
“He loved life and lived it to the full."""
AUP0QNPHRV_KYLUAATDPYJ8BY9,"Action needed to tackle ‘genuine threat’ of abuse of politicians, report says",By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070466.action-needed-tackle-genuine-threat-abuse-politicians-report-says/,"Action is needed to address the “genuine threat to democracy” posed by the intimidation and abuse of politicians, a new report has said.
A report by the Jo Cox Civility Commission, named after the MP murdered in 2016, has issued a roadmap of 28 recommendations that would make life safer for political representatives and candidates for office.
Recommendations include the implementation of a central unit to address the abuse and intimidation of all elected politicians, and impartial political and media literacy should be made a mandatory part of the school curriculum.
The report also calls on social media companies to offer additional support for candidates at election times about how to protect themselves on the platform and report abuse.
Further police checks at politicians’ homes and offices is also among the recommendations.
According to the commission, research has found 43% of Welsh MPs and Senedd Members have received a death threat, while almost 90% of female MSPs have feared for their safety since being elected.
Jacqui Smith, chair of the Jo Cox Foundation and former home secretary, said in a statement: “Abuse and intimidation of elected politicians is a genuine threat to democracy in this country and now is the time to act if we want to prevent elected representatives from stepping down and ensure a diverse and talented future pipeline of politicians.
“Two main refrains have come up repeatedly in our research: firstly, a lack of a central coordinating force at government level, and secondly, a lack of political education which leads to confusion, misunderstanding, and abuse.
“We are urging all those identified in the report as having a role to play – including central government, policing institutions, and social media firms – to adopt these recommendations so that we can make real change for the benefit of our democracy.”
Mrs Cox, a Labour MP, was murdered by a white supremacist in a terrorist attack.
Sir David Amess MP, a Conservative, was stabbed to death while hosting a constituency surgery in October 2021.
Former prime ministers Sir Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron and Theresa May have all given their backing to the report’s recommendations.
Sir Tony called the findings “a vital step forward”, adding: “Robust political debate is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy and is to be encouraged.
“Yet too often, our politics is dissolving into abuse, threats, and violence that only serve to undermine the democratic process.”
Lord Cameron said: “When Jo Cox was killed in 2016, it was while doing her job and serving her constituents.
“As Prime Minister at the time, the outpouring of love and grief for her was a testament to Jo’s life and values.
“It is important and right that The Jo Cox Foundation has led this Commission to show a way forward that makes our democracy safer and civil for those who are elected to represent us.”"
B1A86C4FRF_JGNZZ80VK2LX5HT,Maltkiln CPO land west of York could be worth £170 million,By Thomas Barrett,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24074426.maltkiln-cpo-land-west-york-worth-170-million/,"Land that could be the subject of a compulsory purchase order to allow a new town to be built west of York could be worth £170 million, according to a councillor.
Cllr Arnold Warneken (Green Party, Ouseburn) gave the figure at a meeting of Selby & Ainsty councillors when he said an unnamed developer had valued 128 hectares of land around Cattal station that is currently unavailable.
A new town, called Maltkiln, would be built near the villages of Cattal, Whixley, Green Hammerton and Kirk Hammerton.
But large swathes of the site is currently off the table with North Yorkshire Council’s Conservative executive agreeing this month to explore the option of using a compulsory purchase order (CPO) to gain control of it and allow developer Caddick Group to build the homes.
A decision on whether to use the CPO has not been made yet but if it does happen Caddick has said it would underwrite any costs.
Cllr Warneken told councillors that despite public statements from North Yorkshire Council saying the landowner had pulled out from the sale this was not the case.
He said he has met the family who told him the reality was an option to buy the land had expired and a new agreement could not be reached with Caddick.

Cllr Warneken said: “The suggestion is, we can CPO it and give no regard for farming and the wishes of the family that’s farmed that land for 200 years.
“The real concern from the community is it’s not deliverable. This community, we're turning our back on them. The landowner wants to set the record straight, no way will they turn over and be submissive.”
At a meeting earlier this month, Conservative councillor Derek Bastiman, who has the business portfolio on the executive, insisted the CPO “is not a threat to beat the landowners into agreeing to sell land”.
Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service this week, Cllr Warneken said the £170 million figure could be an underestimate and the land may be worth even more.
He said a move to use the CPO could be “irresponsible” of the council due to well-publicised financial pressures on vital services such as adult social care.
Cllr Warneken added: “We’re delving into an area that’s not our responsibility. With the way construction costs are rising you’d be lucky to get your money back on the CPO and it may even lose money.”"

Walmgate just inside Walmgate Bar was sealed off by police tape and two rows of police vehicles following the incident, at 2.20pm.
Two First York buses – one an electric double-decker and the other a Park & Ride bus – were stationary within the area sealed off by the police tape, with their hazard lights flashing.
An ambulance was also parked nearby.
Police asked motorists and pedestrians to ‘avoid the area until further notice’.
But the road was reopened later this afternoon.

Another weather system will bring windy weather on Tuesday night and into Wednesday for much of the northern half of the country, The Met Office said.
Amber and yellow weather warnings for wind have been issued covering much of the UK, together with yellow warnings for rain covering parts of western and southern Scotland, and north-west England.
A yellow warning for ice has also been issued across northern and eastern parts of Scotland.
Gusts of 80mph could be experienced in exposed areas, with 40-50mm of rain possible over higher ground, the forecaster said.
Met Office chief meteorologist Steve Willington said Storm Jocelyn, named by Met Eireann, could cause further disruption hot on the heels of Storm Isha.
He said: “Although this system will be a step down relative to Storm Isha, with the damage and clean up still underway, we could potentially see more impacts from Storm Jocelyn.
“Outbreaks of heavy rain on Tuesday could bring rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20mm quite widely with 40 to 50mm over higher ground in southwest Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of northwest England.
“Wind gusts are expected to reach 55 to 65mph across northwestern Scotland while there is potential for winds to gust to reach 75 to 80mph in a few places, in particular exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal northwest Scotland early on Wednesday morning.”
Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said Tuesday will be another wet day before windspeeds start to pick up towards the evening.
“Tuesday will be quite a wet day for many people with a rain front bringing the chance of disruption,” he said.
“Higher windspeeds will start to develop overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.
“Windspeeds from Storm Jocelyn will be a slight notch down from Storm Isha, but with the clean up still underway, more disruption is likely.”
Temperatures are expected to remain mild.
Further transport disruption is expected on Tuesday after services had largely recovered on Monday.
ScotRail services across Scotland will be suspended from 7pm and there will be no rush-hour services on Wednesday, the railway operator has said.
Martin Thomson, national operations manager for resilience at Transport Scotland, said: “Across the wider network, we can expect to see more delays and cancellations with ferries, flights and rail from Tuesday into Wednesday morning.”
The Met Office said the highest recorded windspeed during Storm Isha was 99mph at Brizlee Wood in Northumberland, with gusts of 90mph at Capel Curig in Snowdonia on Sunday.
A 26-year-old man was in a critical condition on Monday night after his car hit a tree on a road in Northumberland, police said.
An 84-year-old man died after the car in which he was a front seat passenger crashed into a fallen tree in Grangemouth, Falkirk, Police Scotland said.
And a man in his 60s was killed in a crash involving two vans and a fallen tree in Limavady, Co Londonderry, on Sunday night, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.
Many people were expected to spend Monday night without any power, The Energy Networks Association said.
Some 24,000 were without power in some parts of Great Britain on Monday evening, mainly in the north of England and in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, 15,000 customers were without power.
A number of people were rescued by firefighters from flooded roads in the Yorkshire Dales.
A Network Rail spokesman said “hundreds of engineers” were deployed with chainsaws and cherry pickers to remove debris from tracks."

Prof Leitch, a prominent Scottish Government adviser, branded a Conservative politician “rude” and a Labour MSP a “smart-arse” after giving a coronavirus briefing in June 2021.
The messages were part of an exchange with then-Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, and were published by the UK Covid-19 Inquiry.
Prof Leitch, who is a civil servant, also called a newly elected Labour MSP, Mercedes Villalba a “new girl” after she was elected to Holyrood that month.
In a previous exchange, in May 2021, Prof Leitch said he could “barely understand” Scotland’s chief medical officer, Professor Sir Gregor Smith.
The Scottish Conservatives condemned “mudslinging” at opposition politicians, and called for Prof Leitch “to do the decent thing and resign or be sacked as national clinical director”.
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Flynn said “some of the language that has been used most people would probably be relatively uncomfortable with” but did not call for an apology.
He also said he was “thoroughly impressed with the job they did”.
Mr Flynn said: “It’s not for me to pass comment or judgment on the role of a civil servant but I’m sure Jason Leitch will be reflecting heavily on it and I’m sure if he wants to say something in relation to it he will to the people of Scotland.
“I think given some of the language that has been used most people would probably be relatively uncomfortable with it and it’s for Jason to determine himself which course of action he wants to take.”
He added: “I don’t think it would be unreasonable for people to expect someone who has used that terminology to apologise to those involved.
“But I also think we need to remind ourselves that the Scottish Government did work on all of our behalf. Nicola Sturgeon was on the TV every day reassuring us throughout the pandemic, trying to do the very best to make sure we were all safe.
“I was thoroughly impressed with the job they did. It certainly helped me and my family cope with what was a very challenging set of circumstances.
“And that was in stark contrast to what we saw emanating from Westminster with comments like let the bodies pile high.”"

The Chancellor and Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, met with bosses at Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Santander UK and the London Stock Exchange Group on Tuesday morning.
It follows recent efforts to improve competitiveness in the financial services industry amid a dearth in stock market listings and a slew of listed companies leaving London markets.
The meeting, held in Downing Street, saw the leaders discuss the outlook for the country’s economic and banking sector, the Treasury said.
Top bank bosses, including Barclays’ chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan and Lloyds chief executive Charlie Nunn, gave their views on what they thought the main opportunities for the banking sector were and how to make the UK industry more competitive.
The Government’s so-called Edinburgh Reforms sought to make changes to rules in the City when first laid out at the end of 2022.
They included new remits for watchdogs, repeals of some EU rules which would make it simpler and more attractive to list on UK stock markets, and relaxing ringfencing rules for banks.
The Government also last year scrapped a cap on bonuses for bankers in a bid to make the UK a more competitive financial hub post-Brexit.
It means there is no longer a limit on the amount people who work for a bank or building society can be given in annual payouts, a move which prompted criticism from trade unions and the Labour Party.
The Treasury said: “The Chancellor and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury set out that the Government would continue to engage with the industry to find new and better ways to unlock growth across the whole of the UK.”
The plans to boost interest in the City come amid a quieter spell for London’s top stock markets, as a string of listed businesses have been taken private by buyers in recent months.
The Restaurant Group, which owns restaurant chain Wagamama, was taken over by US private equity giant Apollo last year, taking it off the public markets.
The same goes for sofa chain ScS, which announced it had accepted a bid from an Italian furniture retailer, and logistics group Wincanton, which is the latest to reveal it was heading for private hands.
Just 23 firms listed on the London stock market over 2023, the quietest year on record since data first started being collected in 2010, according to auditing giant EY.
All of the banks which attended the meeting with Jeremy Hunt, and the London Stock Exchange Group, declined to comment."

Mr Trump’s exit came as a lawyer for a writer seeking millions of dollars in damages for defamation urged a jury to send him a message to stop abuse of her client.
US District Judge Lewis A Kaplan interrupted the closing argument that the lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, was making on behalf of writer E Jean Carroll to note for the record that Mr Trump “just rose and walked out of the courtroom”.
Later, Mr Trump returned to the courtroom to hear his lawyer, Alina Habba, argue that he should not be made to pay Ms Carroll for comments he made that Ms Carroll’s lawyers say set off a flood of hate messages from strangers.
Early in her closing, Ms Habba showed the jury a video in which Trump said a jury’s verdict last year finding that he had sexually abused Carroll was “a disgrace” and “a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.”
“You know why he has not wavered?” Ms Habba asked the jury. “Because it’s the truth.”
That statement prompted an objection that the judge sustained with a warning that “if you violate my instructions again, Ms Habba, you may have consequences.”
The comment carried extra weight because just before arguments began, the judge — without jurors in the room — threatened to send Ms Habba to jail for continuing to talk when he told her she was finished.
Roberta Kaplan and the judge are unrelated.
Trump had appeared agitated all morning, vigorously shaking his head during Kaplan’s closing arguments.
The walkout occurred shortly after Roberta Kaplan said: “Donald Trump has tried to normalise conduct that is abnormal.”
The closings were occurring in the defamation case against Mr Trump a day after he left the courtroom fuming that he had not been given an opportunity to refute Ms Carroll’s sexual abuse accusations.
Lawyers were summing up for nine jurors who will start deliberating later in the day whether Ms Carroll, a long-time advice columnist, is entitled to more than the 5.0 million US dollars (£3.93 million) she was awarded in a separate trial last year.
The final remarks from the lawyers come a day after Mr rump managed to sneak past a federal judge’s rules severely limiting what he could say during his turn on the witness stand, which wound up lasting just three minutes.
“She said something that I considered to be a false accusation,” Mr Trump said, later adding: “I just wanted to defend myself, my family and, frankly, the presidency.”
The jury was told by the judge to disregard both remarks.
A different jury last May concluded that Mr Trump sexually abused Ms Carroll in the spring of 1996 in the changing room of a luxury Manhattan department store.
It also found that he defamed her in 2022 by claiming she made up the allegation to sell a memoir.
Mr Trump, the Republican frontrunner in this year’s presidential election, has long regretted his decision not to testify at that trial, blaming his lawyers for bad advice.
The jury in this new trial has been told that it is there for a limited purpose.
Judge Kaplan will instruct jurors on the law before they deliberate, telling them that they must accept the verdict reached last year and only determine whether additional damages are owed for statements Mr rump made in June 2019 while he was president.
The claims had been delayed for years by court appeals.
Ms Carroll’s lawyers seek more than 10 million dollars (£7.86 million) in compensatory and punitive damages.
Trump attorney Ms Habba has argued against damages, saying Ms Carroll’s association with Mr Trump had given her the fame she craved and that death threats she received cannot be blamed on Trump’s remarks.
Judge Kaplan intends to instruct jurors on Friday that the jury last year concluded that Trump had assaulted Ms Carroll in the department store, but the same jury did not find that he had raped her, according to how rape is defined under New York state law."

Roadblocks are spreading in many French regions, one day after a farmer and her daughter died due to a traffic collision at a protest barricade.
Farmers have also been turning road signs upside down to protest against what they argue are nonsensical agricultural policies.
Some were planning to protest in Brussels, home to EU headquarters, where French farmers’ union Rural Coordination called for a demonstration against the “ever-increasing constraints of European regulations and ever-lower incomes”.
The protests are the first major challenge for newly-appointed Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who took office two weeks ago, and his government. Mr Attal met with farmers’ unions representatives on Tuesday.
Following the meeting, agriculture minister Marc Fesneau promised to make new proposals to respond to the crisis by the end of the week, including regarding food prices and simplifying regulations.
Arnaud Rousseau, head of France’s major farmers union FNSEA, said his organisation would release a listof 40 necessary measures later on Wednesday. Speaking on France 2 television, he said the protest movement was aimed at “getting quick results”.
On Tuesday, a car carrying three people rammed into a barricade of straw bales in the town of Pamiers, in the Ariege region of south-western France. A 36-year-old female farmer was killed.
Her 12-year-old daughter died later in hospital, the local prosecutor said in a statement.
Police detained the three occupants of the car for questioning."
CWR5Z04GLT_BGOBQKM5P9Q8KTO,Holocaust survivor Hannah Lewis says there are ‘no winners in war’,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064739.holocaust-survivor-hannah-lewis-says-no-winners-war/,"A Holocaust survivor who watched her mother being shot dead in front of her by the Nazis has warned there are “no winners in war”.
Hannah Lewis and her father Adam were the only members of her family to survive the genocide of the Second World War.
Now 86, Mrs Lewis has warned future generations to stay vigilant because “human nature is the same”.
Mrs Lewis, who grew up in Poland, was rounded up with her family and forcibly marched to a labour camp in 1943.
Towards the end of the war, her mother was lined up with other people and shot dead by German police.
Speaking at her home in north London ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day on Saturday, she said humans have a self-destructive nature.
“By the end of the war, only my father and I survived, everyone else had been murdered,” she said.
Asked about the importance of remembering the Holocaust today, she told the PA news agency: “Look what’s happening in the world. We don’t learn.
“Climates may change, places may change, but human nature is the same.
“We’re sort of self-destructive almost.”
Mrs Lewis was born in the small market town of Wlodawa, and was the only child of Adam and Haya.
She had a happy and uneventful childhood until war broke out and the Nazis occupied Poland.
In 1943, Mrs Lewis and her family were forcibly marched to a labour camp in a village called Adampol a few miles away.
She recalled: “My father was very, very concerned, because my grandfather was quite fragile, and he heard that when there were these marches, if you stumbled, if you fell, they had absolutely no compunction taking out a revolver and shooting you.
“He was determined that his father was going to be wherever we were safely.
“He ran around like a lunatic, and all he could find was a wheelbarrow. He and his cousins and everybody took it in turns to wheel my grandfather.”
Over time, most of her family disappeared. Her father and his cousin managed to escape to join partisans, leaving only Mrs Lewis and her mother in the camp.
She worked at Adampol alongside her cousin Szlomo and her mother, who were given jobs at the home of a village elder who owned the camp’s land.
She recalled the tragic day Szlomo was taken away by the Germans.
She said: “Szlomo was deaf and mute and I absolutely adored him. We did everything together as far as we could.
“This particular time, I could hear them on horseback and I could hear the cars as well.
“I got hold of his hand and squeezed it so he knew he had to follow me and we ran to the nearest barn.
“I pulled his hand and started going into the hay, but he let go of my hand.
“I couldn’t call him because he couldn’t hear, and the Germans were outside.
“The door was flung open, they walked in, and they saw him there.
“My last sight of my lovely cousin was him being held by the scruff of his neck, his feet kicking, and he couldn’t even have the voice to scream.
“I think that’s when the war actually came to me.”
During the last winter of the occupation, Mrs Lewis fell ill with suspected typhoid, and when her father came to warn them of planned German action the next day, her mother refused to leave knowing her daughter would not have survived the journey.
The next morning the German police arrived and her mother – with other people – was taken and lined up by the village well, where she was shot.
Mrs Lewis recalled: “She didn’t look at me at all, so I decided I would go and hold her hand, the way I’ve done lots of times.
“Before I could do it, someone yelled a command.
“They started to shoot, and I saw her fall. I saw the blood on the snow, and that’s when I grew up.
“I knew why she wasn’t looking at me, and I knew that I mustn’t make a sound.”
Mrs Lewis remained in the camp and survived as best she could until being liberated by a Soviet soldier who picked her out of a trench dirty and very hungry.
After the war, her father found her, and in 1949 she was brought to live with her great aunt and uncle in London while her father eventually left Poland to go to Israel.
Describing the moment she was reunited with her father, she said: “Suddenly, out of nowhere, there was my father, skinny, slightly dirty, but my father, and when he saw me, he put me in his arms and he started to cry.
“He couldn’t believe that I was still alive.”
Mrs Lewis now lives in London having married in 1961 and had four children and eight grandchildren.
She has been sharing her experiences in schools and universities through the Holocaust Educational Trust’s Outreach Programme for several years so that young people can seek to understand the impact the Holocaust has had on the contemporary world.
She continued: “People say to me ‘do you tell us this because you hate the Germans so much?’
“I say ‘no, I’m telling you this because I like you so much and I want you to be vigilant’.
“We shouldn’t be horrible to each other. We shouldn’t want to kill each other.
“There’s plenty of room for everything and everybody.
“I think understanding is very important. And I think we need to be kinder to each other.
“There are no winners in war. There’s the damaged and the less damaged, but there’s no winners.”"

Survivors joined senior politicians, actors and faith leaders at a memorial event in central London to commemorate 79 years since the Holocaust, and 30 years since the Rwandan genocide.
Several speakers made reference to the Israel-Hamas conflict, with the chair of the HMD Trust, Laura Marks, saying she was “appalled” by the October 7 attacks and that the “subsequent war in Gaza has caused immense civilian suffering”.
“The very fabric of our world feels fragile,” she said.
Ms Marks expressed her “sincere hope” that HMD “can breach divisions and bring people together no matter what race, religion or ethnicity”.
Vera Schaufeld and Antoinette Mutabazi, survivors of the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide respectively, spoke of that same fragility and told the PA news agency of their hope for people to come together.
A similar theme was taken up by the Prime Minister who condemned the “despicable resurgence of antisemitism” in a video message played at the ceremony.
“It is sickening that Jewish people are once again facing the most abhorrent antisemitism here in this country, in this century,” Rishi Sunak said.
“As prime minister, my message is clear: We’re not going to cower away and accept it, not on my watch.
“We will do whatever it takes to keep our Jewish community safe, but more than that, we will be far bolder and more assertive in defending our liberal values and our way of life, we’ll end the passive tolerance of words and actions that will go against everything we stand for, and we’ll tackle the root cause of this hatred with the most ambitious national effort to educate future generations.”
Ms Schaufeld was born in Prague in 1930 and was told when she was nine years old that she had to move to England on her own after the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and never saw her parents again.
She gave testimony during the ceremony in which she recalled losing her identity as “Vera” and becoming “the Jew” before she left for the UK.
Ms Mutabazi was 12 years old when she fled and hid for 90 days from people intent on committing genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.
Her mother, two brothers and 80 other relatives were murdered.
Both women felt that it was more important than ever to hold events of commemoration.
Ms Schaufeld, 93, told PA: “Especially as the present situation is giving rise to more antisemitism and I feel this is something that we thought didn’t exist, and it suddenly seems to be more prevalent, especially among young people and students, and I find that really, really awful.
“And I think there’s anti-Muslim feeling as well and I think it just has to stop existing and we have to be a civilised people who can live together and respect each other from whatever communities.”
Ms Mutabazi, 41, said: “It’s more important as ever to be able to commemorate the Holocaust, because it brings people together and we all need to be able to value individuals for who they are, not discriminate.”
Ms Schaufeld was a teacher before she retired and Ms Mutabazi is a chaplain.
Asked what their message to the world was, Ms Schaufeld said: “To try and understand other people, and to have empathy for other people.
“I was a teacher all my life, and I think it’s so important to make teachers and children understand how important it is to respect each other and to understand that people from different countries might need more help and more support as children.”
Ms Mutabazi said: “I want to inspire the next generation to connect – connect with your emotion, connect with those around you and value each person.”
She told PA: “I’m passionate about the next generation, leading the better life that we lost.
“We talk about the fragility of freedom, it’s not free when … you (Ms Schaufeld) lived all this 79 years ago … and then 30 in Rwanda, it keeps coming.
“So I hope when we come together to commemorate, we can learn the lesson and where ‘never again’, it will be the reality not as spoken but as action.”
Angela Rayner, shadow deputy prime minister, and Michael Gove, the Communities Secretary, both took to the stage to condemn the rise in antisemitism and call for people to challenge hate.
Ms Rayner said: “Many people wouldn’t expect me to say this but honestly Michael I’m really pleased to share the stage with you today.”
The MP added: “We have the responsibility to challenge hatred and prejudice within our society.”
Mr Gove said the “test” of how free a society is is how safe minorities are within it – a test he deemed the UK as “failing” – citing that Jewish communities have seen the biggest rise in antisemitism “since the Second World War”.
Home Secretary James Cleverly and Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle also attended the event.
Welsh actor Sir Jonathan Pryce did a reading of the “last letter” by Arvid Harnack, a resistance fighter, to his wife before he was executed by the Nazi regime.
A number of musical performances took place and the audience stood as they were led in prayer.
Holocaust Memorial Day will take place on Saturday January 27."

DU6FX4P28D_FK1FJ58R3P954M7,YORK: Date to submit Haxby station application delayed,By Adam Laver,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24073258.york-date-submit-haxby-station-application-delayed/,"Network Rail has been told to “get on with it” after the target to submit a planning application for a train station in Haxby was delayed.
Haxby station closed in 1930, but plans to reopen it were part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s ‘Network North’ plan that diverted money from the partly ditched HS2 project.
The original target for the submission of a planning application by Network Rail was January but it has since been pushed back to February 23.
However, a Haxby Town Council spokesperson said: “As completion has now been pushed back to December 2025 in any case, the minor delay in planning will likely not have any impact on the revised date at the end of next year for bringing the new station into use.”
Officers from both Network Rail and City of York Council are due to attend a Haxby Town Council’s public meeting on March 5 “to outline the key features of the planning application.”
Despite the delay only being minor, this has been a frustratingly long-winded project called upon by councillors for decades.
The BBC reported in 2013 that Cllr Dave Merrett said a new station had been an ambition of “successive councils over 20 years.”
Cllr Pete Kilbane, City of York Council’s transport executive, said: “This project is now sat with the Department for Transport and Network Rail and we urge both parties to get on with it.
“The delays are particularly frustrating given that back in 2022 the old Liberal Democrat administration kept telling us how the council needed to make urgent decisions or lose the project.
“The reality, sadly, seems to be far from what we were told.
“However we remain optimistic that the station will be delivered by 2025.”
Cllr Andrew Hollyer, the Liberal Democrat candidate for York Outer at the next general election, said: “Whilst it is disappointing to see the slippage in the scheme timetable due to government delays, the planning application is one of the final pieces of the jigsaw, with the site secured and full funding now promised.
“If the application is approved there should be no further impediments and residents can look forward to a station opening in Haxby by December 2025, if not earlier.”
A Network Rail spokesperson said: “Plans for the construction of Haxby station are ongoing, with a planning application to be submitted in February 2024.
“We are working towards a completion date of late 2025 and will continue to work with the Department for Transport and City of York Council to progress the project.”
The proposed station has public support, with 81 per cent of 1,200 people who took part in a public consultation exercise supporting the plans.
When the Network North plans were announced, Cllr Ian Cuthbertson, who represents the Haxby and Wigginton ward, said: “This vital transport link will transform connectivity for residents to the north-east of York via the new station at Haxby.
“It is imperative that this project now goes ahead without any further confusion or delay from the government.”"
EC4AB17IM5_GZ0CKJWD9DVHDCB,"York primary school results in reading, writing and maths",By Kevin Glenton @YorkPressKevin Reporter,_,20230124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24062681.york-primary-school-results-reading-writing-maths/,"NEW government data has revealed York primary schools’ reading, writing and maths scores for 2022-23.
Using Department for Education (DfE) figures and boundaries for 'York Central' and 'York Outer', Rufforth Primary School near York led the way with 87 per cent of eligible students achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and maths in key stage two in the 2022-23 school year.
It was followed by:
At the other end of the table was Westfield Primary Community School in Acomb where 29 per cent of eligible students achieved the expected standard.
Overall in England, 60 per cent of students met the standard in 2022-23 – up from 59 per cent the year before but below 65 per cent in 2018-19, before the pandemic.
The Government aims for 90 per cent of key stage two children to meet the expected standard in reading, writing and maths.
Pupils scoring at least a scaled score of 100 out of 120 will have met the expected standard in the test.
School leaders' union the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said ranking schools is simplistic and does not consider the context of the particular cohort or the community the school serves.
The DfE said the statistics covered the attainment of year six pupils who took assessments in summer 2023 and that these pupils experienced disruption to their learning during the pandemic, particularly at the end of year three and in year four.
Rufforth Primary School’s headteacher Jill Richards said: “We are incredibly proud of the progress and attainment made by our Year Six pupils last year.
“High attainment is of course something to celebrate but we are equally proud of the progress our students make and their wider personal development throughout their time at school.”
Lamara Taylor, headteacher at Westfield Primary School said: “The Education Endowment Foundation published a report in May 2022 highlighting the impact that Covid had on the attainment of all pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“Evidence shows pupils from areas of high deprivation have experienced a greater impact.
“Our results are a reflection of this.
“We are delighted that in July 2023 Ofsted recognised that, despite our outcomes, we remain a good school ‘where pupils benefit from an ambitious curriculum and rich cultural experiences’.”

The NAHT said government investment is needed to help pupils recover from the pandemic, as figures show the proportion of students meeting the expected mark is well below pre-pandemic levels.
General secretary Paul Whiteman added: ""No piece of data can provide an accurate picture of the effectiveness of schools, whose work goes far beyond that number, and league tables and ranking of schools should be scrapped.
""They can have damaging consequences and can actually be a barrier to improvement.""
A DfE spokesperson said: “We know the pandemic had a significant impact on education globally which is why we have made £5 billion available since 2020 for education recovery initiatives, including just under five million tutoring course starts to date supporting pupils in all corners of the country.""
They added England outperformed the international average in maths, reading and science.

EINNIREL8G_FCEVTYJSLQU8JMC,York: Claire Douglas denies promise to freeze council tax,By Adam Laver,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24077190.york-claire-douglas-denies-promise-freeze-council-tax/,"The leader of City of York Council has denied she pledged to freeze council tax before last year's May elections - after voting to increase the tax by nearly five per cent.
Before being elected as council leader, Cllr Claire Douglas was pictured and quoted on Labour campaign material saying: “York needs a Labour-run council to freeze your council tax.”
But on Thursday night (January 25), the Labour executive voted to increase council tax by 4.99 per cent – not including parish, police and fire authority precepts – to add more than £5 million to its annual budget amid a forecasted £11 million overspend.
The Liberal Democrat party, the opposition on the council, is suggesting the tax hike is a broken promise by Cllr Douglas.
But the council leader says the campaign material referred to a pledge made by the national Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer to freeze council tax if he became Prime Minister.
The campaign material distributed before the May 2023 local elections that saw Labour elected in York with a majority quotes Cllr Douglas saying: “York needs a Labour-run council to freeze your council tax, reverse the Liberal Democrats’ blue badge ban, get free school meals to all primary school pupils and decarbonise our city.”
The campaign material
The blue badge ban, free school meals and carbon promises featured in Cllr Douglas's six election pledges.
But freezing council tax was not one of her six pledges and the council leader says it featured in campaign material because the national party asked her to include it.
Following the executive meeting on Thursday, the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Cllr Douglas to explain the campaign material.
READ MORE:
She said: “That was a national Labour Party commitment from Keir Starmer that was made in March 2023 to launch the local election campaign from our national party.
“He committed that if Labour was in government they would freeze council tax for a year and so that’s where it came from.”
Asked if the council tax line was misleading, she added: “In my view, that’s not what the pledge was about.
“It was adhering to the national commitment to do that for residents so that’s why it was on there.”
York Labour’s actual key pledges before the May elections were:
Cllr Paula Widdowson, deputy leader of York Liberal Democrats, said: “This is yet another example of a broken promise by this Labour administration.”
She also accused Labour of breaking promises on free school meals for all primary school children because the party has only announced two one-year trials.
However, Labour has previously said it aims to deliver the pledge in full by the next set of council elections, dependent on fundraising.

She said Labour promised to bring well-paid jobs to York but said the council is now “cutting the economic development team"".

EIPXKJMZCY_N2IEY9O354Z8Q02,Irish government under further pressure to join Gaza genocide case,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24071565.irish-government-pressure-join-gaza-genocide-case/,"The Irish government has faced further pressure to join South Africa in a genocide case against Israel, as opposition parties criticised its decision to await the preliminary findings from the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The Taoiseach has said the government will wait until South Africa files its main case against Israel before deciding whether to submit an intervention.
South Africa has brought a case against Israel’s action in Gaza, which has killed 25,000 people since October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
On Wednesday, the Social Democrats tabled a motion in the Dail calling on the Irish government to support South Africa’s case.
Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns said that the question of Ireland supporting the case at the ICJ has been “firmly kicked to touch”.
“We are told you will strongly consider an intervention in the South African case but only after the preliminary ruling has been made and after South Africa files its substantive case,” Ms Cairns said.
“That could take months… We do not need to wait for preliminary judgments and subsequent assessments to indicate our support. I’m sure the government knows that.”
Ms Cairns also accused the government of refusing to use the word genocide in reference to Israel’s actions in Gaza.
""We are told Govt will strongly consider an intervention in the South African case – but only after the preliminary ruling has been made by the ICJ,"" says @HollyCairnsTD

“This is despite the enormous death toll, the tens of thousands who have been maimed, the collapse of the healthcare system, the breakout of famine and the fact that the UN is now warning Gaza has been rendered uninhabitable,” the West Cork TD said.
“Clearly, genocide isn’t a word the government wants to use in relation to Israel, at least not until the preliminary ruling from the ICJ gets it some cover.”
Later on Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Leinster House in support of the motion.
Demonstrators waved Palestinian flags and carried placards which called on the Taoiseach to boycott the traditional annual trip to the White House for St Patrick’s Day over US support of Israel.
Under the night sky, protesters installed a large illuminated sign spelling out “Gaza” across the road from the gates of Leinster House.
Delivering a speech at the protest, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the US and leading European Union states are “up to their necks in Palestinian blood and complicity with Israel’s crimes”.
He added: “It is beyond shameful that the Irish Government still this week is refusing to commit to support South Africa’s brave, courageous decision to take Israel to the ICJ for the crime of genocide against the people of Gaza.”
Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon accused the Government of being “cowardly” in its position, adding: “We can’t stand back and be meek.”
Labour leader Ivana Bacik said Israel was practising apartheid.
She said: “Today we stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza as they endure horrific bombardment.”
Independent senator Frances Black said: “Three-and-a-half months into this nightmare, the Government continues to sit on the fence.
“After all this time, all the death, the destruction, horror – Government still refuses to take meaningful action. It has to make you wonder – if not now, when?
“What does Israel have to do for Ireland to impose sanctions? Is empty rhetoric the only thing we can offer our Palestinian brothers and sisters when they look for practical assistance in their darkest hour.”
During the Dail debate, Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said Israel is engaging in a “land grab”.
“This is about wiping out the Palestinian people or removing them from the homeland,” Ms Murphy said.
“That’s what this is about. It’s about a genocide. It’s about ethnic cleansing.”
Minister for agriculture Charlie McConalogue said the government is taking the South Africa’s case “very seriously”.
“Any decision we take about an intervention will be based on detailed and rigorous legal analysis,” he added.
“The government’s position has been clear and consistent across all forums in its bilateral engagement. We need a humanitarian ceasefire. This is a message we conveyed to the United Nations yesterday and remains central to the Tanaiste’s approach to the Foreign Affairs Council earlier this week.”
Sinn Fein’s Matt Carthy said more than 25,000 people, including 10,000 children, have been killed in the last 100 days.
He said that the Israeli military has attacked every hospital in Gaza and demolished education buildings.
“If that isn’t genocide, well then I really do not know what genocide will ever mean again because what would we apply that term to?” Mr Carthy added.
“If we can’t apply it to what is being done by Israel on the Palestinian people of Gaza, well then, essentially, the term of genocide becomes a unicorn. Something that doesn’t happen.
“But it does happen because it is happening in Gaza right now.”"
EPY98LJM5N_PO4VLOPALRJ8160,Fresh UK and US airstrikes on Houthi targets ‘deal another blow’ to militants,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067571.fresh-uk-us-airstrikes-houthi-targets-deal-another-blow-militants/,"The UK and the US have carried out a fresh set of joint airstrikes in Yemen, in the latest bid to stop Houthi attacks.
Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the latest round of strikes were in “self-defence” and would “deal another blow” to the Iranian-backed militants.
It follows seven rounds of airstrikes on Houthi military sites by the US in recent days and comes after the UK took part in an initial joint strike operation earlier this month against the Houthis.
Since then, ships have continued to be targeted along the vital Red Sea and Gulf of Aden trade routes, with the US military confirming the latest strikes were against eight targets.
Mr Shapps said: “Dangerous Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have continued to threaten the lives of sailors and disrupt shipping at an intolerable cost to the global economy. Along with our US partners, we have conducted a further round of strikes in self-defence.
“Aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities, this action will deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade. Alongside our ongoing diplomatic efforts, we will continue to support regional stability across the Middle East, working hand in hand with our like-minded partners.”
The MoD said that four Royal Air Force Typhoons and a pair of Voyager tankers were involved in the latest military strike, which it said saw multiple targets hit at two military sites near the Sanaa airfield in Yemen.
The department said that a “very rigorous analysis” was carried out to avoid civilian casualties. According to US Central Command, “targets missile systems and launchers, air defence systems, radars and deeply buried weapons storage facilities” were among the targets.
A senior US military official told a press briefing initial assessments indicated missiles, unmanned aerial systems and weapons storage areas had been destroyed which had “degraded their (Houthis’) ability to conduct these maritime attacks”.
The Houthis’ media office in an online statement said that several American and UK raids targeted Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.
The second operation between the UK and the US comes after a series of joint military strikes on January 11 which saw US and UK warships and jets hit more than 60 targets in 28 locations.
Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden had spoken earlier on Monday evening, with a Number 10 readout stating that the two leaders had agreed “continue efforts alongside international partners to deter and disrupt” attacks by the Houthis.
A joint statement issued by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the US described the strikes as “proportionate and necessary”.
The statement said that the mission targeted Houthi underground storage site as well as locations linked to the Houthis’ missile and air surveillance capabilities.
It continued: “The Houthis’ now more than 30 attacks on international and commercial vessels since mid-November constitute an international challenge.
“Recognising the broad consensus of the international community, we again acted as part of a coalition of like-minded countries committed to upholding the rules-based order, protecting freedom of navigation and international commerce, and holding the Houthis accountable for their illegal and unjustifiable attacks on mariners and commercial shipping.”
The countries also warned: “We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.”
While the US, UK and other Western allies have insisted the strikes are not escalatory, it comes as tensions simmer in the Middle East as the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues.
The Houthis, a Shia rebel group that has held Sanaa since 2014 and been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s exiled government since 2015, have linked their attacks to the Israel-Hamas war.
However, the ships they have targeted increasingly have tenuous links to Israel – or none at all.
The latest operation could raise fresh questions about the need to consult Parliament over military action. It is understood that in contrast to the strikes on January 11, neither Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer nor Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were briefed about the operation.
Mr Sunak, after the first joint mission, gave a statement to MPs at the earliest possible opportunity. It remains to be seen if or when he will come before the Commons after these latest strikes."
EX63JSROYZ_AWL31PJ3OKB811A,UK diplomat plays downs delays to naming date for major European summit,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24069243.uk-diplomat-plays-downs-delays-naming-date-major-european-summit/,"The UK’s ambassador to the EU has played down reports of delays by the Government in picking a date for a meeting of the European Political Community in the first half of the year.
A report in the Financial Times said some EU diplomats have linked a failure to pin down a date for the summit to debates inside Downing Street about the timing of a general election and a failure to rule out completely a spring poll.
Originally an idea of Emmanuel Macron’s and now something of regular part of the political calendar, the European Political Community includes countries both inside and outside the EU.
The UK has long been scheduled to host a gathering in 2024.
Lindsay Croisdale-Appleby, appearing at an event hosted by the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said the “reality” was “when you look at the international calendar, it is a very busy six months”.
Pointing to several scheduled European Council meetings as well as a major Nato gathering in Washington, he said the discussions inside Government were “when do we organise the summit so it can really add value?”.
“We are committed to the format of the EPC but we need to show on an ongoing basis the meetings are a success and deliver good quality outcomes.”
He said the Government was talking to allies both in and outside the EU but “haven’t reached a conclusion on that yet”.
But he insisted the UK was “capable” of hosting a major European summit in a matter of months.
Pedro Serrano, the EU’s ambassador to the United Kingdom and who appeared at the same event, suggested that regardless of the number of European Council meetings leaders had agreed to host two summits a year.
EU leaders, he said, “are very happy to attend an EPC and are looking forward to the convening of this meeting by the UK”.
Downing Street said the announcement on the date would come in “due course”."

National clinical director Professor Jason Leitch will give evidence on Tuesday, with the retention of informal messaging likely to be high on the agenda.
Last week, a message from Prof Leitch was shown to the inquiry in which he said deleting WhatsApp messages was a “bed time ritual”.
The statement followed reports last year that senior Scottish Government officials deleted messages relating to the pandemic regularly and could not hand them to the inquiry.
Former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney were also revealed not to have retained messages, although Ms Sturgeon said in a statement at the weekend correspondence had been given to the inquiry after being saved by recipients.
On Monday, the issue was raised with Scotland’s chief medical officer Professor Sir Gregor Smith, with a message showing him instructing colleagues to “delete at the end of every day”.
Sir Gregor told the inquiry Scottish Government advice was “not to retain information for longer than it was necessary”, adding that information he deemed to be pertinent would not be recorded “verbatim” on Government systems, but the “essence” would.
Opposition politicians have accused officials of secrecy over the issue, with the Scottish Tories calling for Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney to make a statement in parliament.
Prof Leitch shot to prominence during the pandemic, appearing at Scottish Government briefings alongside the then first minister on a near-daily basis as well as fronting public information campaigns on TV, radio and online.
The inquiry has moved to Edinburgh as it probes the devolved administration’s response to the pandemic."

Every household in the UK is legally required to have a TV licence if they watch or record live TV, regardless of what channel it is on.
However, those of us aged 75 or over who are in receipt of Pension Credit, the TV Licence can be obtained for free rather than costing £159.
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) posted on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""Are you missing out on extra money, Cost of Living Payments, help with energy bills and - for over 75s - a free TV licence? ​

""Check your eligibility for Pension Credit and apply online today.""
Guidance from TV Licensing says: “Free TV Licences are only available if you’re 75 or over and you, or your partner living at the same address, are receiving Pension Credit.
“If you think you’re eligible for a free licence but can’t apply online, please call 0300 790 6117* and speak to one of our advisors to request an application form (our lines are open between 8.30am and 6.30pm, from Monday to Friday).

“Once we’ve received your application it may take a few weeks to process. If there are any problems we’ll write to let you know. We may also call you if you have given us your phone number.
“There are separate arrangements in place for over 75s on the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey.”
Even if you do not meet the eligibility criteria for a free TV Licence you may be able to get some money back on yours, so long as it is no longer needed.
If you have already purchased a TV licence but do not watch or record live TV, or stream BBC iPlayer, you could be entitled to a refund worth £159.
Households across the UK can apply for a refund if you won’t need your licence again before it expires, and you have at least one complete month left on it or the licence fee for you expired less than two years ago.
You can apply for a refund online here.
The amount you will be due in a refund will be worked out by TV Licensing, the organisation that issues TV licences.
They explain how they work out the amount you will be due here: “Any refund due is calculated in unused months. You must have at least one complete month left on your licence that you won’t need before it expires.
“So, you could get a refund for between one and 11 months, depending on how long you have left on your licence.
“You won’t be eligible for a refund if there is less than one month between the cancellation date and the expiry date.
“If you haven’t paid for your licence in full, its expiry date may be changed to reflect what you’ve paid.”"
FX9ZJDIDXA_GG6UDQHV19GD2MV,Former investigator still believes subpostmaster is guilty despite court ruling,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24071382.former-investigator-still-believes-subpostmaster-guilty-despite-court-ruling/,"A former Post Office investigator still believes a subpostmaster stole money from his branch despite a court overturning his wrongful conviction, the Horizon IT inquiry has heard.
Raymond Grant told the probe he considered William Quarm to still be guilty of stealing money from his Post Office branch in North Uist, Scotland, but denied that was the reason for not regarding the inquiry as a priority.
Mr Quarm was convicted of embezzlement in 2010 and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.
He died two years later at the age of 69 and his conviction was successfully quashed in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh last year.
Mr Grant also lamented the fact that “there was nobody paying me the salary to do the work that we’re here talking about today” as he was asked to recall his time at the Post Office.
He said he had to conduct research “in my own personal time” and had “spent some time in my sick bed reading” in preparation for giving evidence to the inquiry.
The probe heard Mr Grant had to be forced to attend on Wednesday as his “time was limited” due to his “10 to 11-hour” working days and moving house.
He submitted a “minimum” witness statement that was a little over two pages long – arguing that he was looking after homeless residents in a Christian shelter during December where “there are a lot of activities going on”.
Counsel to the inquiry Jason Beer KC said he would see if the witness could improve on his statement, before adding: “Now that carol services and dog walking are out of the way”.
Mr Beer asked the former investigator: “When you made a witness statement, did you think that Mr Quarm continued to be guilty of the crime of embezzlement?”
Mr Grant replied: “Yes I did.”
Mr Beer said: “Does that remain your view?”
Mr Grant responded: “I’ve subsequently been advised that the verdict has been reversed so he is now not guilty of the offence.”
Mr Beer pressed him: “I’m talking about in your mind.”
The former investigator said: “In my mind, I still think Mr Quarm had a role to play in the loss of the money.”
Mr Beer continued: “That’s a different answer to a different question – the question would be ‘did Mr Quarm have a role to play in the events?’
“The question I, in fact, asked was ‘Do you think, do you remain of the view, that he’s guilty of the crime?'”
Mr Grant replied: “Yes I do.”
The counsel to the inquiry went on: “Despite the verdict of the High Court of Judiciary in Scotland?”
Mr Grant said: “Yes.”
Mr Beer then asked: “Was that amongst the reasons that you didn’t regard this inquiry as a priority?”
Mr Grant responded: “No.”
The counsel to the inquiry said: “You haven’t said that to any of the solicitors in the inquiry before – ‘Mr Quarm was guilty, I don’t know why you’re asking me questions about this’.
Mr Grant said: “If I’ve said that, then that would be my view at that time, yes.”
Mr Beer continued: “‘It may be a priority for you investigating but it’s not a priority for me’. They would accord with your sentiments, wouldn’t they?”
Mr Grant said: “Well I think you’re mixing up the priority. I’m talking about priorities that I had in my personal role 16 years on from being a Post Office investigator, working for another organisation who pay me my salary.
“There was nobody paying me the salary to do the work that we’re here talking about today.
“I was being asked to do that in my own personal time.”
He continued: “I do not think that it was a fair thing to ask me to do in such a short space of time, considering that this inquiry has been going on for a number of months and years.”
Asked if he still believed that documents sent to him by the inquiry would not help him recall his time at the Post Office, Mr Grant replied: “I’ve had a bit of time, I was actually off sick last week.
“I spent some time in my sick bed reading up some of these things to prepare for today.
“There’s some that I still don’t recognise and still don’t recall.
“But in general terms, I’ve done a bit of research since, in my own personal time I hasten to add – I’m not employed by the Post Office any more, my employer is the Salvation Army. They require me.
“I recognise the seriousness of this inquiry, and I understand why it’s being done, but to ask a layperson, which is what I am right now, these facts and figures, documents to recall 16 years ago – I find that very difficult.”
At the end of his evidence, Mr Grant appeared to become emotional as he said for his “part” in the scandal, he was “humbly sorry”.
He said his former employer had been “less than open and honest with information that should have been shared”, adding: “They deceived me and they deceived an awful lot more people.”
More than 700 branch managers were prosecuted by the Post Office after Fujitsu’s faulty accounting software, Horizon, made it look as though money was missing from their shops.
The saga prompted an outcry across the country after it was dramatised in the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office earlier this month.
Hundreds of subpostmasters are awaiting compensation despite the Government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts."
G3Z7XUKMN1_11WFXH4XEHYHLKZ,"The BBC has been biased ‘on occasion’, says Culture Secretary",By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24065084.bbc-biased-on-occasion-says-culture-secretary/,"Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said she believes the BBC has been biased “on occasion” as she discussed new measures aimed at boosting confidence in the corporation’s impartiality.
The reforms, announced as part of the BBC mid-term review, would give media regular Ofcom more powers over BBC’s online services, meaning it could gain enforcement action over BBC News website articles it does not believe meet relevant broadcast standards.
Currently, the communications regulator is only able to issue an opinion, but Government recommendations say Ofcom will be given increased oversight over the BBC’s online public services, including its YouTube channel.
Asked whether she thinks the BBC is biased, Ms Frazer said: “I think that on occasion it has been biased”, citing its reporting of a hospital attack in Gaza.

Ms Frazer refused to say which other broadcasters she believed might be impartial, saying they were in “totally different positions” from the publicly funded corporation.
She told Sky News that “evidence” suggested there was a “perception amongst audiences” that there was some bias at the BBC.
When it was put to her that perceptions are not necessarily reality, she said: “There are only perceptions and perceptions are important.
“What’s important about the BBC is that it’s funded by the public, so the perception of audiences of the public are important.”
In a separate interview, the minister declined to say whether she thinks it is right for someone on a six-figure salary to pay the same TV licence fee as someone on minimum wage, suggesting it was not a “simple question”.
Ms Frazer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I appreciate that you think that’s a really simple question that I could answer today.
“But that’s why I have quite an extensive review into all these questions and you can’t just answer that question in isolation.
“I’m putting together an expert panel to look at how the media market is changing. That’s a very, very complex issue which will require expert evidence on… what revenues does the BBC need, what can it do commercially that it’s not doing at the moment?”
She said she would be “led by evidence” in her review and insisted it would be “inappropriate” for her to express a view on the matter.
The Government said its recommendations are expected to be implemented in a timely manner, following talks with the BBC and Ofcom.
Ofcom, which has authority over TV, radio and video-on-demand services through a broadcasting code, has also been given a new legally binding responsibility to review more of the BBC’s complaints decisions.
Alongside the Ofcom reforms is a legal responsibility for the BBC board to actively oversee its own complaints process.
The review also recommends that the BBC considers how diversity and opinion could be better represented, as the Government says some audience groups, including disabled viewers and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, feel underrepresented by the corporation.
Ms Frazer said the corporation “needs to adapt” to the reforms or risk “losing the trust of the audience it relies on”.
The BBC’s complaints process, called BBC First, was introduced at the last Charter Review in 2017, and the mid-term review concluded that it does allow licence fee payers to hold the BBC directly accountable, but said impartiality continues to be an ongoing issue for audiences.
Under BBC First, audience complaints are normally addressed by the corporation before they can be escalated to Ofcom.
To improve the complaints process, the BBC board, which previously had a responsibility to oversee only the establishment of a complaints handling process, will now oversee the process as a whole.
Non-executive board directors and external advisors on the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee will also be given greater powers to scrutinise and challenge BBC senior management’s complaint handling.
Furthermore, the job role that has responsibility for complaints handling will now report directly to the director-general rather than the director responsible for editorial policy, to separate pre-broadcast editorial policy and post-broadcast complaints resolution.
The review has also recommended the BBC develop a public strategy that outlines its intended partnerships with others and said the impact of commercial changes, including the introduction of a BBC Commercial Board in 2022, needs to be closely monitored.
A BBC spokesperson said: “The mid-term review was designed to look at the BBC’s governance and regulation. We’re pleased the Government’s findings reflect that overall these are working well.
“With regard to the BBC’s impartiality, no other organisation takes its commitment to impartiality more seriously. We have well-established and detailed plans to sustain and further improve standards. We know this matters to audiences and the BBC continues to be the number one source for trusted news, with the highest scores for impartiality and accuracy.
“During discussions over the mid-term review, we proposed and implemented a number of reforms, including strengthening our complaints procedures, which now form part of the conclusions. We are pleased the Government has fully taken our proposals onboard. We remain committed to continuous improvement to ensure we deliver for all licence fee payers.
“The BBC is operationally and editorially independent and we will continue to engage constructively with Government, and our regulator Ofcom, over the second half of this Charter and as we look ahead to a new Charter in 2028.”"
GHNUWXCF8Q_05SMOXEOD1KVGXD,Yousaf apologises to Covid bereaved over ‘poor’ response to message requests,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24074998.yousaf-apologises-covid-bereaved-poor-response-message-requests/,"Humza Yousaf has apologised “unreservedly” for the Scottish Government’s handling of requests for messages from the UK Covid-19 Inquiry.
It came as the Scottish First Minister began giving evidence to the inquiry, sitting in Edinburgh, on Thursday afternoon.
He described his Government’s handling of inquiry requests as “frankly poor” and offered an apology.
Jamie Dawson KC, lead counsel to the current module of the inquiry, put it to Mr Yousaf that it is “important” for the messages to be retained so proper lessons can be learned.
Mr Yousaf said: “I apologise unreservedly to the inquiry and to those mourning the loss of a loved one.”
The First Minister, who was Scottish health secretary from May 2021 until March 2023, said he believes there were times that decisions made during the pandemic by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon were not “cascaded” to the rest of the cabinet.
He told the inquiry it was, however, “very rare” for decisions to be made solely by Ms Sturgeon.
Mr Dawson asked Mr Yousaf if decisions were made through the cabinet, the then first minister or through the gold command group.
He replied: “It was a variety of all of those decisions we made.”
However he said there were times when Ms Sturgeon wanted a “tighter cast list” for decision-making.
He insisted a WhatsApp message from national clinical director Professor Jason Leitch was an example of the adviser “over-speaking”, after Prof Leitch suggested Ms Sturgeon “actually wanted none of us” (in relation to decision making).
An exchange of WhatsApp messages between Mr Yousaf and Prof Leitch on May 20, 2021 showed the adviser saying: “There was some First Minister ‘keep it small’ shenanigans as always. She actually wants none of us.”
Mr Dawson asked Mr Yousaf: “Was this an indication in fact that the first minister really took decisions in connection with the pandemic herself, or at least would have referred to it that way?”
Mr Yousaf responded: “I think that was, as Jason (Leitch) said when he gave evidence to this very inquiry, an example of him perhaps over-speaking.
“I don’t doubt of course there were times the former first minister needed a tighter cast list and wanted one.
“I think this is a classic example of Jason perhaps over-speaking.”
Mr Yousaf also said Prof Leitch’s advice to him in a message that “literally no-one” followed mask guidance for standing in a public place was another example of him “over-speaking”.
Prof Leitch’s reply came in a WhatsApp after Mr Yousaf asked the adviser for guidance on wearing a mask on November 19 2021, and the exchange was shown to the inquiry.
Mr Dawson asked Mr Yousaf: “If the cabinet secretary for health and social care felt the need to clarify the rules, what chance do others have in understanding the rules?”
Mr Yousaf said: “As the cabinet secretary for health and social care, I didn’t want to just double-check the rules, triple check them, I would quadruple check them if I had to, because the intensity of the public scrutiny that we were under.”
Mr Dawson asked the First Minister if he was concerned about Prof Leitch’s advice during the pandemic.
Mr Yousaf responded: “For those that know Jason, I think by his own admission he would perhaps have a casual way of speaking and perhaps over-speak, as he described it.
“So when he says ‘but literally no-one does’, that to me suggested that yes, on this particular nuance when it comes to being at a dinner or a reception, that when standing speaking to people there wasn’t people wearing masks as per the guidance we had.”
The First Minister insisted he was seeking counsel on the rules, rather than looking for advice on how to break them.
Mr Yousaf also said he used his own personal phones to conduct Government business during the course of the pandemic rather than a Government-issued phone.
Mr Dawson asked him: “Is it the case that you used your own personal phones, plural, for WhatsApp messages during the course of the pandemic rather than a Government-issued phone?”
Mr Yousaf said: “Yes that’s correct.”
Mr Dawson said: “I think it has transpired from the material you have provided that in fact you had multiple phones?”
Mr Yousaf replied: “Both personal and Government devices, yes.”
The inquiry, which continues, is holding a series of hearings in Edinburgh as it probes the devolved administration’s response to the pandemic."

GJTKMD70UH_JWXF9804ILLWCOY,Reform UK will not run for York and North Yorkshire mayor,By Adam Laver,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24074240.reform-uk-will-not-run-york-north-yorkshire-mayor/,"Reform UK has confirmed that it will not field a candidate in May’s York and North Yorkshire’s mayoral election.
Despite committing to running in every constituency in the upcoming general election, Reform UK told the Local Democracy Reporting Service it won’t compete to have the first metro mayor of York and North Yorkshire.
Voters will elect a mayor on May 2 to oversee a new combined authority with devolved power over housing, education and transport.
Reform UK, which was founded by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, did not respond when asked to comment further on not selecting a candidate.
Although Reform UK’s presence in the general election could cost the Conservatives seats in the House of Commons, low turnout in local elections may mean this wouldn’t make a difference anyway.
Keane Duncan, the Conservative candidate for the mayoral election, was also approached to comment on whether he thought the lack of a Reform UK candidate could affect his chances, but did not respond.
Dr Richard Hayton, associate professor of politics at the University of Leeds, said: “The Conservatives might hope that the absence of a Reform UK candidate in the York and North Yorkshire mayoral election will boost Keane Duncan’s chances of victory, but it is likely to have only a marginal impact on the result.
“Turnout in such ballots is not usually high, so any voters keen to back Reform UK as a way of sending a message to either of the two main parties are likely to stay away rather than return to the fold.”
Only the Conservatives, Labour and the Green Party have announced candidates for the mayoral election, as well as Keith Tordoff who is running as an independent.
The Liberal Democrats hope to announce a candidate “shortly” and The Yorkshire Party is yet to replace Mr Tordoff who was previously its candidate.
The deadline for parties to submit candidates by is April 5.
Reform UK has not neglected all of the combined authority elections, however, and has announced candidates for North East mayor and London mayor.
The right-wing party also has an agreement with the Social Democratic Party and will endorse its candidate David Bettney for the South Yorkshire mayoral election.
Polling for the general election, which is likely to take place in the second half of 2024, suggests support for Reform UK nationally is around 12 per cent.
UKIP, Nigel Farage’s former party, received 12.6 per cent of the voteshare in the 2015 general election, winning almost four million votes and one seat in House of Commons.
Robert Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, told The Guardian that Reform UK “harms the Conservatives more now than UKIP did in 2015 because the post-Brexit Tories have a lot more ‘Ukippy’ voters, who they picked up in 2017 and 2019.”
Reform UK was known as the Brexit Party during the 2019 general election, but did not stand against sitting Conservative MPs.
“New Reform UK candidates will therefore offer an option to voters in those seats that wasn’t there in 2019,” Mr Ford said."
GRU1I9F6R7_J5UP2IZRFAAYYJ8,Irish deputy premier says ‘no excuse for delay’ in aid to Gaza,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064735.irelands-deputy-pm-relay-profound-concern-gaza-eu-summit/,"Ireland’s deputy premier has said he will be telling EU foreign affairs leaders “there is no excuse” for delays in getting humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Tanaiste Micheal Martin said Monday’s Foreign Affairs Council summit in Brussels will be “intensive”, with about six hours set aside to discuss the Middle East, after which they will speak about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The 27 European Union foreign ministers are also meeting their counterparts from Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan as well as the secretary-general of the League of Arab States.
Mr Martin, who is also Ireland’s foreign affairs and defence minister, said he will be looking to see if the EU can put pressure on Israel to stop its actions in Gaza.
Looking forward to intensive meetings on the Middle East and Ukraine at today’s #FAC.
I will reiterate our call for a ceasefire in Gaza and unimpeded access of humanitarian aid.

It comes after he said at the weekend that Ireland will be assessing the legal case by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Mr Martin said Ireland will review the case being presented and decide whether to join once the preliminary stages – which call for interim measures such as a ceasefire – have concluded.
At the weekend local health authorities reported that 25,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the Israeli operation, launched after Hamas’s attack on October 7 in which 1,200 Israelis were killed.
Mr Martin is to state Ireland’s “profound concern” about the danger faced by people in Gaza and reiterate Ireland’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
Speaking on his way into the meeting, Mr Martin said: “From Ireland’s perspective, we will be again putting a lot of pressure on and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and also absolute, unimpeded access for humanitarian aid.
“The reports we are receiving, even as late as last evening, are dire in respect of what’s happening in Gaza, in terms of starvation, in terms of the humanitarian consequences of this war.
“And there is no excuse now for any tardiness or for any delays in respect of getting vital aid into Gaza and we’ll be making those points very strongly.”
Mr Martin also called for “the unconditional release of all hostages that are held by Hamas, equally unacceptable and intolerable”.
He said that, while there is agreement on sanctions against Hamas at EU level, there is no agreement on sanctions against violent settlers in the West Bank, as “one or two countries are still holding out”.
On Ukraine, Mr Martin said: “We have seen reprehensible attacks in Ukraine over the new year period, which has caused civilian death and significant damage to civilian infrastructure on a large scale.
“These attacks show that Russia is intent on continued escalation.
“While we were able to deliver some important messages in December, including the historic decision by the European Council to open accession negotiations with Ukraine, it is clear that much work remains to be done.
“There are a number of important meetings in weeks ahead, including the Foreign Affairs Council today, and it is critical that we as the EU continue to send a clear and united message of support for Ukraine.”
Meanwhile Dana Erlich, Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, has said there is an “unconscious bias” against Israel among the Irish people.
Ms Erlich said she does not see Ireland as anti-Israel, but said there is limited publicity about Hamas and what “Hamas is doing”.
Asked whether she thinks Ireland is anti-Israel, Ms Erlich said: “I understand that sometimes we have our differences. Obviously, we see things very differently. I don’t think that Ireland is anti-Israel.
“But I do feel that sometimes, maybe, there is an unconscious bias against Israel right now.
“I’m still here only for five months so I’m learning about the country and its people. But what I see is, even recording about the war, I don’t hear a lot of responsibility of what Hamas is doing.
“You can be pro-Palestinian and worry for Palestinians’ life, but you’re not helping them by not talking about the atrocities of Hamas is doing to their own population.”
She told RTE’s Today with Claire Byrne: “The Palestinians need to be able to control themselves, but they can’t have the opportunity to threaten Israel.
“We don’t want to stay in Gaza, we don’t want to have control over Gaza, but any future solution needs to address the security of Israel.
“We will not compromise on that. And throughout history, we’ve shown that we are willing to make huge compromises and we’ve shown that we believe in peace and we need to do that for the safety of our children.
“But we will not forfeit and we will not do that on the expense of our security.”"

GTBFTZB5O2_0BQIQJR0YDZL71D,Alabama set for first execution with nitrogen gas,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073342.alabama-set-first-execution-nitrogen-gas/,"Alabama, unless blocked by the Supreme Court, will attempt to put an inmate to death with nitrogen gas on Thursday night, a never-before-used execution method that the state claims will be humane but critics call cruel and experimental.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, a 58-year-old convicted killer whose 2022 lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities could not connect an IV line, is scheduled to be executed at an Alabama prison.
Alabama plans to put an industrial-type respirator mask over Smith’s face and replace his breathing air with pure nitrogen gas, causing him to die from lack of oxygen.
The execution will be the first attempt to use a new execution method since the 1982 introduction of lethal injection, now the most common execution method in the United States.
Attorneys for Smith have waged a legal battle to halt the execution, arguing that the state is seeking to make Smith the “test case” for the new execution method, which merits more legal scrutiny before it is used on an inmate.
“It’s an experiment,” said the Rev Jeff Hood, Smith’s spiritual advisor and a death penalty opponent.
Smith’s lawyers asked the US Supreme Court to halt the execution on Thursday to review claims that the new method violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserves more legal scrutiny before it is used on a person.
They said: “There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia.
“When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimise the pain and suffering of the condemned person.”
On Wednesday, justices rejected Smith’s argument that it would be unconstitutional to make another attempt to execute him after the failed lethal injection.
Smith is one of two men convicted in the 1988 murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Sennett.
Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid 1,000 dollars to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance.
Alabama plans to strap Smith to a gurney in the execution chamber — the same chamber where he was strapped down for several hours during the lethal injection attempt — and place a “full facepiece supplied air respirator” over his face.
After he is given a chance to make a final statement, the warden, from another room, will activate the nitrogen gas.
The nitrogen will be administered through the mask for at least 15 minutes or “five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,” according to the state protocol.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find.
Three states — Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma — have authorised nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, but no state has attempted to use the untested method until now.
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said on Wednesday night that he believes the courts will allow the execution to proceed.
He said: “My office stands ready to carry on the fight for Liz Sennett.
“Two courts have now rejected Smith’s claims. I remain confident that the Supreme Court will come down on the side of justice, and that Smith’s execution will be carried out.”
The victim’s son, Charles Sennett Jr, said in an interview with WAAY-TV that Smith “has to pay for what he’s done”.
“And some of these people out there say, ‘Well, he doesn’t need to suffer like that.’ Well, he didn’t ask Mama how to suffer?” Mr Sennett Jr said. “They just did it. They stabbed her — multiple times.”
The state has predicted the nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness within seconds and death within minutes.
A state attorney told the 11th Circuit that it will be “the most painless and humane method of execution known to man”.
But some doctors and organisations have raised alarm about the state’s plan.
Robin M Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Centre, said: “It’s indefensible for Alabama officials to simply dismiss the very real risks this untested method presents and experiment on a man who has already survived one execution attempt.”
Much of what is known about death by nitrogen gas comes from industrial accidents or suicide attempts.
Dr Philip Nitschke, a euthanasia expert who designed a suicide pod using nitrogen gas and appeared as an expert witness for Smith, said nitrogen can provide a peaceful, hypoxic death, but said he has concerns about Alabama’s proposal to use a mask.
Dr Nitschke told The Associated Press that Smith’s facial hair, jaw movements and involuntary movements as he feels the effect of the nitrogen could impact the seal.
If there are leaks, Smith could continue to draw in enough oxygen, “to prolong into what could be a very rather macabre, slow process of slowly not getting enough oxygen,” Dr Nitschke said.
He said he could envision scenarios where the execution goes quickly or seriously awry.
Mr Marshall’s office noted in court filings that Smith previously suggested nitrogen as an alternative method when fighting attempts to execute him by lethal injection.
Courts require inmates challenging execution methods to suggest another available alternative. Alabama at the time had not developed a nitrogen protocol.
Robert Grass, an attorney for Smith, told federal courts that they are challenging the specific way the state plans to administer the nitrogen. They argued the use of a gas mask puts Smith at risk of a prolonged and painful death or choking to death on his own vomit.
In 2020 euthanasia guidelines, the American Veterinary Medical Association wrote nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable euthanasia method for most mammals because the anoxic environment “is distressing”.
Experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture.
Mrs Sennett, 45, was found dead on March 18 1988 in her home in Colbert County.
She had eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner.
Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr, killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect, according to court documents.
John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the slaying, was executed in 2010.
In 1996, a jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge overrode the recommendation and sentenced Smith to death.
Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jury’s death penalty decision."
GUKLIQ0ZA9_XP9AGPGSQI5ZRHI,Serial criminal Lee Thomas jailed for flat burglary,By Megi Rychlikova @CourtYorkPress Court Reporter,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24075630.serial-criminal-lee-thomas-jailed-flat-burglary/,"A burglar who left a man terrified to sleep in his own home has been jailed for three years and four months.
Police caught long-time criminal Lee Anthony Thomas red-handed with stolen items as he left the flat he had just raided, York Crown Court heard.
Benjamin Whittingham, prosecuting, said the victim was inside the flat asleep at the time and unaware he had been burgled until officers woke him up and handed him back his property.
Thomas has 264 previous convictions, more than half of them for theft and dishonesty and including convictions for house burglary and drug dealing. He was on two suspended prison sentences at the time of the flat burglary and has committed many offences in and around York.
In 2015, he carried out a raid in central York during which he confronted a woman as she dressed in her bedroom when he should have been attending court.
Thomas, formerly of York, and now of Victoria Road, Scarborough, denied burglary and tried to deceive a jury with what Judge Simon Hickey called a “ludicrous” account of what he was doing in the flat’s back yard.
“You are a big powerful man, if that man (the flat’s occupant) had woken and confronted you, what would have happened?” the judge told Thomas after the jury returned their guilty verdict in under an hour.
The judge quoted the victim’s statement which said: “The fact that someone has entered my flat whilst I was asleep makes me feel extremely scared, scared to be in my own home ….. and left me worried to go to sleep.”
Thomas had pleaded guilty to stealing a £1,200 bike chained to a post the day before the flat raid. Mr Whittingham said police caught him within hours.
He was jailed for three years and four months including three months previously suspended.
The jury was not told that police were in the Scarborough flat’s area shortly before 8pm on September 28 because a woman had dialled 999 to report a man trying car doors.
They heard evidence an officer spotted Thomas behind the flat carrying the victim’s TV remote and mobile phone and arrested him on suspicion of burglary.
The police officer and a colleague woke the victim, who had left his back door insecure so his cat could get in and out. They found one of Thomas’ earphones on the floor near the back door. It had Thomas’ DNA on it and he had the other matching earphone on him when arrested.
The victim told police the two stolen items had been in different rooms.
Thomas gave differing accounts to the police officer who arrested him, to the officer who interviewed him and in the witness box.
He denied going into the flat or stealing the items. He claimed he had gone to the back door to see if the flat occupant wanted to sell a television which the burglar said he had found in the back yard.
Following the verdict, his barrister Rhianydd Clement said he had a doorman’s licence and would get a job at the end of his sentence.
He had health problems including anxiety, depression, and paranoia, which would get worse in prison, and osteoporosis."
H0NYU9P1A2_XMK37KYPSDTUL5R,Health warning to everyone who drinks energy drinks,By Joshua Searle @josh_searle99 UK Today Editor,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24067785.health-warning-everyone-drinks-energy-drinks/,"Young people who drink energy drinks regularly have been issued a health warning by experts.
Research suggests that just a few cans a week can result in insomnia and poor sleep in young people.
Experts found that young people aged 18 to 35 who consumed the drinks every day slept around half an hour less than those drinking them occasionally or not at all.
Among men, having two or three drinks a week meant they were 35% more likely to have a bedtime after midnight, 52% more likely to sleep less than six hours, and 60% more likely to wake in the night than those who did not or rarely drank them.

For women, they were 20% more likely to have a bedtime after midnight, 58% more likely to sleep less than six hours, and 24% more likely to wake in the night.
It comes after a study published last week said the sale of all energy drinks to young people and children in the UK should be banned because of links with anxiety, stress and suicidal thoughts.
Energy drinks often contain high levels of caffeine and sugar and are marketed as providing people with an energy boost.
The Government has consulted on a proposal to end the sale of energy drinks to children under 16 in England and has said it will set out a response in due course.
In the meantime, some larger retailers and supermarkets have voluntarily introduced a ban on the sale of energy drinks to children under 16.
Researchers have said, however, that the drinks can still be easily bought by children in places such as corner shops.
The latest study, published in BMJ Open and based on 53,266 Norwegian students, found the drinks are popular with young people.
Students in the study were asked how often they drank energy drinks, with responses including daily, weekly (including once a week, two to three times a week, and four to six times a week), monthly (one to three times), and seldom/never.
They were also asked detailed questions about their sleep patterns, such as when they went to bed and got up, how long it took them to fall asleep and if they woke in the night.
Insomnia was defined as problems falling and staying asleep and waking early on at least three nights a week, plus daytime sleepiness and tiredness for at least three days of the week, for at least three months."
HQ0E3JFN5A_B2S12UDCPD3G19W,Turkey’s parliament approves Sweden’s Nato membership,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070325.turkeys-parliament-approves-swedens-nato-membership/,"Turkish legislators have endorsed Sweden’s Nato membership, paving the way for the previously nonaligned country’s entry into the military alliance.
The legislators ratified Sweden’s accession protocol by 287 votes to 55, with four abstentions, on Tuesday.
It will come into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which is expected to be swift.
Hungary then becomes the only Nato ally not to have ratified Sweden’s accession.
Nato-member Turkey had been delaying Sweden’s membership for more than a year, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups that Ankara regards as security threats.
It has been seeking concessions from Stockholm, including a tougher stance toward Kurdish militants militants and members of a network that Ankara blames for a failed coup in 2016.
Turkey had also been angered by a series of demonstrations by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party in Sweden as well as Koran-burning protests that roiled Muslim countries.
Last month, parliament’s foreign affairs committee gave its consent to Sweden’s bid in the first stage of the legislative process, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent its accession protocol to politicians for approval.
Arguing in favour of Sweden’s membership last month, deputy foreign minister Burak Akcapar cited steps Sweden had taken to meet Turkish demands, including lifting restrictions on defence industry sales and amending anti-terrorism laws.
Sweden has pledged deeper co-operation with Turkey on counterterrorism and to support Turkey’s ambition to revive its European Union membership bid.
Turkey’s main opposition party also supported Sweden’s membership in the alliance but a centre-right party and the country’s pro-Kurdish party declared they would oppose it.
“Sweden’s steps concerning its extradition of wanted criminals or the fight against terrorism have remained limited and insufficient,” Musavat Dervisoglu, a politician from the Good Party told parliament.
Mr Erdogan has linked ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership to the US Congress’s approval of a Turkish request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and kits to modernise Turkey’s existing fleet.
He has also urged Canada and other Nato allies to lift arms embargoes on Turkey.
Koray Aydin, another Good Party politician, urged parliament to hold out on ratifying Sweden’s accession until the F-16 sales and the modernisation kits are approved in Washington, saying Turkey would lose an important bargaining chip.
US President Joe Biden’s administration never formally tied the sale of the F-16s to Turkey’s ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership.
However, numerous influential members of Congress had said they would not support the sale unless and until Turkey signs off on Sweden’s accession to the alliance.
Administration officials say they expect relatively quick action on the F-16 sale after Turkey’s ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership by Turkey
In Washington, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Sweden is “more than ready to become a Nato ally”.
He said: “It’s time for Sweden to become a Nato ally. They have a modern, advanced military – one that we’re very comfortable with. And they’ll add real significant military capabilities to the alliance.”
Sweden and Finland abandoned their traditional positions of military nonalignment to seek protection under Nato’s security umbrella following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming Nato’s 31st member, after Turkey’s parliament ratified the Nordic country’s bid.
Hungary has also stalled Sweden’s bid, alleging that Swedish politicians have told “blatant lies” about the condition of Hungary’s democracy.
Hungary has said it would not be the last to approve accession, although it was not clear when the Hungarian parliament intends to hold a vote.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced on Tuesday that he sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to discuss Sweden’s entry into Nato.
Nato requires the unanimous approval of all existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary were the only countries that have been holding out, frustrating other Nato allies who had been pressing for Sweden and Finland’s swift accession."

IEAY1H9XG8_Q2H9FUMR2Z8VQWF,Post Office’s secret decision to sack forensic accountants branded ‘disgusting’,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24076765.post-offices-secret-decision-sack-forensic-accountants-branded-disgusting/,"A campaigner fighting for justice in the Horizon scandal has branded the Post Office’s secret decision to sack independent forensic accountants who found bugs in their IT system as “disgusting”.
Former subpostmistress Jo Hamilton said the move, uncovered in documents seen by the BBC, was like “tipping the board up when you’re losing” a game of Monopoly.
The decision was unearthed in minutes from a Post Office board sub-committee meeting in April 2014, named Project Sparrow, which the broadcaster said was with the full knowledge of Government.
Ms Hamilton, who was wrongfully convicted in 2008 of stealing thousands of pounds from a village shop in Hampshire, described it as a “massive cover-up”, adding: “We knew the Government were in it up to their necks.”
The BBC said minutes from a meeting on April 9, 2014, showed the sub-committee asking for a paper to be prepared on the independent forensic accountants who were from a firm called Second Sight.
The sub-committee also asked for “options to support them or reduce their role”.
Second Sight submitted a report in July 2013 which identified bugs that raised concerns over the reliability of Horizon data used to prosecute subpostmasters.
The Post Office was warned it was in breach of its legal duties as prosecuted subpostmasters should have been told about the bugs, but the board later expressed concern the review from the forensic accountants exposed them to wrongful conviction claims.
Three weeks after the first meeting, the sub-committee took the decision to bring the investigation of subpostmasters’ cases “within the control of the Post Office” and removed Second Sight from its role of investigating the cases independently, the BBC said.
Ms Hamilton said “it’s so wicked” that the documents showed the Post Office planned to pay a total of only £1 million in “token payments” to subpostmasters.
Heavily-redacted versions of the documents were made public in 2021 but the BBC has now seen the minutes of the meetings without redactions.
Reacting to the unearthed minutes from the 2014 meeting, Ms Hamilton told the PA news agency: “It just confirms everything we know.
“We knew the Government were in it up to their necks. We just knew, I knew Project Sparrow and we never had the names, but you can kind of guess who’s on it.
“You can then say to all the business ministers ‘who didn’t know about this, honestly?’ because everyone has to have known – right up to the top, I believe.
“It just confirms what we’ve kind of known – you get a feeling that these kind of shenanigans were going on … and now we’ve got it in black and white.
“You can put it on the television and say ‘go on, explain that’.”
Speaking about the sacking of independent forensic accountants, Ms Hamilton said: “It doesn’t surprise me… I mean, it is disgusting.
“The Government are in this up to their necks and they’ve clearly thought ‘oh my god, quick’ – it’s like Monopoly, isn’t it, tipping the board up when you’re losing.
“They know there’s nowhere else to go and they’ve got to do something crazy.
“It was the true independence that meant they had to go, because they weren’t going to toe the party line.
“It’s a massive cover-up.”
Addressing the Post Office’s attempt to pay subpostmasters “token payments”, Ms Hamilton told PA: “It’s disgusting, isn’t it?
“They stole £60,000 of my money – so how on earth they thought taking people’s houses and everything else, they thought £1 million between us was going to actually cut it – I mean, seriously, what were they thinking?
“People have gone to prison, we’d all had criminal records and people had lost everything, and they thought that kind of money cuts it – it’s an absolute insult.
“People had that in bonuses … it’s just disgusting, it’s so wicked.”
More than 700 branch managers were prosecuted by the Post Office after Fujitsu’s faulty accounting software Horizon made it look as though money was missing from their shops.
The saga prompted an outcry across the country after it was dramatised in the ITV series Mr Bates vs The Post Office earlier this month.
Hundreds of subpostmasters are awaiting compensation despite the Government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts.
A Post Office spokesman said: “It is not appropriate for the Post Office to comment on allegations being made outside of the inquiry, whose role it is to consider all of the evidence on the issues it is examining and independently reach conclusions.
“We fully share the public inquiry’s aims to get to the truth of what happened in the past and accountability.”
A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said Number 10 was taking the “those reports extremely seriously”.
She added: “It is right that we have an inquiry to look into this.
“And for that reason, with that ongoing, I won’t comment on matters of potential interest to the inquiry, particularly also given it relates to a previous administration.”
The PM’s spokeswoman said Number 10 are waiting for the Post Office Horizon IT inquiry to conclude and will “act accordingly” after being asked whether further compensation could be offered if it is found the Government was aware of attempts to cover-up issues relating to Horizon.
The Department for Business and Trade declined to comment."

From January 23 to 29, passengers can claim up to 50% off selected Advance and Off-Peak rail tickets through the Great British Rail Sale.
Rail ticket prices will be slashed on many routes over six weeks in the week-long sale, the Department for Transport announced last week.
The Rail Delivery Group is hosting a central webpage helping customers find the best deals, and tickets can also be found on all ticket retailer websites, for journeys taking place between January 30 and March 15.

It is important to note that there is only a limited number of tickets are available, and no further sale tickets will go on offer once they are sold out.
“The return of the Great British Rail Sale is good news for passengers, following the success of the previous sale which saw passengers benefit from around £7m in savings on their travel costs,"" Transport Secretary Mark Harper said.
He added: “With discounts on more than a million tickets, there'll be plenty of opportunity to connect with friends and family and explore great destinations across the country – I hope passengers make the most of this sale and choose to travel by rail.""
Journeys on thousands of popular routes in England and Wales are included in the sale, the Department for Transport has confirmed.
There will also be discounted tickets for cross-border trips into Scotland, for journeys taking place between January 30 and March 15 too.
Jacqueline Starr, Chief Executive of the Rail Delivery Group said: “Train travel is the greenest way to explore our towns and cities as well as connect with your family and friends because nothing beats being there in person for those special moments.
She continued: “Following the success of the Great British Rail Sale in 2022, we are really excited that it’s coming back, and customers will be able to once again purchase over a million Advance ticket fares starting on 23rd January 2024 and enjoy what rail has to offer.”
Popular journeys passengers could claim savings on tickets for include:
The first Great British Rail Sale in 2022 saw passengers save around £7m on rail tickets and encouraged around 70,000 adults who hadn’t travelled by train since the pandemic to take a trip, the Great British Railways Transition Team (GBRTT) estimated.
The Government and industry are therefore launching a second Great British Rail Sale to save passengers money and get more people using the UK's railways."
J9CJIZUO8K_0SMFY1EANR2W3VM,York and North Yorkshire combined authority to have 54 staff,By Thomas Barrett,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24065667.york-north-yorkshire-combined-authority-54-staff/,"THE new York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority will employ 54 staff at a cost of £4.5 million a year, it has been revealed.
The authority will be led by the region’s first-ever mayor with voters going to the polls on May 2.
Later today, councillors at North Yorkshire Council and City of York Council will discuss a report that details the new mayor’s budget in their first year.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service asked the office that is overseeing the creation of the combined authority for clarity on how many staff it will hire and what roles they will be doing.
James Farrar, interim director of transition, said the 54 officers will help to deliver £56 million of “transformational programmes” related to housing, education, business and net zero.
They will also work to win additional investment and support businesses in the region.
Staff currently working in the office of Zoe Metcalfe, Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, will transfer into the combined authority.
Regarding what the new mayor will be paid, an independent panel will make a recommendation after the election.
According to the website citymayors.com, West Yorkshire mayor Tracey Brabin is paid an annual allowance of £106,837, South Yorkshire mayor Dan Jarvis receives £79,000 and Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen is paid £65,000.
Mr Farrar added: “The launch of the combined authority marks a historic moment for York and North Yorkshire as powers and funds previously held by Westminster have been devolved to local decision makers. That means more local controls and investment into local priorities.”
Powers used by mayors elsewhere in the country have included taking buses back into public ownership, like Labour’s Andy Burnham has done in Greater Manchester.
Conservative Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen brought Teeside International Airport into public ownership in 2018 but he’s faced criticism over use of public money in the Redcar Steelworks project. Mr Houchen has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
Cllr Andy Brown (Green Party, Aire Valley) said he would have preferred to see one mayor for the whole of Yorkshire which he believes could assert more influence in Westminster.
But he said he hopes the role will lead to more investment in the region.
Cllr Brown said: “Lots of little mayors with different powers risks becoming a mess where people in London offer local leaders funding to do what they are told.
Joanna Marchong, investigations campaign manager of campaign group the Taxpayers’ Alliance said residents “will be sceptical of a huge pay bill” amidst talk of savings.
She added: “Combined authorities often deliver cheaper, more efficient services and York and North Yorkshire combined authority should be no exception. Officials must iron out the details and ensure residents are getting value for money.”"

Following the incident at Rake Lane ford in Glaisdale last December, which left three people dead, members of the local parish council have expressed their condolences and called for improved signage.
At a meeting of Glaisdale Parish Council on Thursday, January 18, residents raised concerns over the number of 4×4 drivers “who disregard the existing signage even when conditions are adverse”.
READ MORE: North Yorkshire Police name Esk River drowning victims
According to draft minutes, residents said that “many drivers who attempt the crossing are not local and are unaware of the river conditions on either side of the ford.”
At the meeting, North Yorkshire Police’s PCSO Pete Lewis outlined the incident as well as potential solutions that have been put forward.
Proposed options included permanently closing the road to vehicles or installing lockable gates at both ends of the road.
Other suggestions proposed installing a metal barrier downstream of the ford or installing automatic barriers at each side of the approaches to the ford “which operate when flood level sensors are activated and temporarily closing the road”.
Whilst many of the proposals were described as “extremely unlikely” and expensive, it was agreed that no actions would be proposed or agreed until the coroner’s verdict on the deaths has been pronounced.
The incident on December 28 led to the deaths of Scott Thomas Daddy, Leslie Forbes, and Kenneth Patrick Hibbins when a 4×4 vehicle was “swept away” as it tried to cross a river.
The draft minutes state that the “most positive outcome from the discussion has been the almost universal acknowledgement that much better signage is necessary at this location”.
It was also suggested at the parish council meeting that information should be given on the signs “as to how dangerous this ford is during flooding and that several lives have been lost when attempts are made to cross in flood conditions”.
North Yorkshire Council’s highways representative, Richard Marr, agreed about that “necessity”, according to the minutes.
The parish council concluded that any action “must wait until all investigations are complete and the coroner has issued a verdict on the deaths”.
The chairman expressed condolences to the “family and friends of the deceased and thanked the emergency services and local residents for their efforts during the incident”."

Samuel Cousins, 24, must also pay the victim compensation.
His solicitor Craig Robertson, quoting the doorman’s witness statement, said the victim had made comments about the clothes worn by Cousin’s female companion and her “posterior”.
Cousins, of Alder Way, New Earswick, pleaded guilty to two racially aggravated public order offences.
“The doorman was only doing his job,” district judge Orla Austin told Cousins at York Magistrates' Court.
“He was completely innocent. He doesn’t go to work to be abused, particularly not at a racial level.”
She ordered Cousins to do a 12-month community order with 20 days’ rehabilitative activities and 100 hours’ unpaid work. He must also pay a total of £299, consisting of £100 compensation to the doorman, a £114 statutory surcharge and £85 prosecution costs.
The court heard that Cousins was at the Tank & Paddle in Bridge Street next to Ouse Bridge on May 18.
He was racially insulting to the doorman, referring to his appearance and swearing as  he made remarks about what the doorman should do.
He was still being racially abusive when police arrested him outside Jalou nearby at the bottom of Micklegate.
Mr Robertson said although Cousins had previous convictions, his last had been in 2019.
Cousins had been drinking and accepted he had responded inappropriately and wrongly to the doorman’s comments.
He had recently got a job, court heard."

JE9ZZ7BEWJ_3R4OF7PX5T77RIR,Threats against Donaldson over powersharing talks condemned in Parliament,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073107.threats-donaldson-powersharing-talks-condemned-parliament/,"Threats made against DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson for engaging with the UK Government as part of efforts to restore powersharing have sparked condemnation.
The MP for Lagan Valley revealed he had been targeted as he urged others in the wider unionist movement against opposing a deal that had yet to be agreed.
His remarks came after Conservative former Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith suggested the DUP had negotiated a “very good deal” on issues around post-Brexit trade arrangements.
The party has maintained an almost two-year boycott of the Stormont institutions in protest at internal economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, following the UK’s departure from the EU.
Amid speculation an agreement is near to being reached, the UK Government tabled new legislation aimed at providing a window for this to be achieved.
Under the law governing the formation of a devolved administration in Belfast, the Government assumes a legal duty to call a snap assembly election once a deadline for forming a ministerial executive is passed.
The Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill, which sets a new cut-off of February 8, cleared both the Commons and Lords on Wednesday.
Speaking in the Commons, Sir Jeffrey said: “As a result of the actions my party has taken, the EU were brought back to the table, there were negotiations, changes have occurred, and further change will come as a result of our actions.”
In advance of any agreement he called on the Secretary of State release funding for public sector pay rises, which had been the subject of strike action.
Sir Jeffrey said threats would not stop him from engaging with the Government.
He said: “I’m proud of the service that I have given, unlike some others, to my country when I put on the uniform of the Ulster Defence Regiment to protect everyone in the community from terrorism and violence.
“And yet today, because of the stirring up that is going on, I was threatened, threatened by those who never put on a uniform, by those who haven’t served our country.”
He added: “They are threatening people like me, who’s working day and night to try and find solutions and to move Northern Ireland forward on a basis that the vast majority of people can support.
“Well I would just say this to those who stir up, and those who threaten: the provisional IRA attacked me in the past and it didn’t deflect me from the task that I have, and my colleagues have, to do our job and to get the best that we can for Northern Ireland.”
In a message to fellow unionists in Northern Ireland, Sir Jeffrey said earlier: “Wait until an agreement is reached before you make your final verdict, assess the progress that has been made before you reach your conclusion.”
He said “there are some”, a “tiny minority”, who “don’t want Stormont back”, but said his party is “committed to getting a solution, to moving things forward, to making progress, to resolving the issues that have harmed Northern Ireland”.
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris described those who had sought to threaten Sir Jeffrey as “cowards and idiots”.
Speaking in Parliament, former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Empey condemned those behind the attempts at intimidation.
The peer said: “The question is what did they ever achieve? What did they ever get us? More misery, more deaths and destruction, no progress. So if anything has come out of all of this, it is that is not the way to go forward.”
Expressing her shock, former first minister and DUP leader Baroness Foster of Aghadrumsee, said: “It appears that there is nothing new under the sun.
“These people who hide in the shadows and use the internet, in the way that we have talked about on so many occasions, seek to do damage and to push things in a particular way.
“I send my solidarity to Sir Jeffrey and I am sure the whole House will want to echo that in respect of the threats that he has received.”
Northern Ireland Office minister Lord Caine said: “I know I speak for all members of this House when we pass on our support for him (Sir Jeffrey) and wish him well.”
On the prospect of an agreement, he added: “Of course we all want to see progress within the next fortnight. At the moment there is no deal. We very much hope there will be one in the space of time this legislation provides.”
Senior Tory MP Mr Smith said: “(Sir Jeffrey Donaldson) and his team, I understand, seem to have negotiated also a very good deal with the Government on issues around the Windsor Framework and I hope in the coming days and weeks we will be able to see the results of that work.”"
JP45S0E1D6_U8ZZ7Q4OFFG7YOL,Knife crime ‘will not be fixed overnight’ by crackdown on zombie-style blades,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073651.knife-crime-will-not-fixed-overnight-crackdown-zombie-style-blades/,"Knife crime will not be tackled “overnight” by the Government’s latest ban on zombie-style blades and a fourth crackdown could be announced in future, the policing minister has said.
Chris Philp did not rule out further action being taken on certain types of swords if necessary amid calls to widen the scope of the prohibition.
Fresh legislation will be laid in Parliament on Thursday in order to close what ministers have described as a loophole within an existing ban on zombie-style weapons.
Previous attempts to ban the knives have defined them as having threatening images or words on them. But the new law will mean that blades without any logos will also be recognised if they have other key features, such as a cutting or serrated edge, the Home Office says.
This is the Government’s third attempt at banning the blades since 2016, and campaigners including actor Idris Elba have expressed concern that other weapons such as swords are still not included in the legislation.
Speaking to broadcasters on Thursday’s morning media round, the policing minister said he had spoken with Elba in the Home Office on Wednesday about the issue and suggested the ban could be expanded again.
He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The ban we’re introducing in Parliament today specifies the design of the bladed article… some swords could fall into that definition.
“A regular sword, like the sort a historic soldier might carry, would probably not qualify. It would depend on the design, but they may not qualify. That’s because there are a number of issues like… some religions have those swords.”
He added: “But the commitment that the Government will make, and I’ll make now, is that if we find in the future (that) there are other things that need to be brought into the scope, then we can do another statutory instrument like the one we’re doing today to ban those, because it’s much faster than using primary legislation.”
The new ban is an “important part” of the Government’s overall approach to tackling knife crime but the problem will not immediately disappear, the minister said.
Asked whether the legislation laid on Thursday will combat the issue comprehensively, he told LBC: “It’s a step forward, but I’m not going to claim it’s going to overnight fix all the issues with knife crime, but it’s an important part of it.”
Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday show knife crime offences recorded by police forces in England and Wales rose year-on-year but have not yet returned to levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the year to September 2023, there were 240 killings involving knives and other sharp instruments, which was broadly unchanged on the 241 recorded in the previous year and also lower than pre-pandemic figures.
Offences involving knives or sharp instruments increased by 5% (48,716 offences) compared with the year ending Sept 2022 (46,367 offences), but remain 5% lower compared with the year ending March 2020 (51,228 offences).

More than 19,000 cautions and convictions were handed out for possession of a knife or offensive weapon in the year ending March 2023, according to sentencing statistics from the Ministry of Justice.
Elba welcomed the new ban as a “step in the right direction” but expressed reservations about whether it will work as gaps remain in the legislation.
“Unfortunately it doesn’t ban all knives, including swords. However, the significant step towards zombie knives and machetes is something that I think is really important,” he said.
“We’ve seen in the past that it hasn’t achieved… in fact you see knife crime rise in certain instances. But I do think there is a slightly more joined-up approach.”
We need to protect young people from the rising epidemic of knife crime.
That’s exactly what Labour’s plan will do 👇
— The Labour Party (@UKLabour) January 25, 2024
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government has announced its proposals “about 16 times before” and a “much broader ban” is needed.
“It’s got to include things like the ninja swords and other dangerous weapons as well, and there’s got to be stronger penalties for the online marketplaces who are still profiting from the sale of illegal knives,” she told Sky News.
Meanwhile, Labour is focusing on a youth programme to tackle knife crime, pledging £100 million for a nationwide initiative to support young people at risk of being drawn into violence.
Alongside the programme, it is also promising “real consequences” for those who offend, with an end to “empty warnings and apology letters” for those guilty of possession.
The Conservatives said the announcement is “just another reheated pledge from the Labour Party using money they have already spent seven times”."
JU9S6OKGG0_G8NLBZ2F9RA1UQQ,‘No obvious alternative’ to Sunak as Tory leader among 2019 party backers – poll,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075968.no-obvious-alternative-sunak-tory-leader-among-2019-party-backers---poll/,"There are “no obvious alternatives” to Rishi Sunak as Conservative leader for winning back those who voted for the party in 2019, a new poll has suggested.
Mr Sunak’s continued leadership of his party came under renewed speculation this week after Sir Simon Clarke, a senior ally of former prime minister Liz Truss, said the Tories would suffer a “massacre” at the next election if they did not ditch Mr Sunak.
But a poll by Ipsos UK suggests there may be few alternatives to Mr Sunak in the eyes of 2019 Conservative voters, with the Prime Minister enjoying a higher favourability rating than the rest of his front bench.
Some 42% of 2019 Tory voters said they had a favourable view of Mr Sunak, with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt trailing on 38% and Home Secretary James Cleverly on 28%.
The Prime Minister’s net favourability rating of +13 was also much higher than those of his Chancellor and Home Secretary, on +7 and +2 respectively.
There was also little difference between Mr Sunak and possible candidates from outside the parliamentary Conservative party.
Former prime minister Boris Johnson had a favourability rating among 2019 Tory voters of 43%, but at 34% his unfavourability rating was higher than that of Mr Sunak.
Reform UK founder and honorary president Nigel Farage, suggested by some as a possible future Conservative leader, was also virtually neck-and-neck with Mr Sunak in terms of popularity.
The former MEP was viewed favourably by 43% of 2019 Conservatives, only one point more than Mr Sunak, and was viewed unfavourably by 29%, tied with the Prime Minister.
Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos, said: “With a majority of Britons unfavourable towards Rishi Sunak, six in 10 saying things are heading in the wrong direction and Labour maintaining a large poll lead over the Conservatives in voter preferences, leadership speculation is to be expected.
“However, it is unclear who would do a better job. No obvious alternative stands out amongst 2019 Conservative voters so far.
“Plus, given at least half of Britons have held unfavourable opinions towards the Conservative Party since early 2022, it’s not a given that a new leader will improve the party brand any time soon.”
The poll, which surveyed 1,087 British adults between January 12 and 14, also found that around a fifth of 2019 Conservative voters now said they were likely to consider voting for Labour, while 28% said they would consider voting for Reform."

Michael Murphy appeared by video link at the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry on Wednesday from HMP Edinburgh, where he is serving a sentence for physically and sexually abusing children while he was a social worker with the De La Salle Brothers in Gartmore, Stirlingshire, and St Joseph’s in Tranent, East Lothian, between 1961 and 1991.
Murphy continued to deny he was responsible for abusing boys in his care while he was working at the establishment, and described those who had brought allegations, resulting in convictions in 2003, 2016 and 2021, as “characters” who were motivated to complain for “financial gain”.
The former monk became a member of the De La Salle brothers in 1956 and was posted to St Ninian’s School in Gartmore in 1961.
Murphy was asked by lead counsel to the inquiry, Colin MacAulay KC, how he felt about the allegations.
Murphy said: “All of these characters and complainers, they are unhinged … and I think they need to be checked out by the police and need to be investigated about all of these lies they have told.”
During Wednesday’s evidence, the inquiry heard Murphy had been convicted of 54 charges of physical and sexual abuse, including incidents where he would hit boys on the bottom with an implement made of three 16in shoe laces if they were misbehaving, and that he administered electric shocks to boys using a small generator he called “the tickler”.
The inquiry also heard about an incident where Murphy assaulted a boy so badly, he broke his arm and had to be taken to hospital.
Murphy downplayed the incident and attempted to place blame on the child, saying the youngster had “abused” him because of his “footwear” and described it as a “misunderstanding”.
He said: “I had a misunderstanding with a boy about my footwear and my bad foot.
“I gave him an arm twist. I twisted his arm.
“That’s all.”
Lead counsel to the inquiry Colin MacAulay KC put it to Murphy that the child sustained a broken arm as a consequence.
Murphy said: “He fractured a wee bone on his arm.”
He was later asked about administering electric shocks to children, with one incident causing burns to a boy’s hand.
Murphy continued to insist he was not administering shocks and said the sensation went along the muscle of the hands and that the complainer was “telling lies”.
Mr MacAulay asked Murphy if he had ever administered a shock through the testicles.
Murphy denied he had and said his convictions were “false”.
He said he had been entrusted with the care of around 90 children on his own, with very little training in how to look after them.
When asked to explain why so many people came forward regarding Murphy’s treatment of the children, he said there had been “collusion”.
Mr MacAulay asked Murphy: “Why are they picking on you?”
Murphy responded: “I have already said it is because I am the only one alive today.
“It is all about compensation.”
Meanwhile, the inquiry also heard from a teacher at St Joseph’s between 1978 and 1994, known simply as William, who was accused of hitting boys with blackboard dusters and making them sniff ammonia as forms of discipline.
William told the inquiry he used blackboard dusters to tackle “classroom nonsense” and said the boys would often throw the dusters back at him.
He insisted he did not use physical punishment and witnessed it at the school only once when a boy had taken off the handbrake on a minibus.
When asked about boys being made to smell ammonia, he said he had been talking about “smelling salts” and told the boys he could let them smell ammonia.
He said the accusations of abuse towards the boys were “upsetting” because he believed he had “always got on well” with them and had spent much of his career working with children who had social, behavioural and emotional difficulties.
William has not been convicted of any offences related to the allegations.
Later on Wednesday, a social worker denied accusations of abuse against him when he worked in residential care and said no behaviour he would categorise as abuse took place.
No criminal complaints have been made against the man, who gave evidence to the inquiry under the pseudonym Dominic.
He worked at institutions run by the De La Salle brothers during the 1980s.
Dominic had been accused of hitting boys and looking at them inappropriately while they were changing.
He strenuously denied the accusations put to him at the inquiry.
He said he had never witnessed any physical punishment towards the children in his care, and he described St Joseph’s as a “remarkable” place that was “quite progressive” with an approach that would be described as “restorative” nowadays.
Dominic also discussed Murphy’s electric generator and the sensation it gave as “underwhelming”.
He was asked by Mr MacAulay if he had ever seen any abuse at St Joseph’s during his time there.
He said: “I honestly did not think I saw behaviour with any kid that I would consider to be abusive.”
In 2017, the De La Salle Brothers used the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry to apologise to victims who had suffered abuse within their care.
The spokesman for the De La Salle Brothers, David Anderson, said nothing could be said to defend the mistreatment of children.
“Where a brother at any of these schools was responsible for the mistreatment of a child or young adult entrusted to the congregation’s care, the congregation offers an unreserved apology,” he said at the time.
The inquiry, before Lady Smith, continues."

Thomas White, a senior official with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said on Thursday that 15 of those wounded were in critical condition.
UNRWA says two tank shells hit a building in a shelter housing thousands of displaced Palestinians on Wednesday in the southern city of Khan Younis, which has seen heavy fighting in recent days.
The building caught fire, it said.
It did not directly blame Israel, which is the only party to the conflict that has tanks.
The Israeli military said it has “currently ruled out” that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but was still investigating. It says the building might have been hit by a Hamas rocket.
The fighting in Khan Younis has isolated its two main hospitals, Nasser and Al-Amal, stranding hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people inside.
Mr White says a third hospital was evacuated overnight, and that among the patients who departed were women who had just undergone caesarean sections.
Thousands of people rushed to escape farther south in recent days, crowding into shelters and tent camps near the border with Egypt.
The Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 25,700 people have been killed and another 63,000 wounded in the enclave since the October 7 attack in southern Israel, when militants from Gaza killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages."

Raymond Grant submitted a “minimum” witness statement that was only a little over two pages long – blaming his “10 to 11-hour” working days and moving house.
Mr Grant said he was looking after homeless residents in a Christian shelter during December where “there are a lot of activities going on”.
Counsel to the inquiry Jason Beer KC said he would see if the witness could improve on his statement, before adding: “Now that carol services and dog walking are out of the way”.
Mr Grant investigated William Quarm, who was convicted in 2010 of stealing from his Post Office branch in North Uist, Scotland and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.
He died two years later at the age of 69 and his conviction was successfully quashed in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh last year.
Asked by counsel to the inquiry Jason Beer KC why his witness statement was so short on Wednesday, Mr Grant said: “My current role is I work in a homeless centre for a Christian organisation – it has 30 residents in it.
“I am the programme manager in that unit and my job is to ensure that these residents get the level of respect and dignity that they deserve.
“Part of the role is to ensure that at that time of the year, December in a Christian calendar, there are a lot of activities going on.
“We were, at that point, five members of staff short.
“I was working somewhere in the region of 10 to 11-hour days – I was going home, walking my dog and at the same time, the home where I was living, I was asked to vacate it by December 31.”
He continued: “So I was in the process of trying to purchase a property, view a property, deal with conveyancing issues, dealing with mortgage arrangements – so there was a clear clash of priorities as far as I was concerned.
“I chose my current job as being the most important as it directly affected 20 members of staff and 29 homeless residents.
“I fully understand my obligations to this important Post Office Horizon IT inquiry – however, my time was limited, for all the things that I’ve said previously.
“I managed to negotiate an extra month on my rented property, and I have to be out of that by the 31st (of January).”
Mr Grant said he spoke with one of the senior lawyers from the inquiry who made it clear their priorities were “different” from his own.
He continued: “Reading, digesting, understanding an inordinate amount of documents – 450, at that time, subsequently another 350 on top of that.”
Mr Beer interjected: “When you say documents, you mean pages?”
Mr Grant responded: “Yes sorry, I beg your pardon.
“And then having to prepare a detailed statement of my memory from the time of employment, which was 16 years ago, to any involvement in any Post Office investigation.”
Mr Grant said he was set a deadline of January 2 to provide answers to questions posed by the inquiry’s legal team and after saying it was “not physically possible”, he was told he would “potentially be breaking the law”.
“My pleadings were going on deaf ears,” he said.
“I explained about me moving home, and the caller (said) I should provide details of my conveyancing lawyers so that I could be checked up on.”
Mr Beer then said: “So, in short, it’s a clash of priorities.”
Mr Grant continued: “The next level of communication I had was that Sheriff officers appeared at my door and issued me with a section 21 notice, to say that I had to comply and be here today.”
Mr Beer responded: “That’s right, you’re here under the threat of the exercise of compulsory powers – we had to serve a section 21 notice.”
The former Post Office investigator said: “Yes, I agree with that.
“That kind of focussed me and in my time I was then able to – my first day off during that was January 1 following a 10-hour night shift during New Year’s Eve and New Year’s morning.
“That was when I drafted this minimum statement to comply with the section 21 order.
“I apologise to the court, but for all the reasons I’ve said, that’s the reason why it’s such a short statement.”
Mr Beer said: “Well let’s see if we can improve on that today, now that carol services and dog walking are out of the way.”"
L6AA67SPQW_IAUR8YMI9636R4W,Two million to be cut off from gas and electricity this winter – Citizens Advice,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067588.two-million-cut-off-gas-electricity-winter---citizens-advice/,"More than two million people will have their gas and electricity cut off this winter because they cannot afford to top up their prepayment meter, Citizens Advice has said.
The charity said it was concerned that having no gas and electricity would not be a “one-off” experience for many, after finding that 1.7 million people disconnected at least once a month last year.
Some 800,000 people went for more than 24 hours without gas and electricity last year because they could not afford to top up, leaving them unable to make a hot meal or take a warm shower.
The charity raised its concerns after Ofgem announced that it had permitted EDF, Octopus and Scottish Power to return to forcibly fitting prepayment meters (PPMs) after they were temporarily banned after a scandal around the practice.
Citizens Advice said it expected this to be its busiest winter for helping people who cannot afford to top up, with its latest research suggesting that more than five million people live in households that are in debt to their energy supplier, putting them at risk of debt collection and being forced on to a prepayment meter.
Its survey found that one in four people cannot afford their essential bills and one in 10 households have had to borrow money in the past six months to cover their energy bills.
Half of those in debt to their energy supplier (49%) have turned off the heating in their homes, while almost three million people live in households where they have skipped meals, cut back on food spending or sold or pawned possessions in the last year to save money to keep their meter topped up, the survey found.
Citizens Advice said it wanted to see urgent reform of the warm home discount, which had failed to keep pace with rising prices and should be increased and made available to a wider range of households.
The charity also wants the Government to work with Ofgem to develop a joint action plan to deal with energy debt, including increased funding for support to help meet spiralling demand.
Citizens Advice said it was particularly worried about households with children under four, who were twice as likely to be in debt and to be forced to disconnect from their gas and electricity than those without children.
Half of prepayment meter users with children under four had disconnected in the past year because they could not afford to top up, compared with a quarter (23%) of people with no children, the charity found.
Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty said: “Our frontline advisers are helping more people than ever who can’t pay their energy bill.
“Record numbers are in debt to their supplier and millions with a prepayment meter are too often going without heating and hot meals because they can’t afford to top up.
“The Government has not provided new energy bill support for those in need and has run out of time to develop the long-term approach it promised by April 2024.
“Without immediate action, we risk re-running this same crisis every winter.”
An Ofgem spokesman said: “Ofgem shares the concerns of Citizens Advice about the issue of rising debt and customers self-disconnecting from their energy supply amid the wider cost of living pressures.
“We already have introduced tougher rules to make sure that energy companies do more to spot the signs when a customer may be struggling and step in to offer support, including working out affordable payment plans and providing emergency credit to reduce the risk of self-disconnection.
“We work closely with Citizens Advice and other consumer groups and charities to address the issues people are facing and we will continue to explore more options to help struggling and vulnerable customers.”
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said: “We recognise the cost-of-living challenges families are facing, which is why we are spending £104 billion supporting households with their bills.
“While energy prices are lower than last winter, our Energy Price Guarantee remains in place to protect people until April, and we encourage anyone experiencing difficulties with their energy bills to speak with their supplier.
“We’re also continuing to support the most vulnerable, with three million households expected to benefit from the £150 Warm Home Discount, £900 for those on means-tested benefits, and an extra £150 for disabled people.”

LI7NW4ZVR9_4Q364RCPKI1BIXX,Councils claim funding settlement benefits wealthier areas,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064740.councils-claim-funding-settlement-benefits-wealthier-areas/,"Important elements of the funding settlement for councils this year disproportionately benefit richer areas and fail to take into account a range of growing demand pressures, according to local authorities serving some of the poorest communities.
In its response to the Government’s consultation on the settlement for 2024/25 published last month, the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities (Sigoma) said the Government’s approach shows funding decisions are increasingly less focused on local needs, raising the risk that more councils will declare effective bankruptcy.
Sigoma, which represents 47 urban councils in some of the most deprived areas in England, said the proposals are in line with a policy statement issued in 2022, before the full emergence of severe problems such as  workforce pressures and spiralling costs in a “broken” children’s social care market.
The consultation response, shared exclusively with the PA news agency, raises concerns that wealthier areas are being prioritised because of the way funding is allocated.
Sigoma said an increasing reliance on council tax to boost councils’ core spending power means people are forced to pay for essential services that should be funded by the Government.
This approach does not take into account variations in the level of council tax that can be generated in different areas, leaving poorer areas disadvantaged by having a higher proportion of properties in lower, cheaper bands.
This means either average council tax charges must be much higher in areas where many households can least afford them, to cover the shortfall, or there is significantly less to spend despite higher demand for services.
Sigoma also questioned the fairness of an effort to eliminate what is known as “negative revenue support grant”, whereby councils that receive more revenue than they need from local charges pay back funding to central Government.
The move to compensate affected councils, which mostly benefits district councils in shire areas, involves hundreds of million of pounds being redirected “to the detriment of poorer areas”, Sigoma said.
“This is further evidence of the need for a full fair funding review of the local government finance system,” it added.
Concerns were also raised about the Government’s “funding guarantee”, which aims to ensure councils get a 3% annual increase in their core spending power before decisions have been taken on efficiencies, use of financial reserves and council tax levels.
However, analysis by Sigoma shows that the 30% most deprived authorities got nothing from the funding guarantee, while the 10% least deprived areas received the most per household.
Sigoma argue that the guarantee is flawed because it is calculated without recognising the level of revenue available to councils.
This imbalance is illustrated by a largely flat increase in councils’ core spending power across all levels of deprivation in 2024/25, when in the past less wealthy areas received higher increases to cover demand on services.
Sigoma’s intervention comes as 44 Conservative MPs have written to the Prime Minister to urge him to rethink funding plans for councils.
They said they are “exceptionally concerned” that their local councils are on the verge of financial crisis and will be forced to hike council tax and cut services in an election year.
Sir Stephen Houghton, Sigoma chairman and Labour leader of Barnsley Council, said the finance settlement fails to cover increasing costs and account for rising demand.
He said: “These pressures, following a decade of cuts, have pushed many councils to the brink.
“The settlement also failed to distribute funding fairly. Over the last 14 years, the method of allocating funding has been moving further and further from a needs basis, resulting in an ever-growing gap between councils in the richest and poorest areas.
“The provisional settlement cements that trend and severely undermines any notions of levelling up. The final settlement, expected in early February, must be used to provide additional funding for the most in-need places.”
Announcing the settlement, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said: “We recognise councils are facing challenges and that is why we have announced a £64 billion funding package – a real-terms increase at an average of 6.5% – to ensure they can continue making a difference alongside our combined efforts to level up.”
A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “The 2024/25 settlement will also see the most relatively deprived areas of England receive 18% more per home than the least deprived areas.”"

The Bedding Barn, based at Bugthorpe Grange, says it has grown from a home-based operation to thriving business with many customers and a wide delivery area seeking its equine care and supplies.
It was founded in February 2022 by Rupert Armitage, a former city professional turned entrepreneur who found a significant gap in the market.
Inspired by his wife Sue, an avid horse enthusiast, the couple noticed the lack of reliable and comprehensive equine supply and delivery services in the region.
READ MORE:
They say the Bedding Barn’s unique selling proposition lies in a commitment to delivering
high-quality horse bedding, feed, supplements, and stable accessories directly to the
doorsteps of horse owners at very competitive prices.
This service is particularly valued in the rural and semi-rural areas of North & East Yorkshire, where access to such supplies can be challenging and peoples’ time to collect is limited by work commitments and store opening hours.
In less than two years, The Bedding Barn has expanded significantly:
● Now operating two large vans, delivering 5-6 days a week.
● Serving over 400 customers across a 4500 square mile area
● Offering a vast range of products including major feed and supplement brands,
quality stable equipment, and a variety of pet foods.
● Experiencing a remarkable growth in demand, as evidenced by a more than 350%
increase in the individual bags of feed ordered from our main wholesaler between
2022 and 2023.
● Maintaining strong partnerships with major equine wholesalers.
The business says it has not only filled a vital market gap but has also fostered a community of equestrian enthusiasts, contributing positively to the local economy and the equine industry.
The Bedding Barn’s success story is a testament to understanding customer
needs and delivering reliable, flexible service.
Rupert said: “We are thrilled to see how well The Bedding Barn has been received by the community.
""Our goal has always been to provide the highest quality products and services to horse owners and enthusiasts. The response we’ve gotten is a clear indication that we’re filling an essential need.”
The Bedding Barn’s future plans include expanding their product lines, delivery areas,
exploring eco-friendly options, and further engaging with the local equestrian community
through events and educational initiatives.

N9P28YJFAX_A4EZEU09YAHRSZ2,Chief medical officer told colleagues to delete WhatsApps ‘at end of every day’,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24066348.chief-medical-officer-told-colleagues-delete-whatsapps-at-end-every-day/,"Scotland’s chief medical officer told colleagues to delete WhatsApp messages “at the end of every day” during the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has heard.
Professor Sir Gregor Smith’s has added to a growing political storm around the retention of informal messages by senior decision makers and their advisers during the handling of Covid-19.
Former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney did not retain messages, while the national clinical director, Professor Jason, Leitch said deleting messages was a “bedtime ritual”.
During an appearance before the inquiry on Monday, as it continues to take evidence in Edinburgh, a message from the chief medical officer in a group chat in July 2021 with other Government medical advisers was shown for the first time.
Deputy chief medical officer, Professor Graham Ellis, said “hope this isn’t FOI-able?” in reference to freedom of information, in an exchange where he appeared to joke about having “my own supply” of cannabis.
Responding, Sir Gregor said: “Delete at the end of every day…”
Asked about the comments, by counsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, Sir Gregor said: “Scottish Government advice at this time was not to retain information for longer than it was necessary, it was to make sure that information that was pertinent, any information – particularly discussions which ended up in a decision – was captured within the corporate systems.
“My practice was to make sure that any information which was important in that way was then captured in email form on the system, was formally recorded so that it was an auditable trail, and I think you will see evidence of my approach to this within the conversations and within other conversations where I exalt other members of those conversations to do the same.”
Asked if he deleted messages at the end of every day, Sir Gregor said: “If not at the end of every day then certainly on a frequent basis, I deleted information which was no longer needed to be kept.”
Information that the chief medical officer deemed pertinent would not be recorded “verbatim”, he added, saying the “essence” of decisions or information given would be.
Sir Gregor went on to say advice had been given to Scottish Government employees to regularly delete informal messages, “partly for security purposes”.
This comes after the inquiry was told by Mr Dawson that messages held by Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney had been deleted, while logs from the national clinical director showed he said he regularly deleted messages.
Ms Sturgeon, however, said messages from her had been submitted to the inquiry by other people.
Scottish Tory chairman Craig Hoy accused senior Government officials of “effectively sneering” at the Scottish people during the pandemic.
He added: “We know this shocking culture of cover-up, and edicts to delete messages, came from the very top: Nicola Sturgeon and her senior SNP ministers.
“The nod-and-a-wink sniggering that went hand in hand with the industrial-scale deletion of messages points to the incriminating or embarrassing content contained within them.”
Those involved, he said, should “urgently explain their shameful, secretive and scandalous behaviour”.
Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton accused the Scottish Government of destroying evidence “while families grieved”, as he pushed for Ms Sturgeon to appear before MSPs.
The chief medical officer, who took over the post after his predecessor, Dr Catherine Calderwood, broke lockdown rules to visit her second home, also told the inquiry the loss of life in Scotland due to Covid-19 was “inevitable” due to the scale of the pandemic.
Asked by Mr Dawson if the Scottish Government believed “no death from coronavirus was acceptable”, the chief medical officer said the phrase was not one that he recognised.
“Certainly from a clinical perspective, there was a deep realisation – tragic though it is, and it was an absolute tragedy for some families – that it was almost inevitable given the scale of the threat which was faced by a novel virus in a population that had no immunity to it, it was likely that there were going to be deaths,” he said.
The Scottish Government, he said, would do its best to try to “limit the harm” caused by the virus.
Later on Monday, Sir Gregor was asked about a Nike conference that was held in Edinburgh in early March 2020.
The Scottish Government had previously been accused of covering up information of a Covid-19 outbreak at the event, which took place at the capital’s Hilton Edinburgh Carlton hotel.
But, Sir Gregor said, his predecessor was “very against” circumstances where she could be responsible for the release of information about patients and had “high risk threshold” in relation.
He disagreed with Dr Calderwood’s decision not to release the information because of the public interest in the outbreak.
Sir Gregor told the inquiry that it had been international travel that “seeded” the virus throughout Scotland and that “in hindsight” he’d have advised against an international rugby match which took place between Scotland and France at Murrayfield on March 8, 2020.
The chief medical officer was also asked about the impact of Dr Calderwood’s resignation on the wider team after reports she had travelled to her second home in Fife, against Covid-19 restrictions that had been brought in.
He said: “The biggest impact it had was on the workload of the rest of the directorate – an important, trusted colleague was no longer there.”
The UK Covid-19 Inquiry will hear evidence from Scottish Government national clinical director, Jason Leitch on Tuesday."
ND6IREVFTV_4057YM2TJW9MFUG,World Health Organisation issues fresh warning over measles,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24068478.world-health-organisation-issues-fresh-warning-measles/,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a fresh warning over measles after an almost 45-fold rise in cases across Europe.
Experts from the organisation said Europe is seeing an “alarming rise” in the spread of the disease, which has “accelerated in recent months”.
Some 42,200 cases were reported by member states in 2023, almost 45 times the 941 cases in 2022.
Two in five cases were in children aged one to four, while one in five were among people aged 20 and over.
The rising trend is expected to continue if people do not vaccinate their children against the disease, WHO said.
It comes after the UK launched its own campaigns to encourage parents to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children.
Measles can lead to serious complications, lifelong disability and death.
It can affect the lungs and brain and cause pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures.
Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said: “Vaccination is the only way to protect children from this potentially dangerous disease.
“Urgent vaccination efforts are needed to halt transmission and prevent further spread.
“It is vital that all countries are prepared to rapidly detect and timely respond to measles outbreaks, which could endanger progress towards measles elimination.”
WHO said that sliding vaccination rates were to blame, but more people were now travelling abroad after Covid-19, increasing the risk of cross-border disease transmission and spread within communities.
On Friday, the head of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned the UK is on a “trajectory for everything getting much worse” when it comes to measles spreading,
Professor Dame Jenny Harries told the PA news agency that “concerted action” is needed to tackle the virus, as she visited a measles blackspot in the West Midlands.
She suggested the majority of people are not against their child receiving the MMR jab, but that they need more information to feel confident about their decision.
She added: “What we are seeing at the moment with measles is that people have forgotten what a serious illness it is…
“We have had very high vaccination rates, especially for young families, but they are low at the moment.”
Measles is highly infectious and can be passed on even before a rash appears.
Make sure your child is protected from becoming seriously unwell from measles by making sure they are up to date with their MMR vaccinations.

Vaccination rates across the country have been dropping, but there are particular concerns about some regions, including parts of London and the West Midlands.
Figures released by the UKHSA on Friday showed there have been 216 confirmed measles cases and 103 probable cases in the West Midlands since October 1 last year.
Four-fifths (80%) have been found in Birmingham while 10% were identified in Coventry, with the majority being in children aged under 10.
The UKHSA has declared a national incident, which it said is an internal mechanism signalling the growing public health risk and enabling it to focus work in specific areas.
Official figures show uptake of the vaccine is at its lowest point in more than a decade.
In 2022/23, some 84.5% of youngsters in England had received both doses of the jab by the time they were five years old – the lowest level since 2010/11. Some 92.5% had received one dose.
Mike Tildesley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick and an expert in disease spread and Covid, said the R number for measles – the number of people that one infected person will pass the illness on to – is much higher than for Covid.
“This means we need over 90% of the population to be immune or you’re going to start seeing cases growing,” he said.
“We have childhood vaccinations for measles which for many years have helped us to get rid of the disease.
“Unfortunately, if those vaccination levels drop then we will start to see cases going up and that’s what we are seeing at the moment.”"
NECIP12E0E_SPDLC4XFU2LYPGK,Ministers approve Sir James Dyson’s £6m donation to state primary school,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067266.ministers-approve-sir-james-dysons-6m-donation-state-primary-school/,"A £6 million donation from Sir James Dyson to his local state primary school has been given the green light by the Government.
Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has approved the donation from the billionaire inventor to build a centre for science, technology, engineering, mathematics (Stem) and arts at Malmesbury Church of England primary school in Wiltshire.
The expansion at the school would see purpose-built rooms equipped for design, technology, art, science and mathematics-based activities, as well as additional classrooms.
If planning permission is approved by Wiltshire Council, it is expected to be open from September 2027, the Department for Education (DfE) said.
In November, Sir James announced a £35 million donation to his former fee-paying school – Gresham’s School in Holt, Norfolk – which allowed him to continue his studies there for free after the death of his father.
In a letter to The Times last year, Sir James said his donation to Malmesbury Church of England primary school had been blocked by officials – a claim denied by Downing Street.
The billionaire businessman said he had been trying to give a grant to the state school through his charitable foundation to help with the building of its new science and technology centre and expansion by 210 places.
“But the local authority and Department for Education say no, citing the risk of other schools having insufficient numbers,” Sir James wrote in the letter to The Times in October.
Announcing the approval of the donation on Monday, Ms Keegan said: “I welcome this generous donation from the Dyson Foundation which will support cutting edge education for local pupils, helping to develop the scientists and engineers of the future.
“This new centre will provide world-class facilities for pupils in Malmesbury and the surrounding areas to inspire them and develop the skills we need to compete on the world stage.
“The £6 million donation builds on the work we have been doing to boost the uptake of Stem subjects in schools and through apprenticeships and further education, boosting growth and opportunity in these vital sectors.”
A James Dyson Foundation spokesman said: “The Secretary of State’s approval is conditional on the local authority approving the school’s expansion before any building work can commence, which takes us back to square one.”
Wiltshire Council has raised concerns around having all the investment in one location, and the impact that the expansion of pupil numbers at Malmesbury Primary School could have on neighbouring schools.
Laura Mayes, cabinet member for children’s services, said: “We have an important responsibility to ensure all our school pupils can access opportunities that inspire them and help them achieve their potential.
“Our school places strategy is our long-term plan, based on clear evidence, which maps out how we will secure sufficient school places for the future.
“Our strategy shows we have sufficient places in the three local schools to cater for expected demand and we have expressed concern about the impact that adding 210 additional places at Malmesbury Primary School could have on neighbouring schools.
“However we now have the Government’s final decision and we will work with everyone involved to ensure we achieve the best outcomes for all our pupils.”"

On Tuesday, January 23 heavy rain and strong winds moved across the isles, with the largest gusts recorded in Capel Curig, North Wales, at 97mph.
Elsewhere, trains in Scotland stopped running on Tuesday evening, there was disruption on roads in Northern Ireland and thousands of homes lost power.
Tuesday night saw gusts of 60-80mph in North Wales, Northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, which may have led to some trees, branches or debris falling on roads, BBC News reports.
#StormJocelyn has brought some very strong winds across the UK overnight and continues to do so across Scotland in particular this morning 💨     Here are the latest maximum gust speeds... pic.twitter.com/duugU5RQ3n
Here is when Storm Jocelyn is expected to end, and when people can expect a return to calmer weather conditions.
The worst of Storm Jocelyn is already over for many and according to the Met Office weather warnings page, it is set to end by 4pm on Wednesday, January 24.
This relates to a current yellow weather warning for wind which covers much of Scotland and Northern England, which represents the last of the storm.
Alongside this, the Met Office adds: ""The winds will gradually ease through the Wednesday and as we head through the rest of the week the weather continues to look changeable, with the drier and most settled conditions towards the south and east, and the most unsettled (wettest and windiest) conditions expected in the northwest.
""Temperatures are expected to remain mild or close to average for the time of year.""

Storms as a whole are named so people can more easily engage with weather forecasts, with the practice being established in the 1950s.
In 2015, following the success of the US model, the UK Met Office and Irish service Met Éireann launched their first ""Name our Storms"" campaign.
Most years, they draw the names from a shortlist of favourites submitted by the public.
Additionally, they have been joined by the National Weather Service of the Netherlands who contribute a few names each year.
Recommended reading:
As part of the 2023/24 weather season, the Met Office has named a number of storms after prominent scientists, meteorologists and other people involved in the weather.
In the past, storms have alternated between male and female names but that has altered this year in order to honour the right people.
An almost full alphabet of names is put forward each year, except for ones beginning with Q, U, X, Y and Z.
In the current 2023/24 weather season the UK has gone through 10 storms, with Jocelyn being the most recent.
If an 11th storm is forecast it will be called Kathleen."
NO2OYMIG7C_T7KWT0YJEE7SO3D,"Air strikes send ‘clearest possible message’ to Houthis, says Cameron",By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067826.air-strikes-send-clearest-possible-message-houthis-says-cameron/,"The latest round of UK and allied strikes against Houthi targets was designed to “send the clearest possible message” to the rebels that attacks on cargo ships are “unacceptable”, the Foreign Secretary said.
Britain joined the US in carrying out a fresh set of joint air strikes in Yemen in response to the Houthi rebels targeting international shipping along vital Red Sea and Gulf of Aden trade routes.
Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said UK armed forces will “continue to degrade” the Houthis’ ability to carry out attacks as long as their “completely indiscriminate” campaign of harassment in the Middle East continues.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to update MPs during an appearance in the Commons on Tuesday.
Lord Cameron said the UK had renewed its military action against the Iran-backed Houthis due to attacks on cargo ships continuing.
London and Washington targeted rebel sites overnight on January 11-12, with further US attacks in recent days.
Despite the Western intervention, ships have continued to be targeted along the major global trade route which provides access to the Suez Canal, a thoroughfare that serves 15% of world shipping.
International freight companies have been forced to reroute cargo vessels around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, resulting in longer and more costly journeys.
The Foreign Secretary, speaking to broadcasters on Tuesday, said: “Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis in the Red Sea.
“These attacks are illegal, they are unacceptable.
“What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action.”
The US military confirmed the latest strikes were against eight targets.
The Ministry of Defence said four Royal Air Force Typhoons and a pair of Voyager tankers were involved in the latest action.
The department said several targets were hit at two military sites near the Sanaa airfield in Yemen.
Officials stated that a “very rigorous analysis” was carried out to avoid civilian casualties.
Labour figures said Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer was not alerted before Monday’s allied action, while the PA news agency understands Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was not either, unlike when the UK first carried out joint strikes with the US earlier this month.
Shadow health minister Karin Smyth told GB News that the Government “haven’t spoken to us on the usual terms” ahead of the assault.
Conservative Government minister Huw Merriman disputed that, telling LBC: “They (Sir Keir and Sir Lindsay) were both informed, is my understanding.
“The Prime Minister will be in the House of Commons today, as he was on the previous day following the first round, to account to Parliament.”
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it is “deeply disappointing” that Parliament is being “bypassed” by the Prime Minister on the Red Sea response.
Sir Ed, who stated that his party backs the strikes “so long as they remain limited”, said: “It is absolutely vital that Parliament has an opportunity to have its say, via a debate and a vote.
“The Prime Minister has so far failed to grant either.
“It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives are being bypassed on an issue as important as military action.”
The UK Government has warned that the latest strikes in the Red Sea will “not just be a one-off” if the Houthis continue to disrupt international shipping.
Mr Merriman told Sky News: “For us to take action and then the Houthis respond, and then we do nothing, would send out the completely wrong signal.
“So, this demonstrates that we will be tough and we will take all measures required against the Houthis to protect international shipping and protect the lives of those who operate those ships.
“We will deliver whatever it takes to the Houthis to ensure that they desist, so we hope the message is now clear, this being a second time.”
Mr Sunak and US President Joe Biden spoke on Monday evening, with a Downing Street readout stating that the two leaders agreed to “continue efforts alongside international partners to deter and disrupt” attacks by the Houthis.
A joint statement issued by Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and the US described the strikes as “proportionate and necessary”.
The statement said the mission targeted a Houthi underground storage site as well as locations linked to the group’s missile and air surveillance capabilities.
While the US, UK and other Western allies have insisted the strikes are not escalatory, it comes as tensions simmer in the Middle East as the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues.
The Houthis, a Shia rebel group that has held Sanaa since 2014 and been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s exiled government since 2015, have linked their attacks to the Israel-Hamas war.
However, the ships they have targeted increasingly have tenuous links to Israel – or none at all.
Lord Cameron said the West “shouldn’t accept the Houthi narrative” that their actions have been targeting shipping with ties to Tel Aviv.
He said: “What the Houthis are doing is attacking shipping indiscriminately and effectively trying to close a vital sea lane, whereas we want to keep that sea lane open.”
The Cabinet minister stressed there is “no quarrel with the Yemeni people”, pointing to the UK providing the war-torn country with aid, through a “sea lane that the Houthis are trying to close”, which feeds more than 100,000 people a month."
O25Z2OGNNJ_CX62HKXEBHYQM8E,"UK should boost green public investment by 1% of GDP a year, say top economists",By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24065013.uk-boost-green-public-investment-1-gdp-year-say-top-economists/,"The UK Government should increase public investment in tackling climate change and biodiversity loss by £26bn a year – or 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) – to boost growth and productivity, leading economists have found.
Professor Nicholas Stern and other experts from the London School of Economics and the University of Cambridge analysed current plans to cut public investment over the next few years, as laid out in the Chancellor’s 2024 autumn statement.
In a report released on Monday, they said continued low public investment, and ongoing barriers to business investment in productive and sustainable assets, are “inconsistent with success in international markets and will likely lead to more stagnation”.
The researchers also warned that unsustainable investments, such as the development of new oil and gas fields in the North Sea and the construction of homes and offices that are not energy-efficient, will likely damage the UK economy.
“This risks creating stranded assets, significant financial losses in polluting and emissions-intensive sectors, and an insecure, unaffordable and unsustainable energy supply,” they wrote.
“It will also mean that the UK fails to adequately tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, including water and air pollution.”
The researchers estimated that the UK needs to increase annual public spending by 1% of GDP – £26 billion at current prices – to make up for decades of underinvestment in its physical, natural, social, knowledge and human capital.
This will enable the country to deliver on tackling climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation as well as being economically productive and competitive in future, the report noted.
The authors, which also includes Dimitri Zenghelis, Esin Serin, Professor John van Reenen, Dr Anna Valero and Bob Ward, pointed out that this public investment would encourage more private investment.
The report said: “Together with a coherent set of public policies to drive innovation and address gross systemic inefficiency, this would help crowd in private investment in tackling climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, and could form part of a rise in annual overall public and private investment that taken together is equivalent to at least 3% of GDP, or £77 billion”.
It adds: “Productivity is driven by efficiency, and investment in resource and energy efficiency gets more out of the country’s resources and drives competitiveness in global markets.
“The investments inevitably will be front-loaded, substituting capital for fossil fuels, and reducing waste and pollution.”
The authors also concluded that investments in the transition to a sustainable, inclusive and resilient economy will improve the UK’s public finances.
They acknowledged that there will be upfront investment costs but “targeted and temporary borrowing for good public net investment” will reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over time, calling it “fiscally responsible”.
“Once the UK’s sustainable innovation system is up and running, government support can be phased down, as new, more efficient and productive industries increasingly outcompete the old and generate their own global revenues and inward investment,” the report notes.
“By contrast, inaction would likely prove costly to economic competitiveness and financial resilience and require costly remedial support later on.”
A Government spokesperson said: “This Government is focused on long-term decisions to strengthen our economy which is why at Autumn Statement we announced a business investment package which could raise investment by around £20 billion a year in a decade’s time.
“We’re leading the world in our transformation of the energy industry towards more clean and renewable energy, with over 80,000 green jobs being supported or in the pipeline since 2020 and our plans to power up Britain are expected to attract a further £100 billion investment in green industries of the future.”"
OC1VSQE72Z_VVRJ8BA2WHLF76J,Donald Trump celebrates Ron DeSantis’ decision to end presidential campaign,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064759.donald-trump-celebrates-ron-desantis-decision-end-presidential-campaign/,"Donald Trump has celebrated one-time Republican rival Ron DeSantis as his newest supporter after the Florida governor ended his presidential campaign and endorsed the former president.
For Mr Trump, it has become a familiar ritual to welcome the backing of someone who once tried to take him on.
Nonetheless, it was notable at Sunday’s rally in New Hampshire to see Mr Trump praise Mr DeSantis without calling him “DeSantimonious” or “DeSanctus”, putting an end to perhaps the most bitter rivalry of Republicans’ 2024 campaign.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Mr Trump said at the outset of his remarks.
“He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.”
Mr Trump described Mr DeSantis as “a really terrific person”.
Earlier in the day, Mr DeSantis said via video that he would be ending his campaign two days before New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation Republican primary.
But, Mr Trump’s glee on Sunday night aside, it was not the warmest of endorsements.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” Mr DeSantis said, offering matter-of-fact analysis through a forced smile without adding plaudits for Mr Trump.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge,” he continued, before adding a dig at the remaining contender, Nikki Haley.
Mr DeSantis described the former UN ambassador and one-time South Carolina governor as a stand-in for “the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism”.
Mr Trump seemed unbothered by Mr DeSantis’ approach, striking a tone of camaraderie as fellow political combatants.
“I will tell you it’s not easy,” Mr Trump said on Sunday night in Rochester.
“They think it’s easy doing this stuff, right? It’s not easy.”
The former president seemed to revel in skewering Mr DeSantis throughout the campaign, often making clear it was a personal grudge because he considered the governor’s decision to run in the first place an act of disloyalty.
Mr Trump endorsed Mr DeSantis, then a congressman, in a competitive 2018 Republican primary for Florida governor.
Mr DeSantis went on to win the nomination and the general election. By the time Mr DeSantis won a landslide re-election four years later, though, he was positioning himself for his own White House campaign.
As recently as November, Mr Trump came to Florida and addressed a boisterous crowd at a state Republican meeting standing in front of a sign that read: “Florida is Trump Country.”
That evening, Mr Trump did not mention Mr DeSantis until more than 30 minutes into his speech. Even then, it was to brag about polls showing his advantages over the governor.
“I endorsed him, and he became a rocket ship in 24 hours,” Mr Trump said, claiming that Mr DeSantis had begged for his endorsement.
“Now he’s like a wounded falling bird from the sky.”
Mr Trump never did debate Mr DeSantis or any other 2024 rival. He has said he would not until one proves they are a legitimate threat to him winning the nomination.
Mr DeSantis concentrated his campaign in recent months in Iowa, where he finished in second place in last week’s caucuses — 30 percentage points behind Mr Trump and barely ahead of Ms Haley.
Ms Haley, meanwhile, has long prioritised New Hampshire as a potential springboard ahead of her home-state South Carolina primary next month.
In Iowa, APVoteCast surveys of caucusgoers suggested Mr DeSantis’s supporters were much more likely than Ms Haley’s to consider themselves conservatives who would back Mr Trump no matter what if he wins the nomination and faces President Joe Biden in November.
If that trend holds in New Hampshire, then Mr Trump could expect at least some boost from Mr DeSantis dropping out, and whatever he gets could stretch out his margin and frustrate Ms Haley’s ability to claim any momentum.
Indeed, Mr Trump’s aides have said they expect Mr DeSantis’ support around the country will shift heavily to Mr Trump.
Mr Trump noted on Sunday that he won New Hampshire’s 2016 primary by about 20 points. He lost the battleground state twice in general elections."
OPF2R8K1KZ_LYO3S4O734054R0,South African police arrest man who says he started deadly fire to hide murder,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070453.south-african-police-arrest-man-says-started-deadly-fire-hide-murder/,"A man was arrested on Tuesday and will face 76 counts of murder after telling an inquiry that he started a deadly building fire in South Africa last year while trying to get rid of the body of someone he had strangled in the apartment complex.
The shocking confession came when the man was giving evidence at the public inquiry into the causes of the night-time fire in Johannesburg in August, which was one of South Africa’s worst disasters with its death toll of 76.
The 29-year-old man, who was not named, said he had killed a man in the basement of the rundown building on the night of the fire by beating him and strangling him, according to South African media reports of the evidence.
He said he then poured petrol on the man’s body and set it alight with a match.
He testified that he was a drug user and was told to kill the man by a Tanzanian drug dealer who lived in the building.
Hours later, police said they had arrested the man after his evidence.
He is also facing 120 counts of attempted murder and a charge of arson, police said in a statement.
He would appear in court in Johannesburg soon, police said, without giving a date.
The inquiry he was testifying at is not a criminal proceeding and his confession came as a complete surprise. The inquiry is looking into what caused the fire and what safety failures might have resulted in so many people dying, and he testified because he was a resident of the building.
The panel in charge of the inquiry ordered that he not be identified after his evidence and a lawyer leading the questioning of witnesses said that his confession could not be used against him because it was not a criminal hearing.
South African media referred to him as Mr X when reporting on his claim that he caused the fire that ripped through the dilapidated five-storey building in the city’s Marshalltown district, killing dozens, including at least 12 children. More than 80 people were injured.
The fire drew the world’s attention to central Johannesburg’s long-running problem with “hijacked buildings”, rundown structures that have been taken over by squatters and abandoned by authorities.
There are many of them in the old centre of the city, officials say, illustrating the decay of parts of South Africa’s largest city and one of the African continent’s most important economic hubs.
The city of Johannesburg owned the building, but it had been taken over by illegal landlords, who were renting out space to hundreds of poor people desperate for somewhere to live. Many of the building’s occupants were immigrants suspected of being in South Africa illegally.
It also sparked anger in South Africa that authorities should seemingly be so powerless to stop the illegal takeover of such buildings.
In his evidence, Mr X said that the building was a haven of criminality and was being run by drug dealers. He also claimed there were more bodies in the basement of the building — which he called a “slaughterhouse” — before the fire.
South African police opened a criminal case in the days after the fire five months ago but no one had been arrested until Tuesday.
Emergency service officials said that they found most of the fire escapes in the building had been locked or chained closed that night, making it even deadlier.
Some people jumped out of windows — some as high as three floors up — to escape the inferno, according to witnesses and health officials.
Some said they had to throw their babies and children out, hoping they would be caught by people below.
Many of the injured suffered broken limbs and backs from jumping out the windows.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered the inquiry into the disaster, which started in October by hearing evidence from emergency services personnel who first responded to the fire in the early morning hours of August 31."
P0XB7KTLPJ_7EKE7H33VK2CCZV,York-based Northern issues fewer penalties to fare dodgers,By Kevin Glenton @YorkPressKevin Reporter,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24068291.york-based-northern-issues-fewer-penalties-fare-dodgers/,"A TRAIN operator based in York has seen the number of penalty fares for those travelling without a ticket fall by more than 20 per cent.
Northern issued 41,234 penalty fares between January 23 and December 23 last year, compared to 52,394 for the same period in 2022.
The £100 ‘fine’ came into effect on January 23 last year after being £20 since 2005 – a figure Northern said the rail industry felt was too low and no longer a deterrent to would-be evaders.

The company said as part of the government’s public consultation, 69 per cent of respondents agreed that £20 was too low as a penalty fare.
Mark Powles, commercial and customer director at Northern, said: “This is a significant and much welcomed drop in the number of penalty fares issued.
“The appetite for ‘risking it’ has clearly taken a hit in the past 12 months – and the increase in the penalty fare is no doubt a factor.”
The company said its approach to fare evasion in recent years includes sending teams to known hotspots, introducing new technology to help with ticket checks at stations and on-board its trains and clamping down on cases of digital fraud.
Mr Powles added: “It’s worth remembering that upwards of 95 per cent of our customers do the right thing and buy a ticket before they travel.
“The reduction in attempted fare evasion is a victory for taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill for those that try not to pay.”
The Office of Rail and Road has published figures on passenger journeys made by train operators for the first three-quarters of 2023.
It said that for January to March 2023, passenger journeys on Northern was at 83 per cent of pre-pandemic levels (January to March 2019) and that for April to September 2023, the figure was higher than for the equivalent period in 2022."
P7284XQUSR_KUQMCDOJUZP0EHV,Attorney General reviewing whether Nottingham attacker sentence too lenient,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075980.attorney-general-reviewing-whether-nottingham-attacker-sentence-lenient/,"The Attorney General is considering whether judges should review the sentence of Nottingham knifeman Valdo Calocane after receiving a submission that it could be unduly lenient.
A judge handed down a hospital order to the 32-year-old, who has paranoid schizophrenia and whose pleas to manslaughter by diminished responsibility were accepted earlier this week.
The families of the three people he killed have reacted angrily to the sentencing and accused prosecutors of a “fait accompli” in accepting a manslaughter charge rather than pursuing a murder verdict.
A spokesman for Attorney General Victoria Prentis confirmed her office had received a referral arguing the sentence administered on Thursday had been unduly lenient.
It gives the Cabinet minister 28 days from sentencing to review the request and decide whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal to decide whether the sentence was appropriate.
Judge Mr Justice Turner said Calocane would “very probably” be detained in a high-security hospital for the rest of his life as he sentenced him for the “atrocious” killings, as well as the attempted murder of three others.
Emma Webber, mother of student Barnaby Webber, 19, who was killed alongside his friend Grace O’Malley-Kumar, also 19, and school caretaker Ian Coates, 65, on June 13 last year, was critical of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to downgrade the charge from murder.
Speaking on the steps outside Nottingham Crown Court after the sentencing hearing concluded, Mrs Webber said the CPS only met the bereaved families on November 24.
She said: “We were presented with a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges.
“At no point during the previous five-and-a-half-months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder.
“We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out.”
While accepting that the “murderer is mentally unwell”, Mrs Webber said the “pre-meditated” nature and “brutality” of the attacks indicated that they were the actions of “an individual who knew exactly what he was doing”.
The Attorney General’s considerations are unlikely to look at whether the correct charge was pursued in Calocane’s case, PA news agency understands.
Any person or institution can ask for a sentence to be reviewed if they have reason to think it is unduly lenient.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declined to back calls for a public inquiry into the circumstances that led to the Nottingham attacks but has promised to learn “any lessons” required from the case.
Mr Sunak told broadcasters during a visit to Scarborough in north Yorkshire on Thursday that it was “right” Calocane, who he branded a “very dangerous individual”, would “spend very probably the rest of his life” in a high-security hospital.
Asked whether he would order a public inquiry into any failings by the police, health authorities and the CPS, he said: “I think it is important that all the relevant agencies look back to ensure that all reasonable steps that could have been taken were taken and if there are any lessons to be learned that we do so.”
Despite being detained in hospital, Mr Justice Turner said Calocane still “remains dangerous”.
During the three-day hearing, the court heard that Calocane, a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Nottingham, hid in the shadows in Ilkeston Road at around 4am on June 13, armed with a dagger, before beginning his attack on Mr Webber and Ms O’Malley-Kumar as they walked back to their student accommodation after an end-of-term night out.
After stabbing the pair tens of times, the court heard how Calocane “calmly” walked away, later going on to “lure” Mr Coates from his van before stabbing him 15 times.
Leaving Mr Coates dying in the street, Calocane stole his van where he proceeded to drive into pedestrians on his way into the city centre.
Calocane was arrested after being tasered around five minutes after the final victims were injured.
A search of his backpack found two other knives and a scaffolding pole.
The court heard that Calocane’s “serious” mental illness, which he was not taking his prescribed medication for, meant he would hear voices telling him he needed to kill people or his family would be hurt.
He is also known to have visited MI5’s London headquarters two years before the fatal attack to ask them to stop “controlling him”.
Calocane had previously been detained in hospital four times under mental health laws and was arrested in September 2021 for assaulting a police officer.
Three psychiatrists agreed a hospital order would be the best course of action for Calocane, who believed he was being “interfered with” by “malign forces”, with all of them agreeing in court that the attack would not have happened had he not been in the grip of “severe psychosis”."
PKKXUKNTKO_MJUFDOHWEXWE8A7,South Korea says North Korea has fired several cruise missiles into the sea,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070459.south-korea-says-north-korea-fired-several-cruise-missiles-sea/,"South Korea’s military says North Korea has fired several cruise missiles into waters off its western coast.
It marks the latest entry in a provocative run of weapons demonstrations in the face of deepening nuclear tensions with the United States, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Wednesday that the US and South Korean militaries were analysing the launches. It did not immediately confirm the exact number of missiles fired or their specific flight details.
The launches marked North Korea’s second known launch event of the year, following a January 14 flight test-firing of the country’s first solid-fuel intermediate range ballistic missile, which reflected its efforts to advance its line-up of weapons targeting US military bases in Japan and Guam.
“Our military has increased surveillance and vigilance and is closely coordinating with the United States while monitoring for further signs and activity from North Korea,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have increased in recent months as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to accelerate his weapons development and issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the United States and its Asian allies.
The US, South Korea and Japan in response have been expanding their combined military exercises, which Mr Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around nuclear-capable US assets.
In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea said last week that it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan, as it blamed its rivals for tensions in the region.
Cruise missiles are among a broad range of weapons North Korea has been testing in recent years as it attempts to build a viable nuclear threat against the US and its Asian allies.
Since 2021, the North has conducted several flight tests of what it describes as long-range cruise missiles, which it claims can cover ranges of up to 2,000 kilometres (1,242 miles) away and are nuclear-capable.
While North Korean cruise missile activities are not directly banned under UN sanctions, experts say those weapons potentially pose a serious threat to South Korea and Japan, as they are designed to fly like small airplanes and travel along landscape that would make them harder to detect by radar.
There are concerns that North Korea would dial up tensions in a US election year. Experts say the North would aim to increase its bargaining power as it plans for eventual negotiations with whoever wins the November presidential vote.
North Korea also has a long history of ramping up pressure on rival South Korea when it does not get what it wants from Washington.
At Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament last week, Mr Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with the South and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to cement its war-divided rival as its most hostile foreign adversary.
He accused South Korea of acting as “top-class stooges” of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.
Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear stand-off and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its nuclear status."

PWNTHRQE6L_U5ZFQQIAGTQ2B8B,PM apologises over RAAC disruption during Scarborough visit,By Anttoni James Numminen,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24076602.pm-apologises-raac-disruption-scarborough-visit/,"Rishi Sunak has apologised for the disruption faced by students at Scalby School after they expressed concerns about the impact of RAAC on their studies.
On a visit to Scarborough on Thursday (Jan 25), Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was sorry about the impact that crumbling concrete has had on students’ studies.
However, he also defended the Government’s record, stating that “it was right that we took action when we did”.
The presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) in Scarborough’s Scalby School has forced it to close two-thirds of its space.
Speaking to reporters after visiting the Construction Skills Village in Eastfield, Scarborough, Rishi Sunak admitted that it had been “a difficult period for people to get through, particularly parents who were impacted by it”.
The prime minister said: “I know there’s one school locally that has been impacted.
“I’m pleased kids everywhere are back in face-to-face learning, and we’ve been very clear that we will make sure we fix all the issues of RAAC, either with specific support for the schools in question, or through our regular school rebuilding program.”
Scalby School was identified as having RAAC in March 2023 but updated guidance from the Department for Education in August meant that 17 classrooms were cordoned off before the beginning of the autumn term.
The school has had a set of Portakabin buildings – known as the “Village” – delivered and installed to replace classrooms that cannot be used.
During his visit to Scarborough, Rishi Sunak also said that there were “a handful of other schools that are new and being invested in” which he said demonstrated “the Government’s commitment to schools particularly in this area”.
He added that “less than one per cent of schools [were] affected in the end” and that all children were now back to face-to-face learning.
“I know it’s been disruptive, and I’m sorry about that, but when something like that happens, you really do just need to move quickly to resolve the issues,” the prime minister said.
Scalby School has been given an additional £37,000 to provide after-school lessons, according to the Government."

Q5QUUWB7IE_CKJY58644IGT2Q0,Families of Gaza hostages storm Israel’s parliament demanding release deal,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067408.families-gaza-hostages-storm-israels-parliament-demanding-release-deal/,"Dozens of family members of hostages held by Hamas stormed a committee meeting in Israel’s parliament, demanding a deal to win their loved ones’ release.
It came as European foreign ministers joined growing international calls for Israel to negotiate on the creation of a Palestinian state after the war.
The developments showed the increasing pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has dug in on both fronts.
He has insisted to the Israeli public that pursuing the devastating offensive in Gaza is the only way to bring the hostages home.
At the same time, he has rejected the United States’ vision for a post-war resolution, saying he will never allow a Palestinian state.
The dispute over Gaza’s future pits Israel against its top ally and much of the international community.
It also poses a major obstacle to plans for post-war governance or reconstruction of the coastal territory, large parts of which have been left unliveable by Israeli bombardment.
In other developments, Israeli strikes and shelling intensified in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, sending Palestinian families fleeing south in pick-up trucks and donkey carts loaded with possessions.
In the city, which has been a battle zone for weeks, people dug graves for the dead inside the yard of Al-Nasser Hospital as staff struggled to deal with dozens of newly killed and wounded, including children.
Health care workers said strikes hit at least four schools sheltering displaced people on the city’s western edges, including two inside a coastal strip that Israel had declared a safe zone for people fleeing.
Gaza’s internet and phone networks collapsed again on Monday for the 10th time during the war.
The repeated blackouts severely hamper distribution of aid that is essential for the survival of the territory’s population of 2.3 million, UN officials said.
The loss of service also prevents Palestinians from communicating with each other and the outside world.
Mr Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas and to return all remaining hostages after the October 7 rampage in southern Israel which triggered the war.
In that attack, some 1,200 people were killed and Hamas and other militants abducted around 250 people.
Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it is possible to do either.
Around 100 hostages were freed under a week-long ceasefire deal in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
Around 130 remain captive but a number have since been confirmed dead.
Hamas has said it will free more captives only in exchange for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners.
Mr Netanyahu has ruled out such an agreement but anger is rising among hostages’ families.
Relatives and other protesters set up a tent camp outside Mr Netanyahu’s home in Jerusalem, vowing to remain until a deal is reached.
On Monday, dozens of family members of the hostages stormed into a gathering of the Knesset’s finance committee, holding up signs and yelling: “You won’t sit here while they are dying there.”
“These are our children!” they shouted. Some had to be physically restrained and at least one person was escorted out.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 25,295 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 60,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
Residents in Khan Younis reported bombardment on all sides of the city.
At Nasser Hospital, Ayman Abu Abaid, the head of surgery, told Al Jazeera TV early on Monday that at least 50 dead and more than 100 wounded had been brought to the facility.
Ashraf Al-Qudra, spokesman for the health ministry, said Israeli troops stormed Al-Khair Hospital and detained the medical staff, the latest hospital troops have seized during the conflict.
The hospital is just inside the safe zone at Muwasi, a rural coastal strip west of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military had said it would not carry out operations.
Volunteers with the Red Crescent said strikes hit four schools west of Khan Younis — two of them inside the Muwasi zone — causing an unknown number of casualties.
They said the organisation’s ambulances could not reach the sites.
Families streamed out of Khan Younis along the coastal motorway, some walking, some loading blankets and possessions into vehicles.
They headed towards Rafah, the tiny sliver at the extreme southern end of Gaza where well over a million people are already crowded, many living in tents that have filled the streets.
As he fled Khan Younis with his family, Ahmad Shurrab said he had been displaced multiple times.
“Where should I go? Should I go to Rafah? Rafah is like one street. What do they want from us?” he shouted.
Some 85% of the Gaza population has been driven from their homes by the war. UN officials say one in four people in Gaza is starving as the fighting and Israeli restrictions hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid.
Only 15 bakeries are working across the Gaza Strip, all of them in either Rafah or the central town of Deir al-Balah, the UN said.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants in its offensive, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it operates in dense residential areas.
The war has also stoked tensions across the region, with Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israeli and US targets.
Mr Netanyahu, whose popularity has plummeted since October 7, faces pressure from the US to shift to more precise military operations and do more to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The United States is also calling for a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the war and for negotiations to start on a two-state solution.
The authority currently governs pockets of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was ejected from Gaza in 2007 when Hamas took power.
Mr Netanyahu has rejected both the entry of the Palestinian Authority and the creation of a Palestinian state. His governing coalition is beholden to far-right parties that want to step up the offensive, encourage the emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements there.
At a meeting in Brussels, European Union foreign ministers added their voices to the calls for a Palestinian state, saying it was the only way to achieve peace.
French foreign affairs minister Stephane Sejourne said Mr Netanyahu’s rejection of statehood is “worrying. There will be a need for a Palestinian state with security guarantees for all”.
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind?” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said of Israel. “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them off?”
In an interview with CNN late on Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said the kingdom will not normalise relations with Israel or contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction without a credible path to a Palestinian state. His comments were notable because before the war, the US had been trying to broker a landmark normalisation agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel.
The Palestinians seek a state including Gaza, the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Peace talks broke down nearly 15 years ago."
Q8DJFWP15X_SGFSYPBA2BD7JHT,"Suffering in Gaza is ‘unacceptable’, minister to tell UN",By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067590.suffering-gaza-unacceptable-minister-tell-un/,"A UK minister will warn at the United Nations that the situation in Gaza is “worsening daily” and suffering there is “unacceptable”.
Middle East minister Lord Ahmad travels to New York on Tuesday to restate the UK’s call for an immediate humanitarian pause in the conflict that would lead to a sustainable ceasefire.
It comes as global concern continues to grow about the situation in the Middle East.
The UK Government on Monday said it would continue with its support for a two-state solution in the Middle East for “as long as it takes” after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would “not compromise” on Tel Aviv control over Palestinian territories.
The peer will deliver the UK’s statement on the Middle East peace process at the UN Security Council’s open debate, set to be chaired by French foreign minister Stephane Sejourne.
Lord Ahmad will say the crisis in Gaza is “worsening daily, suffering is unacceptable, and our priority must be to alleviate it”, and that “an immediate pause is now necessary to get life-saving aid in, and hostages out”.
The Foreign Office minister will hold diplomatic talks with foreign minister of the Palestinian Authorities, Riyad Malki, as well as the foreign ministers of Algeria, Lebanon and Jordan.
He will also speak to the UN permanent representatives of Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
Lord Ahmad will say that the conflict “must not go on a moment longer than is necessary” and that “we need to work towards a sustainable ceasefire”.
He will add: “Peace remains the only way to end the tragedy and suffering that has engulfed Israelis and Palestinians once and for all.
“We must work together to make the vision for peace a living reality.”
The visit will also see the minister meet the leaders of aid organisations including Unicef and the International Committee of the Red Cross."
QAYME9N6W1_KBZ2KJMRWMYKZQY,Alabama executes man with nitrogen gas using new method for the first time,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075988.alabama-executes-man-nitrogen-gas-using-new-method-first-time/,"Alabama executed a convicted murderer with nitrogen gas on Thursday, putting him to death with a new method that once again put the US at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment.
The state said the method would be humane, but critics called it cruel and experimental.
Officials said Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25pm at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation.
It marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since lethal injection, now the most commonly used method, was introduced in 1982.
The execution took about 22 minutes, and Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes.
For at least two minutes, he appeared to shake and writhe on the gurney, sometimes pulling against the restraints. That was followed by several minutes of heavy breathing, until breathing was no longer perceptible.
In a final statement, Smith said: “Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards. … I’m leaving with love, peace and light.”
He made the “I love you sign” with his hands toward family members who were witnesses. “Thank you for supporting me. Love, love all of you,” Smith said.
The state had previously attempted to execute Smith, who was convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldn’t connect an IV line.
The execution came after a last-minute legal battle in which Smith’s attorneys contended the state was making him the test subject for an experimental execution method.
Federal courts rejected Smith’s bid to block it, with the latest ruling coming Thursday night from the US Supreme Court.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who along with two other liberal justices dissented, wrote: “Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before. The world is watching.”
The majority justices did not issue any statements.
In a statement issued before he was put to death, Smith and the reverend Jeff Hood, his spiritual adviser, said, “The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse. Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalise the suffocation of each other.”
The state had predicted the nitrogen gas would cause unconsciousness within seconds and death within minutes.
A state attorney told the 11th circuit court of appeals that it will be “the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.”
But some doctors and organisations have raised alarm, and Smith’s attorneys had asked the Supreme Court to halt the execution to review claims that the method violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserves more legal scrutiny before it is used on a person.
“There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person,” Smith’s attorneys wrote.
In her dissent, Ms Sotomayor wrote that Alabama has shrouded its execution protocol in secrecy, releasing only a heavily redacted version.
She also said Smith should be allowed to obtain evidence about the execution protocol and to proceed with his legal challenge.
“That information is important not only to Smith, who has an extra reason to fear the gurney, but to anyone the State seeks to execute after him using this novel method,” Ms Sotomayor wrote.
“Twice now this Court has ignored Smith’s warning that Alabama will subject him to an unconstitutional risk of pain,” Ms Sotomayor wrote. “I sincerely hope that he is not proven correct a second time.”
Justice Elena Kagan wrote a separate dissent and was joined by justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
In his final hours, Smith met family members and his spiritual adviser, according to a prison spokesman.
He ate a last meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Mr Hood said by telephone before the execution was carried out."
QIPBSXEKNG_W1C5T1U1TJRFIGD,Saudi Arabia ‘won’t recognise Israel without path to a Palestinian state’,By PA News Agency,_,20240122,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064988.saudi-arabia-wont-recognise-israel-without-path-palestinian-state/,"Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister has said the kingdom will not normalise relations with Israel or contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction without a credible pathway to a Palestinian state.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan’s remarks in an interview with CNN broadcast on Sunday were some of the most direct yet to come from Saudi officials on the Gaza conflict.
It puts the kingdom at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has rejected Palestinian statehood and described plans for open-ended military control over Gaza.
The dispute over Gaza’s future – coming as the war still rages with no end in sight – pits the United States and its Arab allies against Israel and poses a major obstacle to any plans for post-war governance or reconstruction in Gaza.
Before the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the war, the US had been trying to broker a landmark agreement in which Saudi Arabia would normalise relations with Israel in exchange for US security guarantees, aid in establishing a civilian nuclear programme in the kingdom, and progress toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In September, Mr Netanyahu had said Israel was “at the cusp” of such a deal, which he said would transform the Middle East.
In the interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS, the host asked the Saudi foreign minister: “Are you saying unequivocally that if there is not a credible and irreversible path to a Palestinian state, there will not be normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel?”
Prince Faisal replied: “That’s the only way we’re going to get a benefit. So, yes.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked if oil-rich Saudi Arabia would finance reconstruction in Gaza – where Israel’s air and ground offensive has devastated vast swathes of the impoverished territory – Prince Faisal gave a similar answer.
“As long as we’re able to find a pathway to a solution, a resolution, a pathway that means that we’re not going to be here again in a year or two, then we can talk about anything,” he said.
“But if we are just resetting to the status quo before October 7, in a way that sets us up for another round of this, as we have seen in the past, we’re not interested in that conversation.”
The Palestinians seek a state that would include Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital and the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people. It has built scores of settlements across both territories that are home to hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers. The last of several rounds of peace talks broke down nearly 15 years ago.
The current war between Israel and Hamas, the fifth and by far deadliest, began when Palestinian militants broke through Israel’s defences and rampaged through several nearby communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking around 250 people hostage and shattering Israelis’ sense of security.

Israel’s offensive has killed at least 25,105 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 60,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense residential areas.
Some 85% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, seeking elusive shelter in the south as Israel continues to strike all parts of the besieged enclave.
UN officials say one in four people in Gaza are starving as the ongoing fighting and Israeli restrictions hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid.
The war has also stoked tensions across the region, with Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israeli and US targets as the risk of a wider conflict grows.
Mr Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas and to return all of the remaining hostages after more than 100 were released in a cease-fire deal in November in exchange for scores of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
But Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether that outcome is possible.
Hamas is believed to be holding the hostages in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only successfully rescued one hostage, while Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli air strikes or during failed rescue operations.

On Monday, dozens of family members of the hostages stormed into a finance committee meeting in Israel’s Parliament, yelling: “You won’t sit here while they are dying there!”
Some had to be physically restrained as they shouted at the lawmakers, and at least one person was escorted out.
Moshe Gafni, the chair of the committee, said he understood their pain and called for a break from the meeting, which was in the process of approving budgets for communities near Gaza.
Families of the hostages, as well as other protesters, have set up a tent camp outside Mr Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem and vowed to remain until a deal is reached with Hamas to bring the rest of the hostages home. Other protests have called for new elections.
Hamas has said it will only free more captives in exchange for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu has ruled out such an agreement and says military pressure is key to securing the release of more hostages.
Mr Netanyahu, whose popularity has plummeted since October 7, faces pressure from the US – Israel’s top ally – to shift to more precise military operations, do more to facilitate humanitarian aid and embrace post-war plans with broad support across the region.
But Mr Netanyahu’s governing coalition is beholden to far-right parties that want to step up the offensive, encourage the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza, and re-establish Jewish settlements there."
R1KBWEN1YG_T14X65YXJKK1B55,Operation Obtundity: Anti-terror exercise at York Minster,By Harry Booth Reporter,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24067721.operation-obtundity-anti-terror-exercise-york-minster/,"HUNDREDS of people took part in the anti-terror exercise, Operation Obtundity, at York Minster last night.
Starting at 6pm on Monday, January 22, a combination of emergency services and police forces tested their joint response to a series of simulated terrorist incidents.
North Yorkshire's police, fire and rescue, and ambulance service joined counter terrorism police and York Minster police. The entire exercise was overseen by the national counter terrorism security office.
The operation came in response to the Manchester Arena enquiry, which concluded that venues such as York Minster should conduct reviews to understand the risk of terrorist attacks, and be able to take proportionate and reasonable measures against them.
Last night’s exercise had been planned months in advance, and was supported by City of York council and the city’s protect & prepare partnership group.

Strategic exercise lead for North Yorkshire Police, Chief Inspector Mick Roffe said: ""This was a great opportunity for the emergency services to take part in an exercise along with the Minster Police.
""The evening provided an opportunity to test our joint working in dealing with a no-notice violent attack.""
It took place on a Monday evening in January in hopes that it would reduce the impact on local businesses, residents and visitors in York.
Scenarios included in the attack were: hostile vehicle and acid attacks, as well as a siege within the Minster. Almost 300 volunteers took part, playing hostages and casualties.
Volunteers for the exercise came from Wakefield College, the ready for anything group, the York rescue boat, the University of York, North Yorkshire Police (including cadets), and the North Yorkshire volunteers.

York Minster's Chief Operating Officer, David Colthup said: ""We take seriously our responsibility, and work very hard, to ensure that those who visit and worship at York Minster feel safe and will be safe.
""We are really grateful for the patience of all our neighbours – residents and businesses – for any disruption they may have experienced during the exercise. I hope they feel reassured that we are better prepared to deal with every eventuality.""
North Yorkshire Fire & Rescue lead on the exercise, Tony Peel said: ""Being part of an exercise in such an iconic location within the city and county has been a great experience for all those involved. The support of City of York Council is appreciated.""
Owen Hayward, head of emergency preparedness, resilience and response (EPRR) and special operations at Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: ""This exercise has provided a great opportunity for emergency service colleagues to come together, and we have taken away valuable learning that we can use to refine our processes and approaches to the many challenging scenarios we may be faced with."""

Popular fashion store Peacocks will move into 6 Fishergate, Ripon on February 28 after M&Co announced widespread UK closures, including in Ripon, in February last year.
Peacocks is looking for staff at the new store - which will move next to Costa and down the same street as Boots and Specsavers.
This new store announcement comes almost three years after Peacocks was saved from collapse - with around 2,000 jobs saved nationally.
At the time of the proposed collapse, Peacocks had 400 stores, but with issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, it struggled and has closed several of its shops already.
As for M&Co, the brand announced the closure of all its 170 stores after it went into administration for a second time at the end of 2022."

The Prime Minister said he would not have put powers to ignore the court in the Rwanda legislation going through Parliament unless he was willing to use them.
The Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill states that it is up to ministers to decide whether or not to comply with interim rulings issued by judges in the human rights court.
The British people should decide who gets to come to this country – not criminal gangs or foreign courts.
That’s what this Bill delivers.
We will now work to make it law so that we can get flights going to Rwanda and stop the boats.
— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) December 12, 2023
But the Strasbourg court’s president, Siofra O’Leary, said “there is a clear legal obligation” under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for states to abide by the so-called Rule 39 interim measures.
The Prime Minister told broadcasters the Rwanda scheme was needed as a  deterrent to stop people crossing the English Channel in small boats.
“I’ve been very clear, I won’t let a foreign court stop us from getting flights up and running and establishing that deterrent,” he said.
“The Bill that we’ve just passed through the House of Commons has a specific power in it that says ministers will get to make those decisions, I would not have put that power in there if I wasn’t prepared to use it.”
A Rule 39 measure – branded a “pyjama injunction” by critics because it can be issued outside normal court hours – contributed to the 2022 grounding of the first flight intended to take asylum seekers to Rwanda under the Government’s controversial scheme.
The new legislation which is due to be considered in the Lords next week seeks to address the legal challenges which have dogged the scheme and gives ministers the power to ignore the emergency injunctions.
But Ms O’Leary told a press conference: “There is a clear legal obligation under the Convention for states to comply with Rule 39 measures.“
She said the interim measures are only issued “in exceptional circumstances where there is a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm”.
Countries which have failed to comply with Rule 39 indications have previously been found to have violated obligations under Article 34 of the ECHR, which gives the right for individuals to apply to the court once domestic legal routes have been exhausted.
Senior judge Ms O’Leary said the UK “has always complied with Rule 39 measures”, except in one very particular case, and has “publicly declared the need for other states to comply with Rule 39 indications” – including urging Vladimir Putin’s Russia to abide by a 2021 measure in relation to the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
The Strasbourg court president would not be drawn on the Safety of Rwanda Bill while it goes through the parliamentary process.
But she said: “I know there’s a very healthy debate in the United Kingdom relating to the content of the Bill.
“It’s a country which is blessed with many, many international legal experts and a very active civil society. So I am sure that all of those issues can be fully examined.”
In the Rwanda case in June 2022, the interim measure blocking an Iraqi asylum seeker being sent to the African state was granted just hours before the flight was due to take off.
Ms O’Leary said Rule 39 measures are almost always sought in “situations of urgency, if not extreme urgency, and the nature of the urgency or the degree of urgency is something which respondent governments control”.
The interim injunction powers are rarely used – in 2023 13 requests were refused, and just one interim measure was granted.
The Rule 39 process is currently being reformed and since December 2023 the duty judge issuing an interim measure will be identified, addressing one of the criticisms of the situation in the Rwanda case.
Downing Street claimed the legislation going through Parliament would mean that the Strasbourg court would not need to get involved in any future deportation flights.
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said:  “We are confident our legislation is compliant with our international obligations. We’re clear the Bill and the treaty address the Supreme Court’s concerns. There should be no need for Strasbourg to intervene to block flights in the way they did in 2022.
“We’ve also drafted the Bill to give ministers the power not to comply with those rulings if necessary. And obviously every case is assessed on its individual facts, but the Prime Minister has been clear repeatedly that we will not let a foreign court block flights from taking off.”
The spokesman added: “I think it would be bizarre to draw any comparison between Russia’s cruel treatment of Alexei Navalny, who was a victim of an attempted assassination attempt, and our plan to protect and deter vulnerable migrants from making perilous crossings across the Channel.”
Meanwhile, the head of the United Nations’ refugee agency also criticised the Government’s approach.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told the BBC that some countries with “more resources” were devising “systems with which they would abdicate responsibilities they have to asylum seekers and shift these responsibilities to other states”.
“This is contrary to the basic principles of refugee protection,” he said."
R91GHSLN53_ZVPDRQMMSVV3HP2,Statement of Administrator’s Proposals issued on York Cocoa House LTD,By Darren Greenwood Business Editor,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24059520.statement-administrators-proposals-issued-york-cocoa-house-ltd/,"A well-known York business owed more than £1.2million before it was bought for £60,000 in a pre-pack administration deal.
The financial details of the former York Cocoa House Ltd are revealed in a 36-page Statement of Administrator's Proposals, published a week ago on the Companies House website.
The 'proposals' act as a kind of interim report on the administration of the business and its financial figures are subject to revision when further details emerge.
York Cocoa House Ltd, which is based in Castlegate, in York City Centre and trades as York Cocoa Works, went into administration in November.
READ MORE:
The business, founded by Sophie Jewett in 2011, makes and sells chocolate, has a chocolate-focussed cafe and also runs chocolate making workshops. Orginally in Blake Street it moved to moved to Castlegate in 2018.
As the Press recently reported, the venture was bought by YCW Trading, also of Castlegate. Its sole director is 57-year-old Bermudian, finance director Mark Turner, a UK resident.
In his report, Administrator Frazer Ulrick of Auker Rhodes Accounting recalls how the business was incorporated in 2011. In 2019, HMRC issued a Winding Up petition and the company entered a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) in February 2020.
However, the report continued, the pandemic ""impacted severely"" on the firm's ability to trade in line with forecasts and the holding costs of keeping the business trading were ""too significant to carry forward whilst fulfilling the CVA's obligations.""
The company built-up further liabilities with HMRC in respect of tax and VAT and ""struggled to keep up with its contributions"" in line with the CVA.
By the summer of 2023 it was clear the company could not successfully conclude the CVA and possible administration and liquidation were discussed.
""The business had already been visited by its electricity provider and was under imminent threat of being cut off due to accumulating charges. HMRC had also indicated it was considering issuing a winding up petition against the company,"" the report continued.
BPI Asset Advisory were then appointed to value company assets, who then marketed them ""on an accelerated basis to avoid closure"". The fortnight-long process saw 13 expressions of interest and one offer.
The report says liquidation would have been problematic as it would be costly to implement. Had the company being wound up, there would be little prospect of any return to creditors. Only a pre-pack sale could deliver any return to creditors. A pre-pack sale is one that is agreed before a business formally enters administration.
The Cocoa House directors have yet to produce a 'Statement of Affairs' but the administrator said he identifies liabilities, or debts, of £1,242,465.
They include unsecured trade and expense creditors, including subcontractors and suppliers, owed approximately £317, 547. There are also loans to the company from directors totalling £416,839.
A list of 40 creditors includes City of York Council (owed £44,000), Evora Construction (£98,349), Evershot Construction (£25,585), Ms Sophie Jewett (£129,934), Mark Lister (£202,684), Michelle Proctor (£80,000) and Saugu of Bogota, Columbia (£2,038).
The report said the administrator was unaware of any secured creditors or primary preferential creditors. HMRC was a secondary preferential creditor, with a claim of £508,076 in VAT, PAYE and National Insurance, in pre and post CVA liabilities.
""It is anticipated a dividend will be paid to HMRC,"" it continued.
However, there were ""insufficient realisations"" for a distribution of any remaining assets to non-preferential creditors.
An estimated 'Statement of Affairs' lists assets of £60,000, the same as YCW Trading paid for the business.
The report added YCW's offer was 'disappointing' but this was 'significantly higher' than if the assets were sold at auction."
RKWDDGEKBT_9O2TG40YFNOGY8Z,Probe into ending of Salvation Army's rough sleeper contract,By Stephen Lewis StephenLewisYrk Reporter/Community Content Reporter,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24066947.probe-ending-salvation-armys-rough-sleeper-contract/,"The way the city council terminated the Salvation Army’s rough sleepers contract in York is to be formally reviewed.
And The Press understands that the review will look not only at the controversial circumstances under which the contract was abruptly ended last September – but also at the ‘challenging’ conditions under which it operated as long ago as early 2022.
The council announced last September that it would not be extending the Salvation Army’s £95,000-a-year contract to deliver rough sleeping services in York when it expired on September 30.
Instead, the authority said it would be using £260,000 of extra government funding over the next two years to expand its own rough sleepers service under a new homelessness strategy.
But the announcement was made so abruptly that the Salvation Army itself only learned that the contract was not to be extended in a call from The Press.
To make matters worse, an attempt to grant the charity a one-month contract extension to allow for a transition period came to nothing – because the council sent the contract out too late.
It later emerged that no rough sleepers had been consulted over the decision.

Rough sleepers that The Press spoke to were universal in their condemnation.
One told The Press that it was always the Salvation Army that people living on the street turned to for help.
The 45-year-old said he wouldn't be alive but for the charity’s help. ""I would have drunk myself to death,"" he said.
Now the way the contract was terminated is to be looked into by members of the city council’s Audit and Governance Committee.
READ MORE:
A report will be submitted to the committee next month, following a request by Cllr Danny Myers, the Labour chair of the council’s health, housing and adult social care committee.
Cllr Myers wrote to the chair of the audit and governance committee, Liberal Democrat Cllr Andrew Hollyer, saying his committee members had ‘concerns’.
“At our meeting we heard from both the Salvation Army and the council that the contract and communication has been poorly handled … with a lack of communication between stakeholders about the contract and likely extensions, renewals or expiration,” Cllr Myers wrote.
“We further heard that a one-month or potential two-month extension to the contract was delivered to the Salvation Army by the council with just five minutes to go before close-of-play on the Friday when the original six month extension was due to expire. The Salvation Army said at our meeting that there was no way they could get it signed.”
Cllr Andrew Hollyer, the Lib Dem chair of the Audit and Governance Committee, has confirmed that the report will be submitted to his committee on February 28.
And The Press understands that the report will focus not just on what happened last year, but also the year before.
A council email seen by the Press says: “Relations were best considered as ‘challenging’ as far back as early 2022.”
The Salvation Army continues to run a rough sleepers programme without council funding. The council’s own new rough sleepers strategy - which the authority says aims to put an end to rough sleeping in York within the lifetime of this Labour administration - is still being drafted.
In early September last year,  The Press reported how members of the Salvation Army's early intervention team were out at 5am five days a week, checking on people sleeping rough on the city’s streets to ensure they were OK, and directing them towards help or a hot meal.
The charity also ran a regular drop-in service for rough sleepers at its base in Lawrence Street.
For years, this 'early intervention programme' had been funded through a £95,000-a-year contract with the city council.
That contract was abruptly terminated at the end of September, when the council announced it would not be renewing the Salvation Army's funding. Since then, the charity has paid the wages of its York early intervention staff itself.
It later emerged that the question of whether the Salvation Army contract should be renewed had been up for discussion within the council for some time - under both the Labour and the previous Liberal Democrat/ Green administrations.
The most recent full extension of the contract was in early 2022.
Then, in March 2023, the then Lib Dem/ Green administration approved a further stop-gap six month contract extension.
By the time that contract extension came to an end in September last year, Labour had swept to power in York  - and it was the new Labour administration that took the decision not to renew it further. it is still not entirely clear why.
The city council's report on what happened will look all the way back to the granting of the most recent full extension in early 2022 - and also at the way the final ending of the contract in September last year was handled."

The two nations have been negotiating for the last two years after Britain left the European Union, with trade continuing under the same deal originally brokered when the UK was a member of the bloc.
A UK Government spokesperson said: “We have always said we will only negotiate trade deals that deliver for the British people.
“And we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made.
“We remain open to restarting talks with Canada in the future to build a stronger trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”
The previous agreement had allowed the UK to continue to sell cars and cheese in the North American nation without Canada charging import tax.
Once again the Conservatives would rather Canada roll over during negotiations instead of standing up for Canadians.

However, Canada’s government has been facing pressure from the beef industry and domestic cheesemakers.
The UK had been trading with Canada on terms that largely replicated the arrangements in place from the UK’s time in the EU.
Negotiations began on a new agreement in March 2022.
A UK Government source said Canada appeared to have “lost sight of the bigger picture – the British and Canadian businesses who do £26 billion worth of trade a year and the people they employ”.
The source added: “If Canada come back to table with a serious offer and desire to make progress we’re all ears, but in the meantime we’re going to focus on other trade deals that deliver for UK businesses.”
A spokeswoman for Canada’s trade minister, Mary Ng, told the BBC she was “disappointed” at the cessation of talks and had said as much to Kemi Badenoch, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade.
Ms Ng’s spokeswoman added: “Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.”
Ms Ng added on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the Canadian “government will never agree to a deal that isn’t good for our workers, farmers and businesses”.
Minette Batters, president of the Nation Farmers’ Union of England and Wales, praised the Government for having “stuck to its line and not given way”.
She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it was essential that hormone-treated beef is not allowed into the country.
“It is a relief for farmers. This has been going on for a long time and it is about enhancing the trading relationship between the UK and Canada.
“Trade on agricultural products is always the first thing to be discussed and the last thing to be agreed. I am pleased the Government has stuck to its line and not given way,” she said.
Ms Batters added: “Canada has played hardball for a long time. It was always going to come to a crunch point as to who was going to capitulate.”
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said ministers should have made a statement to MPs about the halt in trade talks.
He told the Commons: “I will say it is amazing how quickly the Government come to give good news. I just hope that they might reflect on briefing out overnight. As I say, I always believe this House should hear it first.”"
RWI26UCCC6_PRLG4Z1SIL0MSAK,Deadly attack on Israeli army in Gaza kills at least 21 soldiers,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067619.deadly-attack-israeli-army-gaza-kills-least-21-soldiers/,"Twenty-one soldiers have been killed in the Gaza Strip in the deadliest attack on Israel’s forces since the October 7 Hamas raid that triggered the war, the military has said.
Hours later, the military announced that ground forces had encircled the southern city of Khan Younis, Gaza’s second largest, where dozens of Palestinians have been killed and wounded in heavy fighting in recent days.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu mourned the soldiers but vowed to press ahead with the offensive until “absolute victory” over Hamas was achieved.
He has also promised to return over 100 hostages held captive in Gaza. But Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it is possible to do either, and large numbers of Israeli casualties have pressured Israel’s government to halt past military operations.
The attack is a major setback that could add to mounting calls for a ceasefire.
A senior Egyptian official said Israel had proposed a two-month ceasefire in which the hostages would be freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and top Hamas leaders in Gaza would be allowed to relocate to other countries.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hamas rejected the proposal and was insisting that no more hostages would be released until Israel ended its offensive and withdrew from Gaza. Israel’s government declined to comment on the talks.
The official said Egypt and Qatar, who have brokered past agreements between Israel and Hamas, were developing a multistage proposal to try and bridge the gaps.
On Monday, Israeli reservists were preparing explosives to demolish two buildings in central Gaza when a militant fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a tank nearby. The blast triggered the explosives, causing both two-storey buildings to collapse on the soldiers inside.
At least 217 soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began in late October, including three killed in a separate event on Monday, according to the military.
Mr Netanyahu acknowledged it was “one of the hardest days” since the war began and said the military would launch an investigation.
“In the name of our heroes, and for our own lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory,” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Families of the hostages and many of their supporters have called for Israel to reach a ceasefire deal, saying that time is running out to bring the hostages home alive.
On Monday, dozens of hostages’ relatives stormed a parliamentary committee meeting, demanding a deal to win their loved ones’ release.
Israel launched its offensive after Hamas crossed the border October 7, killed over 1,200 people and abducted some 250 others.
More than 100 were released in November in exchange for a week-long ceasefire and the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
The offensive has caused widespread destruction, displaced an estimated 85% of Gaza’s population and left over 25,000 Palestinians dead, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory.
The United Nations and international aid agencies say the fighting has caused a humanitarian disaster, with a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people facing starvation.
The war has heightened regional tensions, with Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen attacking United States and Israeli targets in support of Palestinians.
The US and Britain launched another wave of strikes on Monday against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have targeted international shipping in the Red Sea in what they portray as a blockade of Israel.
Meanwhile, Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said it had fired rockets at a strategic military installation in northern Israel for a second time this month."

Michael Murphy appeared by video link at the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry on Wednesday from HMP Edinburgh, where he serving a sentence for physically and sexually abusing children while he was a social worker with the De La Salle Brothers in Gartmore, Stirlingshire, and St Joseph’s in Tranent, East Lothian, between 1961 and 1991.
Murphy continued to deny he was responsible for abusing boys in his care while he was working at the establishment, and described those who had brought allegations, resulting in convictions in 2003, 2016 and 2021, as “characters” who were motivated to complain for “financial gain”.
The former monk became a member of the De La Salle brothers in 1956 and was posted to St Ninian’s School in Gartmore in 1961.
Murphy was asked by lead counsel to the inquiry, Colin MacAulay KC, how he felt about the allegations.
Murphy said: “All of these characters and complainers, they are unhinged … and I think they need to be checked out by the police and need to be investigated about all of these lies they have told.”
During Wednesday’s evidence, the inquiry heard Murphy had been convicted of 54 charges of physical and sexual abuse, including incidents where he would hit boys on the bottom with an implement made of three 16in shoe laces if they were misbehaving, and that he administered electric shocks to boys using a small generator he called “the tickler”.
The inquiry also heard about an incident where Murphy assaulted a boy so badly, he broke his arm and had to be taken to hospital.
Murphy downplayed the incident and attempted to place blame on the child, saying the youngster had “abused” him because of his “footwear” and described it as a “misunderstanding”.
He said: “I had a misunderstanding with a boy about my footwear and my bad foot.
“I gave him an arm twist. I twisted his arm.
“That’s all.”
Lead counsel to the inquiry Colin MacAulay KC put it to Murphy that the child sustained a broken arm as a consequence.
Murphy said: “He fractured a wee bone on his arm.”
He was later asked about administering electric shocks to children, with one incident causing burns to a boy’s hand.
Murphy continued to insist he was not administering shocks and said the sensation went along the muscle of the hands and that the complainer was “telling lies”.
Mr MacAulay asked Murphy if he had ever administered a shock through the testicles.
Murphy denied he had and said his convictions were “false”.
He said he had been entrusted with the care of around 90 children on his own, with very little training in how to look after them.
When asked to explain why so many people came forward regarding Murphy’s treatment of the children, he said there had been “collusion”.
Mr MacAulay asked Murphy: “Why are they picking on you?”
Murphy responded: “I have already said it is because I am the only one alive today.
“It is all about compensation.”
Meanwhile, the inquiry also heard from a teacher at St Joseph’s between 1978 and 1994, known simply as William, who was accused of hitting boys with blackboard dusters and making them sniff ammonia as forms of discipline.
William told the inquiry he used blackboard dusters to tackle “classroom nonsense” and said the boys would often throw the dusters back at him.
He insisted he did not use physical punishment and witnessed it at the school only once when a boy had taken off the handbrake on a minibus.
When asked about boys being made to smell ammonia, he said he had been talking about “smelling salts” and told the boys he could let them smell ammonia.
He said the accusations of abuse towards the boys were “upsetting” because he believed he had “always got on well” with them and had spent much of his career working with children who had social, behavioural and emotional difficulties.
William has not been convicted of any offences related to the allegations.
Later on Wednesday, a social worker denied accusations of abuse against him when he worked in residential care and said no behaviour he would categorise as abuse took place.
No criminal complaints have been made against the man, who gave evidence to the inquiry under the pseudonym Dominic.
He worked at institutions run by the De La Salle brothers during the 1980s.
Dominic had been accused of hitting boys and looking at them inappropriately while they were changing.
He strenuously denied the accusations put to him at the inquiry.
He said he had never witnessed any physical punishment towards the children in his care, and he described St Joseph’s as a “remarkable” place that was “quite progressive” with an approach that would be described as “restorative” nowadays.
Dominic also discussed Murphy’s electric generator and the sensation it gave as “underwhelming”.
He was asked by Mr MacAulay if he had ever seen any abuse at St Joseph’s during his time there.
He said: “I honestly did not think I saw behaviour with any kid that I would consider to be abusive.”
In 2017, the De La Salle Brothers used the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry to apologise to victims who had suffered abuse within their care.
The spokesman for the De La Salle Brothers, David Anderson, said nothing could be said to defend the mistreatment of children.
“Where a brother at any of these schools was responsible for the mistreatment of a child or young adult entrusted to the congregation’s care, the congregation offers an unreserved apology,” he said at the time.
The inquiry, before Lady Smith, continues."

Storm Jocelyn has been named by the Irish weather service Met Éireann after Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell, an astrophysicist who discovered the first pulsating radio stars, or pulsars, in 1967.
As York braces for the remainder of Storm Jocelyn there are three flood warnings in place in York as river levels continue to rise.

Meanwhile, the real Dame Jocelyn returned to her former school in York in 2022 to speak to pupils on International Women's Day.
Jocelyn Bell Burnell with pupils at The Mount in 2022
She spoke to pupils at The Mount School in York and said she would love to see young girls being given more opportunities to play with STEM-inspiring toys and encouraged to take leadership roles.
Professor Bell Burnell's comments came in answer to questions posed during a live, in-person Q&A in celebration of International Women’s Day, hosted by The Mount and attended by pupils from Queen Mary’s School and Terrington Hall.
Each school had prepared a short list of questions for Professor Bell Burnell, which were read out and answered in turn, before the hosting panel College Leaders opened the floor for general questions.
Professor Bell Burnell, who is a former pupil of The Mount School, explained how she strives “to be a voice for women, particularly younger women.”
She said: “As you get older you can be more outrageous and be more blunt. Sometimes you need people to say, ‘no that’s not right’ - it tends to be useful for older women to say that.”
She went on to speak candidly about her experiences of being a woman in STEM, including smashing stereotypes at university, being overlooked for the Nobel Prize for Physics, moving to different locations as a result of her husband’s career, her Quaker faith and being the second-only woman to be awarded the Copley medal, which began in 1731.
After the Q&A, professor Bell Burnell chatted with staff and pupils from the three schools, enjoyed a guided tour of her alma mater with A-Level and GCSE physics pupils, and a delicious lunch with Year 10 pupils and the STEM department.
The Mount’s Principal, David Griffiths, said: “Jocelyn was kind, humble and approachable and she left having inspired all those who listened to her talk and spent time with her subsequently.”

Shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said it is a “national scandal” that so many children are not in school, adding that approximately one in five youngsters were “persistently absent” across the autumn and spring terms last year.
An Opposition motion sought to ensure the Commons considered their Children Not in School (National Register and Support) Bill on February 7.
The Bill would have established a mandatory duty on local authorities in England to maintain a register of eligible children not in school.
But MPs voted 303 to 189, majority 114, against the motion.
Ms Phillipson told the debate: “It is a national scandal that every day, every week, so many children are not in school. Absence from school is not simply a problem in itself, it is a symptom of deeper problems and a cause of further problems.”
Addressing the absence of children from school, she said: “This failure by the Government to address the most serious and urgent barrier to learning in our schools – that children are not there – it exemplifies a broader failing and tells a wider story.”
She added: “Across the autumn and spring terms last year, over 1.5 million children were persistently absent from school. That is roughly speaking one in five children – more than double the number who were absent during the same terms five years ago.
“If that rise goes on, then the number of children persistently absent will rise to more than two million in 2025/26. One in four children missing at least a day each fortnight. It’s a disaster.”
Education minister Damian Hinds said the Government had cut school absence between 2010 and the start of the pandemic, telling the Commons: “Attendance levels improved significantly with absence falling from 6% in 2010 to 4.8%, representing 15 million more days in school.
“And persistent absence, that was 16% in 2010, came down by almost a third by 2015 and stayed around that level up until the pandemic.”
He said increases in absence since the pandemic is something “many educations systems are dealing with”, adding: “That is true in jurisdictions far beyond these shores, it is also true in all of England, Scotland and Labour-run Wales, where, by the way, the increase in absence is from a considerably higher starting point to a considerably higher current point than in England.”
He said Labour’s motion contained a “conflation” between the issue of absence and home education, saying if Labour believes the two are the same then they have “failed to grasp this issue”.
“We do think it is important for local authorities to have a register,” he said, adding the Government has recently completed a consultation on the elective home education to inform new guidance.
The minister also highlighted Conservative MP Flick Drummond’s (Meon Valley) proposed Children Not In School (Register) Bill, and said the Government is looking forward to working with his Tory colleague on the Private Members’ Bill as she seeks for it to progress.
Conservative former minister Vicky Ford said Labour should look at the proposals being moved via the Private Members’ Bill’s process, as she highlighted her move to place attendance guidance for schools on a statutory footing.
Steve Double, Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, welcomed assurances from the Government that it supports the right of parents to home educate their children and said many do so for positive reasons.
But Mr Double added: “Regrettably many parents now find themselves having to home educate their children, not because that’s what they believe is right for their children but because they feel forced into that situation because they can’t find the right school environment and support available for their children, who may have particular challenges – whether that is autism or perhaps a mental health condition.”
Mr Double said attendance targets are driving the issue, blaming the “overbearing and heavy-handed approach that many schools are taking”."
SPYGHMW7JT_QJA6XAZOMODUF8U,Jury begins deliberations in defamation case after Trump walks out,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24078590.jury-begins-deliberations-defamation-case-trump-walks/,"A jury began deliberations on Friday in the defamation trial against former president Donald Trump, deciding whether he owes writer E Jean Carroll additional millions after a jury last year concluded that he sexually abused her in 1996.
The jury, which is anonymous, began its work after closing arguments punctuated by Mr Trump’s dramatic exit from the courtroom as one of Ms Carroll’s lawyers spoke.
He later returned as his lawyer defended him over statements he made while president in June 2019, and he remained until deliberations began.
Ms Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, asked jurors to award 24 million US dollars (£18.8 million) in compensatory damages and much more in punitive damages.
Mr Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, said Mr Trump told the truth when he refuted her claims.
She said Ms Carroll’s association with Mr Trump had given her the fame she craved and that death threats she received cannot be blamed on his remarks.
The jury, consisting of seven men and two women, is only deciding damages because it has been told to accept as true the findings of another jury that last May awarded Carroll 5.0 million dollars (£3.93 million) after concluding Mr Trump sexually abused Ms Carroll in the changing room of a luxury Manhattan department store.
It also found that he defamed her in 2022 by claiming she made up the allegation to sell a memoir.
The current jury is deciding what damages, if any, Mr Trump owes for two statements he made in June 2019 while he was president after Ms Carroll made her accusation.
Rather than turn away from the allegation, Mr Trump has used the trial to fund-raise for his presidential campaign, telling supporters in a social media post: “They aren’t after me. They’re after you, I’m just in the way.”
Ms Kaplan was only a few minutes into a closing that lasted more than an hour in Manhattan federal court on Friday when Mr Trump suddenly rose from his seat at the defence table and walked toward the exit, pausing to scan the packed courtroom as members of the Secret Service leaped up to follow him out.
The unexpected departure prompted Judge Lewis A Kaplan, who is unrelated to Ms Carroll’s lawyer, to speak up, briefly interrupting the closing argument to note: “The record will reflect that Mr. Trump just rose and walked out of the courtroom.”
The walkout came only minutes after the judge, without the jury present, threatened to send Ms Habba to jail for continuing to talk when he told her to stop.
“You are on the verge of spending some time in the lock-up. Now sit down,” the judge told Ms Habba, who immediately complied.
Later, Mr Trump returned to the courtroom to hear Ms Habba argue that he should not be made to pay Carroll for comments that set off hate messages from strangers.
The final remarks from the lawyers come a day after Mr Trump managed to sneak past a federal judge’s rules severely limiting what he could say during his turn on the witness stand, which wound up lasting just three minutes.
He left fuming that he had not been given an opportunity to refute Carroll’s sexual abuse accusations.
During her closing, Ms Kaplan told jurors that the current case was not about a sexual assault.
“We had that case,” she said, referencing the first trial. “That’s why Donald Trump’s testimony was so short yesterday. He doesn’t get a do-over this time.”"

The items will be sold in the 20th Century Design Sale at Tennants Auctioneers in Leyburn on March 2.
Thompson, who died in 1955, was a British furniture maker. He was born and lived in Kilburn, North Yorkshire, where he set up a business manufacturing oak furniture, which featured a carved mouse on almost every piece.
Tennants’ 20th Century Design Specialist Diane Sinnott said the items were drawn from several private collections, many of the pieces are sold with excellent provenance, and all date from the 1920s and 1930s.
She said: “We have been very privileged at Tennants to sell some wonderful pieces of Mouseman furniture over the years, but we have never had a sale with so many important early pieces with such excellent provenance. This really is an exceptional auction”.
""A fine group of bedroom furniture made for Kate Elwell, who was Robert Thompson’s secretary for several years, is led by an English Oak Tall Double Wardrobe, an unusually small English Oak Wardrobe , and an English Oak 3ft Bedstead. Also for sale are two fenders. In addition to her secretarial work, Kate helped paint any polychromed pieces that were commissioned, and she continued to work at the Mouseman workshop in Kilburn until she married in 1938.
Diane added: ""Being sold from a deceased estate are two lots which were given by American businessman Paul Herrick Kelly to his son Captain Philip Paul Kelly on the occasion of his marriage to Mary Haselwood Porter in 1932. The lots comprise an English Oak Partner’s Desk, and an English Oak Monk’s Chair, made circa 1929 and bearing the Ampleforth Abbey coat-of-arms on gridiron panels Captain Philip Kelly, who attended Ampleforth College between 1919 and 1923, died in Myanmar during the Second World War having been mentioned in dispatches.
""From a further Private Collection is an elaborately carved English Oak Blanket Chest, made in 1928 for John and Kathleen Brunton to celebrate their marriage.The chest is based on a 16th century example held in the collection of the V&A, and which was illustrated in Robert Thompson’s copy of Early English Furniture and Woodwork, a 1922 publication by Crescinsky and Gribble. Robert annotated the page next to the illustration with notes and working drawings, and the book is still in the possession of the Thomson family at Kilburn.
A set of unique child’s nursery furniture is also on offer, which was commissioned by the Thompson-Schwab family of Kingfield House, Penton, Carlisle before later being purchased by the current vendor.
From the Collection of a North Yorkshire gentleman are two English Oak Monk’s Chairs, made for the Horlicks family of Berkshire. The Horlicks’ outfitted both their boardroom and their private house with Mouseman furniture, and the present lots were purchased directly from the family some years ago. Each chair is carved with monks’ heads and Yorkshire roses, with a carved ‘H’ to the back panel.
The sale will also offer a further 80 lots of Mouseman furniture and furnishings dating from the 1940s onwards.
A fully illustrated catalogue will be available on our website leading up to the sale.

T7S0JZ817L_CBAHCFWVIW85COY,York MP Rachael Maskell quizzes minister about NHS dentists,By Stephen Lewis StephenLewisYrk Reporter/Community Content Reporter,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24068798.york-mp-rachael-maskell-quizzes-minister-nhs-dentists/,"YORK Central MP Rachael Maskell has demanded in Parliament that ministers say WHEN they will come forward with promised plans to help NHS dentistry recover from the pandemic.
Labour MP Ms Maskell was speaking in the House of Commons this morning as it was revealed that yet another York dental practice is to close its doors to adult NHS patients.
Ms Maskell told the Commons that a plan to help NHS dentistry had long been planned but never delivered by ministers.
She said: “We were promised before the summer, we were promised after the summer, we were promised before Christmas, we were promised soon, and now we have been promised shortly. The reality is that our benches have got a plan and the Government have not got a plan.”
The MP said her constituents had “nowhere to go” to register with an NHS dentist, with practices handing back their contracts.
She added: “What is the minister going to do to ensure my constituents can access NHS dentistry?”
Health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom replied: “I absolutely understand the challenge for some people. The situation has improved over the last year.
“Since the Covid pandemic, where almost every dentist had to stop working altogether, we have not seen the recovery we want to see and we are putting in plans, not a paper ambition like the members opposite have put forward, but some really significant reforms that will enable many more people to be seen by NHS dentists.”"

This is a particularly troubling development, given that Drax is not the sustainable, ‘renewable’ energy business it advertises.
More than six million tonnes of imported wood was burned at Drax power station in 2022. Outdated rules allow Drax to claim the carbon emissions from burning this wood can be ignored, a practice scientists have repeatedly criticised and that their own advisors have told them to stop.
It is hard to find evidence that Drax can deliver on the promise of capturing some of its emissions in future decades; even if it does it will be too little, too late and wouldn’t address the harms caused by industrial-scale tree burning.
More and more people support ending the huge bill-payer funded subsidies companies like Drax receive for their highly polluting and destructive operations.
As the Government is currently consulting on whether to continue these payments, now is a great time to tell them that genuine renewables and energy efficiency are much better investments in a sustainable, resilient, and low-cost energy future.

Speaking as, I believe, a normal everyday person, I ask Christian Vassie - would you do us normal people the courtesy of letting us have a mind of our own?
The equine industry measures horses in hands, sells in guineas, rides over miles, furlongs and yards. The marine industry uses fathoms, knots and cables, the brewing industry imperial units (ie gallons, ferkins, tuns).

The suspect was also charged with arson and was ordered to be kept in police custody until a bail hearing next month.
He faces a possible sentence of life in prison. South Africa has no death penalty.
Prosecutors said the suspect, Sithembiso Lawrence Mdlalose, made a written confession.
Mdlalose was arrested on Tuesday after making a startling claim at a separate inquiry that he was responsible for the fire at a downtown Johannesburg apartment complex in August 2023 that killed 76 people and injured dozens of others.
He told the inquiry that he set the fire while trying to hide the body of a man he had killed in the basement of the building.
He said he had strangled the man and then poured gasoline over his body and set it alight.
The fire ripped through the five-storey building in the predawn hours of August 31.
Prosecutors said Mdlalose’s apparent confession at the inquiry could not be used in his trial because the ongoing inquiry is not a criminal proceeding.
They said he had since made a written confession in front of a judge."

Lily-Rae Merchant-O’Hanlon, 11, from Nottingham, was diagnosed last December with Stargardt disease, an inherited eye condition which causes blurriness in the central part of the eye.
Her mother, Emma Merchant, set up a GoFundMe to help Lily-Rae see the Northern Lights for the first time before her eye condition, which affects one in 10,000 people according to the Macular Society, worsens.
The pair were overwhelmed to see a £5,000 donation and a personal message from Titanic star Winslet.
Lily-Rae told the PA news agency: “We were shocked. We were both in tears.”
Ms Merchant, 45, an executive assistant and DJ, added she was overwhelmed and said the personal message from Winslet was “so special”.
She told PA: “We’re very overwhelmed. The donations we’ve had have been absolutely appreciated.”
“To have somebody such as Kate Winslet… I cannot explain how much I respect that woman as an actress, let alone now as an individual as a human being, to be so generous.
“She sent a lovely message as well. To have made so personal was just so special.”
On GoFundMe, Winslet wrote: “Wishing Lily-Rae some magical adventures so she can make many special memories to treasure! With lots of Love, Kate Winslet and family.”
Ms Merchant created the fundraiser to allow Lily-Rae to have new experiences and see new places before her eye condition deteriorates further.
The mother and daughter created a list of things they want to experience including a safari because of Lily-Rae’s love of cats, but said seeing the Northern Lights was at the “top of the list”.
“I would say this (fundraiser) is important for us because then I can see the world before my vision goes and my mum can also experience with me and I can just have mental memories and also muscle memories of all the different experiences,” Lily-Rae explained.
Ms Merchant added: “It means the world because I can’t do this on my own.
“For me, it’s the timescale, it’s the ‘how long have we got?’, so let’s see what we can do. I said to her, ‘I’ll do anything to get you to see the world’.”
Ms Merchant noticed her daughter’s poor eyesight when she was aged five after Lily-Rae struggled to read at school and described her diagnosis as life-changing.
“It’s changed my life upside down as a parent,” she explained.
“Now it’s all about what we can do together and have those memories. I want to live for today. We both live for today.”
Lily-Rae explained her condition does not affect colour, but she does struggle with depth perception – only being able to see from three metres or less and said she uses a font size 64 to read her laptop.
The 11-year-old now uses a cane and is learning Braille, but hopes sharing her story will debunk some misconceptions about people with sight impairments.
Lily-Rae said: “So many people assume if you’ve got a cane, you’re probably blind. People think I can’t see them, but I can.
“They look at me confused because I will be using (the cane) one minute and then holding it up the next.”
The school pupil hopes to change people’s perspective about impairments and wants to detach the negative connotations often associated with disabilities.
“If there’s anything you feel is wrong with you, it’s not a disability and no one should see it as a disability. They should see it as an ability,” she said.
Ms Merchant added: “I think people say, ‘oh gosh, what’s she going to do in life?’ She can do anything she wants.
“From a non-visually impaired person looking and spending the last year watching her adapt and seeing how she’s amazingly changing and adapting, it’s been one of those situations where she’s very positive about it.”
Lily-Rae hopes her story will inspire people with and without impairments to find their purpose in life.
“Even if you feel like you can’t do something or you feel like you don’t have any worth in life, which some people can just feel like that, realise that there is a purpose for your life. You’ve just not found it yet,” she said."
TMMD9CXKQ1_MPOHT44O7D8482U,First meeting of York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority,By Karen Darley @KarenGazette Reporter,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24070196.first-meeting-york-north-yorkshire-combined-authority/,"The first meeting of York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority has taken place – marking another major milestone for devolution in the region.
Held on Monday, the meeting included confirmation of the Combined Authority’s constitution, budget and statutory officers. This allows the organisation to officially launch on February 1.
The Combined Authority is brand new for the region. Created by local authorities working together, powers and funding are moving from Westminster to the Combined Authority under the leadership of a mayor, who will be elected on May 2 this year.
The role of the Combined Authority is to deliver the region’s devolution deal. This includes £540 million for the mayor to invest over 30 years.  Further funding and powers are also being devolved to York and North Yorkshire to improve transport, housing, skills and to help the economy transition to net zero.
The Combined Authority will work with local authorities to invest across York and North Yorkshire, maximising the combined strengths of the city region and rural powerhouse. As the organisation launches, in 2024/2025 the programme funds being delivered into the region stand in excess of £44 million.
Leaders of City of York Council and North Yorkshire Council are members of the Combined Authority, and were at the meeting at County Hall, Northallerton.
North Yorkshire Council’s leader, Cllr Carl Les, who chaired the inaugural meeting of the Combined Authority, said: “Today’s meeting represents the latest significant step to bringing the benefits of more local decision-making powers and millions of pounds in additional funding to York and North Yorkshire for hundreds of thousands of people.
“The Combined Authority represents a powerful means of ensuring these benefits are delivered for residents and businesses alike.
“It will be vital in ensuring that the full potential of the devolution deal for York and North Yorkshire comes to fruition, bringing better jobs and improved skills and training as well as major environmentally-friendly projects and more affordable housing to the region.
“Devolution has been a long-held ambition for York and North Yorkshire, and it is a key policy for the Government’s levelling up agenda to tackle regional inequalities across the country.
“We are committed to making sure that we can bring the maximum benefits to the public, and I am looking forward to making sure that North Yorkshire Council is at the heart of this while working closely with City of York Council, the Combined Authority and the new mayor.”
Cllr Claire Douglas, Leader at City of York Council, said: “Today’s meeting is another significant milestone and is testament to the tireless efforts of the many across York and North Yorkshire who’ve helped to make devolution a reality.
“The Combined Authority presents significant new opportunities for our region and we will continue to work with colleagues in North Yorkshire and the mayor, when they are elected, to deliver for the people of York and North Yorkshire.
“This means delivering more sustainable and affordable housing, increased investment in transport, tackling the climate emergency and growing our economy for the benefit of everyone.”
Minister for Levelling Up, Jacob Young, said: “The York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority (YNYCA) held its inaugural meeting today. This is a key milestone in getting the new Combined Authority up and running, adopting its new constitution and laying the foundations for the first mayoral election on 2 May 2024.
“Establishing the YNYCA and electing a Mayor for York and North Yorkshire were key elements of the area’s devolution deal. Implementing the deal means more powers and decision-making being transferred from London back to the region and further empowering local leaders in delivering for local businesses and communities.
“The York and North Yorkshire devolution deal also includes a commitment from Government to provide more than half a billion pounds of funding to be invested in local priorities and projects over the next 30 years.”

In July 2023, the City of York Council’s executive approved a city-wide five-year anti-racism and inclusion strategy, developed by IERUK. The ambition is for York to be the first anti-racism city in the north.
Haddy Njie, chair of Inclusive Equal Rights UK, was instrumental in raising the issue of racism in York, after experiencing racism in the city. She put forward the motion to make York the north’s first anti-racist city, following similar initiatives in Oxford, Brighton, and Derby.

In a speech where she fought back tears Haddy said the group have received threats.
""Through the work we do we are fearful for our lives - we receive threats and abuse. I have had emails saying 'put her on a boat and give me a gun',"" he said.

Haddy Njie said: “We want to use York as a template to inspire other towns and cities across the UK.
""This summit is an important next step in our ambition to make York an anti-racist and inclusive city.
""Despite a wave of support for our strategy last year, we also saw threatening and racist responses, which highlights how urgent constructive dialogue and engagement is to ensure we make a lasting stand and promote inclusivity.
""All who attended the summit left with actionable solutions. Only by working together, can we make a lasting difference.”

Mrs Ropner said: ""I'm sure the King would be happy that this event is happening, and being the person he is, he would hope for it across the county and I would like to see this across the whole of North Yorkshire.""
Figures from the education sector attended from York St John University, Askham Bryan College, and University of York, as well as representatives from North Yorkshire Police. Business leaders from York BID and the CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Paul Kissack, also took part.
The summit coincided with the UN Education and Peace Day, and aimed to foster dialogue, understanding, and cooperation to help combat the pressing issues of racism and hate.
At the event, IERUK introduced the Anti-Racism Strategic Task Force leading the implementation of the anti-racism and inclusion strategy for the City of York.
The strategy includes 12 action points for policing reform, including reviewing Stop and Search policies, and establishing unconscious bias training. It also focuses on healthcare, housing, and social welfare, to help make access to infrastructure and opportunities in York more equitable.

UC8WYQ121R_0KJ6084Y0K7JNLT,Family of missing Annie Dryden of Middlesbrough issue message to her,By Dylan Connell @dylanconnell_ Reporter,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24067918.family-missing-annie-dryden-middlesbrough-issue-message/,"The family of a missing 20-year-old woman last seen almost three weeks ago in North Yorkshire have issued a direct message to help find her.
Annie Dryden from Middlesbrough was last seen after getting off a train at Battersby in the Moors at about 2.38pm on Thursday, January 4.
She boarded the train at James Cook train station in Middlesbrough at 2.09pm that day.
Annie’s family have urged her to make contact.
“Annie, we just want to know you are safe. You don’t need to come home, we just need to know you are ok,” they said in a statement through North Yorkshire Police.
“We love you and we miss you but we also understand there were events coming up at home which were causing you upset. These have now passed.
“So many people are worried about you, we are receiving so many messages from those concerned about you. Please just get in touch with someone.”
A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson added: “Annie we know from speaking to your family, you would not like the media attention, or your photograph being published.
“We needed to do this to help find you. Once we know you are ok, we will remove your image from our website and social media channels and will work with the media to do the same.
“You are not in any trouble, just like your family, we want to know you are safe.”
Officers urge anyone who knows where Annie is to phone 999.
Annie is described as around 5ft 10in tall and of slim build. She has dark hair with a distinctive blonde fringe and a scar above her top lip. She was carrying a green and black backpack when she was last seen.
As The Press reported, officers have carried out extensive searches in the area of Battersby and further afield with the support of mountain rescue volunteers and the National Police Air Service.
Last week they extended their search to the village of Castleton, after following up information provided by the public.
Detective Chief Inspector Fionna McEwan from North Yorkshire Police previously said Annie is “very familiar” with the outdoors and wild camping (when someone sleeps in a tent in the countryside not in a campsite or caravan park)."
UHQQMAMIKK_M6ZKTIJYLH1NUG2,Yousaf and ex-adviser to Sturgeon to give evidence to Covid inquiry,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073214.yousaf-ex-adviser-sturgeon-give-evidence-covid-inquiry/,"Scotland’s First Minister Humza Yousaf is due to give evidence to the UK Covid-19 Inquiry amid ongoing scrutiny over messages exchanged by ministers and officials during the pandemic.
Former first minister Nicola Sturgeon’s use of private party emails is also likely to be examined as her former chief of staff Liz Lloyd gives evidence on Thursday morning.
A spokesperson for Mr Yousaf issued a statement earlier this week explaining his actions as former health secretary after the inquiry was shown a WhatsApp exchange he had with Scotland’s national clinical director Professor Jason Leitch in November 2021.
In the exchange, Mr Yousaf asked Prof Leitch about the rules around the wearing of masks ahead of an event he was attending.
At the time, Covid rules in Scotland meant people would not have to wear a mask if they were sitting down to eat or drink, but would if they were moving around a bar or restaurant while not drinking.
Prof Leitch told Mr Yousaf to “have a drink in your hands at ALL times” then he would be “exempt” from wearing a mask, but he denied to the inquiry he had given Mr Yousaf a way to “get out” of obeying the mask rules.
A spokesperson for Mr Yousaf later said the exchange “simply shows the then health secretary seeking specific, up-to-date guidance from a senior adviser to ensure he was complying with the Covid rules”.
The inquiry has also previously heard that Ms Sturgeon provided a public health expert with an SNP email address where she said she could be contacted “privately” alongside her official email during a discussion around a briefing paper.
The Scottish Conservatives have since urged Ms Sturgeon to publish any emails to or from her SNP email account relating to Government business during her time in Bute House.
Scottish Labour deputy leader Dame Jackie Baillie has also written to Permanent Secretary John Paul Marks – Scotland’s top civil servant – asking what action he has taken to investigate the issue.
A source close to Ms Sturgeon told the PA news agency any emails relevant to the management of the pandemic she received in her private inbox “were passed to the Scottish Government”.
Scottish Secretary Alister Jack had been due to give evidence on Thursday but inquiry chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett said on Wednesday she hopes to call him next week and his inability to attend on Thursday was neither his fault nor that of the inquiry.
The inquiry is holding a series of hearings in Edinburgh as it probes the devolved administration’s response to the pandemic."
UJ4JHCK8MK_I6EA20KGWEQBUA3,Average council tax demand in North Yorkshire set to rise,By Stuart Minting,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24070887.average-council-tax-demand-north-yorkshire-set-rise/,"North Yorkshire residents are facing an average increase of almost £90 in their annual council tax payment to the unitary authority from April, despite plans to raid the council’s reserves and use £46m of savings.
A meeting of North Yorkshire Council’s executive heard efficiencies generated from local government reorganisation had put the local authority in a much stronger financial position than many others, but soaring costs over special educational needs and disabilities and social care had effectively wiped out the savings.
The proposed increase in bills comes before parish councils, the police and fire services announce their plans for billing residents over the coming year.
Nevertheless, although some councillors underlined the vast majority of the proposed savings would not impact on frontline services, others urged the administration to rethink its plan to halve community grants distributed by elected members.
The Tory-run council’s leading members approved pushing forward a recommendation for a council tax increase of 4.99 per cent in the coming financial year, two per cent of which would be reserved for subsidising adult social care.
If approved at a full meeting of the authority next month, the average Band D council tax will rise by £87.80 a year and results in an overall average
Band D level of £1,847 in 2024/25.
However, the meeting heard residents in areas such as Hambleton will see higher rises and householders in districts such as Harrogate lower rises as bills are brought into line across the county.
The authority’s corporate director, Gary Fielding, told the meeting although the next 12 months were needed to develop further savings opportunities the council’s finances remained “sufficiently robust” that there was no immediate danger of having to issue a section 114 financial distress notice.
Councillor Carl Les, the council’s leader, told the meeting North Yorkshire was in “an enviable position” compared with other local authorities.
Liberal Democrat group leader Councillor Bryn Griffiths told the meeting councillors’ community grants represented excellent value for money as they were often used to lever other grants and brought about great social benefits.
In response, the council’s finance boss, Councillor Gareth Dadd said it was “very difficult to quantify benefits” of the grants and highlighted fears of the authority’s deficit “snowballing into section 114 territory”, whereby new spending is severely restricted.
Coun Dadd said the council could face the measure in the future without a sustainable plan and that the “luxury of choices that we have at the moment” were unlikely to continue. He added the council’s “laser-like focus” towards supporting vulnerable people had become more important than ever.
He said the proposed budget would see the fruition of many of the immediate
financial benefits arising from local government reform in the county, including restructures in service teams; reduction in senior management; reduction in support service costs; and reduction of corporate overheads."
UM3DYKJNUZ_DF33IHSQUHL3FBM,Oil tanker on fire in Red Sea after strike claimed by Houthis,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24078610.oil-tanker-fire-red-sea-strike-claimed-houthis/,"An oil tanker is on fire off the coast of Yemen after a missile strike claimed by the Houthis.
Multinational firm Trafigura, which has offices in London, said the safety of crew on the Marlin Luanda, a vessel operated on its behalf, is its “foremost priority”.
Military ships in the region are on the way to provide assistance, it said.
UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported an incident 60 nautical miles south-east of Aden on Friday.
It comes after an earlier incident in which two missiles were reported to have exploded in the water and “vessel and crew are safe and no damage reported”.
The Yemeni armed forces claimed it had targeted Marlin Luanda, which it described as a British oil tanker, in the Gulf of Aden.
Shipping data suggests the vessel sails under the flag of the Marshall Islands.
UKMTO said authorities have been informed and are responding to the latest strike, warning other vessels to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity.
The Houthis have repeatedly launched attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, endangering shipping on a key route for global trade.
Alongside numerous air strikes on key Houthi targets, the UK and US are also targeting key figures in the Iran-backed militant group with sanctions.
A second series of UK and US air strikes, carried out at the start of the week, appears to have done little to deter Houthi action.
A Trafigura spokesperson said in a statement: “Earlier on 26th January, the Marlin Luanda, a petroleum products tanker vessel operated on behalf of Trafigura, was struck by a missile as it transited the Red Sea.
“Firefighting equipment on board is being deployed to suppress and control the fire caused in one cargo tank on the starboard side. The safety of the crew is our foremost priority.
“We remain in contact with the vessel and are monitoring the situation carefully. Military ships in the region are underway to provide assistance.”
Earlier on Friday, a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: “We continue to call on (the Houthis) to step back from such action. We’re clear that this is illegal and unacceptable.”
Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron is currently finishing a trip to the Middle East in a diplomatic bid to reduce tensions as the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues."
UT5RZNSH3W_A0B65HIWS455ZBU,Monk convicted of abusing children describes victims as ‘unhinged’ at inquiry,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24072163.monk-convicted-abusing-children-describes-victims-unhinged-inquiry/,"A 90-year-old man who physically and sexually abused boys in his care at a residential school in the 1960s has branded his victims “unhinged” and said they should be investigated by police for “telling lies”.
Michael Murphy appeared by video link at the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry on Wednesday from HMP Edinburgh, where he serving a sentence for physically and sexually abusing children while he was a social worker with the De La Salle Brothers in Gartmore, Stirlingshire, and St Joseph’s in Tranent, East Lothian, between 1961 and 1991.
Murphy continued to deny he was responsible for abusing boys in his care while he was working at the establishment, and described those who had brought allegations, resulting in convictions in 2003, 2016 and 2021, as “characters” who were motivated to complain for “financial gain”.
The former monk became a member of the De La Salle brothers in 1956 and was posted to St Ninian’s School in Gartmore in 1961.
Murphy was asked by lead counsel to the inquiry, Colin MacAulay KC, how he felt about the allegations.
Murphy said: “All of these characters and complainers, they are unhinged … and I think they need to be checked out by the police and need to be investigated about all of these lies they have told.”
During Wednesday’s evidence, the inquiry heard Murphy had been convicted of 54 charges of physical and sexual abuse, including incidents where he would hit boys on the bottom with an implement made of three 16in shoe laces if they were misbehaving, and that he administered electric shocks to boys using a small generator he called “the tickler”.
The inquiry also heard about an incident where Murphy assaulted a boy so badly, he broke his arm and had to be taken to hospital.
Murphy downplayed the incident and attempted to place blame on the child, saying the youngster had “abused” him because of his “footwear” and described it as a “misunderstanding”.
He said: “I had a misunderstanding with a boy about my footwear and my bad foot.
“I gave him an arm twist. I twisted his arm.
“That’s all.”
Lead counsel to the inquiry Colin MacAulay KC put it to Murphy that the child sustained a broken arm as a consequence.
Murphy said: “He fractured a wee bone on his arm.”
He was later asked about administering electric shocks to children, with one incident causing burns to a boy’s hand.
Murphy continued to insist he was not administering shocks and said the sensation went along the muscle of the hands and that the complainer was “telling lies”.
Mr MacAulay asked Murphy if he had ever administered a shock through the testicles.
Murphy denied he had and said his convictions were “false”.
He said he had been entrusted with the care of around 90 children on his own, with very little training in how to look after them.
When asked to explain why so many people came forward regarding Murphy’s treatment of the children, he said there had been “collusion”.
Mr MacAulay asked Murphy: “Why are they picking on you?”
Murphy responded: “I have already said it is because I am the only one alive today.
“It is all about compensation.”
Meanwhile, the inquiry also heard from a teacher at St Joseph’s between 1978 and 1994, known simply as William, who was accused of hitting boys with blackboard dusters and making them sniff ammonia as forms of discipline.
William told the inquiry he used blackboard dusters to tackle “classroom nonsense” and said the boys would often throw the dusters back at him.
He insisted he did not use physical punishment and witnessed it at the school only once when a boy had taken off the handbrake on a minibus.
When asked about boys being made to smell ammonia, he said he had been talking about “smelling salts” and told the boys he could let them smell ammonia.
He said the accusations of abuse towards the boys were “upsetting” because he believed he had “always got on well” with them and had spent much of his career working with children who had social, behavioural and emotional difficulties.
William has not been convicted of any offences related to the allegations.
Later on Wednesday, a social worker denied accusations of abuse against him when he worked in residential care and said no behaviour he would categorise as abuse took place.
No criminal complaints have been made against the man, who gave evidence to the inquiry under the pseudonym Dominic.
He worked at institutions run by the De La Salle brothers during the 1980s.
Dominic, who now works at a Scottish university, had been accused of hitting boys and looking at them inappropriately while they were changing.
He strenuously denied the accusations put to him at the inquiry.
He said he had never witnessed any physical punishment towards the children in his care, and he described St Joseph’s as a “remarkable” place that was “quite progressive” with an approach that would be described as “restorative” nowadays.
Dominic also discussed Murphy’s electric generator and the sensation it gave as “underwhelming”.
He was asked by Mr MacAulay if he had ever seen any abuse at St Joseph’s during his time there.
He said: “I honestly did not think I saw behaviour with any kid that I would consider to be abusive.”
In 2017, the De La Salle Brothers used the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry to apologise to victims who had suffered abuse within their care.
The spokesman for the De La Salle Brothers, David Anderson, said nothing could be said to defend the mistreatment of children.
“Where a brother at any of these schools was responsible for the mistreatment of a child or young adult entrusted to the congregation’s care, the congregation offers an unreserved apology,” he said at the time.
The inquiry, before Lady Smith, continues."

The suspect remains at large.
Police in Will County and the city of Joliet said they did not know of a motive for the killings.
Joliet Police Chief William Evans did say the victims were known to the suspect, named as 23-year-old Romeo Nance.

“I’ve been a policeman 29 years, and this is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with,” Mr Evans said during a news conference outside the Joliet homes on Monday evening.
One victim was found on Sunday, with the remaining seven discovered on Monday at three separate locations, authorities said.
Police also believe another shooting in Joliet that wounded a man on Sunday is connected to the attacks.
Mr Evans added that the victims found on Monday in the houses were family members.

The FBI’s Fugitive Task Force is assisting local police in the search for the suspect.
Emergency services have also warned the community on social media that the man should be considered “armed and dangerous”.
Joliet Police said in a Facebook post on Monday afternoon that they were investigating “multiple” people found dead.
It also shared the man’s photo and images of a vehicle, identifying the car as a red Toyota Camry.
Joliet Police Detectives are currently seeking the whereabouts of Romeo Nance, believed to be driving a red Toyota Camry Q730412. This is an active investigation in which we are working with our area law enforcement partners. Nance should be regarded as armed and dangerous.

The Will County Sheriff’s Office also shared images of the same car on Facebook on Monday and said it had been seen at the scenes of two separate shootings on Sunday afternoon.
Will County Chief Deputy Dan Jungles said during the news conference that police deputies had been staking out one of the houses since Sunday evening in case the suspect in the first fatal shooting they discovered returned to them.
Mr Jungles said he did not have any indication yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead and that autopsies are pending."

ScotRail cancelled trains for the second time this week, after Storm Isha on Sunday night, and services stopped before 7pm – with no rush-hour services on Wednesday morning.
It was warned that Storm Jocelyn could be worse than Storm Isha, which claimed two lives.
The Met Office issued an amber wind warning covering the west coast of Scotland, parts of the north and north east and Orkney between 6pm on Tuesday until 8am on Wednesday.
There are also yellow warnings for rain covering parts of western and southern Scotland and a yellow warning for ice has been issued across northern and eastern parts of Scotland.
#StormJocelyn The last trains of the day have already departed on many routes and won't resume until late morning tomorrow, 24 January.

— ScotRail (@ScotRail) January 23, 2024
A yellow weather warning for wind also covers much of the UK, and the last trains to England departed at 5pm.
Ferry operator CalMac warned of disruption, and it has been a week since Barra and Vatersay, Outer Hebrides, last received food deliveries on January 17.
Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) Distribution said that as of noon, supplies have been successfully restored to more than 37,000 customers in northern Scotland.
Storm Isha claimed two lives including an 84-year-old man who died after the car he was a passenger in crashed into tree in Grangemouth, Falkirk, around 11.45pm on Sunday, Police Scotland said.
A man in his 60s was killed in a crash involving two vans and a fallen tree in Limavady, Co Londonderry, on Sunday night, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.
Workers removed a massive tree that fell on an electricity substation on the Kinnaird estate in Larbert, Falkirk on Sunday night, when winds blew the roof off a block of flats in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire.
Finlay MacRae, head of operations at CalMac, said: “It’s a challenging and difficult time for communities, with travel and supply chain interrupted throughout prolonged periods of adverse weather.
“The safety of our crews, port staff and the customers we serve is our priority. We are always grateful to the communities who use the network for their patience and understanding during storms.”
First Minister Humza Yousaf previously warned Storm Jocelyn could be worse than Storm Isha.
Mr Yousaf said: “Storm Jocelyn is likely to cause more disruption, with another period of strong winds further buffeting our infrastructure and rain falling on already saturated ground.
“Travel is likely to again be difficult, particularly heading into Wednesday’s rush hour, so I urge everyone to follow guidance from Police Scotland and check updates from transport providers, Transport Scotland and the Met Office.”
ScotRail said infrastructure had already been “significantly impacted” by Storm Isha, which passed only yesterday, and it predicted Storm Jocelyn will create more challenges across the network.
Heavy winds of up to 80mph are expected during Storm Jocelyn, prompting fears more trees and other debris could fall onto tracks – making it unsafe for trains to complete their journeys.
Phil Campbell, ScotRail’s customer operations director, said: “This is the second withdrawal of train services this week, and we know the impact this has on customers, but the safety of staff and passengers will always be our priority.
“Our colleagues at Network Rail Scotland will again be working flat out to carry out safety checks, and assess what repairs are required to reopen the railway.
“However, customers will be unable to travel early on Wednesday morning, as trains will not be able to operate until the infrastructure has been made safe.”
Met Office chief meteorologist Steve Willington said: “Outbreaks of heavy rain on Tuesday could bring rainfall accumulations of 15-20mm quite widely – with 40-50mm over higher ground in south-west Scotland, the Scottish Highlands and parts of north-west England.
“Wind gusts are expected to reach 55-65mph across north-western Scotland while there is potential for winds to reach 75-80mph in a few places, in particular exposed parts of the Western Isles and coastal north-west Scotland early on Wednesday morning.”"
VUY3VKGRV1_VQDC4JZPPL2DDH1,"Suspect in killing of eight in suburban Chicago fatally shot himself, police say",By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067612.suspect-killing-eight-suburban-chicago-fatally-shot-police-say/,"A man suspected of shooting and killing eight people in suburban Chicago shot himself dead after a confrontation with law enforcement officials at a petrol station in Texas, where he had no known ties, authorities have said.
Police in Joliet, Illinois, said on Facebook that at about 8.30pm on Monday, US marshals found Romeo Nance, 23, near Natalia, Texas, about 30 miles southwest of San Antonio, and that Nance shot himself.
His death was announced hours after Illinois authorities used social media and a press conference to share initial details of the killings there.
Medina County sheriff Randy Brown said the sheriff’s office got a call on Monday about a person suspected in the Chicago-area killings heading into the county on Interstate 35.
Mr Brown said he believes the suspect was trying to reach Mexico.
“It seems like they (criminal suspects) all head to Mexico,” which is about 120 miles south of Natalia along Interstate 35, Mr Brown said on Tuesday.
Officers from multiple agencies confronted Nance, Mr Brown said.
Mr Brown said his office’s only role in the standoff near Natalia was to support other law enforcement agencies at the scene and referred other questions to US marshals and Joliet police.
Natalia is more than 1,000 miles from Joliet, where Nance is suspected of shooting dead eight people at three locations in the Chicago suburbs.
The manhunt for him left neighbours on edge for several hours on Monday after police warned he was still on the loose and should be considered armed and dangerous.
Authorities in Illinois previously said they did not know of a motive for the killings but said Nance knew the victims.
The FBI’s fugitive task force was assisting local police in the search for the suspect, Joliet Police chief William Evans said.
The victims were found on Sunday and Monday at three separate homes, authorities told reporters at a press conference earlier on Monday evening.
One of the people killed was found with an apparent gunshot wound on Sunday outside apartments in Will County and pronounced dead at hospital.
He was identified by the Will County Sheriff’s Office as a 28-year-old man originally from Nigeria who had been living in the US for about three years.
Seven other bodies were found on Monday at two homes on the same block in Joliet, located about about six miles north-west of the scene police discovered first.
Will County chief deputy Dan Jungles said he did not have any indication yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead. The result of post-mortem tests were pending, he said.
“I’ve been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I’ve ever been associated with,” Mr Evans said during a press conference outside the Joliet homes on Monday evening.
Authorities said they also believe Nance was connected to another shooting in Joliet which wounded a man on Sunday but would not discuss their evidence.
Curtis Ellis said he lives next door to the man wounded in that shooting and captured it on a CCTV camera aimed at their street.
The footage shows the driver of a red car speaking briefly to Mr Ellis’s neighbour, driving to the end of the block before making a U-turn, then stopping and firing nine times.
Mr Ellis said he was watching the Detroit Lions play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in an NFL playoff game when he heard the shots, saw his hurt neighbour outside and called police.
“That could have been me or my wife in the front yard, which is scary,” Mr Ellis, 56, said.
“You haven’t done nothing to anybody, why would somebody just target to shoot you?”
Mr Evans said the victims found on Monday in the houses were family members.
Asked if the victims were members of the suspect’s family, Mr Jungles said he could not comment except to say the suspect knew them.
Teresa Smart lives about a block away from where seven of the victims were found and had said she was worried she and her family would not be able to sleep on Monday night.
“This is way too close to home,” she said, adding that police cars had been blocking streets throughout the neighbourhood."
W369UJVYCJ_WOGV8ETOH0VQLP4,"Long waits for scan results ‘having impact on patient care’, college warns",By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075228.long-waits-scan-results-having-impact-patient-care-college-warns/,"Waits of four weeks or longer for scan results are having a “knock-on effect” on patients, delaying their care and putting them at risk of deteriorating health and death, experts have warned.
The Royal College of Radiologists is calling for more staff to be trained to address “chronic” shortages.
Analysis on NHS England data by the college found 225,000 patients waited four weeks or more for results between July and September 2023.
In August, the NHS outlined a new target for imaging reporting, stating no turnaround “should take longer than four weeks”.
It said the benchmark “is considered a stepping stone” to a more ambitious target, such as two weeks, in the future.
Dr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “These shortfalls mean too many patients are having to wait too long for their diagnosis.
“This has a knock-on effect on all stages of the patient pathway – because of a slow diagnosis, patients may be delayed from either starting treatment or receiving the next stage of appropriate care.
“There is evidence to show that a patient’s health deteriorates while they are waiting on the pathway, and we know that for every four weeks a patient is delayed from starting cancer treatment, their risk of death increases by approximately 10%.
“Similarly, long waiting periods to receive test results can cause huge anxiety and stress for patients and their families.”
The college also found that in the first nine months of 2023, some 532,000 patients waited over the recommended timeframe, an increase of 16,000 on the same period in 2022.
Dr Halliday said the “heart” of the issue “lies in the chronic shortages of clinical radiologists”.
“The expertise and dedication of our radiologists are indisputable, but their numbers are not keeping pace with the increasing demands,” she added.
“The impact of these shortages on patient care is profound. There is an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address staffing shortfalls and ensure timely diagnoses for those relying on our healthcare system.”
The college is calling for the workforce to be bolstered by increasing training posts to meet demand for services, as well as expanding training capacity, both in terms of training staff and physical space.
“Trainees, particularly as they become more senior, bring significant benefits to departments, contributing vital reporting capacity and reducing the need for outsourcing,” Dr Halliday said.
She added that working conditions should also be improved to enhance staff retention.
“Keeping experienced and highly skilled radiologists working in the system must be a priority.
“Trusts and health boards should take active steps to improve doctors’ day-to-day working conditions to make sure they feel valued by their employers. This should include employing sufficient administrative staff to support doctors, exploring flexible working patterns, and providing access to rest spaces and food and drink.”
An NHS spokesperson said: “Thanks to the hard work of staff, latest data shows the NHS delivered a record number of diagnostic tests for patients in November, with over 2.3 million checks and scans, and over 200,000 people received a definitive diagnosis or had cancer ruled out within four weeks – the highest since the introduction of the new faster diagnosis standard.
“The NHS has rolled out over 140 community diagnostic centres across England – with a further 20 on track to be delivered by April 2024 – to offer ‘one stop shops’ in more convenient locations for patients.
“Community diagnostic centres have delivered over 6 million potentially lifesaving tests, checks and scans in total so far, as part of key plans to expand capacity and reduce waiting lists.”"

Father Jonathan Cotton OSB, Benedictine monk died peacefully in the Monastery Infirmary at Ampleforth Abbey on January 17, aged 80.
Born in Shimla, India, in May 1943, Fr Jonathan was educated at St Martin’s, Nawton, and Ampleforth College. He joined the monastic community in 1961 and was ordained priest ten years later. Fr Jonathan read History at St Benet’s Hall at the University of Oxford and subsequently taught History at Ampleforth College for ten years.
Fr Jonathan’s first parochial appointment came in January 1973, when he was sent to St Mary’s, Warrington, and this was followed by a period in which he assisted at Our Lady & St Benedict’s in Ampleforth. Fr Jonathan then worked largely in St Mary’s, Bamber Bridge, and St Mary’s, Leyland, where he was parish priest for thirty years from 1992-2022.
In the early 1970s Fr Jonathan first encountered the Focolare Movement, a religious group founded in Italy during the Second World War. Today the Movement is present in more than 180 nations and it played a major part in Fr Jonathan’s life. He attended the Movement’s summer gathering, Mariapolis, in Manchester in 1972. Fr Jonathan wrote that the Movement “was the greatest influence on my life and helped me to realise the beauty of my monastic vocation”.
From 1975-2019 he was part of the co-ordinating Council of the Focolare Movement in Britain and attended numerous annual and international conferences reflecting on the life of communion for religious in the Church as promoted by the Focolare Movement. He organised and attended events not only in the UK but also worldwide and was a regular attender at Mariapolis, the annual gathering of people of all ages and backgrounds organised by the Focolare Movement to enable people to spend a few days together putting into practice the values of the Gospel. The main guideline of such gatherings was the ‘Golden Rule’: to do to others what we would like to be done to us.
Fr Jonathan retired as parish priest in September 2022 and began a sabbatical in Italy. Ill health forced him to cut short his time abroad and he returned to the Monastery Infirmary at Ampleforth Abbey in July 2023. He was diagnosed with cancer shortly after his return and his health gradually deteriorated. He died peacefully on January 17.
Fr Jonathan’s body will be received into the Abbey church at Ampleforth at 8 pm on Wednesday, January 31. His funeral Mass will be celebrated at 11.30 am in the Abbey church on Thursday, February 1, followed by burial in Monks’ Wood."

But seriously, perhaps there should be a middle ground between NHS and private dental treatment.
The middle ground should consist of part treatment paid by the NHS and the difference made up by patients.
That would leave the less fortunate solely in the lower band and slightly better of being partly funded, with Rolls Royce treatment for the people more able to pay.

Bigger council, more waste?
The new North Yorkshire Council covers a huge geographical area with a population of over 618,000,.
Local political leaders are suggesting this is not the time to be negative, but to grasp the opportunities offered.
This is a worthy sentiment.
But has it been shown anywhere that ratepayers reap physical and fiscal benefits from a larger authority?
Precedents show it does not happen because those in charge lack the talent required to make it a success.
A lethal combination of inefficient, bloated bureaucracy, a collection of councillors’ worthy as they may be but still under the control of party whips, petty ideological differences, regional envies, all in abundance, prevent any chance of such success.
A simple description being: more waste, more hot air, more mistakes, more excuses, more cost.
Ratepayers must be jumping for joy.

Let's stop turning a deaf ear to deafness
At last the effects on life caused by deafness are being recognised.
Helen Keller, famously both blind and deaf, wrote that deafness was the worst of those disabilities as it meant isolation. So true.
I went deaf many years ago and like the majority blamed other people for not speaking properly. Eventually I was tested and found to be almost 100 per cent deaf.
I finally got a cochlear implant and my world opened up.
Sadly, because deafness is unseen, it is still not getting the necessary funding required.
If only more children born deaf could be given this hearing aid they could be socially accepted and not be seen as different.

The city’s top taxpayer, according to the Sunday Times newspaper, is the Shepherd family, who paid £35.1million in tax over the past 12 months.
The family sold their York-based construction business in 2015 and now concentrate on Portakabin- the portable and modular buildings company, which is based in Huntington.
The Sunday Times Tax list says the family are the second-biggest taxpayers in Yorkshire.

The county’s top taxpayer is Malcolm Healey, the founder of Wren Kitchens, who paid £52.1million in tax, and owns an estate close to York.
His kitchen company hit £1 billion in sales last year, making him Yorkshire’s richest man, worth £1.43billion, according to the 2021 Sunday Times Rich List or £1.65bn in 2023, according to Business Insider.
The Hull-born 79-year-old founded Wren Kitchens in Howden in 2009. Now, based at Barton-upon-Humber, it has a chain of more than 400 stores.
Malcolm Healey currently owns Warter Priory, a 12,000-acre estate situated three miles East of Pocklington, which he bought for a reported £48 million in 1998. He is ranked 21 on the national list.

Yorkshire’s top taxpayers also include Mark Hunter and Andrew Vincent, who founded Leeds-based software and IT services company BJSS.
The Tordoff family, who run Bradford-based car retailers JCT600, also made the list alongside fellow care retailer Richard and Christine Teatum, who own Doncaster-headquartered Stoneacre, who also have dealerships around the region.
Nationally, thanks to a major tax settlement with HMRC, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone became the second-biggest tax payer in the UK last year, the Sunday Times Tax List has suggested.
The millionaire businessman, 93, in October agreed a £652.6 million settlement over tax that he was meant to pay to HM Revenue & Customs during 18 years starting in 1994.
The Tax List researchers said Mr Ecclestone was the second-highest individual taxpayer in the country as a result, a little behind Alex Gerko, the billionaire founder of trading firm XTX Markets.
They said that two-thirds of the people who were on last year's list paid less tax this year.
Mostly this was because people's businesses made less profit last year, but it comes at a time when the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK tax burden to hit a post-war high before the end of the decade.
Third on the list were Denise, John and Peter Coates, the family behind online gambling giant Bet365. They paid £375.9 million.
The gambling fortune of Fred and Peter Done and family put them in fourth place at £204.6 million, closely followed by Wetherspoon founder Sir Tim Martin.
""This has been the highest taxing government since the Second World War and although the total tax take is up - it is only by 3.3%,"" said Tax List compiler Robert Watts.
""Bernie Ecclestone seems to have saved Jeremy Hunt's blushes. The total tax found in this year's research would have been a wedge lower were it not for the vast sum shelled out by the Formula One tycoon to settle a long-running investigation.""
The researchers said that Akshata Murty, the wife of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, was liable for tax of around £4.8 million after she gave up her non-dom status following political pressure. It was not enough to get her included on the list.
""If you look at the bottom 98 in this year's list they paid £4.03 billion, £200 million less than last year,"" Mr Watts said.
""That's the amount the Government pledged to the NHS to boost winter resilience. Two thirds of the wealthy individuals in 2023's Tax List were found to have paid less tax this year.
""That was usually because their businesses have reported lower profits. But lower tax receipts from the UK's richest people may raise more than the odd eyebrow at a time when the public finances remain stretched and there is talk of Budget giveaways in the air.""

WW4RW9JVN7_BIIH4Z23KPCAEGK,EasyJet cuts end-of-year losses despite £40m hit from Hamas-Israel conflict,By PA News Agency,_,20240124,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24070497.easyjet-cuts-end-year-losses-despite-40m-hit-hamas-israel-conflict/,"EasyJet said it reduced its losses in the final three months of 2023 despite suffering a £40 million hit from the Hamas-Israel conflict.
The airline recorded a loss before tax of £126 million between October and December last year, down from £133 million during the same period in 2022.
Passenger numbers increased by 14% year on year.
The airline said it expects to suffer a “direct impact of £40 million” in the six months to the end of March due to the war between Israel and Hamas.
This relates to the suspension in flights to Israel and Jordan, alongside a softening of demand for trips to Egypt.
EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline saw a “significant dampening in bookings for a period” but demand “picked up very strongly” from late November.
He also indicated that summer airfares across the sector could face upwards pressure as flight capacity “will probably be tight because of the challenges that some of our competitors have to get their aircraft”.
Delivery delays by aircraft manufacturer Boeing – which does not supply easyJet – are affecting carriers such as Ryanair.
EasyJet was among the airlines which diverted some flights far away from planned destinations on Sunday night due to Storm Isha.
This included a flight from Edinburgh to Bristol which landed in Paris.
Mr Lundgren said: “At certain points throughout the evening there were no options for diversions other than Paris.
“It is obviously inconvenient to say the least for customers who were on domestic flights, but there were relatively few.
“I must say that in the end we prioritise safety so we stand by the captains’ and the pilots’ decisions to do what is safe in those circumstances.”
He added: “I can only apologise but we can’t do anything about the weather.”
In relation to the airline’s financial results for the quarter and future demand, Mr Lundgren said: “We delivered an improved performance in the quarter, which is testament to the strength of demand for our brand and network.
“The popularity of easyJet holidays also continues to grow, with 48% more customers in the period.
“We see positive booking momentum for summer 2024, with travel remaining a priority for consumers.
“Flight and holiday bookings took off strongly during the traditional busy turn-of-year sales period, as customers opted to secure their summer holidays to firm favourites like Spain and Portugal alongside destinations further afield like Greece and Turkey.
“EasyJet remains focused on delivering for our customers in the coming months, while also expecting to deliver continuing performance gains.”
The airline heralded the success of its ongoing sale launched on December 21.
At peak booking periods, it sold enough flight tickets to fill the equivalent of two planes per minute.
The airline announced it has reached a deal with CFM to supply 314 Leap-1A engines to power the 157 Airbus aircraft in the A320neo range it has a firm order for, as well as spare engines.
The companies have also agreed pricing for 200 engines for the additional 100 Airbus planes easyJet has purchase rights for.
This continues a long-standing partnership between the airline and the US-based engine manufacturer."
WY479EQYUT_EC753V8BA2CTO5Z,UK to loan back looted ‘crown jewels’ from Ghana,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073221.uk-loan-back-looted-crown-jewels-ghana/,"The UK is set to loan back a selection of Asante Gold taken from Ghana over 100 years ago, according to reports.
The Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) will lend 17 items, while the British Museum will send 15 pieces under the three-year loan deals – with an option to extend for the same amount of time, the BBC has reported.
The items will reportedly go on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of the Asante region, to celebrate the Asantehene’s silver jubilee.
Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said the gold items taken from the court of the Asante King are the equivalent of “our Crown Jewels”.
The items to be loaned were mostly taken during wars in the 19th century between the UK and the Asante, including a sword of state, gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king, and a gold peace pipe, the BBC said.
There is also reportedly a ceremonial cap decorated with gold ornaments and worn by senior courtiers at coronations and other major festivals.
Mr Hunt said: “(When museums hold) objects with origins in war and looting in military campaigns, we have a responsibility to the countries of origin to think about how we can share those more fairly today.
“It doesn’t seem to me that all of our museums will fall down if we build up these kind of partnerships and exchanges.”
Although, Mr Hunt did suggest the loan is not a permanent return of ownership to Ghana, telling the BBC that the new cultural partnership “is not restitution by the back door”.
The loan agreements are not with the Ghanaian government but with Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the current Asante King known as the Asantehene – who attended the Coronation of King Charles last year, the BBC reported."

Charles, 75, was seen entering the private London Clinic in central London on Friday morning with the Queen at his side.
He took time to visit his daughter-in-law Kate, who is on the 11th day of her hospital stay after undergoing a successful major operation last week.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The King was this morning admitted to a London hospital for scheduled treatment.
“His Majesty would like to thank all those who have sent their good wishes over the past week and is delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness.”
It is not known how long the King will spend in hospital or the exact nature of his treatment.
He was dressed in a smart suit and tie and navy overcoat for his arrival at the hospital, while Camilla was wearing a royal blue coat and carrying a green handbag.
Charles arrived back in London from Norfolk on Thursday afternoon ready for the procedure, after squeezing in a couple of behind the scenes official duties.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has wished the King the “very best” for his treatment and a “speedy recovery” afterwards, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

The Court Circular recorded the King received Dame Polly Courtice, emeritus director of the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and Professor Robert Miller, director of the Whittle Laboratory, on Thursday morning at Sandringham.
In a picture released on the royal family account on X on Friday, he was shown lighting a candle with the Queen earlier this week to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Charles issued a message ahead of the commemorations, describing it as “a valuable opportunity for the richly diverse communities of this nation to come together and recommit to building a society free from antisemitism, persecution and hatred”.
Charles was diagnosed with the benign condition on January 17 while staying at Birkhall in Scotland, after going for a check-up because he was experiencing symptoms.
He is understood to have wanted to share the news to encourage other men to get themselves checked.
The King, who only acceded to throne 16 months ago, cancelled engagements, and was urged to rest by his doctors ahead of the corrective procedure.
The Queen had previously said her husband is “fine” and looking forward to getting back to work.
News of his diagnosis came on the same day that Kensington Palace announced the princess was in hospital after undergoing abdominal surgery.
Kate, 42, is not expected to carry out official engagements until after Easter, with the Prince of Wales clearing his diary of official duties for the time being.
One in every three men over the age of 50 will have symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which include needing to visit the toilet more frequently, with more urgency, and difficulty emptying the bladder.
An enlarged prostate, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, does not usually pose a serious threat to health, and it is not cancer.
But patients may need to have several tests for the condition to rule out the possibility they have another illness with similar symptoms, such as prostate cancer.
The prostate enlargement page on the NHS website saw a 1061% surge in visits following the news of King Charles' health condition.
The page received 16,410 visits on the day of the announcement – that's one visit every five seconds!

Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms that have not responded to medicine, the NHS website says.
Treatment can include a number of procedures, including removing part of the prostate gland with a laser, water ablation using the pressure of the water to destroy prostate tissue, or urethral lift implants, which hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it is not blocked.
Other options include a prostate artery embolisation, during which tiny plastic particles are injected into blood vessels to shrink the prostate gland by reducing its blood supply.
NHS England said the “enlarged prostate” page on the NHS website received one visit every five seconds on the day the King’s diagnosis was announced, with further huge boosts in visits in the days that followed."
WYL9R1ASFJ_YFEAO1CSH1PZGAB,US Supreme Court rules Alabama can proceed with first execution by nitrogen gas,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075984.us-supreme-court-rules-alabama-can-proceed-first-execution-nitrogen-gas/,"The US Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Alabama can proceed with using nitrogen gas to put a man to death, refusing to block what would be the nation’s first execution by a new method since 1982.
The decision clears the way for the state to carry out the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith — a 58-year-old convicted killer whose 2022 lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities could not connect an IV line — this time by using nitrogen gas.
Smith’s attorneys had waged an unsuccessful legal battle to halt the execution, arguing that Alabama was trying to make him the test subject for an experimental execution method.
Smith is scheduled to be executed at a south Alabama prison.
Officials intend to put a respirator mask over his face and replace the air he is breathing with pure nitrogen gas, causing him to die from lack of oxygen.
It will be the first use of a new execution method since the introduction four decades ago of lethal injection, now the most commonly used one in the United States.
“The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse. Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalise the suffocation of each other,” Smith and the Reverend Jeff Hood, Smith’s spiritual adviser, said in a statement on Thursday afternoon.
The state has predicted the nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness within seconds and death within minutes.
A state attorney told the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that it would be “the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.”
But some doctors and organisations have raised alarm about the state’s plan.
Smith’s attorneys asked the US Supreme Court to halt the execution to review claims that the new method violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserves more legal scrutiny before it is used on a person.
“There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person,” Smith’s attorneys wrote.
In the hours ahead of the scheduled execution, Smith met with family members and his spiritual adviser, according to a prison spokesperson.
He ate a final meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Mr Hood said by telephone.
“He’s terrified at the torture that could come. But he’s also at peace. One of the things he told me is he is finally getting out,” Mr Hood said.
Smith is one of two men convicted in the 1988 murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Sennett. Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid 1,000 dollars to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance.
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said on Wednesday night that he believes the courts will allow the execution to proceed.
Alabama plans to strap Smith to a gurney in the execution chamber — the same chamber where he was strapped down for several hours during the lethal injection attempt — and place a “full facepiece supplied air respirator” over his face.
After he is given a chance to make a final statement, the warden, from another room, will activate the nitrogen gas. The nitrogen will be administered through the mask for at least 15 minutes or “five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,” according to the state protocol.
The execution is scheduled to begin at 6pm local time but could be delayed because of legal action or preparation. The state has until 6am on Friday to carry out the execution.
The victim’s son, Charles Sennett Jr, said in an interview with WAAY-TV that Smith “has to pay for what he’s done.”
“And some of these people out there say, ‘Well, he doesn’t need to suffer like that.’ Well, he didn’t ask Mama how to suffer?” the son said. “They just did it. They stabbed her — multiple times.”"

A number of “proportionate measures” will now be put into place at the London-listed telecoms firm to address concerns and allow it to put a director from the investors on its board.
On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden used new powers to declare there were national security risks related to Emirates Telecommunications Group, which does business as Etisalat by e&, holding an almost 15% stake in Vodafone.
The UK is rightly a magnet for global investment.
The Government recently approved the Strategic Relationship Agreement between Vodafone and e&. This is subject to proportionate measures under the NSI Act.
There has been significant interest & speculation about the decision. 👇 pic.twitter.com/cOaZNL35il
— Oliver Dowden (@OliverDowden) January 26, 2024
An order cautioned that the relationship e& has with the British firm would “enable it materially to influence the policy of Vodafone” and ordered a “national security committee” to be set up by the business to oversee and monitor any sensitive work.
The Cabinet Office confirmed on Friday it has now approved a new “strategic relationship agreement between Vodafone and e&”.
“Using the National Security & Investment Act it has put in place proportionate measures to address any potential national security concern”, it said on Friday.
“Where investment might impact the UK’s national security – for example through the acquisition of certain technologies or infrastructure – we will work with investment partners to minimise any risk.
“As part of our critical national infrastructure, telecoms is one such sector. Vodafone is also a particularly important company for the UK Government given its critical functions, including as a key partner in HMG’s cyber security strategy.”
A Vodafone spokesman said: “We are pleased to have received clearance in our home market for our strategic relationship agreement with e& and for e& to take a seat on our board.”
Abu Dhabi-listed e& has built up a stake of 14.6% in Vodafone, marking a deepening of a strategic tie-up that began in May 2022 when e& first invested in the FTSE 100 giant.
The British telephone firm announced in May that e& chief executive Hatem Dowidar would join the Vodafone board as a non-executive director.
Earlier on Friday, the UK’s competition watchdog confirmed the proposed merger between Vodafone and fellow mobile network Three is to be formally investigated.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had started the formal investigation to examine whether it could lead to a substantial lessening of competition for mobile consumers by merging the two firms into a single network provider.
The CMA said if it found reason for concern during its initial examination, it could launch a more in-depth investigation into the merger.
The £15 billion merger was first announced last summer and would create the UK’s largest mobile phone network.
It was expected to draw regulator scrutiny, particularly in terms of competition, because it would reduce the major mobile network providers in the UK from four to three.
Trade unions have also criticised the merger over concerns about possible job cuts.
“This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy,” CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said.
“The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps.
“We now have 40 working days to complete this formal phase one investigation, before publishing our findings and any next steps.”
In response to the CMA’s announcement, Vodafone UK chief executive Ahmed Essam said: “We have formally submitted our merger notice to the CMA, having worked with them closely through the pre-notification process. We look forward to continuing the constructive conversations now that the formal process has begun.
“We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players.
“Our commitment to invest £11 billion will build capacity to meet the exponential growth in demand for data and accelerate the rollout of advanced 5G across the UK, delivering benefits to consumers and businesses throughout the nation.
Three UK chief executive Robert Finnegan said: “By combining networks, Three UK and Vodafone UK will unlock £11 billion of investment that will help the UK close the 5G gap with leading European countries and realise its ambitions to be a front-runner in digital connectivity.
“Thanks to this transaction, 95% of the population and every school and hospital will be covered by standalone 5G by the end of the decade.

XRKZLJ2Q23_OIEO3VEEGFNT5VN,Sunak schedules debate for MPs – but no vote – after second strike on Houthis,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24068963.sunak-schedules-debate-mps---no-vote---second-strike-houthis/,"Rishi Sunak has resisted calls to hold a vote on the air strikes on Houthi rebels after the Royal Air Force (RAF) joined a second bombing raid in Yemen.
The Prime Minister was instead allowing for a “general debate” on the military intervention to take place in the Commons on Wednesday.
Downing Street insisted that they were “acting in line with precedence” by not allowing MPs the chance to vote on whether they support the strikes or not.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said holding a vote was “absolutely vital”, as he warned that MPs were being “bypassed” on military action.
Monday night’s air strikes against the Iran-backed militants were the second joint US-UK raid aimed at stopping the attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
Unlike after the first strikes earlier this month, however, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were not told in advance that the RAF was taking part.
Mr Sunak took questions in the House on Tuesday and was scheduling a “general debate” for Wednesday that Downing Street anticipated would not be accompanied by a vote.
Seeking to justify the lack of a vote, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “It’s important that parliamentarians are able to have their say, but we are acting in line with precedence.
“The powers to make a decision on this action rest with the Prime Minister.
“There isn’t a requirement, and in line with previous strikes, we have not sought a parliamentary vote before acting.”
Mr Sunak first told a Cobra committee meeting including key ministers of the decision after a call with US President Joe Biden, No 10 set out.
The wider Cabinet, as well as Sir Keir and Sir Lindsay, were then “informed at the time of the strikes”, around 10pm.
Both Sir Keir and Sir Ed have backed the strikes on a case-by-case basis, but the Lib Dem leader has been demanding that MPs are given a vote.
Sir Ed argued that “it is absolutely vital that Parliament has an opportunity to have its say, via a debate and a vote”.
“It is deeply disappointing that elected representatives are being bypassed on an issue as important as military action,” he added.
Sir Lindsay said that the Commons must always be informed “at the earliest opportunity” about military action.
He told Sky News: “If this is continuous action, therefore quite rightly, the Government must inform the House and it must put a big debate on.
“The House matters to me, it matters to MPs, they are elected by our constituents. So, we need to hear it in the House ASAP.”"
XSPSS9HT0J_3DH1TUJCH259FQC,Holocaust survivor urges people to ‘stand up against hatred and prejudice’,By PA News Agency,_,20240126,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24075985.holocaust-survivor-urges-people-stand-hatred-prejudice/,"A Holocaust survivor who was rescued on the way to a concentration camp has warned people to “stand up against hatred and prejudice”.
Ivan Shaw BEM, now aged 84 and living in London, was just five when his Jewish parents were arrested by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp.
The youngster was himself being marched towards a train bound for Auschwitz when he was saved by his aunt in a daring rescue.
Mr Shaw, who has been married for nearly 60 years and has three children and six grandchildren, said he had never been aware of antisemitism in the UK until a recent rise caused by the Hamas-Israel conflict.
The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the conflict, figures show.
“I would never have believed it, I thought Britain was different,” he told the PA news agency.
Mr Shaw was born in 1939 in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, part of modern-day Serbia.
In 1944, Germans began to round up and deport Jews, including his mother.
His father decided to go with her, despite only being half-Jewish.
Mr Shaw was hidden by one of his father’s sisters until his concealment was given away by a neighbour.
He recalled: “After about 10 days I was betrayed by one of the neighbours.
“Who would want to betray a five-year-old little boy? The mind just boggles.”
He was taken to prison by the Gestapo, spending the night alone in a cell before being moved to a transit camp where he was reunited with his family.
The inmates were being taken to a train station to be moved to the Auschwitz concentration camp when one of his aunts risked her life to save her nephew.
Mr Shaw said: “I was taken with thousands of other prisoners to the railway station with a view to being put on a train to Auschwitz.
“The road to the station bordered along a public forest. I was force-marched along this road.
“Much to my amazement, I suddenly found my aunt dashing out of the forest, grabbing me, and running back into the forest.
“The whole incident must’ve taken a few minutes.”
Both of his parents died in the camps, while Mr Shaw was hidden for about nine months by his aunt and her family.
“Had she been betrayed, she would have been shot, the whole family would have been shot, and the house would have been burnt down,” he added.
After the war was over, he moved to Amersham in Buckinghamshire to live with his aunt, and later enjoyed a successful career with retailer Marks & Spencer.
“I have been lucky, I was saved by my family. But millions have not been so lucky,” Mr Shaw said.
“Ninety per cent of Jews in Yugoslavia did not survive the war.
“There were good people and bad people, the Germans who looked the other way saved my life.
“We have to stand up against hatred and prejudice, hatred leads eventually to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
“I’ve got a photograph of the family which I always point to as my revenge on Hitler.
“He was determined to exterminate my family, and this picture shows he did not succeed.”
Mr Shaw was speaking ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day on Saturday.
Along with others, he shares his testimony in schools and colleges across the UK through a Holocaust Educational Trust programme which gives tens of thousands of young people the opportunity to hear the testimony of Holocaust survivors."
YG7PRJ8OR0_NDJPIJKLXOV6XXF,Man in court over waste dumped within River Swale flood plain,By Gavin Engelbrecht gavinengelecho Digital Audience and Content Editor,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24074561.man-court-waste-dumped-within-river-swale-flood-plain/,"A man who illegally dumped thousands of tonnes of waste within a North Yorkshire river flood plain has been given a suspended prison sentence.
Phillip Taylor, 70, of Scorton, near Richmond, appeared at York Magistrates’ Court after tipping the waste beside the River Swale over two years.
In a case brought by the Environment Agency, Taylor pleaded guilty to operating an illegal waste activity and an illegal flood risk activity by depositing over 2,400 tonnes of excavation waste within the flood plain.
He was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months and was served with a court order to remove the waste to reduce flood risk.
He was also ordered to pay costs of £9,500 and a victim surcharge of £115.
The court heard that in 2017 and 2018 excavated waste was transported to land known as the Catterick Complex from nearby housing developments, unbeknown to the house builders.
The waste was tipped beside the river to form unauthorised flood defences to protect commercial fishing lakes owned by Taylor.
The downstream village of Catterick flooded in 2012 and has since benefitted from a £6million Environment Agency flood alleviation scheme.
The EA regulates works near main rivers, and their flood plains, to ensure that any changes do not increase flood risk to others or damage important riverside habitats.
The illegal dumping of excavation waste at the Catterick Complex could displace or deflect flood water elsewhere, increasing flood risk. Taylor refused to remove the waste when directed by the EA, the court was told.
Environment Agency’s investigating officer Paul Glasby, said: Due to climate change flooding is becoming more frequent and severe and it’s important that landowners and businesses are aware of the legal restrictions for working in or near main rivers.
""Before doing so they must first gain authorisation from the EA so we can ensure that changes do not increase flood risk to others or damage the environment.
""Taylor showed a blatant disregard for the law and the community around him. Building unauthorised flood defences or conducting unauthorised works in a flood plain is a serious criminal offence and we are determined to take action to protect flood prone communities and the environment.""
During sentencing, Deputy District Judge Garland said Taylor was given ""repeated warnings"" and told him: “It’s clear that there was a deliberate disregard for the rules in the way you went about your business, creating a potential risk.”
The company which transported the waste to the Catterick Complex, Greenford Haulage & Aggregates Ltd, has previously been subject to an Enforcement Undertaking, donating £30,000 to Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust.
An Enforcement Undertaking is a voluntary offer made by companies or individuals to make amends for their offending, and usually includes a payment to an environmental charity to carry out environmental improvements in the local area."
YJ6TCLSGQB_CPK5FLENWO6FP9V,Looted gold regalia to be loaned back to Ghana by British Museum and V&A,By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073705.looted-gold-regalia-loaned-back-ghana-british-museum-v/,"Gold and silver regalia of “cultural, historical and spiritual significance” will be loaned by the UK back to Ghana more than 100 years after they were looted from the country.
Regalia associated with the Asante royal court will be displayed at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi later this year as part of a long-term loan commitment by the V&A and the British Museum.
Many of these items will be seen in Ghana for the first time in 150 years.
The Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) will lend 17 items while the British Museum will send 15 pieces under the three-year loan deals – with an option to extend for the same amount of time.
The collection from the V&A  includes all 13 pieces of Asante royal regalia, which was looted by the British army during the raid on and destruction of the royal palace in the 19th century.
Among the items are a gold peace pipe, three cast gold soul-washers’ badges and sections of sheet-gold ornament.
The items were acquired by the museum at an auction in April 1874.
A joint statement from the V&A and British Museum said: “These objects are of cultural, historical and spiritual significance to the Asante people.
“They are also indelibly linked to British colonial history in west Africa, with many of them looted from Kumasi during the Anglo-Asante wars of the 19th century.
“Some of these formed part of a British indemnity payment forcibly extracted from the Asantehene at the time while many others were sold at auction and later dispersed among museums and private collectors worldwide, including the British Museum and the V&A.”
Among the 15 objects from the British Museum are a small gold ornament in the form of a lute-harp (sankuo).
This ornament was one of the cast gold objects presented in 1817 to British diplomat Thomas Bowdich during his trip to Kumasi to negotiate a trade treaty.
The loan agreements are not with the Ghanaian government but with Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the current Asante King known as the Asantehene – who attended the coronation of the King last year.
The loans will form part of an exhibition planned to celebrate his silver jubilee, as well as commemorating the 150th anniversary of the 1873-4 Anglo-Asante war and the 100th anniversary of the return of the Asantehene Prempeh I from exile in the Seychelles.
Dr Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said: “150 years after the attack on Kumasi and looting of court regalia, the V&A is proud to be partnering with the Manhyia Palace Museum to display this important collection of Asante gold work.
“As part of our commitment to sharing collections with a colonial past, we are excited to see these items on public show, in Ghana, as part of Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II’s silver jubilee celebrations. We thank the Asantehene for his leadership and look forward to further collaboration.”
Dr Lissant Bolton, keeper of Africa, Oceania and the Americas at the British Museum, said: “We are privileged to have built a long-standing cultural partnership with the Manhyia Palace Museum, working together over the past five decades.
“This relationship is of great importance to us. We are delighted to be lending these beautiful and significant cultural objects for display in Kumasi in this the Asantehene’s Silver Jubilee year and the 150th anniversary of the Anglo-Asante war, and to be doing so through a collaboration with Manhyia Palace Museum and the V&A.”"
YX52RANHG7_TQGLUHLJJDX3Q1D,Ryanair agrees first deal with online travel agent,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24068128.ryanair-agrees-first-deal-online-travel-agent/,"Ryanair has launched its first partnership with an online travel agent (OTA) despite repeatedly branding the companies “pirates”.
The Dublin-based airline said it has agreed a deal with loveholidays to offer its flights as part of package trips.
Ryanair has previously strongly complained about OTAs selling its flights without permission.
Last week it highlighted companies such as Kiwi.com, Opodo, eDreams and lastminute.com overcharging passengers.
There is also an issue with passengers’ contact details not being passed on, making it difficult to provide travel updates and process refunds.
Ryanair insisted its partnership with loveholidays is “transparent” as travellers will not pay more than if they book direct, and the airline will receive accurate contact details.
At a press conference in London, Ryanair director of marketing, communications and digital Dara Brady claimed it was “a historic day” for the carrier.
He said: “Nobody is looking to overcharge customers here.
“Nobody is looking for customers not to get the right information, and in the case of where it does go wrong, we’ve a process that guarantees customers can get refunds.
“We’ve always said that if (OTAs) play by our rules, we’d be happy to work with others.”
He went on: “From a Ryanair respective I think it’s a very important step forward.
“We will continue to campaign hard against OTAs who don’t play by the rules.
“They’re pirates, we don’t want to deal with them.
“For legitimate partners like loveholidays – who are invested in the customer and are going to not apply mark-ups, and will give us the correct customer information, we’re happy to work with them.”
Loveholidays is the third largest provider of package holidays in the UK, and the largest OTA.
Chief marketing officer Al Murray said: “This new partnership highlights our commitment to championing consumer choice, with the overall aim of making travel more affordable and accessible while opening the world to everyone.”
Ryanair said OTAs stopped selling its flights in December, which caused a slight decrease in the proportion of seats filled on its aircraft.
Mr Brady said the loveholiday partnership is “certainly not in response to that” as the airline was happy for OTAs not to sell its flights."
ZDK3VH47YY_22A5C7AAQ7IKUHV,Families of Israeli hostages say ‘more needs to be done’ after meeting PM,By PA News Agency,_,20240123,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24067501.families-israeli-hostages-say-more-needs-done-meeting-pm/,"Families of Israeli hostages say more needs to be done after meeting the Prime Minister in London.
The relatives of hostages being held in Gaza landed in the UK on Monday for a three-day visit to raise awareness and call on the Government to put pressure onto leading figures in Qatar – which has helped to mediate negotiations between Israel and Hamas – to do more.
They said Rishi Sunak told them he is “going to do everything he can”, as they called for UK leaders to put pressure on Qatar to “pick a side”.
Ziv Abud told the PA news agency how she had to “hide under bodies” after her nephew and his partner were killed and her boyfriend was kidnapped on October 7.
Ms Abud, 26, fled the Nova party in Re’im with her family after the violence began, and they took shelter with 30 others in front of the Re’im base.
Hamas gunmen arrived and threw grenades into the shelter. Ms Abud’s partner, Eliya Cohen, 26, was shot in the leg.
Ms Abud’s nephew and his partner were killed along with 18 others.
Ms Abud said: “We were in the shelter for half an hour and after this we heard the shooting very, very close, five minutes after they were in our shelter.
“They threw more than nine grenades to the shelter. After they threw the grenades, they start to take people from the shelter.
“They took Eliya and three more people. They put them on a van then they came inside the shelter and start shooting everybody.”
She added: “I sat for six hours with their bodies, my nephew’s body in front of my eyes.”
Two weeks later, they saw a video which showed Mr Cohen, and they said they could see he was injured, but nothing is now known about his condition or his whereabouts.
Ms Abud and her friend Michal Rahoom told the Prime Minister what had happened and said Mr Sunak told them he would “do everything that he can to help” – but called for more to be done.
Ms Rahoom said: “He’s doing a lot, he’s going to a lot of meetings. He also been in Israel a couple of days after everything happened.
“So we really appreciate, but we need to do a lot more.”
Ms Abud added that she believes if Qatar wanted, the hostages could be “released tomorrow morning”.
Eli Albag, father of 18-year-old Liri Albag – who was kidnapped near the border, said it was “very important” for him to meet Mr Sunak and tell him his daughter’s story.
Ms Albag, who lives in Moshav Yarhiv in the centre of Israel and started her career training in the military, was kidnapped “from her bed” near the border with three other women.
He said some of the hostages who were released were with his daughter, and they described the conditions.
Mr Albag said: “They say that they don’t have food, they don’t have water, they don’t take a shower, they’re sleeping on the floor, very cold humidity, 40 metres under the ground.
“And the most important issue, they are touching them.”
There were some pictures taken of her 50 days ago, but no sightings or knowledge about her condition or whereabouts since.
Mr Albag has described his family as “broken”, adding: “All our lives have collapsed.”
Mr Albag, who showed the Prime Minster a photo of his daughter, said: “He was very sensitive and inside his heart is like a very warm person. And for me, it’s made me feel more close and that he understands our situation very well.”
Mr Albag said he was told by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary David Cameron that they will speak to Qatar.
He said: “They will have a meeting with them and they will talk to them and they know everything and David Cameron said that he’s coming to Israel, he will go to Egypt and he will go to Qatar too.”
Liran Berman, brother of 26-year-old twins Ziv and Gali – who were kidnapped from their house in Kfar Aza, showed Mr Sunak a picture of his little brothers and asked the Prime Minister to “keep pushing on the release of the hostages”.
Mr Berman, 36, said: “We know that the Prime Minister is very supportive of the cause of the release of the hostages. He was one of the first prime ministers, officials, to come to Israel after October 7.
“And I asked him to keep pushing on the release of the hostages, to not let it go. Half have been released, some have died, but there are a lot who are still being held captive. So we need his help.”
Mr Berman was two hours away from his brothers and felt “completely helpless” on October 7.
“Around 9.30am or 10am, we lost contact with my brothers,” he added. “We did contact them in the morning, they told us that they are in the safe room, later we found out that they were burning the rooms outside.
“For 10 days we knew nothing about them, they were considered missing, and then 10 days later an official came to us and told us they had been kidnapped and were in Gaza.”
Mr Berman said when hostages were released they told the family they had seen the twins, but they were not together and both had minor injuries.
He said his family are “very tired but very focused” and added that helping to release the hostages is the “mission of their lives”."
ZYL1G1XQWX_CLGZWQKHHN3K5EH,"Russian diplomat accuses US, South Korea of preparing for war with North Korea",By PA News Agency,_,20240125,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24073222.russian-diplomat-accuses-us-south-korea-preparing-war-north-korea/,"Russia’s top diplomat has accused the United States, South Korea and Japan on Wednesday of preparing for war with North Korea.
Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told a UN news conference that this new military bloc brought together by the United States is building up military activity and conducting large-scale exercises.
All of a sudden South Korea’s rhetoric “became even more hostile towards Pyongyang,” he said. “In Japan as well, we hear aggressive rhetoric” and it is seriously talking about setting up Nato infrastructure with US assistance.
Mr Lavrov said the objective of the military bloc is clearly stated: “They’re preparing for war with the DPRK,” the initials of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
The Russian minister said the US, South Korea and Japan have also been talking about developing their cooperation. “It’s quite wishy-washy the way they phrased it, but they said something like nuclear-related cooperation,” he said.
Last week, the three countries conducted combined naval exercises involving an American aircraft carrier in their latest show of strength against nuclear-armed North Korea.
North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has been on a provocative run of weapons testing and threats that raised regional tensions to their highest point in years. Senior diplomats from the three allies were to meet in Seoul to discuss the worsening standoff with Pyongyang.
On the other hand, Mr Lavrov said Russia’s relationship with the DPRK is “proceeding nicely, it’s developing quite actively.”
“We see that the DPRK is trying to be independent, not to dance anybody’s tune,” he said.
Mr Kim is one of the few world leaders openly supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine.
Mr Kim has been actively boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in an attempt to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing, as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.
When asked about Mr Lavrov’s comments, South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lim Soosuk said they reflected North Korea’s “constantly false and misleading claims as it tries to shift the blame to the outside world while developing nuclear weapons and missiles under its own schedule”.
He accused North Korea of further raising tensions with its weapons demonstrations this month, including missile tests and artillery test firings near a disputed sea boundary with the South.
Mr Lim said: “Our government has consistently expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue with North Korea without any preconditions.”
The alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang has raised international concern about alleged arms co-operation.
North Korea has been accused of providing Russia with arms supplies to help prolong its warfighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for economic assistance and military technology.
Both countries have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul that North Korea has been shipping artillery shells, missiles and other military equipment to Russia in recent months.
Mr Putin confirmed his willingness to visit the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, at a convenient time during his meeting with Mr Kim in Russia’s far east in September. Mr Lavrov said the timing will be decided by the Kremlin.
Mr Lavrov compared Mr Kim’s recent announcement that North Korea would not reunify with South Korea to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s statement saying there will be no Palestinian state after the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
“It’s terrible when, instead of unity, we have trends which divide us,” the Russian minister said. “And yet, this is a systematic process across many regions, and the main contributor to that trend are those who believe to be the masters of the universe.”"
