0Z632MLCGL_R5I2RG81TVF8VGR,Here are the questions about accountability that remain after the DOJ Uvalde report,"By Ray Sanchez and Rachel Clarke, CNN","9 minute read Published 7:42 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/us/uvalde-school-shooting-doj-accountability/,"More than a year and half after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, a US Justice Department report detailing failures at every level of the law enforcement response may have a provided a small measure of hope for the victims’ families in their quest for accountability.
While the lengthy report released Thursday did not address their demands for a criminal investigation and possible charges against law enforcement officers involved in the botched operation, it seems that process indeed has begun.
A special grand jury was reportedly empaneled Friday to investigate what the nation’s top law enforcement official described as a disorganized and chaotic response by hundreds of local, state and federal agencies.
The timing appeared to be unrelated. A pool of potential grand jurors had previously been summoned to appear Friday, reported The Uvalde Leader-News. CNN has reached out to the local prosecutor and court officials for comment.

“The community now has the kind of report necessary to make sure accountability occurs,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday. “I think it’s now up to the community, the state and local officials to make the appropriate determinations.”

A grand jury investigation would represent the first publicly known criminal proceeding related to the highly scrutinized response to the May 25, 2022, shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
The selection of a grand jury had been highly anticipated. But families of the victims have been frustrated by the delay in convening the panel.
“I feel like everyone’s just been pointing fingers at each other,” said Berlinda Irene Arreola, whose 10-year-old step granddaughter, Amerie Jo Garza, was killed at the school. “No one wants to take responsibility. Nobody wants to take accountability.”
District Attorney Christina Mitchell told the San Antonio Express-News the grand jury would review evidence related to the mass shooting, but declined comment on the focus of the investigation. Jurors are expected to spend at least six months investigating the case, according to The Uvalde Leader-News.
“Let the DA know we’re not going to go anywhere,” Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares was killed, told CNN Friday. “We’re going to stay here until charges are filed.”
The DOJ report is the fullest official accounting of what happened, though much had already been reported by CNN. Still, the assessment was limited in its scope.
“These families didn’t need a 400- or 500-page government report to learn that law enforcement failed them in a historic way,” Joshua Koskoff, an attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said Thursday.
The report does not make recommendations for punitive steps and its examination of the actions of federal officers at the scene is limited. The review was requested by the then-mayor of Uvalde, Don McLaughlin, who within weeks of the horror said he feared a “cover-up” and being shut out of other investigations amid changing narratives of what happened that day and who took on key decisions.
The Critical Incident Review said the continued gunfire, reports that a teacher had been shot, and a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman should all have prompted law enforcement officers to move to stop the bloodshed far sooner.
Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America’s ongoing scourge of campus shootings.

“Law enforcement can learn what happened in Uvalde to make sure something like this never happens ever again,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta told CNN Friday. “The first step of accountability – any basis for accountability – has to be truth and transparency, and that’s what we’ve tried to do.”
The DOJ said the victims “experienced unimaginable horror” and “witnessed unspeakable violence” as a result of the lack of courage and “cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training” on the part of law enforcement officials.
“The report concludes that had the law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices in an active shooter situation and gone right after the shooter to stop him, lives would have been saved and people would have survived,” Garland told reporters Thursday.
Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco was one of a handful of law enforcement officers named in the DOJ report, in which he was heavily criticized for not taking a leadership role. The report also confirmed CNN reporting that Nolasco knew the name of the gunman and that he had shot his grandmother before going to the school, but did not share that information.
“Sheriff Nolasco did not seek out or establish a command post, establish unified command, share the intelligence he learned from [the shooter’s] relatives, nor did he assign an intelligence officer to gather intelligence on the subject,” the DOJ report said.
“At one point, Sheriff Nolasco and UPD Acting Chief Pargas were within 10–15 feet of each other outside the exterior door of the northwest hallway; however, they were not coordinating with one another and continued to act independently.”
Then-school Police Chief Pete Arredondo, then-acting Uvalde Police Chief Mariano Pargas and Nolasco are singled out in the report for failing to lead. Arredondo was described by the Justice Department as the de facto on-scene commander.

Pargas resigned as acting police chief in November 2022 as the city was preparing to terminate him. A CNN report found he was aware students were alive in the classrooms and needed to be rescued but failed to organize help. Families of the victims have demanded that Pargas quit as a Uvalde county commissioner, a position he still holds.
CNN has reached out to Pargas for comment.
Arredondo, who was fired, has said he did not see himself as the incident commander and instead was “responding as a police officer.”
Nolasco should have questioned the decisions and lack of urgency shown by both Arredondo and Pargas toward entering the classrooms, the report said.
“I entrusted in the man with the gold badge,” Nolasco told CNN after the release of the report, referring to Arredondo. “I acted based on the information that was given to me.”
He told CNN he has already implemented some of the recommendations in the DOJ report, including increased training for his deputies.
Nolasco is running for reelection this year as county sheriff.
“We’re going to wait and see what the voters say. They have the last word,” he said.
Arreola said Thursday: “They have the audacity to run for reelection … knowing that they failed. And it’s there in black and white.”
State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said the reckonings had to go beyond the local officers, particularly to the state Department of Public Safety.
“There has been no accountability at the Department of Public Safety,” Gutierrez told CNN. “Nothing has been done to keep this from happening again.”
Asked about the possibility of the local justice system helping to deliver accountability, Gutierrez was scornful.
“This district attorney has had this case for 20 months,” he said. “There’s been nothing new. There’s no smoking gun. The shooter is dead. There’s no accomplices. There’s no nothing.”
He added, “Cops should have been indicted a long time ago for failure to render aid, for possibly criminal negligent homicide, so many different things. For 77 minutes those kids waited. … The errors that occurred were many. It wasn’t just against the local cops, the local police chief and the sheriff. We need to look at the Department of Public Safety and their head officers that were there on the scene that absolutely did nothing to safeguard these children.”

Some police officers have been convicted for their actions during encounters that resulted in death. But prosecutions and convictions of law enforcement personnel for failing to protect the public during mass shootings are uncommon.
Scot Peterson, the former school resource officer who stayed outside during the February 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was found not guilty last year of seven counts of felony child neglect, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury.
“That is going to be hard,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said of the likelihood of criminal charges related to the law enforcement response in Uvalde. “Being afraid is not a crime, having bad tactical judgment is not a crime, and neither is incompetence under pressure.”
President Joe Biden, who said Thursday he had not yet read the full report, added that he didn’t “know that there’s any criminal liability.”
The DOJ report also questioned the actions of the Texas Department of Public Safety. For instance, the initial crime scene investigation, which was the responsibility of the DPS, was hampered by too many people walking into the two classrooms.
Col. Steve McCraw, DPS director, told CNN in September 2022: “I’ll be the first to resign. I’ll gladly resign. I’ll tender my resignation to the governor if I think there is any culpability in the Department of Public Safety. Period.”
McCraw was responding at the time to minutes of a meeting obtained by CNN that quoted him telling highway patrol captains “no one is losing their jobs” over the inept law enforcement response.
A month later, McCraw told angry families of slaughtered Robb students calling for him to resign: “If DPS as an institution failed the families, failed the school, or failed the community of Uvalde, then absolutely, I need to go. But I can tell you this right now: DPS as an institution right now did not fail the community, plain and simple.”
In a statement Thursday, DPS thanked the Justice Department for its report. “As DPS Director Steven McCraw first stated in the weeks after the shooting, the law enforcement response that day was an abject failure, and this report’s observations underscore those failures,” the DPS said.
DPS has not responded to requests for comment on the findings in the Justice Department report.
Seven of 91 DPS officers who responded to Robb Elementary were referred for investigation to the agency’s inspector general for their actions the day of the massacre. At least two have left voluntarily. The department did move to fire a Ranger, but he is still on the payroll as he challenges the termination.

Separately, DPS and the county district attorney continue to fight a request by CNN and other media organizations to release public records related to what happened at Robb Elementary.
Gutierrez said accountability should also include stricter gun control legislation. He said the law enforcement officers were afraid of the power of the assault-style rifle used by the gunman, and bought legally days after his 18th birthday.
“Politicians need to stop being cowards. They need to see the videos that I’ve seen, they need to see what this gun does,” he said.
Politicians “need to fully and finally pass an assault weapons ban in this country so that we do not see this happen again to another child,” said Gutierrez, who is running in the Democratic primary to be the challenger to Republican Texas US Sen. Ted Cruz this fall.
Koskoff, the attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said: “The questions that are not answered in this report are significantly more important than the questions that are.”
On Wednesday night, the frustrated parents of Khloie Torres, who was 10 when she survived the 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary, walked out of a meeting with Garland and other families before it was over.
Ruben and Jamie Torres left the meeting after about an hour. They expressed disappointment at what they heard ahead of the official release the next day of the DOJ report. They hadn’t heard anything new, the parents said.
Veronica Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was killed in the shooting, said the families will not stop their demands for accountability.
“I think we’re going to continue fighting,” she said. “We’re going to continue fighting that some type of change is made in honor of our kids.”

16USZZHDEH_6ZR668HKVJP2QTL,Media literacy is more than spotting fake news. How one librarian gives teens the tools to decide what to trust,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:13 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/us/teaching-media-literacy-in-schools/,"Along with the smell of old books and the shelves of trendy novels at the South Brunswick High School library are guides for accurately deciphering the digital world.
Poster after poster with “Smart Social Networking” tips and what “Good Digital Citizenship” looks like hang at this New Jersey campus, where school librarian Lisa Manganello has made it her mission to teach teenagers to navigate the vast – often deliberately confusing – landscape of online information.
“Media literacy has absolutely nothing to do with which side of the debate you’re on,” the 17-year veteran of this still-emerging academic subject told CNN. “And I often say to my students, I don’t care if you are conservative or if you are liberal, it really doesn’t make a difference to me.
“Whatever article you’re choosing, I want you to be able to look at it from a critical lens and really make a decision about whether or not this is a trustworthy article,” Manganello told CNN. “You can have an opinion on either side, but you should be able to validate that opinion with a fact-based article.”
Media literacy is the ability to decode media messages – including the systems in which they exist – assess their influence on thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and create media thoughtfully and conscientiously, according to Media Literacy Now, an advocacy group that tracks and drives the subject’s implementation in K-12 schools across the United States.
With lots of kids now getting their news from social media – where disinformation and content created by artificial intelligence run rampant – 18 states have some form of K-12 media literacy education on the books, according to Media Literacy Now. Of those, four – Delaware, Texas, New Jersey and, starting this year, California – mandate media literacy, with lesson standards now being crafted state by state.
Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows
Online misinformation, of course, can direct kids not only to messages that aren’t true but also to dangers like cyberbullying, negative body image and a path into substance abuse, the group says. And so the potential impact of teaching them how to interpret what they see online could be nothing short of “life-changing,” said Olga Polites, New Jersey chapter leader for Media Literacy Now.
When cars were invented, for instance, auto safety wasn’t widely talked about, seatbelts weren’t a priority and learning how to drive was a whole new landscape, she said.
“(Cell) phones are like cars,” Polites told CNN. “But we haven’t really taught people how to use them ethically, efficiently and responsibly.”
To do that, a media literacy lesson might include analyzing which emotions the wording of a mass media headline evoke. Or parsing the photo that runs alongside the text of a news piece. Or using “lateral reading” – lining up stories on the same topic in browser tabs to compare credibility, intent and biases – as Manganello did a few weeks ago at South Brunswick High School.
With a variety of news headlines displayed on her projector screen, the librarian asked 25 students in history teacher Jeff Johnson’s American government class the following:
“Te﻿ll me words that you see in these headlines that you think shows bias?”
“Revenge,” one student quickly said, though with a little hesitation in his voice.
“Ah, revenge!” Manganello replied.
The group, armed with personal laptops and seated four to a table, kept discussing: What might a more neutral word choice have been?
“I thought it was very interesting to think about how we get our information and how we interpret it because of what (the media is) telling us, especially the part where it was talking about the word choice that people use and how it can influence your opinions,” ninth grader Harrison Pekosz told CNN later.
In elementary and middle school, Harrison learned about identifying legitimate sources of information based on a web address ending with “.com” or “.org.”
“Now, it’s more in-depth, and I know there’s more to look at than just domain,” he said.
Soon, Manganello shifted the lesson to photos and asked students to identify whether an image attached to a news article was “flattering, neutral or unflattering.” The choice, she said, could help determine whether the piece as a whole is trustworthy – or not.
“Information literacy is the umbrella for all of the things that we teach in the library … to make sure that our students have all the tools they need to do both information gathering and to engage with media that could be online, social media, for research,” Manganello said. “Media literacy kind of falls under that information literacy banner.”
Beyond the library, Manganello works with teachers at South Brunswick High School throughout the year to incorporate information literacy into their lesson plans, from art history to science classes. She also speaks at educational conferences, where attendees have approached her to ask how they can get started implementing her work in their schools, she said.
On her own campus, Manganello’s goal is to see every student a few times a year, focusing on a new skill each time over their four years, she said. In the end, students have a kit of tools to tap into when they’re scanning the latest headlines – especially online.
Akshara Satheesh and Urja Kandale, both ninth graders at South Brunswick High School, get their news from TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat or Google’s News Discovery feed because of how simple it is to understand storylines, they told CNN.
And they’re not alone.
“We found that 75% of them get their information off of social media, many off of TikTok,” Manganello told CNN.
It’s not an unfathomable stat, considering a growing number of adult TikTok users in the US report getting their news on the short-video platform, according to 2023 data from the Pew Research Center.
That in itself isn’t necessarily a problem: Plenty of reputable news agencies share their reports on social media platforms.
Here’s the catch: 96% of high school students surveyed in in 2018 and 2019 failed to accurately judge the credibility of a piece of information online, Stanford University research found. And two-thirds couldn’t tell the difference between news articles and advertisements on the home page of US news agency.
“Students displayed a troubling tendency to accept websites at face value,” wrote the study’s authors.
In fact, more than 80% of middle school students a few years earlier believed an ad identified by the words “sponsored content” was a real news story, a Stanford survey published in 2016 found; some students even mentioned it was sponsored content but still believed it was a news article.
Teens should be trained before entering the world of social media, APA says
“Young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak,” those authors wrote.
The confusion derives – at least in part, experts say – from the fact that most students aren’t being taught how to use mass media critically, said Polites of Media Literacy Now in New Jersey.
“We’ve given (teens) so little guidance,” Polites said. “And there’s so much life-changing risk that comes with that.”
From Manganello’s lesson, Akshara and Urja’s major takeaways included narrowing their focus on key terms, they said.
“I’ve done stuff like this before,” Urja said, “but we didn’t dive deep.”
While Manganello’s program at South Brunswick High School is a great model, right now it’s the exception, said Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.
“We’re getting legislators to put their foot down and say, ‘We need to see some changes in our education system,’ but now it’s, ‘Where is the funding coming from?’” she said. “‘Where’s the support for teachers and their professional development? How are we really integrating this into our curriculum, across school(s), across a big area, across grade levels?’
“And that is a much broader, slower, more challenging conversation, because it’s expensive and time-consuming.”
New Jersey’s governor last year signed a law that requires the state Education Department to develop student learning standards in information literacy. And California starting this year requires media literacy instruction to be integrated into K-12 mathematics, science and history-social science curriculums when they’re revised, according to the bill.
But getting the frameworks and grade-specific lessons down in writing can take several drafts, even before public comment is sought and polished proposals presented to district leaders, said Elisabeth Yucis, associate director in the Professional Development and Instructional Issues Division at the New Jersey Education Association, an educators union.
Teachers are on the front lines of a battle to change how teens use social media
All in all, the process could take a while, she said.
Meanwhile, Johnson, the history teacher at South Brunswick, hopes in 10 years his students will be able to find clarity in what they’re thinking and saying because of the foundation Manganello is creating for them.
Johnson wants his students to learn to say, “‘Wait a minute, why am I feeling like this? Do I believe this?’” he said. “Or, ‘I just told somebody something happened, but did I even check that that actually happened or that that’s even a big deal to me? Like, why am I saying it’s a big deal?’”
And indeed, Harrison, the ninth grader, already is thinking about how important these lessons are for the future.
“Now that there are more people turning 18 and a lot of them are getting all of their information from social media … I think that will impact how they vote and will impact the country as a result,” he said.
It’s why Manganello has spent nearly two decades perfecting how she teaches media literacy.
“These are kids that are going to go out and do brilliant things,” the librarian said. “We need them to think about how they accept information in a smarter way because I think that will change the way we all do.”"
2DPLOCR4EC_43E85LUTTKE9W6L,US personnel injured in attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq,"By Oren Liebermann, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:09 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/al-asad-air-base-iraq-us-personnel-injured/,"US personnel were injured in a ballistic missile attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq on Saturday, two US officials said.
The attack was one of the largest-scale ballistic missile attacks to date that the US has seen carried out by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday. Two US service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries and have since returned to duty, she said.
US Central Command confirmed the attack Saturday evening.
Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets targeted the base and, while most were intercepted by the base’s air defenses, some made impact, the CENTCOM statement said.
The use of more powerful ballistic missiles, far rarer than rockets or one-way attack drones, comes at a time of growing tension in the region as the Israel-Hamas war passes 100 days.
US and coalition forces have faced increased threats from Iranian-backed Shia militias since the start of the war. As of Thursday, US and coalition forces had come under attack more than 143 times in Iraq and Syria since October 7; Saturday’s incident appears to be the second time ballistic missiles have been used to attack the US.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iranian-backed militia group, claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack.
In a statement, the group emphasized its commitment to resisting American “occupation forces” in the region and cited the attack as a response to what it referred to as the “Zionist entity’s massacres” against the Palestinian people in Gaza. The group did not provide any evidence for its claim.
In November, militants in Iraq fired close-range ballistic missiles at coalition forces, prompting the US to carry out airstrikes against facilities used by the Iranian-backed group Kataib Hezbollah, which has been responsible for many of the rocket and drone attacks against the coalition.
US forces in Iraq and Syria operate as part of the coalition to defeat ISIS. But the Iraqi government has called for international forces to ultimately leave the country after US strikes targeting Kataib Hezbollah facilities — which marked the first time the Biden administration had carried out strikes in Iraq since the war in Gaza began — caused tension with the Iraqi government.
“We believe that reorganizing the relationship through ending its presence will prevent more tensions and entanglement of internal and regional security issues,” Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told Reuters earlier this month.
The UN secretary-general’s special representative for Iraq has also warned that the region is at a “critical juncture” with the war in Gaza, saying in a statement that Iraq is at risk of being further drawn into the conflict.
“Despite the Government’s efforts to prevent the escalation of tensions, continued attacks — originating from within and outside of Iraq’s borders — stand to undo the hard-won stability of the country and the achievements it has made in recent years,” the statement said.
The Pentagon has maintained that the presence of its forces is still at the invitation of the Iraqi government and nothing has changed. National security adviser Jake Sullivan met with al-Sudani earlier this week in Davos, Switzerland, and the two discussed the “importance of sustaining a strong bilateral partnership,” the White House said in a readout.
The US, separately, is also facing threats in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have launched repeated attacks on international shipping lanes, including at least two strikes on US-owned vessels this week, leading some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the critical waterway.
The US has carried out a series of increasingly frequent strikes targeting Houthi assets and President Joe Biden said Thursday the strikes will continue, while conceding that the US strikes haven’t deterred the group’s attacks.

2H89Z7ATWJ_2BGRVTTWCZVGKBI,Netanyahu again rejects Palestinian sovereignty amid fresh US push for two-state solution,"By Abeer Salman, Mitchell McCluskey, Ibrahim Dahman, Sophie Tanno, Kevin Liptak and MJ Lee, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:47 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/middleeast/netanyahu-palestinian-sovereignty-two-state-solution-intl/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday rejected calls for Palestinian sovereignty following talks with US President Joe Biden about Gaza’s future, suggesting Israel’s security needs would be incompatible with Palestinian statehood.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu said in a post on X
The Israeli leader did not provide any other details in his one-line post in Hebrew. The territory west of Jordan encompasses Israel, the occupied West Bank, and Hamas-run Gaza, where Israel is battling the militant group following the October 7 attacks.
Biden and his top officials — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited Israel and the region last week — have said the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel’s security is the only way to finally bring peace and stability to the Middle East.
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called opposition to a two-state solution “unacceptable.”
“The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable,” Guterres posted on X.
Amid reports the US, Egypt and Qatar want Israel to join a new phase of talks with Hamas, Netanyahu this weekend also publicly rejected what he characterized as Hamas’ terms for releasing more Israeli hostages from Gaza: an end of the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, and the release of more Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
“If we agree to this - our soldiers fell in vain. If we agree to this - we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” Netanyahu said Sunday.
Netanyahu’s comments comes amid a rift with the US, Israel’s most important ally, on what Gaza will look like once the conflict ends, and exposes the complex position Netanyahu is in.
The Israeli prime minister is facing competing pressure from the international community to allow the creation of a viable Palestinian state and domestically to guarantee Israel’s security, most notably from far-right members of his coalition.
Adding to the pressure, he is also facing calls for early elections, with thousands taking to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday. Critics have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to stay in power. War cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot says he hopes that is not the case, but also says elections should happen within months.
Netanhahu’s statement on Palestinian sovereignty appears to run counter to what he told President Biden a day earlier, CNN reporting suggests. Netanyahu had told Biden in a private phone call on Friday that he was not foreclosing the possibility of a Palestinian state in any form, a personal familiar with the conversation told CNN.
Biden administration officials have recently been engaged in discussions about a future demilitarized Palestinian state, an idea the US president finds “intriguing,” the source said.
Following the phone call, their first in weeks, Biden told reporters he believed Netanyahu could ultimately be convinced of some kind of two-state solution. “There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” he said.
“There’s a number of countries that are members of the UN that are still – don’t have their own military; a number of states that have limitations, and so I think there’s ways in which this can work,” Biden added.
But the day after Biden spoke, the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement: “In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.”
Biden and Netanyahu remain publicly at odds over the question of what will happen to Gaza once the Israel-Hamas war concludes, despite intense American efforts over the past several months to engage officials in Israel and the wider region on a plan they hope can finally resolve the decades-long conflict.
The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, dating back to the 1947 UN Partition Plan, and many nations say that it is the only way out of the conflict.
It remains an open question how post-war Gaza will be governed but Netanyahu has had long-standing objections to a two-state solution.
And while Netanyahu’s stance is contentious internationally, he faces pressure from more right-wing members of his cabinet who have caused outrage with their suggestions on what should happen to people living in Gaza.
Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has championed the idea of a Palestinian exodus from Gaza. He and far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir sparked anger when advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip."
4ACYTRNDB7_35H0TMRRDNVLVRK,Trump goes all in on attacking Nikki Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,"By Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:29 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/trump-haley-new-hampshire/,"Former President Donald Trump spent the three-year anniversary of his White House departure trying to sweep away the few remaining Republican obstacles to his third consecutive nomination, hammering former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and warning supporters against complacency two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester, “because we have to send real unity as a message.”
But over more than 90 minutes, Trump delivered the vengeful message that he has made the focus of his campaign, moaning about the lost 2020 race; defending the January 6, 2021, rioters; pushing again for the Supreme Court to declare him and all presidents immune from prosecution; mocking President Joe Biden; and, with the most gusto, lashing out at Haley, his former UN ambassador and the candidate closest to him in Granite State primary polls.

Even before he spoke, Trump’s campaign beamed its message on a big screen above the stage with rotating slides attacking Haley over supposed ties to “Democrats, Wall Street & Globalists” and her positions on Social Security and other hot-button issues.
When he took the microphone, Trump kept up the barrage.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to run the radical Democratic campaign operation she’s running,” Trump said, referencing his rival’s appeal to some centrist and anti-Trump political groups and donors. “What the hell kind of Republican candidate is that?”
After running through a laundry list of policy criticisms, most pointedly Haley’s campaign pledge to raise the retirement age for younger people, delaying their access to Social Security payments, Trump jabbed back at Haley over her suggestion that he is too old to be president again – which followed an incident in which Trump confused her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it,” Haley, 52, said earlier Saturday of Trump, 77, at a rally in Keene, New Hampshire.
Trump shot back at the rally, claiming he’s recently taken a “cognitive test,” which he “aced,” before promising to “let you know when I go bad.”
After finishing third in Iowa behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley’s campaign is on the line in New Hampshire. A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters there support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley has the support of a majority — 58% — of registered undeclared voters, but the former president is backed by 67% of registered Republicans.

Granite State voting rules — and their potential to help Haley — were a frequent target for Trump on Saturday night, as the former president groused over the potential for those who don’t consider themselves Republicans or typically vote for the GOP to cast ballots in its presidential primary.
But he added a false flourish to that case, telling the audience that Democrats, too, can take part on the Republican contest. They cannot.
“Registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary, and registered Republicans cannot vote in the Democratic primary,” New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan told CNN earlier this week after Trump leveled a similar charge.
Trump also looked ahead to the next major clash in the race: South Carolina. It’s Haley’s home state, where she was twice elected governor, but Trump leads there in the polls and among influential GOP leaders – a handful of whom showed up in New Hampshire.
“We could be in our home state, but we chose to come up to New Hampshire for a reason,” Rep. Russell Fry said. Gov. Henry McMaster invoked the Spice Girls – really – to tell voters “what we want, what we really really want” is Trump.

“We’re going to be there in three weeks, so you know what I’m doing,” Trump said of his guests, adding, “I’m kissing ass.”
Again, it was Trump’s desires that took centerstage.
He repeated his contention that all US presidents, beginning with him, should have immunity from prosecution. This relatively new line of argument comes as Trump awaits a ruling from a federal appeals court regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In the meantime, he’s argued presidents should never face legal consequences for their actions.
The court hearing the claim has expressed skepticism, but Trump is continuing to make his case in public. On Saturday night, he invoked President Harry Truman’s use of the nuclear bomb in Japan in 1945 as a case study.
“Look at Harry Truman,” Trump said. “He wouldn’t have done, if you think Hiroshima, not exactly a nice act but it did end the Second World War probably, right? Nagasaki. He wouldn’t be doing that; he said, ‘I don’t want to do that because my opponents will indict me.’”
The US dropped atomic bombs on both cities toward the end of the war, killing at least 150,000 in Hiroshima alone, according to some estimates. Though the morality of the decision has been debated, no one sought to bring legal charges against Truman.
Trump had much less to say about DeSantis. He even made a point of noting how little he’d spoken about the Florida governor (before proceeding to mock his height at the prompting of a supporter). He had more kind words, though, for Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban.
“It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” Trump said of the strongman, happily reciting the nice things that Orban has recently said about him.

4YDWOLVNR7_23WRH34SESRROJ5,What voters in New Hampshire have to say about Nikki Haley and Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary,"By Arit John and Jeff Zeleny, CNN","7 minute read Updated 4:52 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-voters/,"Danielle Brown voted for John McCain in the 2000 New Hampshire Republican primary and for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary eight years later. On Tuesday, she intends to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to send a clear message to both parties.
“We need to have some new ideas and a new, younger generation coming in,” Brown, an undeclared voter, said as she clutched a Haley 2024 yard sign freshly autographed by the candidate. “Haley is energized. I think she can do a lot for our country.”
Brown is a voter stuck in the middle, one of thousands of undeclared and independent residents who make up a plurality of the Granite State’s electorate and a critical part of Haley’s coalition. Her chances in New Hampshire – and by extension, the fate of her campaign – likely hinge on how many independents vote for her in the state’s primary Tuesday.

As of Friday, 344,335 voters in New Hampshire were registered as undeclared, making up nearly 40% of the electorate.
Haley’s campaign is targeting Republicans and undeclared voters from the suburbs to the seacoast, advisers said, particularly in precincts where Trump underperformed other Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu. Though former President Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, he lost the state in the general election in both 2016 and 2020.
A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley is backed by a majority – 58% – of registered undeclared voters, but the former president has the support of 67% of registered Republicans.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon, was backed by just 6% of New Hampshire GOP voters in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would have needed to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
A win in New Hampshire could offer Haley’s campaign the momentum, and donor money, necessary to compete in South Carolina on February 24 and the Super Tuesday states voting on March 5.
A loss, however, might hasten the speed at which the Republican Party coalesces around Trump.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who ended his own presidential bid in November, became the latest former candidate to endorse Trump at a rally in Concord on Friday. Haley dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that Trump was lining up “Washington insiders” despite vowing to drain the swamp.
“But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do,” Haley said.
As Trump campaigns in New Hampshire, the former president is trying to keep Republicans in line – and out of reach for Haley.
“Nikki Haley in particular is counting on the Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Portsmouth on Wednesday.
His rallying cry is false. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and the deadline for registering as a Republican or undeclared voter was October. Undeclared voters have the option to choose either a Democratic or Republican primary ballot on Election Day.

Greg Moore, a senior adviser for AFP Action, the political network backed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that has thrown its resources behind Haley, said Friday that the group’s data shows the former governor’s base includes conservative voters. AFP Action, which endorsed Haley in November, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire, Moore said.
“I think some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump,” Moore said. “I know that’s not true.”
What the former president may not know is that Haley’s rallies and town hall meetings in New Hampshire last week were filled with voters like Susan Rice of Rochester, who twice voted for Trump.
Rice, who owns a yarn business in New Hampshire and Maine, was invited to the White House in 2018 during the Trump administration for an event to showcase small-business leaders. She said she believed it was time for the country to move on.
“I’m a staunch Republican and I have been my entire life,” Rice said. “I think it’s time to have a woman as a president. I like her foreign policies and I like the fact that she has a good understanding of our southern border and what she wants to do for that.”
She said she was exhausted by Trump and excited by Haley’s potential to rebuild the Republican Party.
“I don’t necessarily worry about the court cases,” Rice said. “But it’s the baggage, and honestly, sometimes what comes out of his mouth and – how do I put this diplomatically – the name-calling, the putting other people down.”
Michael Lewis, a Hollis resident, said he supported the way Trump approached the economy, the border and America’s relationship with NATO, but he couldn’t vote for a presidential candidate “whose age is past life expectancy.”
He also expressed doubts that Trump will still be eligible to run for president in the general election.
“I think the sequence is there’s campaigning, then there’s the [Republican National] Convention, then there’s going to be the conviction of Donald Trump,” Lewis said. “There’s going to have to be an alternative. I think she’s the answer.”
Still, while some former Trump voters are open, even eager, to vote for Haley, the former president’s base in New Hampshire remains strong.
“MAGA is not going to be with her,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday.
That was the sentiment at the Saddle Up Saloon in Kingston on Friday afternoon, where GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio rallied a few dozen Trump supporters. In interviews, attendees mentioned several criticisms Haley’s rivals have leveled against her foreign policy views and her conservatism.
Sylvia, a Nashua voter at the event who declined to give her last name, said she would sit out the general election if Trump made Haley his running mate.
“She’s a RINO, she’s a war monger,” she said, using the acronym for “Republican in name only.” “I’m not for her at all.”
Bill Jackson, an 86-year-old from Hampton who plans to vote for Trump, said he believed Haley has support only among elitists and echoed the former president’s comments about Democratic crossover votes.
“She’s pro-war. She’s also pro-immigration, illegal immigration,” he said. “I mean, she said we’ve got to treat these people as equals. No, we don’t, they’re illegally coming into this country.”
Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have tried to paint Haley as weak on border security. Haley has responded by saying securing the border would be a top priority of her administration. She has characterized herself as a conservative and said her advocacy for a strong US foreign policy is meant to prevent war.
On the trail, Haley has expanded on the pitch she started making on the night of the Iowa caucuses – that she is the best chance voters have of preventing both Trump and President Joe Biden from winning a second term. She has highlighted polls that show her beating Biden in a general election by a wider margin than the GOP front-runner, and argued that she would help Republicans down ballot win House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
A Marist poll released Friday found Haley running near-even with Biden, 47% to 44%, in a New Hampshire general election matchup, while Trump trailed Biden by 7 points.
Haley has also sought to draw comparisons between Trump and Biden, from their ages to the amount of government spending they approved in office, and said both presidents come with “baggage.”
Her revamped stump speech also pushes back more aggressively against the Trump campaign’s characterization of parts of her record, including her position that the retirement age needs to be raised for people in their 20s and 30s. In a recent ad, Trump’s campaign incorrectly claimed Haley wants to limit Social Security for current beneficiaries.
Haley noted that Trump supported raising the Social Security age to 70. Trump supported raising the Social Security age in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” but wavered on whether to cut entitlements since running for president in 2016, CNN’s KFile reported last year.
“If he’s going to lie about me, we’re going to tell the truth about him,” Haley said in Hollis on Thursday. “You’re going to see a lot of things said, but at the end of the day it’s the drama, and vengeance, and the vindictiveness that we want to get out of the way.”
The message resonated with Nancy Protzmann, an undeclared voter who attended the Hollis event and said she’s long been looking for a candidate to back against Trump. As she left the venue, she said she plans to request a Republican ballot and vote for Haley.
“I will do anything in my power to make sure that Trump does not become our next president,” Protzmann said. “But I liked what she said – and I don’t want Biden either.”
Asked whether her decision was intended to be more of an affirmative vote for Haley or a roadblock for Trump, she said ideally both.
“I hope it will be a launching pad for her, because I do think she would be a good president,” Protzmann said. “And I certainly hope it will help block him.”

5P7X5K3BVE_FRZ71KY3QZ9EVZC,Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution,"By Sandee LaMotte, CNN","9 minute read Updated 11:55 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/health/antibiotic-resistant-germs-phages-wellness/,"Cynthia Horton’s earaches are the stuff of nightmares.
“I can wake up from my sleep in horrible pain, like I’m having a root canal with no anesthesia,” she said. “When I sit up, my ear is often weeping with infection, even oozing blood.”
Already weakened by a lifelong battle with lupus, Horton’s immune system was devastated by rounds of radiation and chemotherapy after a 2003 surgery for a cancerous tumor in her ear.
Ear infections became the norm, usually eased by a round of antibiotics. But as the years passed, the bacteria in 61-year old Horton’s ear became resistant to antibiotics, often leaving her with little to no relief.
“These multi-drug-resistant superbugs can cause chronic infections in individuals for months to years to sometimes decades. It’s ridiculous just how virulent some of these bacteria get over time,” said Dwayne Roach, assistant professor of bacteriophages, infectious disease and immunology at San Diego State University.
Last year doctors offered to treat Horton’s infection with one of nature’s oldest predators — tiny tripod-looking viruses called phages designed to find, attack and gobble up bacteria.
The microscopic creatures have saved the lives of patients dying from superbug infections and are being used in clinical trials as a potential solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. In the United States alone, more than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year.
Such infections are a “urgent global public health threat,” killing 5 million people worldwide, according to 2019 statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” said infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee, codirector of the first dedicated phage therapy center in North America, the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, at UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Eager for a different solution to her recurrent ear infections, Horton was game. Samples of her drug-resistant bacteria were shipped from her doctor’s office in Pennsylvania to UC San Diego’s IPATH with the hopes that phage hunters there could find a match. What scientists discovered next, however, was unexpected.
The bacteria cultured from Horton’s ear were a perfect match to a rare superbug found in certain brands of over-the-counter eye drops that were robbing people of their vision and lives.
Suddenly, the search for a solution to Horton’s problem took on new meaning. Would the bacteria from her ear help scientists find phages that would treat the eye infections as well?
Severe cases of antibiotic-resistant eye infections began popping up in May 2022. By the following January, the CDC said at least 50 patients in 11 states had developed superbug infections after using preservative‐free artificial tears. By May 2023, the outbreak had spread to 18 states: Four people died, another four lost eyes, 14 suffered vision loss, and dozens more developed infections in other parts of the body.

“Only a fraction of patients actually had eye infections, which made the outbreak incredibly difficult to solve,” said epidemiologist Dr. Maroya Walters, who led the CDC’s artificial tears investigation.
“We saw people who were colonized by the organism develop urinary tract or respiratory tract infections months down the road, even though they were no longer using these drops,” Walters said. “One patient spread the infection to others in the health care facility.”
The culprit was a rare strain of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never been identified in the United States before the outbreak, the CDC said.
Horton had never used eye drops, yet the bacteria cultured from her ear were the same rare strain. Using those bacteria and other samples sent by the CDC, scientists at IPATH immediately went to work and identified more than a dozen phages that successfully attacked the deadly pathogen.
Scientists at the CDC were intrigued by the discovery, so much so that they mentioned the availability of the phage treatment for the superbug on the CDC website.
“It brought up this idea of when we have an outbreak that’s caused by bacteria with such limited treatment options, should we be thinking about these alternative therapies?” Walters said.
What is this little creature that can topple bacteria capable of withstanding all the drugs that modern science can muster? And more importantly, could phage treatment become a major player in the battle to end the superbug crisis?
Thanks to evolution, the gazillions of bacteria in the world today have a natural enemy: tiny viruses called bacteriophages genetically programmed for search-and-destroy missions. In this microscopic game of “The Terminator,” each set of phages is uniquely designed to find, attack and devour a specific type of pathogen.
“Each bacterial species, or even genotypes within it, can have a whole repertoire of phages that are attacking it, using a wide variety of methods to enter and debilitate the bacterial cell,” said Paul Turner, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University and microbiology faculty member at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
To counter the attack, bacteria employ various evasive maneuvers, such as shedding their outer skins to eliminate docking ports the phage use to enter, ravage and ultimately explode the pathogen into bits of bacterial goo.
That’s good news because the newly naked bacteria may lose their resistance to antibiotics, becoming once again vulnerable to elimination. The phage, however, is taken out of action, no longer able to fight.
To maximize success, specialists search for a variety of phages to tackle a particularly nasty superbug — at times creating a cocktail of microscopic warriors that can hopefully continue the attack when one is neutralized.
That’s what happened in 2016 to Strathdee’s husband, Tom Patterson, a retired professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego. Due to an infection with “Iraqibacter,” a drug-resistant bacterium found in the sands of Iraq, Patterson was in multi-organ failure and perilously close to death. In a race against time, Strathdee overcame incredible obstacles to find and deliver several cocktails of purified phages to Patterson’s doctors.
One of those cocktails contained a phage that “scared the bacteria so much that it dropped its outer capsule,” said Strathdee, an associate dean of global health sciences at UC San Diego and coauthor of “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug.”
“It was more afraid of the phage, if you will, than the antibiotic, and that allowed the antibiotic to work again. It was the one-two punch Tom needed,” Strathdee said. “Three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”
In labs around the country, phage scientists are taking research and discovery to the next level, or what Strathdee calls “phage 3.0.” Scientists in Turner’s Yale laboratory are busy mapping which phages and antibiotics are most symbiotic in the fight against a pathogen. Roach’s San Diego State lab is investigating the body’s immune response to phages while developing new phage purification techniques to prepare samples for intravenous use in patients.
Currently, clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of phages against intractable urinary tract infections, chronic constipation, joint infections, diabetic foot ulcers, tonsillitis and the persistent, reoccurring infections that occur in patients with cystic fibrosis. The chronic infections common in cystic fibrosis are typically due to various strains of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa — the same pathogen responsible for Horton’s ear infection and the artificial tears outbreak.
A number of labs are developing libraries of phages, stockpiled with strains found in nature that are known to be effective against a particular pathogen. In Texas, a new facility is taking that a step further — speeding up evolution by creating phages in the lab.
“Rather than just sourcing new phages from the environment, we have a bioreactor that in real time creates billions upon billions of phages,” said Anthony Maresso, associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
“Most of those phages won’t be active against the drug-resistant bacteria, but at some point there will be a rare variant that has been trained, so to speak, to attack the resistant bacteria, and we’ll add that to our arsenal,” Maresso said. “It’s a next-generation approach on phage libraries.”
Maresso’s lab published a study last year on the treatment of 12 patients with phages customized to each patient’s unique bacterial profile. It was a qualified success: The antibiotic-resistant bacteria in five patients were eradicated, while several more patients showed improvements.
“There’s a lot of approaches right now that are happening in parallel,” Roach said. “Do we engineer phages? Do we make a phage cocktail, and then how big is the cocktail? Is it two phages or 12 phages? Should phages be inhaled, applied topically or injected intravenously? There’s a lot of work underway on exactly how to best do this.”
To date, genetic manipulation of phages has been difficult due the streamlined nature of the creature: “Normal phages are optimized by evolution to be lean, mean, killing machines. There’s very little room in there for us to get in and change things,” said Elizabeth Villa, a professor of molecular biology at UC San Diego who studies a new form of phage called “jumbo” phages.
“Jumbo phages have very large genomes and come close to having a nucleus that encapsulates the genetic material, which protects them from some of the mechanisms bacteria use against phages to deactivate them,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who is codirector of IPATH.
“That also gives them room to be engineered to become more potent, so they’re very promising phages to be used therapeutically,” Schooley said.
Genetically engineering phages would allow scientists to target each person’s unique mix of antibiotic-resistant pathogens instead of searching sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria to find just the right phage for the job.
Along with phage libraries, genetic engineering is also a key to churning out phages in mass, to distribute on a wider scale. In Russia and the country of Georgia, where phage therapy has been used for decades, patients can buy phage cocktails off the shelf in pharmacies.
All this work has caught the attention of the CDC. In addition to using a phage cocktail to treat a superbug outbreak in real time, phages could also help fight a broader issue — the recolonization of the infected person with the same superbug, the CDC’s Walters said.
“The issue is that when patients have infections with these drug-resistant bacteria, they can still carry that organism in or on their bodies even after treatment,” Walters said. “They don’t show any signs or symptoms of illness, but they can get infections again, and they can also transmit the bacteria to other people.”
However, if phages could be used to “decolonize” a bacterial population inside a high-risk person, “patients could really decrease the likelihood of developing an infection and spreading to others, which is a big part of the problem,” Walters said.
“We were thinking about trying to develop a curated phage collection that would be active against a large number of certain resistant organisms,” she added. “Pseudomonas is a good place to start — there are more than 140 different species. But there are many other organisms that threaten us that we also need to tackle.”"
77GCPLCH1T_O8VEFL51MC4T6AN,Opinion: Our possibly short national nightmare,"Opinion by Richard Galant, CNN","12 minute read Updated 9:19 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/trump-biden-new-hampshire-column-galant/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
On August 9, 1974, the only unelected vice president in American history took the presidential oath of office at a White House ceremony. It was the day after President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.
“My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Gerald Ford said.
“Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.” In words that sound almost foreign to our ears in the 21st century, Ford added, “As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.”
Last week the true-crime docuseries that shot to the top of the list of Netflix shows in the US was “American Nightmare.” But it wasn’t that kind of nightmare, or Gerald Ford’s one, that presidential candidate Nikki Haley invoked Monday after her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
“Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,” the former UN ambassador said. She was referring to polls showing that the majority of Americans don’t want a rematch between President Joe Biden and the president he defeated in 2020, Donald Trump.
When the results of the New Hampshire primary are reported Tuesday, we’ll have a better sense of whether anyone can stand in the way of that dreaded rematch. If not, it won’t be as protracted a “national nightmare” as the two-year-long Watergate scandal that put Gerald Ford in the Oval Office. This year’s election is on November 5 — and the inauguration is only one year away. Though, depending on your point of view, the real nightmare could begin after the swearing-in.
Haley is walking a tightrope, trying to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status among Republicans without alienating his MAGA base. “There’s an outside chance she can pull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump’s perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “But there’s another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control… If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP’s second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.”

Haley has been wary of directly going after the former president’s many vulnerabilities, while obliquely arguing that the nation can’t risk having a president in or nearing his 80s and that “chaos follows” Trump, whether or not it is his fault.
“Her ability to build momentum over the course of the primary showcases her political talent and ability to attract college-educated Republicans tired of having to explain away their support for a president whose hair-trigger social media posts verge into the unhinged,” wrote Patrick T. Brown.
Daniel McCarthy isn’t buying into the idea that Haley has momentum: “Former President Donald Trump’s easy win in Iowa on Monday confirms that there really is no race for the Republican nomination this year. With a deep freeze discouraging turnout, the caucuses provided a hard test of voter enthusiasm. Trump’s rivals failed it.”
“A measure of the former president’s insurmountable strength within the party is that he not only beat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, he also overcame all of the institutional powers backing them — some of the most formidable interests in the GOP.”
On the Democratic side, Biden isn’t even on the ballot Tuesday and isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire, due to a dispute between state and national party officials over the primary’s timing.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a low-profile 54-year-old legislator from Minnesota, is running in New Hampshire, SE Cupp noted, and is polling more strongly there than around the nation. It’s a longshot, Cupp noted, but “if Biden’s poll numbers keep going in the wrong direction, if voters feel taken for granted or even overlooked by Democrats, if a symbolic win in New Hampshire gives voters a reason to look more closely at Dean Phillips, well he might give Biden a run for his money.”
Karen Finney is the great-great-great-great niece of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and great-great-great granddaughter of a freed slave from Virginia.
“Walking through the door of my grandmother’s home in North Carolina,” Finney wrote, “it was impossible to miss a portrait of Lee proudly displayed on the wall. At mealtimes, during what occasionally felt like indoctrination, she would admiringly describe our famous ancestor, ‘the General,’ as a benevolent slave owner and noble warrior.”
“As she explained it, Lee valiantly fought an unjust ‘War of Northern Aggression’ in defense of ‘states’ rights,’ often referred to as ‘The Lost Cause.’ The South had been defeated, my grandmother insisted, only because the Northern army had more resources and slavery really wasn’t so bad.”
In Finney’s view, the Lost Cause is the backdrop for Trump’s suggestion that the Civil War could have been “negotiated,” the rewriting of history in school curriculums under Florida Gov. DeSantis’ administration and Haley’s struggle over the question of whether America is, or ever was, a racist country.
“Beyond absurdly omitting slavery as the root cause of the War, she made matters worse while trying to clean up her comments during a recent CNN Town Hall, saying she just assumed that slavery was a ‘given’ since all children learn about it in school in the South.”

Trump’s remark that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of Americans evokes the words of Adolf Hitler in “Mein Kampf,” author Paul Moses pointed out. But he added that the concept goes further back — to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century.
In 1914, the year Edward Alsworth Ross became president of the American Sociological Association, he published a book warning that immigrants, Moses wrote, “would act on Americans’ standards for cleanliness, morality and education ‘like a slow poison.’ A nation that relies on immigration to maintain its population ‘deserves the extinction that surely awaits it,’ he wrote…The prejudice beneath Ross’ opinions was obvious, but his ideas were mainstream and respectable — he was considered a progressive reformer…”
“But Ross came to regret the implications of his ideas about supposedly superior and inferior races, writing shortly after World War II that ‘we never imagined the theory being made a hinge for German aggression to turn on.’ That’s what the phony claims of eugenics led to — Hitler’s ‘Final Solution,’ which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. It’s certainly worth having vigorous debates about immigration laws, but those who’ve been indifferent to or even supportive of Trump’s increasingly clear turn toward racist, eugenic ideas should confront what they’ve enabled.”
Republicans describe the immigration surge at the US southern border as an “invasion” that presents a national security threat. Yet, John Avlon wrote, Trump and some members of the House GOP, want to tank an emerging compromise in the Senate that would couple border security measures with aid to Ukraine.
“Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more threats from his far-right flank, who have been signaling that they will balk at any border security bill until a Republican is president.
“Right-wing resistance is entirely consistent with a Trump-ified GOP that is more willing to demagogue an issue than actually deal with it.”

Trump sat in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday while E. Jean Carroll testified in support of her defamation case against the former president. Last May, she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation when a jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her. Now Carroll is seeking at least $10 million in additional damages for Trump’s 2019 comments about her allegation.
As Danielle Campoamor wrote, “Carroll found herself facing down not only a man found liable for assaulting her, but also a former president and current presidential frontrunner — an unprecedented example of the power dynamics survivors face. While a victim of sexual assault receives death threats, her assailant receives endorsements and secures the Iowa caucus.”
“During Carroll’s testimony, Trump repeatedly shook his head, according to CNN reporters inside the courtroom, and could be heard ‘loudly saying things’ such as ‘it’s false,’ ‘she’s gotten her memory back,’ and, according to Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley, that the lawsuit is ‘a witch hunt’ and a ‘con job.’”
When the judge threatened to oust Trump from the courtroom, the former president said, “I would love it.”
The chaotic court proceeding is just one example of why the Supreme Court should clear the way for allowing television cameras at Trump’s forthcoming election subversion trial, argued Robert C. Gottlieb. “Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue to impugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display during Wednesday’s court proceedings will undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.”
“The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.”
The narrative of fast-worsening inequality over the past half century has been challenged in a new study by economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They used data to show that, compared to the 1960s, the pre-tax income of the top 1% has increased only by 2.6% and after accounting for taxes, the share of income going to the super-rich “hasn’t budged at all,” wrote Jordan McGillis. The study disputes a 2018 finding by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman that the top 1% has seen its share of national pre-tax income go from 12% to 20% since the 1980s.
McGillis says there’s something else going on that tends to exacerbate inequality. Among rich Americans, marriage rates remain high, but they’ve plummeted for less affluent people, creating more single-person households with lower levels of income. “This cleavage makes possible what the Brookings Institution’s Melissa Kearney describes as “two-parent privilege,” an emerging phenomenon through which well-off couples transmit educational and economic advantages to their children. Viewed from this angle, it should not surprise us that many Americans think the rich are galloping ever further ahead.”
Elise Gould and Josh Bivens have a different take. Using Social Security Administration data, they found that the “share of earnings for the bottom 90% fell 9.7 percentage points between 1979 and 2022, while the share of earnings for the top 5% grew 8.8 percentage points. The very top — the top 0.1% of wage earners — nearly tripled its share of total earnings from 1.6% in 1979 to 4.6% in 2022… All of this straightforward data on earnings clearly shows a huge rise in inequality of pay in the US economy.”
The US and the UK struck back at the Houthis, the Yemeni insurgent group that is targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but the lingering question was about how effective such a series of strikes can be. “We think of war as a last resort,” Elisabeth Kendall, head of Cambridge University’s Girton College told Peter Bergen. The Houthis “think of it as a way of life.”
“The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets,” Kendall said.
CNN Opinion senior editor Sheena McKenzie interviewed Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital, and asked him about the future for Palestinian children amid the war in Gaza.
“There is no future for them,” he said. “How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?”
“The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.” (Hear more from Sheena McKenzie on the Tug of War podcast.)
There is a lot of talk but very little real debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict on US college campuses, wrote Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University.
“Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who ‘Stand with Israel’ and those seeking ‘Justice for Palestine.’… Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.”
“The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.”
“It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority.”

When Holly Thomas was 12, she “received a large — unsolicited — Estee Lauder makeup sampler for Christmas. The box felt like a totem of my impending maturity, recognition that I would soon be allowed access to an as-yet out-of-reach club. I gave it pride of place on my bedroom table (swiftly rebranded as a “dresser” with the help of a soon-to-be filthy sarong), and before too long I was regularly being sent out of class, cheeks burning, to wash my contraband mascara off.”
“It wasn’t a particularly edifying phase, but neither was it very consequential. Today however, skin care is a far more serious business. Gone are the days of teens aimlessly browsing random drugstores by day and smudging their pillows with iridescent bronzer by night. Now, kids don’t just know how to cleanse properly, they’ve taken to beauty products with unprecedented zeal. Absurd though it sounds, that fervor is acutely ominous,” Thomas wrote.
“Dermatologists report children as young as nine, many of whom already maintain elaborate at-home skin care regimes coming to their offices for cosmetic consultations. Teens who’ve barely exited puberty are obsessing over the alleged ‘preventative’ anti-aging properties of Botox, and the internet is teeming with youngsters pleading for solutions to their ‘wrinkles.’ The fretting and groupthink involved bear all the hallmarks of a classic youthful infatuation. But this one comes with sinister undercurrents less familiar to the adults who went before them.”
“The most worrying thing about today’s skin care craze isn’t just that the financial and emotional buy-in are completely out of proportion to the “need” being addressed. They may set kids up for lasting damage. And thanks to the misinformation soup of social media, the gnarly, anxiety-provoking call is coming from inside the house.”"
7K0F8W3Z6D_VQCCVA7J77W5EPS,"Yes, employers can set a mandatory retirement age. What you need to know","By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","6 minute read Published 12:00 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/success/mandatory-retirement-age-boards-ceos/,"Former US Vice President Al Gore, 75, is stepping down from Apple’s board because of the company’s age-based restrictions for its directors, and it raises the question of ageism in Corporate America.
By no means is age 75 — or any age over 65 — an automatic disqualifier for US corporate leaders.
Consider: The top 10 oldest CEOs of companies on the Russell 3000 — led by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett — ranged in age from 84 to 91 in 2022, according to The Conference Board and ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE. As of this writing, they are all still on the job.
In fact, mandatory retirement ages are more of an exception than a rule in Corporate America, and they don’t exist for US lawmakers or surgeons or many other jobs. But they do exist in a lot of public-safety occupations.
Here’s a look at where they are most and least prevalent, and why.
Having a mandatory retirement policy for board members is up to the discretion of individual companies. But a majority do have them.

“In 2023, 69% of [S&P 500] boards reported having a mandatory retirement policy — down one point from 2022,” according to an August 2023 report from executive search firm Spencer Stuart.
Among those with such policies, the vast majority (97%) set the retirement age at 72 or higher, with 57% putting it at 75 or older, the report noted.
“Director retirement policies continue to be quite commonly found in corporate organizational documents, as the need for board refreshment is ongoing,” said Matteo Tonello, a managing director at The Conference Board, who advises members about governance issues.
That’s due largely to the need for boards to diversify in a number of ways, Tonnello said, citing gender and racial diversity and also diversification in terms of qualifications and skills, such as having experience with emerging technologies.
It is harder to quantify how many companies impose a mandatory retirement age for CEOs and other senior leaders, Tonello said.

For one thing, some companies may have retirement age policies on paper but will disregard them when they want to keep someone on.
“Boards often override them due to the inconvenient circumstances the company may face when the policy is triggered,” he said.
Those circumstances can be a company going through a crisis (or conversely performing very well); a tight labor market for senior talent; or an economic downturn.
For example: Target CEO Brian Cornell was 63 in 2022, when he and the board agreed he would stay on another three years. The board said it would eliminate its policy of discussing a CEO’s retirement when he or she turns 65.
And in 2021, in the midst of Boeing’s 737 Max crisis, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun turned 64. The company board waived its mandatory retirement age of 65 and announced it would extend it to age 70 for Calhoun.
But waiving a mandatory retirement age policy for one CEO doesn’t mean a board won’t resurrect it for someone else.
“These policies have often disappeared from corporate governance principles or other organizational documents. [That] does not mean though that they have been rescinded, since there is no disclosure obligation related to them. And many boards may choose to unofficially keep them in place, [and] use them only when convenient,” Tonello explained.
Then again, boards may not have to make the call too often since many CEOs leave well before traditional retirement age. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks CEO exits, reports that “the average age of an exiting CEO was 56 in 2023, down from over 63 in 2017.”
Thanks to federal and state age discrimination laws, generally speaking it is illegal for companies to impose a mandatory retirement age for rank-and-file employees, said Thomas McKinney, a partner at the employment law firm of Castronovo & McKinney, LLC.
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act applies to all companies with 20 or more employees. But a state can decide to apply prohibitions to a wider swath of employers if it chooses. For example, McKinney noted, New Jersey prohibits all companies, regardless of how many employees they have, from imposing a mandatory retirement age on workers.
So why is it okay for companies to push their CEOs and board members out the door after a certain age?
There is an exception in the ADEA that lets companies set retirement ages for anyone 65 or older if they are a bonafide executive or high-level policymaker (which includes senior executives other than CEOs or board members) and who stands to receive non-forfeitable retirement benefits valued at a minimum of $44,000 a year.
Individual states may set a lower retirement benefit threshold.
The ADEA, however, does not apply to organizations of all kinds.
For example, McKinney notes, it does not cover partners and shareholders in closely held corporations. So doctors or lawyers working in a small practice may be asked to hand in their work ID when they turn 65 or older.

However, there is no official required retirement age for surgeons when it comes to physically operating on patients. But the American College of Surgeons put out a statement in 2016 — which the ACS still stands by today — that recommends surgeons, “starting at age 65-70,” voluntarily seek out physical, visual and cognitive testing among other measures.
Many other public safety occupations do have mandatory retirement ages. Commercial airline pilots, for instance, under federal law may no longer fly commercially after turning 65 (though there has been a legislative push in Congress to increase that age to 67).
Federal and state police officers are typically subject to mandatory retirement ages, too, McKinney said.
In New York State, for instance, state police officers with at least 20 years’ service must retire after turning 60. But US Capitol Police officers with that same tenure must retire at 57, although in 2020 they were temporarily exempted from that requirement.
Other federal jobs subject to mandatory retirement ages are “firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, air traffic controllers, and customs and border protection officers,” according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
There may be varied stated reasons for having a mandatory retirement age, such as opening up the pipeline for younger talent to have more opportunities. Or, in the case of boards, as Tonello noted, there is often a desire to diversify and fill roles with various types of expertise.
But the underlying reason for retirement age policies is often more of a knee-jerk assumption.
“What is behind these mandatory retirement policies and laws is an assumption that somebody older is not as qualified, competent or productive,” said Mary O’Neill, an attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Or, in the case of public-safety jobs, “there’s an assumption that age is connected with safety and physical competence,” O’Neill said.
But all such assumptions are based more on “myths, fears and stereotypes” than fact, she said, noting that performing individual assessments of employees is a better way to determine competency of all kinds — physical, mental and psychological.
“There will be some 33-year-olds who don’t have the ability to do a job if you do an individual assessment,” she said.
And some 65-year-olds may not make the grade either. But some will.
For that reason, advocates for older workers, like the AARP, contend all mandatory retirement ages should be eliminated, even for demanding jobs involving public safety.
“Numerous scientific and medical studies find no need for this age-based discrimination,” the AARP notes in its latest policybook on employment issues.
“Public safety would be better served by periodically testing the fitness of public-safety employees, regardless of age, rather than relying on arbitrary age restrictions.”"
7KG78W70B0_P7IIT9F8B263L25,DeSantis ends 2024 presidential campaign and endorses Trump,"By Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:58 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/desantis-ends-2024-campaign/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who entered the Republican presidential primary as Donald Trump’s greatest threat, announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president.
His announcement, made in a video posted on X, comes after a disappointing second-place finish in last week’s Iowa Republican caucuses.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it, but I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,” DeSantis said.
He then touted his support for Trump: “While, I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.”
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement, because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,” he said.
His departure leaves former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the lone Trump alternative in the race but without much time to consolidate support and catch up to the front-runner.
DeSantis’ decision came after days of conversations with donors. It became clear over the weekend that there was neither the rationale nor the financial support to continue his candidacy.
DeSantis and his wife Casey made the decision Sunday afternoon, surprising many of his rank-and-file staffers and supporters.
DeSantis called top donors personally and told them that he had woken up that morning and decided there was no path to winning and it was time to get out, two Republican donors with knowledge of the calls told CNN.
DeSantis told the donors that there was no reason to waste his time and money staying in the race. DeSantis said there was no path to victory with Trump in the race, recalling how he kept hearing from attendees at his events that, “if it wasn’t for Trump, I would vote for you.”
The two sources said DeSantis knows he is young and if he is to have a chance at winning the GOP presidential nomination in 2028, he needed to endorse Trump.
It’s a devastating blow to the promising career of a once-rising GOP star, and his failure to reach the lofty expectation of his candidacy has already sparked a wave of second-guessing from close allies and advisers. Some believe DeSantis took too long to attack former President Donald Trump. Others think his team underestimated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
More yet remain convinced that there was nothing DeSantis could have done to wrestle the party from Trump’s loyal and sizable followers.
“DeSantis has run the playbook to a T,” Steve Deace, a well-known conservative radio commentator and supporter of the Florida governor, told CNN in recent weeks. “It’s just as simple as: when they started indicting Donald Trump, people weren’t ready to move on from him. And for DeSantis, it wasn’t quite his time.”
For his part, DeSantis has blamed his performance on a host of challenges, including Iowa’s weather, conservative media’s loyalty to Trump and the unprecedented barrage of negative ads against him. One thing he hasn’t faulted was his main pitch to voters – his record of accomplishment in Florida – which he continued to feature in speech after speech until his final moments as a presidential candidate.
Last week’s outcome in Iowa proved an especially devastating blow. DeSantis had once vowed to win the state, then predicted he would perform well, claiming his ground game would reveal itself as a secret weapon. He instead finished nearly 30 points behind Trump and barely edged out Haley for second place, sapping his credibility along with the enthusiasm for him.
DeSantis vowed to fight on, but after Iowa, it was increasingly clear to many around him that his campaign had run its course.
Trump can now take credit for upending the political futures of three of the most prominent and promising Republican politicians in his adopted home state: DeSantis, former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (the latter two of whom he bested in the 2016 Republican presidential primary).
It is unclear what is next for DeSantis, who, at age 45, has three years remaining in his second term as governor before he is term-limited. In recent weeks, DeSantis has planted the seeds for a potential 2028 bid, claiming that some Trump supporters have already encouraged it.
“They were coming up to me saying, ‘We want you in 2028, we love you, man,’” the governor recently told reporters.
DeSantis had an inauspicious start on the path to White House contender. It wasn’t until his third term in the US House in 2017 that he began to make a name for himself as a loyal defender of Trump on Fox News. On the website then known as Twitter, Trump called DeSantis “a true FIGHTER!”
With Trump’s backing, DeSantis won the Florida governorship in 2018. DeSantis then spent the next four years charting a path distinct from his one-time ally. He found his lane as an unabashed and willing culture warrior who broke from the medical community during the coronavirus pandemic and dove into national controversies over immigration, education and LGTBQ issues, earning fawning media coverage from right-wing outlets along the way.
By the time of his 19-point reelection victory in 2022 – when a GOP red wave fizzled elsewhere and many Trump-backed candidates flamed out – a presidential campaign was all but certain. Republicans looking to move on from Trump saw a resume straight out of central casting: blue-collar roots, Little League star, a college athlete at Yale, Harvard law degree, Navy veteran and a photogenic young family.
Beyond that, DeSantis at that point had never lost a race.
“DeFuture,” declared the New York Post, the tabloid published by conservative media mogul Rupert Mudoch, the morning after the midterm election, with DeSantis and his wife Casey, a top confidant, splashed across the cover.
But DeSantis slow-walked his entrance into the race – there was first a book to sell and a legislative session to oversee – and, once in, he struggled to match those lofty expectations. More critically, DeSantis failed to convince other Republican presidential hopefuls that he and Trump stood alone atop the GOP and spent the 2023 summer running against a crowded field instead of the former president.
The campaign trail proved a challenging environment for DeSantis, who had grown accustomed to holding court and chastising media from behind a lectern. His political foes gleefully elevated his stiff and awkward interactions with voters. In eight months as a candidate, he struggled to articulate a coherent rationale for his candidacy and focused more often on his past accomplishments as a governor than his ideas for the future.
His campaign was also beset with cost overruns and shakeups that dogged him throughout the summer. A small group of loyal but inexperienced advisers in Tallahassee regularly clashed with the veteran GOP operatives who commanded his super PAC, led by strategist Jeff Roe. By the time Iowans caucused, the super PAC, Never Back Down, was on its fourth CEO, had undergone an exodus of staff and advisers and was no longer running ads.
Still, DeSantis remained a viable candidate until the voting started, a testament to a relentless appetite for campaign stops and media appearances. In Iowa, for example, he visited all 99 counties and had earned the support of the state’s popular Republican governor, Kim Reynolds.
But it was clear in the days after the Iowa caucuses, when he appeared tired and sounded dejected, that the grind of the campaign had taken its toll. DeSantis maintained, though, that he had no regrets about running.
“If I had been sitting on the sidelines, and Republicans end up losing in 2024, people then would have said, ‘Oh, well, you had the opportunity to do something, and you didn’t,’” he said in a recent interview. “So, any one can sit there and carp on the sidelines – get in the arena, and fight for what you believe in.”

AKRLBS3LUQ_IAYTM0PI2PU5IDP,Iran blames Israel for assassination of its military advisors in Damascus missile strike,"By Sarah El Sirgany, Adam Pourahmadi, Artemis Moshtaghian and Jonny Hallam, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:32 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/world/iran-israel-missile-damascus-military-intelligence-intl/,"At least five Iranian military advisors and a number of Syrian forces were killed in an Israeli missile strike on a building in Damascus on Saturday, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, in another sign of building hostilities in the Middle East as Israel’s war with Hamas enters its fourth month.
The alleged strike targeted the Mazzeh neighborhood in Syria’s capital, home to several diplomatic missions including the Iranian embassy, according to Syrian authorities.
Israel “launched an air attack from the Golan Heights at 10:20 a.m. local time that targeted a residential building in the Mazzeh neighborhood,” the Syrian Ministry of Defense alleged, adding that some missiles were shot down by national defense forces.
A number of buildings and nearby vehicles around the targeted building were damaged in the blast, Syria’s state broadcaster reported, with civil defense teams still searching for victims trapped under the rubble.
The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the incident, telling CNN, “We do not comment on foreign reports.”
One of the dead, Hojjatollah Omidvar, was described by Iran’s semi-official Student News Network as a deputy chief of the Quds Force intelligence unit in Syria – one of five branches of the Revolutionary Guards unit in charge of foreign operations.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) identified the four others killed as military advisors Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi. Their presence in Syria had been “at the official invitation of the Syrian government,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, noted in a statement on social media.
The attack in Damascus comes amid concerns that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza is spiraling into a regional war. In northern Iraq, an Iranian missile attack last week targeted what Tehran claimed to be a spy base for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. in Lebanon, militant group Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily confrontations with Israeli forces across the border. And from Yemen, Houthi rebels have launched a series of attacks on commercial ships and Western military vessels in the Red Sea.
Attacks by Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East won’t stop until Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza ends, Tehran’s top diplomat warned on Wednesday, echoing comments by several groups in Iran’s network of influence.
“If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.
Since Israel launched its ground and air campaign in Gaza, in response to Hamas’ bloody October 7 terror attacks, nearly 25,000 people have been killed in the blockaded Palestinian enclave – the majority of them women and children – according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.
The US, a key Israel ally, has also stepped in militarily, launching strikes in Yemen with the aim of degrading Houthi capabilities to harm the vital Red Sea shipping lane. In comments on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller emphasized that a larger conflagration could be avoided and highlighted a flurry of US diplomatic activity in the Middle East.
“We continue to engage in diplomatic efforts to try to make clear to everyone in the region that we don’t want to see the conflict escalated, that we don’t think it’s in any country’s interest to see the conflict escalated,” Miller said Wednesday.
But the path to de-escalation will be hard to find. Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday vowed to “punish” Israel for the Damascus missile strike. The killing was “another stain on the record of all governments who claim to be the advocates of human rights because it violated Syria’s airspace and trampled on human and international laws,” he said, in comments reported by Iranian state media.

Ariel, a spaniel, was born with multiple health defects. She was named after the Disney princess because her extra back legs were partly fused together, resembling a mermaid’s tail.
She was taken in by Greenacres Rescue, a non-profit group based in the town of Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The group arranged Ariel’s surgery and set her up with a foster family.
Ariel is recovering and walking normally, Greenacres Rescue said in a post shared on Facebook.
“Our wonderful and special little spaniel has been discharged from Small Animal Referral Hospital Langford Vets University of Bristol and is back in the comfort of her wonderful foster home,” the group wrote, sharing photos of Ariel wrapped up in a red blanket post-surgery.
They added that her procedure “went as well as expected” and she now has a few weeks of recovery ahead of her.
“Ariel has to now rest for the next 10 to 14 days to recover,” the group said. “We will post updates over that time.”
“There were two procedures which lasted about two hours but both went fine,” the charity’s founder Mikey Lawlor said of Ariel’s operation in comments to the UK national news Press Association agency.
“The next day she was up, walking around and eating and drinking.”
Lawlor said there had been an outpouring of support for Ariel from people around the world, including calls and emails from as far as Australia.
“I just can’t say enough of a thank you to everyone who’s contributed to helping her,” Lawlor said.
Ariel will likely be discharged from hospital this weekend and brought home to her foster family."

“We believe this was a small gathering that turned deadly,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said at an early morning news conference.
Investigators aren’t sure whether the suspected shooter or shooters were already inside the house, or if someone came uninvited to the house and began opening fire, Gonzalez said. There is also evidence of shots being fired outside the house along the street, he added.
Police are working to investigate the shooting and identify suspects and determine if other people were injured, Gonzalez said."
BQQZTIIHZX_28CUZURFWUKLPN3,Media literacy is more than spotting fake news. How one librarian gives teens the tools to decide what to trust,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:13 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/us/teaching-media-literacy-in-schools/,"Along with the smell of old books and the shelves of trendy novels at the South Brunswick High School library are guides for accurately deciphering the digital world.
Poster after poster with “Smart Social Networking” tips and what “Good Digital Citizenship” looks like hang at this New Jersey campus, where school librarian Lisa Manganello has made it her mission to teach teenagers to navigate the vast – often deliberately confusing – landscape of online information.
“Media literacy has absolutely nothing to do with which side of the debate you’re on,” the 17-year veteran of this still-emerging academic subject told CNN. “And I often say to my students, I don’t care if you are conservative or if you are liberal, it really doesn’t make a difference to me.
“Whatever article you’re choosing, I want you to be able to look at it from a critical lens and really make a decision about whether or not this is a trustworthy article,” Manganello told CNN. “You can have an opinion on either side, but you should be able to validate that opinion with a fact-based article.”
Media literacy is the ability to decode media messages – including the systems in which they exist – assess their influence on thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and create media thoughtfully and conscientiously, according to Media Literacy Now, an advocacy group that tracks and drives the subject’s implementation in K-12 schools across the United States.
With lots of kids now getting their news from social media – where disinformation and content created by artificial intelligence run rampant – 18 states have some form of K-12 media literacy education on the books, according to Media Literacy Now. Of those, four – Delaware, Texas, New Jersey and, starting this year, California – mandate media literacy, with lesson standards now being crafted state by state.
Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows
Online misinformation, of course, can direct kids not only to messages that aren’t true but also to dangers like cyberbullying, negative body image and a path into substance abuse, the group says. And so the potential impact of teaching them how to interpret what they see online could be nothing short of “life-changing,” said Olga Polites, New Jersey chapter leader for Media Literacy Now.
When cars were invented, for instance, auto safety wasn’t widely talked about, seatbelts weren’t a priority and learning how to drive was a whole new landscape, she said.
“(Cell) phones are like cars,” Polites told CNN. “But we haven’t really taught people how to use them ethically, efficiently and responsibly.”
To do that, a media literacy lesson might include analyzing which emotions the wording of a mass media headline evoke. Or parsing the photo that runs alongside the text of a news piece. Or using “lateral reading” – lining up stories on the same topic in browser tabs to compare credibility, intent and biases – as Manganello did a few weeks ago at South Brunswick High School.
With a variety of news headlines displayed on her projector screen, the librarian asked 25 students in history teacher Jeff Johnson’s American government class the following:
“Te﻿ll me words that you see in these headlines that you think shows bias?”
“Revenge,” one student quickly said, though with a little hesitation in his voice.
“Ah, revenge!” Manganello replied.
The group, armed with personal laptops and seated four to a table, kept discussing: What might a more neutral word choice have been?
“I thought it was very interesting to think about how we get our information and how we interpret it because of what (the media is) telling us, especially the part where it was talking about the word choice that people use and how it can influence your opinions,” ninth grader Harrison Pekosz told CNN later.
In elementary and middle school, Harrison learned about identifying legitimate sources of information based on a web address ending with “.com” or “.org.”
“Now, it’s more in-depth, and I know there’s more to look at than just domain,” he said.
Soon, Manganello shifted the lesson to photos and asked students to identify whether an image attached to a news article was “flattering, neutral or unflattering.” The choice, she said, could help determine whether the piece as a whole is trustworthy – or not.
“Information literacy is the umbrella for all of the things that we teach in the library … to make sure that our students have all the tools they need to do both information gathering and to engage with media that could be online, social media, for research,” Manganello said. “Media literacy kind of falls under that information literacy banner.”
Beyond the library, Manganello works with teachers at South Brunswick High School throughout the year to incorporate information literacy into their lesson plans, from art history to science classes. She also speaks at educational conferences, where attendees have approached her to ask how they can get started implementing her work in their schools, she said.
On her own campus, Manganello’s goal is to see every student a few times a year, focusing on a new skill each time over their four years, she said. In the end, students have a kit of tools to tap into when they’re scanning the latest headlines – especially online.
Akshara Satheesh and Urja Kandale, both ninth graders at South Brunswick High School, get their news from TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat or Google’s News Discovery feed because of how simple it is to understand storylines, they told CNN.
And they’re not alone.
“We found that 75% of them get their information off of social media, many off of TikTok,” Manganello told CNN.
It’s not an unfathomable stat, considering a growing number of adult TikTok users in the US report getting their news on the short-video platform, according to 2023 data from the Pew Research Center.
That in itself isn’t necessarily a problem: Plenty of reputable news agencies share their reports on social media platforms.
Here’s the catch: 96% of high school students surveyed in in 2018 and 2019 failed to accurately judge the credibility of a piece of information online, Stanford University research found. And two-thirds couldn’t tell the difference between news articles and advertisements on the home page of US news agency.
“Students displayed a troubling tendency to accept websites at face value,” wrote the study’s authors.
In fact, more than 80% of middle school students a few years earlier believed an ad identified by the words “sponsored content” was a real news story, a Stanford survey published in 2016 found; some students even mentioned it was sponsored content but still believed it was a news article.
Teens should be trained before entering the world of social media, APA says
“Young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak,” those authors wrote.
The confusion derives – at least in part, experts say – from the fact that most students aren’t being taught how to use mass media critically, said Polites of Media Literacy Now in New Jersey.
“We’ve given (teens) so little guidance,” Polites said. “And there’s so much life-changing risk that comes with that.”
From Manganello’s lesson, Akshara and Urja’s major takeaways included narrowing their focus on key terms, they said.
“I’ve done stuff like this before,” Urja said, “but we didn’t dive deep.”
While Manganello’s program at South Brunswick High School is a great model, right now it’s the exception, said Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.
“We’re getting legislators to put their foot down and say, ‘We need to see some changes in our education system,’ but now it’s, ‘Where is the funding coming from?’” she said. “‘Where’s the support for teachers and their professional development? How are we really integrating this into our curriculum, across school(s), across a big area, across grade levels?’
“And that is a much broader, slower, more challenging conversation, because it’s expensive and time-consuming.”
New Jersey’s governor last year signed a law that requires the state Education Department to develop student learning standards in information literacy. And California starting this year requires media literacy instruction to be integrated into K-12 mathematics, science and history-social science curriculums when they’re revised, according to the bill.
But getting the frameworks and grade-specific lessons down in writing can take several drafts, even before public comment is sought and polished proposals presented to district leaders, said Elisabeth Yucis, associate director in the Professional Development and Instructional Issues Division at the New Jersey Education Association, an educators union.
Teachers are on the front lines of a battle to change how teens use social media
All in all, the process could take a while, she said.
Meanwhile, Johnson, the history teacher at South Brunswick, hopes in 10 years his students will be able to find clarity in what they’re thinking and saying because of the foundation Manganello is creating for them.
Johnson wants his students to learn to say, “‘Wait a minute, why am I feeling like this? Do I believe this?’” he said. “Or, ‘I just told somebody something happened, but did I even check that that actually happened or that that’s even a big deal to me? Like, why am I saying it’s a big deal?’”
And indeed, Harrison, the ninth grader, already is thinking about how important these lessons are for the future.
“Now that there are more people turning 18 and a lot of them are getting all of their information from social media … I think that will impact how they vote and will impact the country as a result,” he said.
It’s why Manganello has spent nearly two decades perfecting how she teaches media literacy.
“These are kids that are going to go out and do brilliant things,” the librarian said. “We need them to think about how they accept information in a smarter way because I think that will change the way we all do.”"

“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu said in a post on X
The Israeli leader did not provide any other details in his one-line post in Hebrew. The territory west of Jordan encompasses Israel, the occupied West Bank, and Hamas-run Gaza, where Israel is battling the militant group following the October 7 attacks.
Biden and his top officials — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited Israel and the region last week — have said the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel’s security is the only way to finally bring peace and stability to the Middle East.
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called opposition to a two-state solution “unacceptable.”
“The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable,” Guterres posted on X.
Amid reports the US, Egypt and Qatar want Israel to join a new phase of talks with Hamas, Netanyahu this weekend also publicly rejected what he characterized as Hamas’ terms for releasing more Israeli hostages from Gaza: an end of the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, and the release of more Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
“If we agree to this - our soldiers fell in vain. If we agree to this - we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” Netanyahu said Sunday.
Netanyahu’s comments comes amid a rift with the US, Israel’s most important ally, on what Gaza will look like once the conflict ends, and exposes the complex position Netanyahu is in.
The Israeli prime minister is facing competing pressure from the international community to allow the creation of a viable Palestinian state and domestically to guarantee Israel’s security, most notably from far-right members of his coalition.
Adding to the pressure, he is also facing calls for early elections, with thousands taking to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday. Critics have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to stay in power. War cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot says he hopes that is not the case, but also says elections should happen within months.
Netanhahu’s statement on Palestinian sovereignty appears to run counter to what he told President Biden a day earlier, CNN reporting suggests. Netanyahu had told Biden in a private phone call on Friday that he was not foreclosing the possibility of a Palestinian state in any form, a personal familiar with the conversation told CNN.
Biden administration officials have recently been engaged in discussions about a future demilitarized Palestinian state, an idea the US president finds “intriguing,” the source said.
Following the phone call, their first in weeks, Biden told reporters he believed Netanyahu could ultimately be convinced of some kind of two-state solution. “There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” he said.
“There’s a number of countries that are members of the UN that are still – don’t have their own military; a number of states that have limitations, and so I think there’s ways in which this can work,” Biden added.
But the day after Biden spoke, the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement: “In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.”
Biden and Netanyahu remain publicly at odds over the question of what will happen to Gaza once the Israel-Hamas war concludes, despite intense American efforts over the past several months to engage officials in Israel and the wider region on a plan they hope can finally resolve the decades-long conflict.
The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, dating back to the 1947 UN Partition Plan, and many nations say that it is the only way out of the conflict.
It remains an open question how post-war Gaza will be governed but Netanyahu has had long-standing objections to a two-state solution.
And while Netanyahu’s stance is contentious internationally, he faces pressure from more right-wing members of his cabinet who have caused outrage with their suggestions on what should happen to people living in Gaza.
Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has championed the idea of a Palestinian exodus from Gaza. He and far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir sparked anger when advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip."

The newspapers were returned to the publisher hours after being stolen from nearly all the racks across town, the newspaper notes.
The incident took place after the weekly edition of the Ouray County Plaindealer was published this week. The paper featured a front-page story about the arrest of three individuals in connection to an alleged May 2023 sexual assault at the home of Ouray Police Chief Jeff Wood.
CNN has reached out to Chief Wood and the Ouray Police Department for comment.
On Thursday morning, more than 200 copies of that newspaper were missing from vending racks around the town, according to the Plaindealer.
“I’m sorry that most of you locals who like to get your papers from the racks were not able to put your quarters in and receive your weekly news today,” co-publisher Erin McIntyre said in a statement to readers Thursday afternoon.
“It’s pretty clear that someone didn’t want the community to read the news this week,” McIntyre added in the statement.
The newspaper said they worked to get another round of the newspaper printed and redistributed around town.
By Thursday evening, the newspaper announced an individual confessed to taking the papers and returned them all in garbage bags to the newspaper’s office.
The suspect is “not a member or relative of local law enforcement and not associated with the defendants in the recent reported sexual assault,”  according to the Ouray County Sheriff’s Office.
The newspaper reported Saturday the suspect was cited on suspicion of petty theft.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the sexual assault case.
According to a statement from the city of Ouray, “no personnel investigations are being conducted in the Ouray Police Department regarding this (sexual assault) case.”
“Thank you for the outpouring of support we have received to help pay us to reprint the paper, and to those who also support our message that you can’t kill the public’s right to know by stealing a few hundred newspapers,” publishers of the Plaindealer said in a Friday update.
The Plaindealer announced it received more than $2,000 in donations since the theft was announced.
Ouray County is in southwest Colorado, about 160 miles south of Aspen."

EFHS3XBR66_O06U12ERPV0IQWF,Moscow blames Ukraine for strikes that killed at least 28 in Russian-controlled Donetsk; Kyiv denies attack,"By Darya Tarasova, Teele Rebane, Radina Gigova, Victoria Butenko, Josh Pennington, Andrew Carey and Maria Kostenko, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:35 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/europe/ukraine-strikes-russian-controlled-donetsk-intl/,"Shelling killed at least 28 people and injured 30, including two children, near a market in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, according to Russian officials. Moscow blamed Ukraine for the attack, while Kyiv denied responsibility.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a market and shops in the city’s Kirovsky district were targeted with multiple launch rocket systems, with the shelling reportedly coming from the direction of Avdiivka. Kyiv “once again committed a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia,” the Russian ministry said. “There are a large number of victims.”
CNN is unable to independently verify this claim.
Ukraine’s armed forces said they were not responsible for the shelling attacks. “The Russians are spreading [mis-]information about the strike on a market in Donetsk. We responsibly declare that the forces under the control of the Tavria military formation did not engage in combat operations in this case,” a statement on the Facebook page of the armed forces’ Tavria command said.
“Russia must be held accountable for the lives of the Ukrainians taken,” it added.
Russia has responded with outrage to previous Ukrainian attacks but has been responsible for thousands of civilians deaths following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched an investigation and “all those involved and responsible for this and other terrorist attacks on our soil will suffer inevitable punishment,” the ministry said.
Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said that the attack came on the busiest day of the week for the area and that search teams were looking for fragments of weapons.
At least 27 civilians were killed and at least 25 were injured in the area of a market and shops in the Kirovsky district of the city of Donetsk, Pushilin said in a Telegram post.
Another man was also killed on Sunday in another part of Donetsk city as a result of shelling, Pushilin said. Five additional people were wounded in the city and elsewhere in Russian-occupied parts of the region on Sunday, he said.
Residential buildings, a school and shops in different Russian-occupied parts of the region were also damaged, he said.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the deadly attacks on Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk region, a UN spokesperson said on Sunday.
“The Secretary-General strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately,” the statement continued.
Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow said in 2022 it would recognize as Russian territory – an annexation process which is illegal under international law.
The region, which is partially but not fully controlled by Russian forces, is on the frontline of fighting in the east.
The Donetsk attack comes with the frontlines of the war largely static.
Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed to deliver major gains and its troops are now under pressure from Russia at several points along the 1,000 kilometer-long frontline.
Kyiv’s troops have withdrawn from the village of Krokhmalne in the northeast of the country, close to the border between Kharkiv and Luhansk regions – with an army spokesman saying on Ukrainian TV that its troops’ position have been moved to “where it is more advantageous for them to destroy the enemy.”
In another indication of increasing Russian pressure, Ukraine’s military says it expects to see Russia’s forces step up operations around the embattled town of Avdiivka, as well as nearby Nevelske and Pervomaiske – which all lie to the immediate northwest of Donetsk city.
“The enemy is regrouping, and we are preparing for an increase in their activity,” a Ukrainian army spokesperson said.
In recent months, Avdiivka has become a focus of Russia’s fight, in much the same way that Bakhmut was in the first half of 2023. The Ukrainian army spokesman said Russia now had about 40,000 Russian personnel in the area.
In a separate development, a Ukrainian defense source told CNN that Ukraine carried out a drone attack on a Russian oil terminal about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Saint Petersburg, the latest example of Ukraine’s capacity to strike deep inside Russia.
A night-time video posted by Leningrad regional boss Alexander Drozdenko showed what appeared to be a significant fire at the Novatek facility in Ust-Luga, which sits on the Gulf of Finland. Later videos showed fire-fighters tackling the blaze. Authorities said there were no injuries.
According to Novatek’s website, the Ust-Luga complex sees the processing of liquified natural gas products into various types of fuel, including naptha, jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoil.
The Ukrainian defense source said the products are used to supply, among others, the Russian military, adding: “The successful attack on this facility will complicate the enemy’s logistics.” .
The attack comes three days after a Ukrainian intelligence source claimed another drone operation targeting the St. Petersburg region. “This is a new stage,” the source told CNN. “Our targets are military facilities and oil depots.”
Elsewhere, Ukraine also carried out drone strikes in the Tula, Smolensk and Belgorod regions.
This story has been updated with further developments."

“At this time, we have no other definitive answers until further testing can be completed,” said the sheriff’s office in the Thursday news release. “These types of tests take a significant amount of time, and again, we ask for patience from the public as this investigation continues.”
“A thorough and detailed investigation is the top priority of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office,” the release went on. “Our hope is to positively identify the victim while remaining respectful of the victim and the victim’s family.”
The sheriff’s office did not indicate if a cause of death or the sex of the victim had been identified.
In the first news release, they reported “investigators believe this is an isolated incident, and there is no ongoing threat to the community.”
The remains were found at a home in Grand Junction, Colorado, about 200 miles west of Denver. The sheriff’s office confirmed to CNN in an email that the remains were found in a freezer in the home.
Sam Troester, who lives across the street from the home, told CNN affiliate KUSA workers in white hazmat suits first drew her attention to the investigation unfolding in her neighborhood.
“I feel so bad,” Troester told KUSA. “I would hate to have to be the family missing that loved one right now. It would be heartbreaking.”"
F9GCE1J98I_VIQECXH7UOB1CPJ,Opinion: Our possibly short national nightmare,"Opinion by Richard Galant, CNN","12 minute read Updated 9:19 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/trump-biden-new-hampshire-column-galant/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
On August 9, 1974, the only unelected vice president in American history took the presidential oath of office at a White House ceremony. It was the day after President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.
“My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Gerald Ford said.
“Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.” In words that sound almost foreign to our ears in the 21st century, Ford added, “As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.”
Last week the true-crime docuseries that shot to the top of the list of Netflix shows in the US was “American Nightmare.” But it wasn’t that kind of nightmare, or Gerald Ford’s one, that presidential candidate Nikki Haley invoked Monday after her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
“Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,” the former UN ambassador said. She was referring to polls showing that the majority of Americans don’t want a rematch between President Joe Biden and the president he defeated in 2020, Donald Trump.
When the results of the New Hampshire primary are reported Tuesday, we’ll have a better sense of whether anyone can stand in the way of that dreaded rematch. If not, it won’t be as protracted a “national nightmare” as the two-year-long Watergate scandal that put Gerald Ford in the Oval Office. This year’s election is on November 5 — and the inauguration is only one year away. Though, depending on your point of view, the real nightmare could begin after the swearing-in.
Haley is walking a tightrope, trying to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status among Republicans without alienating his MAGA base. “There’s an outside chance she can pull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump’s perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “But there’s another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control… If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP’s second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.”

Haley has been wary of directly going after the former president’s many vulnerabilities, while obliquely arguing that the nation can’t risk having a president in or nearing his 80s and that “chaos follows” Trump, whether or not it is his fault.
“Her ability to build momentum over the course of the primary showcases her political talent and ability to attract college-educated Republicans tired of having to explain away their support for a president whose hair-trigger social media posts verge into the unhinged,” wrote Patrick T. Brown.
Daniel McCarthy isn’t buying into the idea that Haley has momentum: “Former President Donald Trump’s easy win in Iowa on Monday confirms that there really is no race for the Republican nomination this year. With a deep freeze discouraging turnout, the caucuses provided a hard test of voter enthusiasm. Trump’s rivals failed it.”
“A measure of the former president’s insurmountable strength within the party is that he not only beat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, he also overcame all of the institutional powers backing them — some of the most formidable interests in the GOP.”
On the Democratic side, Biden isn’t even on the ballot Tuesday and isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire, due to a dispute between state and national party officials over the primary’s timing.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a low-profile 54-year-old legislator from Minnesota, is running in New Hampshire, SE Cupp noted, and is polling more strongly there than around the nation. It’s a longshot, Cupp noted, but “if Biden’s poll numbers keep going in the wrong direction, if voters feel taken for granted or even overlooked by Democrats, if a symbolic win in New Hampshire gives voters a reason to look more closely at Dean Phillips, well he might give Biden a run for his money.”
Karen Finney is the great-great-great-great niece of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and great-great-great granddaughter of a freed slave from Virginia.
“Walking through the door of my grandmother’s home in North Carolina,” Finney wrote, “it was impossible to miss a portrait of Lee proudly displayed on the wall. At mealtimes, during what occasionally felt like indoctrination, she would admiringly describe our famous ancestor, ‘the General,’ as a benevolent slave owner and noble warrior.”
“As she explained it, Lee valiantly fought an unjust ‘War of Northern Aggression’ in defense of ‘states’ rights,’ often referred to as ‘The Lost Cause.’ The South had been defeated, my grandmother insisted, only because the Northern army had more resources and slavery really wasn’t so bad.”
In Finney’s view, the Lost Cause is the backdrop for Trump’s suggestion that the Civil War could have been “negotiated,” the rewriting of history in school curriculums under Florida Gov. DeSantis’ administration and Haley’s struggle over the question of whether America is, or ever was, a racist country.
“Beyond absurdly omitting slavery as the root cause of the War, she made matters worse while trying to clean up her comments during a recent CNN Town Hall, saying she just assumed that slavery was a ‘given’ since all children learn about it in school in the South.”

Trump’s remark that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of Americans evokes the words of Adolf Hitler in “Mein Kampf,” author Paul Moses pointed out. But he added that the concept goes further back — to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century.
In 1914, the year Edward Alsworth Ross became president of the American Sociological Association, he published a book warning that immigrants, Moses wrote, “would act on Americans’ standards for cleanliness, morality and education ‘like a slow poison.’ A nation that relies on immigration to maintain its population ‘deserves the extinction that surely awaits it,’ he wrote…The prejudice beneath Ross’ opinions was obvious, but his ideas were mainstream and respectable — he was considered a progressive reformer…”
“But Ross came to regret the implications of his ideas about supposedly superior and inferior races, writing shortly after World War II that ‘we never imagined the theory being made a hinge for German aggression to turn on.’ That’s what the phony claims of eugenics led to — Hitler’s ‘Final Solution,’ which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. It’s certainly worth having vigorous debates about immigration laws, but those who’ve been indifferent to or even supportive of Trump’s increasingly clear turn toward racist, eugenic ideas should confront what they’ve enabled.”
Republicans describe the immigration surge at the US southern border as an “invasion” that presents a national security threat. Yet, John Avlon wrote, Trump and some members of the House GOP, want to tank an emerging compromise in the Senate that would couple border security measures with aid to Ukraine.
“Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more threats from his far-right flank, who have been signaling that they will balk at any border security bill until a Republican is president.
“Right-wing resistance is entirely consistent with a Trump-ified GOP that is more willing to demagogue an issue than actually deal with it.”

Trump sat in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday while E. Jean Carroll testified in support of her defamation case against the former president. Last May, she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation when a jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her. Now Carroll is seeking at least $10 million in additional damages for Trump’s 2019 comments about her allegation.
As Danielle Campoamor wrote, “Carroll found herself facing down not only a man found liable for assaulting her, but also a former president and current presidential frontrunner — an unprecedented example of the power dynamics survivors face. While a victim of sexual assault receives death threats, her assailant receives endorsements and secures the Iowa caucus.”
“During Carroll’s testimony, Trump repeatedly shook his head, according to CNN reporters inside the courtroom, and could be heard ‘loudly saying things’ such as ‘it’s false,’ ‘she’s gotten her memory back,’ and, according to Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley, that the lawsuit is ‘a witch hunt’ and a ‘con job.’”
When the judge threatened to oust Trump from the courtroom, the former president said, “I would love it.”
The chaotic court proceeding is just one example of why the Supreme Court should clear the way for allowing television cameras at Trump’s forthcoming election subversion trial, argued Robert C. Gottlieb. “Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue to impugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display during Wednesday’s court proceedings will undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.”
“The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.”
The narrative of fast-worsening inequality over the past half century has been challenged in a new study by economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They used data to show that, compared to the 1960s, the pre-tax income of the top 1% has increased only by 2.6% and after accounting for taxes, the share of income going to the super-rich “hasn’t budged at all,” wrote Jordan McGillis. The study disputes a 2018 finding by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman that the top 1% has seen its share of national pre-tax income go from 12% to 20% since the 1980s.
McGillis says there’s something else going on that tends to exacerbate inequality. Among rich Americans, marriage rates remain high, but they’ve plummeted for less affluent people, creating more single-person households with lower levels of income. “This cleavage makes possible what the Brookings Institution’s Melissa Kearney describes as “two-parent privilege,” an emerging phenomenon through which well-off couples transmit educational and economic advantages to their children. Viewed from this angle, it should not surprise us that many Americans think the rich are galloping ever further ahead.”
Elise Gould and Josh Bivens have a different take. Using Social Security Administration data, they found that the “share of earnings for the bottom 90% fell 9.7 percentage points between 1979 and 2022, while the share of earnings for the top 5% grew 8.8 percentage points. The very top — the top 0.1% of wage earners — nearly tripled its share of total earnings from 1.6% in 1979 to 4.6% in 2022… All of this straightforward data on earnings clearly shows a huge rise in inequality of pay in the US economy.”
The US and the UK struck back at the Houthis, the Yemeni insurgent group that is targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but the lingering question was about how effective such a series of strikes can be. “We think of war as a last resort,” Elisabeth Kendall, head of Cambridge University’s Girton College told Peter Bergen. The Houthis “think of it as a way of life.”
“The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets,” Kendall said.
CNN Opinion senior editor Sheena McKenzie interviewed Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital, and asked him about the future for Palestinian children amid the war in Gaza.
“There is no future for them,” he said. “How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?”
“The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.” (Hear more from Sheena McKenzie on the Tug of War podcast.)
There is a lot of talk but very little real debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict on US college campuses, wrote Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University.
“Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who ‘Stand with Israel’ and those seeking ‘Justice for Palestine.’… Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.”
“The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.”
“It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority.”

When Holly Thomas was 12, she “received a large — unsolicited — Estee Lauder makeup sampler for Christmas. The box felt like a totem of my impending maturity, recognition that I would soon be allowed access to an as-yet out-of-reach club. I gave it pride of place on my bedroom table (swiftly rebranded as a “dresser” with the help of a soon-to-be filthy sarong), and before too long I was regularly being sent out of class, cheeks burning, to wash my contraband mascara off.”
“It wasn’t a particularly edifying phase, but neither was it very consequential. Today however, skin care is a far more serious business. Gone are the days of teens aimlessly browsing random drugstores by day and smudging their pillows with iridescent bronzer by night. Now, kids don’t just know how to cleanse properly, they’ve taken to beauty products with unprecedented zeal. Absurd though it sounds, that fervor is acutely ominous,” Thomas wrote.
“Dermatologists report children as young as nine, many of whom already maintain elaborate at-home skin care regimes coming to their offices for cosmetic consultations. Teens who’ve barely exited puberty are obsessing over the alleged ‘preventative’ anti-aging properties of Botox, and the internet is teeming with youngsters pleading for solutions to their ‘wrinkles.’ The fretting and groupthink involved bear all the hallmarks of a classic youthful infatuation. But this one comes with sinister undercurrents less familiar to the adults who went before them.”
“The most worrying thing about today’s skin care craze isn’t just that the financial and emotional buy-in are completely out of proportion to the “need” being addressed. They may set kids up for lasting damage. And thanks to the misinformation soup of social media, the gnarly, anxiety-provoking call is coming from inside the house.”"
FHBLK6I281_DE11ZHPE14JWVCX,Moscow blames Ukraine for strikes that killed at least 28 in Russian-controlled Donetsk; Kyiv denies attack,"By Darya Tarasova, Teele Rebane, Radina Gigova, Victoria Butenko, Josh Pennington, Andrew Carey and Maria Kostenko, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:35 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/europe/ukraine-strikes-russian-controlled-donetsk-intl/,"Shelling killed at least 28 people and injured 30, including two children, near a market in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, according to Russian officials. Moscow blamed Ukraine for the attack, while Kyiv denied responsibility.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a market and shops in the city’s Kirovsky district were targeted with multiple launch rocket systems, with the shelling reportedly coming from the direction of Avdiivka. Kyiv “once again committed a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia,” the Russian ministry said. “There are a large number of victims.”
CNN is unable to independently verify this claim.
Ukraine’s armed forces said they were not responsible for the shelling attacks. “The Russians are spreading [mis-]information about the strike on a market in Donetsk. We responsibly declare that the forces under the control of the Tavria military formation did not engage in combat operations in this case,” a statement on the Facebook page of the armed forces’ Tavria command said.
“Russia must be held accountable for the lives of the Ukrainians taken,” it added.
Russia has responded with outrage to previous Ukrainian attacks but has been responsible for thousands of civilians deaths following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched an investigation and “all those involved and responsible for this and other terrorist attacks on our soil will suffer inevitable punishment,” the ministry said.
Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said that the attack came on the busiest day of the week for the area and that search teams were looking for fragments of weapons.
At least 27 civilians were killed and at least 25 were injured in the area of a market and shops in the Kirovsky district of the city of Donetsk, Pushilin said in a Telegram post.
Another man was also killed on Sunday in another part of Donetsk city as a result of shelling, Pushilin said. Five additional people were wounded in the city and elsewhere in Russian-occupied parts of the region on Sunday, he said.
Residential buildings, a school and shops in different Russian-occupied parts of the region were also damaged, he said.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the deadly attacks on Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk region, a UN spokesperson said on Sunday.
“The Secretary-General strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately,” the statement continued.
Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow said in 2022 it would recognize as Russian territory – an annexation process which is illegal under international law.
The region, which is partially but not fully controlled by Russian forces, is on the frontline of fighting in the east.
The Donetsk attack comes with the frontlines of the war largely static.
Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed to deliver major gains and its troops are now under pressure from Russia at several points along the 1,000 kilometer-long frontline.
Kyiv’s troops have withdrawn from the village of Krokhmalne in the northeast of the country, close to the border between Kharkiv and Luhansk regions – with an army spokesman saying on Ukrainian TV that its troops’ position have been moved to “where it is more advantageous for them to destroy the enemy.”
In another indication of increasing Russian pressure, Ukraine’s military says it expects to see Russia’s forces step up operations around the embattled town of Avdiivka, as well as nearby Nevelske and Pervomaiske – which all lie to the immediate northwest of Donetsk city.
“The enemy is regrouping, and we are preparing for an increase in their activity,” a Ukrainian army spokesperson said.
In recent months, Avdiivka has become a focus of Russia’s fight, in much the same way that Bakhmut was in the first half of 2023. The Ukrainian army spokesman said Russia now had about 40,000 Russian personnel in the area.
In a separate development, a Ukrainian defense source told CNN that Ukraine carried out a drone attack on a Russian oil terminal about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Saint Petersburg, the latest example of Ukraine’s capacity to strike deep inside Russia.
A night-time video posted by Leningrad regional boss Alexander Drozdenko showed what appeared to be a significant fire at the Novatek facility in Ust-Luga, which sits on the Gulf of Finland. Later videos showed fire-fighters tackling the blaze. Authorities said there were no injuries.
According to Novatek’s website, the Ust-Luga complex sees the processing of liquified natural gas products into various types of fuel, including naptha, jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoil.
The Ukrainian defense source said the products are used to supply, among others, the Russian military, adding: “The successful attack on this facility will complicate the enemy’s logistics.” .
The attack comes three days after a Ukrainian intelligence source claimed another drone operation targeting the St. Petersburg region. “This is a new stage,” the source told CNN. “Our targets are military facilities and oil depots.”
Elsewhere, Ukraine also carried out drone strikes in the Tula, Smolensk and Belgorod regions.

G5VZ3K3I33_H3L2HAIVZT026UT,Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution,"By Sandee LaMotte, CNN","9 minute read Updated 11:55 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/health/antibiotic-resistant-germs-phages-wellness/,"Cynthia Horton’s earaches are the stuff of nightmares.
“I can wake up from my sleep in horrible pain, like I’m having a root canal with no anesthesia,” she said. “When I sit up, my ear is often weeping with infection, even oozing blood.”
Already weakened by a lifelong battle with lupus, Horton’s immune system was devastated by rounds of radiation and chemotherapy after a 2003 surgery for a cancerous tumor in her ear.
Ear infections became the norm, usually eased by a round of antibiotics. But as the years passed, the bacteria in 61-year old Horton’s ear became resistant to antibiotics, often leaving her with little to no relief.
“These multi-drug-resistant superbugs can cause chronic infections in individuals for months to years to sometimes decades. It’s ridiculous just how virulent some of these bacteria get over time,” said Dwayne Roach, assistant professor of bacteriophages, infectious disease and immunology at San Diego State University.
Last year doctors offered to treat Horton’s infection with one of nature’s oldest predators — tiny tripod-looking viruses called phages designed to find, attack and gobble up bacteria.
The microscopic creatures have saved the lives of patients dying from superbug infections and are being used in clinical trials as a potential solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. In the United States alone, more than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year.
Such infections are a “urgent global public health threat,” killing 5 million people worldwide, according to 2019 statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” said infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee, codirector of the first dedicated phage therapy center in North America, the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, at UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Eager for a different solution to her recurrent ear infections, Horton was game. Samples of her drug-resistant bacteria were shipped from her doctor’s office in Pennsylvania to UC San Diego’s IPATH with the hopes that phage hunters there could find a match. What scientists discovered next, however, was unexpected.
The bacteria cultured from Horton’s ear were a perfect match to a rare superbug found in certain brands of over-the-counter eye drops that were robbing people of their vision and lives.
Suddenly, the search for a solution to Horton’s problem took on new meaning. Would the bacteria from her ear help scientists find phages that would treat the eye infections as well?
Severe cases of antibiotic-resistant eye infections began popping up in May 2022. By the following January, the CDC said at least 50 patients in 11 states had developed superbug infections after using preservative‐free artificial tears. By May 2023, the outbreak had spread to 18 states: Four people died, another four lost eyes, 14 suffered vision loss, and dozens more developed infections in other parts of the body.

“Only a fraction of patients actually had eye infections, which made the outbreak incredibly difficult to solve,” said epidemiologist Dr. Maroya Walters, who led the CDC’s artificial tears investigation.
“We saw people who were colonized by the organism develop urinary tract or respiratory tract infections months down the road, even though they were no longer using these drops,” Walters said. “One patient spread the infection to others in the health care facility.”
The culprit was a rare strain of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never been identified in the United States before the outbreak, the CDC said.
Horton had never used eye drops, yet the bacteria cultured from her ear were the same rare strain. Using those bacteria and other samples sent by the CDC, scientists at IPATH immediately went to work and identified more than a dozen phages that successfully attacked the deadly pathogen.
Scientists at the CDC were intrigued by the discovery, so much so that they mentioned the availability of the phage treatment for the superbug on the CDC website.
“It brought up this idea of when we have an outbreak that’s caused by bacteria with such limited treatment options, should we be thinking about these alternative therapies?” Walters said.
What is this little creature that can topple bacteria capable of withstanding all the drugs that modern science can muster? And more importantly, could phage treatment become a major player in the battle to end the superbug crisis?
Thanks to evolution, the gazillions of bacteria in the world today have a natural enemy: tiny viruses called bacteriophages genetically programmed for search-and-destroy missions. In this microscopic game of “The Terminator,” each set of phages is uniquely designed to find, attack and devour a specific type of pathogen.
“Each bacterial species, or even genotypes within it, can have a whole repertoire of phages that are attacking it, using a wide variety of methods to enter and debilitate the bacterial cell,” said Paul Turner, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University and microbiology faculty member at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
To counter the attack, bacteria employ various evasive maneuvers, such as shedding their outer skins to eliminate docking ports the phage use to enter, ravage and ultimately explode the pathogen into bits of bacterial goo.
That’s good news because the newly naked bacteria may lose their resistance to antibiotics, becoming once again vulnerable to elimination. The phage, however, is taken out of action, no longer able to fight.
To maximize success, specialists search for a variety of phages to tackle a particularly nasty superbug — at times creating a cocktail of microscopic warriors that can hopefully continue the attack when one is neutralized.
That’s what happened in 2016 to Strathdee’s husband, Tom Patterson, a retired professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego. Due to an infection with “Iraqibacter,” a drug-resistant bacterium found in the sands of Iraq, Patterson was in multi-organ failure and perilously close to death. In a race against time, Strathdee overcame incredible obstacles to find and deliver several cocktails of purified phages to Patterson’s doctors.
One of those cocktails contained a phage that “scared the bacteria so much that it dropped its outer capsule,” said Strathdee, an associate dean of global health sciences at UC San Diego and coauthor of “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug.”
“It was more afraid of the phage, if you will, than the antibiotic, and that allowed the antibiotic to work again. It was the one-two punch Tom needed,” Strathdee said. “Three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”
In labs around the country, phage scientists are taking research and discovery to the next level, or what Strathdee calls “phage 3.0.” Scientists in Turner’s Yale laboratory are busy mapping which phages and antibiotics are most symbiotic in the fight against a pathogen. Roach’s San Diego State lab is investigating the body’s immune response to phages while developing new phage purification techniques to prepare samples for intravenous use in patients.
Currently, clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of phages against intractable urinary tract infections, chronic constipation, joint infections, diabetic foot ulcers, tonsillitis and the persistent, reoccurring infections that occur in patients with cystic fibrosis. The chronic infections common in cystic fibrosis are typically due to various strains of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa — the same pathogen responsible for Horton’s ear infection and the artificial tears outbreak.
A number of labs are developing libraries of phages, stockpiled with strains found in nature that are known to be effective against a particular pathogen. In Texas, a new facility is taking that a step further — speeding up evolution by creating phages in the lab.
“Rather than just sourcing new phages from the environment, we have a bioreactor that in real time creates billions upon billions of phages,” said Anthony Maresso, associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
“Most of those phages won’t be active against the drug-resistant bacteria, but at some point there will be a rare variant that has been trained, so to speak, to attack the resistant bacteria, and we’ll add that to our arsenal,” Maresso said. “It’s a next-generation approach on phage libraries.”
Maresso’s lab published a study last year on the treatment of 12 patients with phages customized to each patient’s unique bacterial profile. It was a qualified success: The antibiotic-resistant bacteria in five patients were eradicated, while several more patients showed improvements.
“There’s a lot of approaches right now that are happening in parallel,” Roach said. “Do we engineer phages? Do we make a phage cocktail, and then how big is the cocktail? Is it two phages or 12 phages? Should phages be inhaled, applied topically or injected intravenously? There’s a lot of work underway on exactly how to best do this.”
To date, genetic manipulation of phages has been difficult due the streamlined nature of the creature: “Normal phages are optimized by evolution to be lean, mean, killing machines. There’s very little room in there for us to get in and change things,” said Elizabeth Villa, a professor of molecular biology at UC San Diego who studies a new form of phage called “jumbo” phages.
“Jumbo phages have very large genomes and come close to having a nucleus that encapsulates the genetic material, which protects them from some of the mechanisms bacteria use against phages to deactivate them,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who is codirector of IPATH.
“That also gives them room to be engineered to become more potent, so they’re very promising phages to be used therapeutically,” Schooley said.
Genetically engineering phages would allow scientists to target each person’s unique mix of antibiotic-resistant pathogens instead of searching sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria to find just the right phage for the job.
Along with phage libraries, genetic engineering is also a key to churning out phages in mass, to distribute on a wider scale. In Russia and the country of Georgia, where phage therapy has been used for decades, patients can buy phage cocktails off the shelf in pharmacies.
All this work has caught the attention of the CDC. In addition to using a phage cocktail to treat a superbug outbreak in real time, phages could also help fight a broader issue — the recolonization of the infected person with the same superbug, the CDC’s Walters said.
“The issue is that when patients have infections with these drug-resistant bacteria, they can still carry that organism in or on their bodies even after treatment,” Walters said. “They don’t show any signs or symptoms of illness, but they can get infections again, and they can also transmit the bacteria to other people.”
However, if phages could be used to “decolonize” a bacterial population inside a high-risk person, “patients could really decrease the likelihood of developing an infection and spreading to others, which is a big part of the problem,” Walters said.
“We were thinking about trying to develop a curated phage collection that would be active against a large number of certain resistant organisms,” she added. “Pseudomonas is a good place to start — there are more than 140 different species. But there are many other organisms that threaten us that we also need to tackle.”"

Ariel, a spaniel, was born with multiple health defects. She was named after the Disney princess because her extra back legs were partly fused together, resembling a mermaid’s tail.
She was taken in by Greenacres Rescue, a non-profit group based in the town of Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The group arranged Ariel’s surgery and set her up with a foster family.
Ariel is recovering and walking normally, Greenacres Rescue said in a post shared on Facebook.
“Our wonderful and special little spaniel has been discharged from Small Animal Referral Hospital Langford Vets University of Bristol and is back in the comfort of her wonderful foster home,” the group wrote, sharing photos of Ariel wrapped up in a red blanket post-surgery.
They added that her procedure “went as well as expected” and she now has a few weeks of recovery ahead of her.
“Ariel has to now rest for the next 10 to 14 days to recover,” the group said. “We will post updates over that time.”
“There were two procedures which lasted about two hours but both went fine,” the charity’s founder Mikey Lawlor said of Ariel’s operation in comments to the UK national news Press Association agency.
“The next day she was up, walking around and eating and drinking.”
Lawlor said there had been an outpouring of support for Ariel from people around the world, including calls and emails from as far as Australia.
“I just can’t say enough of a thank you to everyone who’s contributed to helping her,” Lawlor said.
Ariel will likely be discharged from hospital this weekend and brought home to her foster family."
H3GPYGH84G_638ZZ2WW6N6KH0O,US personnel injured in attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq,"By Oren Liebermann, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:09 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/al-asad-air-base-iraq-us-personnel-injured/,"US personnel were injured in a ballistic missile attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq on Saturday, two US officials said.
The attack was one of the largest-scale ballistic missile attacks to date that the US has seen carried out by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday. Two US service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries and have since returned to duty, she said.
US Central Command confirmed the attack Saturday evening.
Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets targeted the base and, while most were intercepted by the base’s air defenses, some made impact, the CENTCOM statement said.
The use of more powerful ballistic missiles, far rarer than rockets or one-way attack drones, comes at a time of growing tension in the region as the Israel-Hamas war passes 100 days.
US and coalition forces have faced increased threats from Iranian-backed Shia militias since the start of the war. As of Thursday, US and coalition forces had come under attack more than 143 times in Iraq and Syria since October 7; Saturday’s incident appears to be the second time ballistic missiles have been used to attack the US.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iranian-backed militia group, claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack.
In a statement, the group emphasized its commitment to resisting American “occupation forces” in the region and cited the attack as a response to what it referred to as the “Zionist entity’s massacres” against the Palestinian people in Gaza. The group did not provide any evidence for its claim.
In November, militants in Iraq fired close-range ballistic missiles at coalition forces, prompting the US to carry out airstrikes against facilities used by the Iranian-backed group Kataib Hezbollah, which has been responsible for many of the rocket and drone attacks against the coalition.
US forces in Iraq and Syria operate as part of the coalition to defeat ISIS. But the Iraqi government has called for international forces to ultimately leave the country after US strikes targeting Kataib Hezbollah facilities — which marked the first time the Biden administration had carried out strikes in Iraq since the war in Gaza began — caused tension with the Iraqi government.
“We believe that reorganizing the relationship through ending its presence will prevent more tensions and entanglement of internal and regional security issues,” Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told Reuters earlier this month.
The UN secretary-general’s special representative for Iraq has also warned that the region is at a “critical juncture” with the war in Gaza, saying in a statement that Iraq is at risk of being further drawn into the conflict.
“Despite the Government’s efforts to prevent the escalation of tensions, continued attacks — originating from within and outside of Iraq’s borders — stand to undo the hard-won stability of the country and the achievements it has made in recent years,” the statement said.
The Pentagon has maintained that the presence of its forces is still at the invitation of the Iraqi government and nothing has changed. National security adviser Jake Sullivan met with al-Sudani earlier this week in Davos, Switzerland, and the two discussed the “importance of sustaining a strong bilateral partnership,” the White House said in a readout.
The US, separately, is also facing threats in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have launched repeated attacks on international shipping lanes, including at least two strikes on US-owned vessels this week, leading some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the critical waterway.

I89055GN9V_9Z67GXU8UJMUM7H,‘Very dangerous’: Zelensky on Trump’s claim he could end Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours,"By Andrew Carey and Victoria Butenko, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:12 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/europe/zelensky-trump-end-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/,"For the first time, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed publicly unequivocal concern over Donald Trump’s suggestion he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day if he returns to the White House.
Speaking to Britain’s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner’s boast as “very dangerous” – on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.
Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump’s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a “political message.”
But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, “makes me really quite stressed.”
Trump’s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”
Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, “They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.”
Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.
At Davos earlier this week, responding to a similar question from a journalist, the Ukrainian leader answered rhetorically, wondering how Trump would respond if Putin rolled through Ukraine - in a scenario where Trump removed all US support - and began threatening NATO members with invasion.
It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.
By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.

Ukraine’s ability to negotiate toward that result has been significantly weakened, at least in the short term, by the failure of the summer counteroffensive.
Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: “Nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.”
Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.
Turning to address the camera, he said, “Please, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.”
“Maybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,” Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer."
ICEC76V0RG_5CUKDCW42UAWCNJ,"In South Carolina, Ron DeSantis prepares a last stand – and a way out","By Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:26 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/ron-desantis-south-carolina/,"With most of the political world closely watching New Hampshire this weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead spent Saturday 900 miles away in South Carolina, laying the groundwork for his presidential campaign’s last stand.
“I’m asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,” DeSantis told supporters at a Florence restaurant. “I’ll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida. I will always be a candidate that you can be proud of. As president, I will get the job done.”
In a marker of the confusion surrounding his unclear path forward, DeSantis’ campaign late Saturday was still scrambling to figure out which state their candidate would appear in on Sunday. The scheduling fluctuations resulted in DeSantis abruptly canceling plans to appear Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His campaign quickly chimed in publicly to end speculation about his political future to note that DeSantis will appear in New Hampshire on Sunday.

Yet, even as he soldiers on, DeSantis increasingly sounds like a candidate wrestling with his relevancy. In the days following his distant second-place finish in Iowa, DeSantis has lashed out at Fox News, bemoaned the money spent against him, blamed cold weather and “very low” enthusiasm for his performance, trivialized the sway of the Hawkeye State Republicans who endorsed him, conceded former President Donald Trump’s edge going forward, admitted his media strategy failed, and for the first time suggested what it would take for him to end his White House bid.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he said Friday night. “The minute I don’t, then I’m not just going to do this just for my health.”
His public journey through the seven stages of grief comes as his Republican rivals have all but dismissed his candidacy as an afterthought.
Trump recently predicted on his social media site that DeSantis “will SOON be out of money and dropping out of the race for President.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was “no longer focused on” DeSantis after Iowa.
“He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” she said. “He’s invisible in New Hampshire. He’s invisible in South Carolina. We’re focused on Trump. That’s the key.”
DeSantis, though, is intensely focused on Haley in South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. In appearances around the Palmetto State this week, DeSantis has contended she’s not conservative enough for the state and has asked the audience to list her accomplishments. He has asserted no one can.
Fourth-grade teacher Regina Wasiluk took issue with that suggestion. She showed up to DeSantis’ Lexington event to defend Haley’s record on education when he once again queried his crowd.
After a brief exchange, DeSantis shut her down.
“This isn’t your show, ma’am,” he said.
Wasiluk said after the experience she wouldn’t vote for DeSantis if he’s the GOP nominee.
“I was very upset that I didn’t bring my phone so that I can share it with other people who feel the same way that I do,” she said.
South Carolina’s February 24 primary is still more than a month away and comes after the Nevada caucuses. But coming just nine days before Super Tuesday, when the race expands into a national contest, the state typically turns into “the graveyard of a lot of campaigns and the booster rocket to at least one,” said the state’s GOP chairman, Drew McKissick.
“This is your last chance to be able to focus on one state at a time,” McKissick said. “After that, you’ve got to be on the air and on the ground in half a dozen to a dozen states at one time. That’s cost prohibitive, time prohibitive and manpower prohibitive.”
Still, DeSantis’ campaign is not setting expectations for a win here or even a second-place finish. Instead, it appears singularly focused on playing spoiler to Haley on her home turf. The theory behind the strategy is Haley would drop out if she can’t manage a strong performance in the state she once led, though she has given no indication that is the case. The Florida governor is moving much of his campaign here to carry out that mission.
DeSantis himself is not setting expectations, either. He told reporters Saturday, “I’m not a political pundit,” when asked his end goal in South Carolina and whether there’s a district he thinks he can win.
“We’re here. You saw the folks. We get great reception,” DeSantis said, referencing a large crowd at the Myrtle Beach event. “As this thing turns, you know, we’re gonna be in a good situation.”
But DeSantis has stopped short of the scorched-earth offensive it may take to damage Haley. His remarks across three stops Saturday largely touched on familiar themes – his accomplishments in Florida, the scourges of a “woke” culture and the urgency to change course as a country – none of which moved the needle for him in Iowa and New Hampshire.
One attendee in Myrtle Beach asked DeSantis why he hasn’t gained traction from Republicans in 2024 given his track record in Florida – a sign of the skepticism from voters that accompanies worsening odds.
“I got to break through a lot of clutter out there in ways that other candidates don’t,” DeSantis contended. “There’s other candidates that get elevated, and I got to break through the clutter.”
Unclear is how much firepower DeSantis will have to “break through the clutter.” DeSantis’ campaign and supporting super PACs have not aired an ad outside of Iowa since mid-November, and the Hawkeye State did not deliver the result for him that could have led to a fundraising bonanza.
Meanwhile, Haley’s campaign is preparing to launch a $4 million media buy in South Carolina beginning the day of the New Hampshire primary, her campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, told reporters Saturday. Americans for Prosperity Action, which is supporting Haley, also has about $2.3 million booked in the state, according to AdImpact.
Also missing since getting thrashed in Iowa is the swagger of the candidate who once cosplayed as a “Top Gun” pilot to drive home the point he will “never back down from a fight.” DeSantis appeared tired touring his third state this week while keeping up a schedule badly battered by winter storms. Asked by a voter Saturday in Myrtle Beach whom he’d pick as a running mate, DeSantis listlessly batted away the question with a blunt assessment of his standing in the GOP race.
“It’s presumptuous,” he said. “I’ve got eight delegates. Trump’s got 20. You gotta get there.”
A visit to South Carolina four days before New Hampshire votes would seem to necessitate punting on the Granite State – where Trump and Haley are in a heated fight and he is at risk of not reaching the 10% vote threshold needed to earn delegates in the state. Yet, as DeSantis arrived in South Carolina, he published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Journal in which he urged voters to support him.
“Support me in the coming New Hampshire primary,” he wrote, “and I will embody the live free or die spirit as your next president.”

KKCL4UUW6X_ZIT1ITWIW82IDL7,Ayodhya’s Muslims confront grief and anxiety as Ram Temple inauguration nears,"By Aishwarya S Iyer, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:57 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/20/asia/ayodhyas-muslims-anxiety-ram-temple-inauguration-intl-hnk/,"Saffron flags are flying in the majority Hindu town of Ayodhya as excited locals prepare to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration of a new multimillion-dollar temple.
But like many of the town’s 500,000 Muslims, 65-year-old Maulana Badshah Khan says he’ll be staying at home.
He fears a repeat of the religious violence that erupted more than 30 years ago, when Hindu nationalists destroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, triggering riots across the country.
On Monday, Modi will officially open the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a lavish temple built on the same site that analysts say is a monument to Hindu nationalist ambition.
Khan says he believes the celebration is a clear sign of how Muslims are becoming marginalized under the leadership of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
“The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” said Khan.
“The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.”
More than 7,000 people have been invited to Ayodhya to attend the ceremony in person, including high-profile politicians who are flying in from across the vast country to take part. And tens of thousands of pious Hindus are thronging to the small town to place flowers and gifts inside the temple.
Amid these increasing crowds, there is apprehension among Ayodhya’s Muslims.
Azam Qadri, the 39-year-old head of a local religious body, said that those who lived through the 1992 violence fear the arrival of outsiders.
“Every time people come from outside there is trouble. One cannot afford to lose their precious belongings, savings, or identity papers anymore. It is not easy to restart your life again,” he said.
Haji Mahboob, who lost two relatives during the 1992 violence, said local Muslims are worried the emboldened crowds will chant provocative slogans against them.
“They will call for Muslims to be expelled from Ayodhya or demand a Hindu Rashtra (nation),” he said.
Mahboob said there is now a sense of hopelessness among his community.
Many Muslims believed that in 2019, when the Supreme Court granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, the controversy might come to an end, he said. But instead, emboldened Hindus began targeting even more mosques across the country, campaigning to tear those down too.
“The Hindus cannot stand us, they cannot see us, what can we do?” he said.
Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus.
Many states have passed legislation that critics say is rooted in Hindutva and discriminatory toward Muslims, including laws that make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry and banning the slaughter and transport of cows – an animal considered sacred to Hindus.
And one of Modi’s key promises to his voters was to build the Ram Temple on the desecrated mosque’s site, and he’s hoping its construction will firm his chances for a rare third election win this year.
Related article A decades long Hindu nationalist dream is about to be achieved. What does this mean?
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of “The Demolition and the Verdict,” a book about the 1992 mosque demolition, said Modi’s decision to preside over Monday’s festivities is a sign of Hindu hegemony in India.
Modi’s involvement in the ceremony is indicative of how the line between the state and religion is becoming increasingly blurred, he said.
Mukhopadhyay added the sentiment among Muslims is not one of celebration. He has heard that Muslims are advising each other not to travel by train, not to drive cars alone and not to wear clothing that identifies them as Muslim.
“There is going to be immense sadness and there is also going to be tremendous fear (among India’s Muslims),” he said.
Speaking to CNN, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said Muslims are not being marginalized in India, and that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir is a “cause for celebration.”
“In terms of Prime Minister Modi’s government’s work, initiatives, and developmental agenda, not one scheme, program, or anything, distinguishes between Indian citizens on the basis of religion, caste, region,” he said.
In the years following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that worried Indian liberals, who feared more outbursts of sectarian violence.
That 2019 judgement that paved the way for the building of the Ram Mandir also allocated land for the town’s Muslims to build another mosque, some 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the Ram Mandir in a village called Dhannipur.
Mahboob, one of the petitioners who fought for the Babri mosque in the Supreme Court, said for most Muslims of Ayodhya, its construction does not hold emotional sway.
“If they built the mosque close to where Babri stood, we could have tried to convince ourselves that injustice was not happening to us. However, this land is so far away, and over that the construction has not even begun. So what do we say?”
Late last year, Arafat Shaikh – a member of the BJP – was appointed to lead the construction of the mosque. He told CNN that he had never stepped foot in Ayodhya before he took on the role.
He said the delays were due to disagreements about the design of the building but believes the new mosque will be unique as it will be the first in India with five minarets.
Amongst other ambitious plans, Shaikh says he wants additional land for educational institutions, a vegetarian kitchen, and a 21-foot-long Quran which will be painted saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism but one that has become increasingly politicized and appropriated by the Hindu-right.
Shaikh said the color was chosen because Gharib Nawaz, a famous Sufi saint, also revered saffron.
“It will bring the two communities closer,” he said.
Right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations say the temple’s opening is a symbol of a new Hindu nation.
“The Mughals tried to change us, then the English tried to change us, but the inauguration of the Ram Temple shows the world that our Hindu traditions, practices, and beliefs are still intact. New India will see a resurrection of the Hindu civilization,” said Vinod Bansal, spokesperson of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad group.
Mahant Jairam Das, the local head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the parent organization of the BJP, said he does not believe the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, instead claiming calls to build the structure were a “call for war.”
“Go to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, or a Muslim-dominated country. Why build a mosque like this in India?” he said.
For Hassan Ali, who was just nine when he spent two nights in a local police station trying to escape the 1992 violence, the sectarian fault lines are clearly visible.
“In 1992 there were many stories of local Hindus and Muslims helping each other. However now, there is a lot more poison that has been fed to people,” he said. “So one cannot tell anymore. One cannot tell what people have in their hearts.”"

Ariel, a spaniel, was born with multiple health defects. She was named after the Disney princess because her extra back legs were partly fused together, resembling a mermaid’s tail.
She was taken in by Greenacres Rescue, a non-profit group based in the town of Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The group arranged Ariel’s surgery and set her up with a foster family.
Ariel is recovering and walking normally, Greenacres Rescue said in a post shared on Facebook.
“Our wonderful and special little spaniel has been discharged from Small Animal Referral Hospital Langford Vets University of Bristol and is back in the comfort of her wonderful foster home,” the group wrote, sharing photos of Ariel wrapped up in a red blanket post-surgery.
They added that her procedure “went as well as expected” and she now has a few weeks of recovery ahead of her.
“Ariel has to now rest for the next 10 to 14 days to recover,” the group said. “We will post updates over that time.”
“There were two procedures which lasted about two hours but both went fine,” the charity’s founder Mikey Lawlor said of Ariel’s operation in comments to the UK national news Press Association agency.
“The next day she was up, walking around and eating and drinking.”
Lawlor said there had been an outpouring of support for Ariel from people around the world, including calls and emails from as far as Australia.
“I just can’t say enough of a thank you to everyone who’s contributed to helping her,” Lawlor said.
Ariel will likely be discharged from hospital this weekend and brought home to her foster family."
MGFK3HK4NG_CSL94LA7W3XDSNZ,"If the New Hampshire primary results match latest polling, only one question will be asked","Analysis by David Chalian, CNN","3 minute read Updated 11:47 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/new-hampshire-haley-trump-primary-campaign/,"If the New Hampshire primary results come in on Tuesday night looking like the final CNN/UNH poll results released Sunday, there is going to be one question hanging over the race for the Republican presidential nomination: Is this race over?
Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has said plainly that “the road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated that he intends on competing for delegates at least through the month of March.
But it is hard to imagine how Haley and DeSantis continue to fund their campaigns at a competitive level, never mind convincing Republican voters and power brokers that there is a rationale to continue onward following sizable back-to-back victories for former President Donald Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire where the former president collects a majority of the votes and the delegates.
There has never been a non-incumbent Republican candidate for president who has won both Iowa and New Hampshire. In fact, in modern presidential campaign history — since the Iowa caucuses have served as the official kickoff, followed by the New Hampshire primary — the two people who have won both contests outright were Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry, both of whom went on to become their party’s nominee.
In the new CNN/UNH poll, one finding stands out as a particularly telling element in this race: When likely GOP primary voters were asked for their overall opinion of the candidates, Trump’s favorability rating was in a different stratosphere than that of his competitors.
Trump scores a 56% favorable rating from likely Republican primary voters, compared with a 36% unfavorable rating. That is a net positive 20 points favorable advantage for the former president.
Haley and DeSantis are both underwater. More GOP primary voters have an unfavorable view of them than have a favorable view of them.
The relentless hammering on DeSantis by Trump and his allies for the better part of the last year and their more recent attacks on Haley have had their intended effect — more negative ratings for Trump’s two foremost rivals.
But the strategic decision by DeSantis and Haley to sharpen their criticisms of Trump only at the very end of these contests is also on display here.
The ever-present concern that attacking Trump directly would push away some of the very voters Haley and DeSantis spent much of 2023 trying to attract has left Trump’s popularity with Republicans largely unscathed, if not improved.
Perhaps there was no way for any candidate to truly chip away at Trump’s incredible bond with the majority of Republican voters, but it is also clear that not having attempted to do that for the entire year before the voting began leaves these non-Trump candidates with very limited options for a path forward."
MO3JXG73P2_ICB30DWN0RBUFK6,"Yes, employers can set a mandatory retirement age. What you need to know","By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","6 minute read Published 12:00 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/success/mandatory-retirement-age-boards-ceos,"Former US Vice President Al Gore, 75, is stepping down from Apple’s board because of the company’s age-based restrictions for its directors, and it raises the question of ageism in Corporate America.
By no means is age 75 — or any age over 65 — an automatic disqualifier for US corporate leaders.
Consider: The top 10 oldest CEOs of companies on the Russell 3000 — led by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett — ranged in age from 84 to 91 in 2022, according to The Conference Board and ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE. As of this writing, they are all still on the job.
In fact, mandatory retirement ages are more of an exception than a rule in Corporate America, and they don’t exist for US lawmakers or surgeons or many other jobs. But they do exist in a lot of public-safety occupations.
Here’s a look at where they are most and least prevalent, and why.
Having a mandatory retirement policy for board members is up to the discretion of individual companies. But a majority do have them.
Related article Al Gore is officially too old to serve on Apple’s board
“In 2023, 69% of [S&P 500] boards reported having a mandatory retirement policy — down one point from 2022,” according to an August 2023 report from executive search firm Spencer Stuart.
Among those with such policies, the vast majority (97%) set the retirement age at 72 or higher, with 57% putting it at 75 or older, the report noted.
“Director retirement policies continue to be quite commonly found in corporate organizational documents, as the need for board refreshment is ongoing,” said Matteo Tonello, a managing director at The Conference Board, who advises members about governance issues.
That’s due largely to the need for boards to diversify in a number of ways, Tonnello said, citing gender and racial diversity and also diversification in terms of qualifications and skills, such as having experience with emerging technologies.
It is harder to quantify how many companies impose a mandatory retirement age for CEOs and other senior leaders, Tonello said.
Related article Charlie Munger’s best quotes on investing, life and everything in between
For one thing, some companies may have retirement age policies on paper but will disregard them when they want to keep someone on.
“Boards often override them due to the inconvenient circumstances the company may face when the policy is triggered,” he said.
Those circumstances can be a company going through a crisis (or conversely performing very well); a tight labor market for senior talent; or an economic downturn.
For example: Target CEO Brian Cornell was 63 in 2022, when he and the board agreed he would stay on another three years. The board said it would eliminate its policy of discussing a CEO’s retirement when he or she turns 65.
And in 2021, in the midst of Boeing’s 737 Max crisis, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun turned 64. The company board waived its mandatory retirement age of 65 and announced it would extend it to age 70 for Calhoun.
But waiving a mandatory retirement age policy for one CEO doesn’t mean a board won’t resurrect it for someone else.
“These policies have often disappeared from corporate governance principles or other organizational documents. [That] does not mean though that they have been rescinded, since there is no disclosure obligation related to them. And many boards may choose to unofficially keep them in place, [and] use them only when convenient,” Tonello explained.
Then again, boards may not have to make the call too often since many CEOs leave well before traditional retirement age. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks CEO exits, reports that “the average age of an exiting CEO was 56 in 2023, down from over 63 in 2017.”
Thanks to federal and state age discrimination laws, generally speaking it is illegal for companies to impose a mandatory retirement age for rank-and-file employees, said Thomas McKinney, a partner at the employment law firm of Castronovo & McKinney, LLC.
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act applies to all companies with 20 or more employees. But a state can decide to apply prohibitions to a wider swath of employers if it chooses. For example, McKinney noted, New Jersey prohibits all companies, regardless of how many employees they have, from imposing a mandatory retirement age on workers.
So why is it okay for companies to push their CEOs and board members out the door after a certain age?
There is an exception in the ADEA that lets companies set retirement ages for anyone 65 or older if they are a bonafide executive or high-level policymaker (which includes senior executives other than CEOs or board members) and who stands to receive non-forfeitable retirement benefits valued at a minimum of $44,000 a year.
Individual states may set a lower retirement benefit threshold.
The ADEA, however, does not apply to organizations of all kinds.
For example, McKinney notes, it does not cover partners and shareholders in closely held corporations. So doctors or lawyers working in a small practice may be asked to hand in their work ID when they turn 65 or older.

However, there is no official required retirement age for surgeons when it comes to physically operating on patients. But the American College of Surgeons put out a statement in 2016 — which the ACS still stands by today — that recommends surgeons, “starting at age 65-70,” voluntarily seek out physical, visual and cognitive testing among other measures.
Many other public safety occupations do have mandatory retirement ages. Commercial airline pilots, for instance, under federal law may no longer fly commercially after turning 65 (though there has been a legislative push in Congress to increase that age to 67).
Federal and state police officers are typically subject to mandatory retirement ages, too, McKinney said.
In New York State, for instance, state police officers with at least 20 years’ service must retire after turning 60. But US Capitol Police officers with that same tenure must retire at 57, although in 2020 they were temporarily exempted from that requirement.
Other federal jobs subject to mandatory retirement ages are “firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, air traffic controllers, and customs and border protection officers,” according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
There may be varied stated reasons for having a mandatory retirement age, such as opening up the pipeline for younger talent to have more opportunities. Or, in the case of boards, as Tonello noted, there is often a desire to diversify and fill roles with various types of expertise.
But the underlying reason for retirement age policies is often more of a knee-jerk assumption.
“What is behind these mandatory retirement policies and laws is an assumption that somebody older is not as qualified, competent or productive,” said Mary O’Neill, an attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Or, in the case of public-safety jobs, “there’s an assumption that age is connected with safety and physical competence,” O’Neill said.
But all such assumptions are based more on “myths, fears and stereotypes” than fact, she said, noting that performing individual assessments of employees is a better way to determine competency of all kinds — physical, mental and psychological.
“There will be some 33-year-olds who don’t have the ability to do a job if you do an individual assessment,” she said.
And some 65-year-olds may not make the grade either. But some will.
For that reason, advocates for older workers, like the AARP, contend all mandatory retirement ages should be eliminated, even for demanding jobs involving public safety.
“Numerous scientific and medical studies find no need for this age-based discrimination,” the AARP notes in its latest policybook on employment issues.
“Public safety would be better served by periodically testing the fitness of public-safety employees, regardless of age, rather than relying on arbitrary age restrictions.”"

On Monday, Modi will officially open the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a lavish temple built on the same site that analysts say is a monument to Hindu nationalist ambition.
Khan says he believes the celebration is a clear sign of how Muslims are becoming marginalized under the leadership of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
“The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” said Khan.
“The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.”
More than 7,000 people have been invited to Ayodhya to attend the ceremony in person, including high-profile politicians who are flying in from across the vast country to take part. And tens of thousands of pious Hindus are thronging to the small town to place flowers and gifts inside the temple.
Amid these increasing crowds, there is apprehension among Ayodhya’s Muslims.
Azam Qadri, the 39-year-old head of a local religious body, said that those who lived through the 1992 violence fear the arrival of outsiders.
“Every time people come from outside there is trouble. One cannot afford to lose their precious belongings, savings, or identity papers anymore. It is not easy to restart your life again,” he said.
Haji Mahboob, who lost two relatives during the 1992 violence, said local Muslims are worried the emboldened crowds will chant provocative slogans against them.
“They will call for Muslims to be expelled from Ayodhya or demand a Hindu Rashtra (nation),” he said.
Mahboob said there is now a sense of hopelessness among his community.
Many Muslims believed that in 2019, when the Supreme Court granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, the controversy might come to an end, he said. But instead, emboldened Hindus began targeting even more mosques across the country, campaigning to tear those down too.
“The Hindus cannot stand us, they cannot see us, what can we do?” he said.
Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus.
Many states have passed legislation that critics say is rooted in Hindutva and discriminatory toward Muslims, including laws that make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry and banning the slaughter and transport of cows – an animal considered sacred to Hindus.
And one of Modi’s key promises to his voters was to build the Ram Temple on the desecrated mosque’s site, and he’s hoping its construction will firm his chances for a rare third election win this year.

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of “The Demolition and the Verdict,” a book about the 1992 mosque demolition, said Modi’s decision to preside over Monday’s festivities is a sign of Hindu hegemony in India.
Modi’s involvement in the ceremony is indicative of how the line between the state and religion is becoming increasingly blurred, he said.
Mukhopadhyay added the sentiment among Muslims is not one of celebration. He has heard that Muslims are advising each other not to travel by train, not to drive cars alone and not to wear clothing that identifies them as Muslim.
“There is going to be immense sadness and there is also going to be tremendous fear (among India’s Muslims),” he said.
Speaking to CNN, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said Muslims are not being marginalized in India, and that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir is a “cause for celebration.”
“In terms of Prime Minister Modi’s government’s work, initiatives, and developmental agenda, not one scheme, program, or anything, distinguishes between Indian citizens on the basis of religion, caste, region,” he said.
In the years following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that worried Indian liberals, who feared more outbursts of sectarian violence.
That 2019 judgement that paved the way for the building of the Ram Mandir also allocated land for the town’s Muslims to build another mosque, some 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the Ram Mandir in a village called Dhannipur.
Mahboob, one of the petitioners who fought for the Babri mosque in the Supreme Court, said for most Muslims of Ayodhya, its construction does not hold emotional sway.
“If they built the mosque close to where Babri stood, we could have tried to convince ourselves that injustice was not happening to us. However, this land is so far away, and over that the construction has not even begun. So what do we say?”
Late last year, Arafat Shaikh – a member of the BJP – was appointed to lead the construction of the mosque. He told CNN that he had never stepped foot in Ayodhya before he took on the role.
He said the delays were due to disagreements about the design of the building but believes the new mosque will be unique as it will be the first in India with five minarets.
Amongst other ambitious plans, Shaikh says he wants additional land for educational institutions, a vegetarian kitchen, and a 21-foot-long Quran which will be painted saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism but one that has become increasingly politicized and appropriated by the Hindu-right.
Shaikh said the color was chosen because Gharib Nawaz, a famous Sufi saint, also revered saffron.
“It will bring the two communities closer,” he said.
Right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations say the temple’s opening is a symbol of a new Hindu nation.
“The Mughals tried to change us, then the English tried to change us, but the inauguration of the Ram Temple shows the world that our Hindu traditions, practices, and beliefs are still intact. New India will see a resurrection of the Hindu civilization,” said Vinod Bansal, spokesperson of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad group.
Mahant Jairam Das, the local head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the parent organization of the BJP, said he does not believe the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, instead claiming calls to build the structure were a “call for war.”
“Go to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, or a Muslim-dominated country. Why build a mosque like this in India?” he said.
For Hassan Ali, who was just nine when he spent two nights in a local police station trying to escape the 1992 violence, the sectarian fault lines are clearly visible.
“In 1992 there were many stories of local Hindus and Muslims helping each other. However now, there is a lot more poison that has been fed to people,” he said. “So one cannot tell anymore. One cannot tell what people have in their hearts.”"
OXNQPAJOWJ_4DOMKLSL3TBL9NH,"In South Carolina, Ron DeSantis prepares a last stand – and a way out","By Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","6 minute read Published 8:26 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/ron-desantis-south-carolina/,"With most of the political world closely watching New Hampshire this weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis instead spent Saturday 900 miles away in South Carolina, laying the groundwork for his presidential campaign’s last stand.
“I’m asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,” DeSantis told supporters at a Florence restaurant. “I’ll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida. I will always be a candidate that you can be proud of. As president, I will get the job done.”
In a marker of the confusion surrounding his unclear path forward, DeSantis’ campaign late Saturday was still scrambling to figure out which state their candidate would appear in on Sunday. The scheduling fluctuations resulted in DeSantis abruptly canceling plans to appear Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His campaign quickly chimed in publicly to end speculation about his political future to note that DeSantis will appear in New Hampshire on Sunday.

Yet, even as he soldiers on, DeSantis increasingly sounds like a candidate wrestling with his relevancy. In the days following his distant second-place finish in Iowa, DeSantis has lashed out at Fox News, bemoaned the money spent against him, blamed cold weather and “very low” enthusiasm for his performance, trivialized the sway of the Hawkeye State Republicans who endorsed him, conceded former President Donald Trump’s edge going forward, admitted his media strategy failed, and for the first time suggested what it would take for him to end his White House bid.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he said Friday night. “The minute I don’t, then I’m not just going to do this just for my health.”
His public journey through the seven stages of grief comes as his Republican rivals have all but dismissed his candidacy as an afterthought.
Trump recently predicted on his social media site that DeSantis “will SOON be out of money and dropping out of the race for President.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was “no longer focused on” DeSantis after Iowa.
“He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” she said. “He’s invisible in New Hampshire. He’s invisible in South Carolina. We’re focused on Trump. That’s the key.”
DeSantis, though, is intensely focused on Haley in South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. In appearances around the Palmetto State this week, DeSantis has contended she’s not conservative enough for the state and has asked the audience to list her accomplishments. He has asserted no one can.
Fourth-grade teacher Regina Wasiluk took issue with that suggestion. She showed up to DeSantis’ Lexington event to defend Haley’s record on education when he once again queried his crowd.
After a brief exchange, DeSantis shut her down.
“This isn’t your show, ma’am,” he said.
Wasiluk said after the experience she wouldn’t vote for DeSantis if he’s the GOP nominee.
“I was very upset that I didn’t bring my phone so that I can share it with other people who feel the same way that I do,” she said.
South Carolina’s February 24 primary is still more than a month away and comes after the Nevada caucuses. But coming just nine days before Super Tuesday, when the race expands into a national contest, the state typically turns into “the graveyard of a lot of campaigns and the booster rocket to at least one,” said the state’s GOP chairman, Drew McKissick.
“This is your last chance to be able to focus on one state at a time,” McKissick said. “After that, you’ve got to be on the air and on the ground in half a dozen to a dozen states at one time. That’s cost prohibitive, time prohibitive and manpower prohibitive.”
Still, DeSantis’ campaign is not setting expectations for a win here or even a second-place finish. Instead, it appears singularly focused on playing spoiler to Haley on her home turf. The theory behind the strategy is Haley would drop out if she can’t manage a strong performance in the state she once led, though she has given no indication that is the case. The Florida governor is moving much of his campaign here to carry out that mission.
DeSantis himself is not setting expectations, either. He told reporters Saturday, “I’m not a political pundit,” when asked his end goal in South Carolina and whether there’s a district he thinks he can win.
“We’re here. You saw the folks. We get great reception,” DeSantis said, referencing a large crowd at the Myrtle Beach event. “As this thing turns, you know, we’re gonna be in a good situation.”
But DeSantis has stopped short of the scorched-earth offensive it may take to damage Haley. His remarks across three stops Saturday largely touched on familiar themes – his accomplishments in Florida, the scourges of a “woke” culture and the urgency to change course as a country – none of which moved the needle for him in Iowa and New Hampshire.
One attendee in Myrtle Beach asked DeSantis why he hasn’t gained traction from Republicans in 2024 given his track record in Florida – a sign of the skepticism from voters that accompanies worsening odds.
“I got to break through a lot of clutter out there in ways that other candidates don’t,” DeSantis contended. “There’s other candidates that get elevated, and I got to break through the clutter.”
Unclear is how much firepower DeSantis will have to “break through the clutter.” DeSantis’ campaign and supporting super PACs have not aired an ad outside of Iowa since mid-November, and the Hawkeye State did not deliver the result for him that could have led to a fundraising bonanza.
Meanwhile, Haley’s campaign is preparing to launch a $4 million media buy in South Carolina beginning the day of the New Hampshire primary, her campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, told reporters Saturday. Americans for Prosperity Action, which is supporting Haley, also has about $2.3 million booked in the state, according to AdImpact.
Also missing since getting thrashed in Iowa is the swagger of the candidate who once cosplayed as a “Top Gun” pilot to drive home the point he will “never back down from a fight.” DeSantis appeared tired touring his third state this week while keeping up a schedule badly battered by winter storms. Asked by a voter Saturday in Myrtle Beach whom he’d pick as a running mate, DeSantis listlessly batted away the question with a blunt assessment of his standing in the GOP race.
“It’s presumptuous,” he said. “I’ve got eight delegates. Trump’s got 20. You gotta get there.”
A visit to South Carolina four days before New Hampshire votes would seem to necessitate punting on the Granite State – where Trump and Haley are in a heated fight and he is at risk of not reaching the 10% vote threshold needed to earn delegates in the state. Yet, as DeSantis arrived in South Carolina, he published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Journal in which he urged voters to support him.
“Support me in the coming New Hampshire primary,” he wrote, “and I will embody the live free or die spirit as your next president.”

PD80HN85LB_O8H9Z3QRI7YZVV2,Trump goes all in on attacking Nikki Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,"By Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:29 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/trump-haley-new-hampshire/,"Former President Donald Trump spent the three-year anniversary of his White House departure trying to sweep away the few remaining Republican obstacles to his third consecutive nomination, hammering former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and warning supporters against complacency two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester, “because we have to send real unity as a message.”
But over more than 90 minutes, Trump delivered the vengeful message that he has made the focus of his campaign, moaning about the lost 2020 race; defending the January 6, 2021, rioters; pushing again for the Supreme Court to declare him and all presidents immune from prosecution; mocking President Joe Biden; and, with the most gusto, lashing out at Haley, his former UN ambassador and the candidate closest to him in Granite State primary polls.

Even before he spoke, Trump’s campaign beamed its message on a big screen above the stage with rotating slides attacking Haley over supposed ties to “Democrats, Wall Street & Globalists” and her positions on Social Security and other hot-button issues.
When he took the microphone, Trump kept up the barrage.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to run the radical Democratic campaign operation she’s running,” Trump said, referencing his rival’s appeal to some centrist and anti-Trump political groups and donors. “What the hell kind of Republican candidate is that?”
After running through a laundry list of policy criticisms, most pointedly Haley’s campaign pledge to raise the retirement age for younger people, delaying their access to Social Security payments, Trump jabbed back at Haley over her suggestion that he is too old to be president again – which followed an incident in which Trump confused her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it,” Haley, 52, said earlier Saturday of Trump, 77, at a rally in Keene, New Hampshire.
Trump shot back at the rally, claiming he’s recently taken a “cognitive test,” which he “aced,” before promising to “let you know when I go bad.”
After finishing third in Iowa behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley’s campaign is on the line in New Hampshire. A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters there support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley has the support of a majority — 58% — of registered undeclared voters, but the former president is backed by 67% of registered Republicans.

Granite State voting rules — and their potential to help Haley — were a frequent target for Trump on Saturday night, as the former president groused over the potential for those who don’t consider themselves Republicans or typically vote for the GOP to cast ballots in its presidential primary.
But he added a false flourish to that case, telling the audience that Democrats, too, can take part on the Republican contest. They cannot.
“Registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary, and registered Republicans cannot vote in the Democratic primary,” New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan told CNN earlier this week after Trump leveled a similar charge.
Trump also looked ahead to the next major clash in the race: South Carolina. It’s Haley’s home state, where she was twice elected governor, but Trump leads there in the polls and among influential GOP leaders – a handful of whom showed up in New Hampshire.
“We could be in our home state, but we chose to come up to New Hampshire for a reason,” Rep. Russell Fry said. Gov. Henry McMaster invoked the Spice Girls – really – to tell voters “what we want, what we really really want” is Trump.

“We’re going to be there in three weeks, so you know what I’m doing,” Trump said of his guests, adding, “I’m kissing ass.”
Again, it was Trump’s desires that took centerstage.
He repeated his contention that all US presidents, beginning with him, should have immunity from prosecution. This relatively new line of argument comes as Trump awaits a ruling from a federal appeals court regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In the meantime, he’s argued presidents should never face legal consequences for their actions.
The court hearing the claim has expressed skepticism, but Trump is continuing to make his case in public. On Saturday night, he invoked President Harry Truman’s use of the nuclear bomb in Japan in 1945 as a case study.
“Look at Harry Truman,” Trump said. “He wouldn’t have done, if you think Hiroshima, not exactly a nice act but it did end the Second World War probably, right? Nagasaki. He wouldn’t be doing that; he said, ‘I don’t want to do that because my opponents will indict me.’”
The US dropped atomic bombs on both cities toward the end of the war, killing at least 150,000 in Hiroshima alone, according to some estimates. Though the morality of the decision has been debated, no one sought to bring legal charges against Truman.
Trump had much less to say about DeSantis. He even made a point of noting how little he’d spoken about the Florida governor (before proceeding to mock his height at the prompting of a supporter). He had more kind words, though, for Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban.
“It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” Trump said of the strongman, happily reciting the nice things that Orban has recently said about him.

PMYAEZ0CJ4_9NKAU3CUUY9WFHH,"Yes, employers can set a mandatory retirement age. What you need to know","By Jeanne Sahadi, CNN","6 minute read Published 12:00 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/success/mandatory-retirement-age-boards-ceos/,"Former US Vice President Al Gore, 75, is stepping down from Apple’s board because of the company’s age-based restrictions for its directors, and it raises the question of ageism in Corporate America.
By no means is age 75 — or any age over 65 — an automatic disqualifier for US corporate leaders.
Consider: The top 10 oldest CEOs of companies on the Russell 3000 — led by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett — ranged in age from 84 to 91 in 2022, according to The Conference Board and ESG data analytics firm ESGAUGE. As of this writing, they are all still on the job.
In fact, mandatory retirement ages are more of an exception than a rule in Corporate America, and they don’t exist for US lawmakers or surgeons or many other jobs. But they do exist in a lot of public-safety occupations.
Here’s a look at where they are most and least prevalent, and why.
Having a mandatory retirement policy for board members is up to the discretion of individual companies. But a majority do have them.

“In 2023, 69% of [S&P 500] boards reported having a mandatory retirement policy — down one point from 2022,” according to an August 2023 report from executive search firm Spencer Stuart.
Among those with such policies, the vast majority (97%) set the retirement age at 72 or higher, with 57% putting it at 75 or older, the report noted.
“Director retirement policies continue to be quite commonly found in corporate organizational documents, as the need for board refreshment is ongoing,” said Matteo Tonello, a managing director at The Conference Board, who advises members about governance issues.
That’s due largely to the need for boards to diversify in a number of ways, Tonnello said, citing gender and racial diversity and also diversification in terms of qualifications and skills, such as having experience with emerging technologies.
It is harder to quantify how many companies impose a mandatory retirement age for CEOs and other senior leaders, Tonello said.

For one thing, some companies may have retirement age policies on paper but will disregard them when they want to keep someone on.
“Boards often override them due to the inconvenient circumstances the company may face when the policy is triggered,” he said.
Those circumstances can be a company going through a crisis (or conversely performing very well); a tight labor market for senior talent; or an economic downturn.
For example: Target CEO Brian Cornell was 63 in 2022, when he and the board agreed he would stay on another three years. The board said it would eliminate its policy of discussing a CEO’s retirement when he or she turns 65.
And in 2021, in the midst of Boeing’s 737 Max crisis, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun turned 64. The company board waived its mandatory retirement age of 65 and announced it would extend it to age 70 for Calhoun.
But waiving a mandatory retirement age policy for one CEO doesn’t mean a board won’t resurrect it for someone else.
“These policies have often disappeared from corporate governance principles or other organizational documents. [That] does not mean though that they have been rescinded, since there is no disclosure obligation related to them. And many boards may choose to unofficially keep them in place, [and] use them only when convenient,” Tonello explained.
Then again, boards may not have to make the call too often since many CEOs leave well before traditional retirement age. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks CEO exits, reports that “the average age of an exiting CEO was 56 in 2023, down from over 63 in 2017.”
Thanks to federal and state age discrimination laws, generally speaking it is illegal for companies to impose a mandatory retirement age for rank-and-file employees, said Thomas McKinney, a partner at the employment law firm of Castronovo & McKinney, LLC.
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act applies to all companies with 20 or more employees. But a state can decide to apply prohibitions to a wider swath of employers if it chooses. For example, McKinney noted, New Jersey prohibits all companies, regardless of how many employees they have, from imposing a mandatory retirement age on workers.
So why is it okay for companies to push their CEOs and board members out the door after a certain age?
There is an exception in the ADEA that lets companies set retirement ages for anyone 65 or older if they are a bonafide executive or high-level policymaker (which includes senior executives other than CEOs or board members) and who stands to receive non-forfeitable retirement benefits valued at a minimum of $44,000 a year.
Individual states may set a lower retirement benefit threshold.
The ADEA, however, does not apply to organizations of all kinds.
For example, McKinney notes, it does not cover partners and shareholders in closely held corporations. So doctors or lawyers working in a small practice may be asked to hand in their work ID when they turn 65 or older.

However, there is no official required retirement age for surgeons when it comes to physically operating on patients. But the American College of Surgeons put out a statement in 2016 — which the ACS still stands by today — that recommends surgeons, “starting at age 65-70,” voluntarily seek out physical, visual and cognitive testing among other measures.
Many other public safety occupations do have mandatory retirement ages. Commercial airline pilots, for instance, under federal law may no longer fly commercially after turning 65 (though there has been a legislative push in Congress to increase that age to 67).
Federal and state police officers are typically subject to mandatory retirement ages, too, McKinney said.
In New York State, for instance, state police officers with at least 20 years’ service must retire after turning 60. But US Capitol Police officers with that same tenure must retire at 57, although in 2020 they were temporarily exempted from that requirement.
Other federal jobs subject to mandatory retirement ages are “firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, air traffic controllers, and customs and border protection officers,” according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
There may be varied stated reasons for having a mandatory retirement age, such as opening up the pipeline for younger talent to have more opportunities. Or, in the case of boards, as Tonello noted, there is often a desire to diversify and fill roles with various types of expertise.
But the underlying reason for retirement age policies is often more of a knee-jerk assumption.
“What is behind these mandatory retirement policies and laws is an assumption that somebody older is not as qualified, competent or productive,” said Mary O’Neill, an attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Or, in the case of public-safety jobs, “there’s an assumption that age is connected with safety and physical competence,” O’Neill said.
But all such assumptions are based more on “myths, fears and stereotypes” than fact, she said, noting that performing individual assessments of employees is a better way to determine competency of all kinds — physical, mental and psychological.
“There will be some 33-year-olds who don’t have the ability to do a job if you do an individual assessment,” she said.
And some 65-year-olds may not make the grade either. But some will.
For that reason, advocates for older workers, like the AARP, contend all mandatory retirement ages should be eliminated, even for demanding jobs involving public safety.
“Numerous scientific and medical studies find no need for this age-based discrimination,” the AARP notes in its latest policybook on employment issues.
“Public safety would be better served by periodically testing the fitness of public-safety employees, regardless of age, rather than relying on arbitrary age restrictions.”"
Q0NFYF2KJ5_CCL6M6YQM083NLS,What voters in New Hampshire have to say about Nikki Haley and Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary,"By Arit John and Jeff Zeleny, CNN","7 minute read Updated 4:52 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-voters/,"Danielle Brown voted for John McCain in the 2000 New Hampshire Republican primary and for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary eight years later. On Tuesday, she intends to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to send a clear message to both parties.
“We need to have some new ideas and a new, younger generation coming in,” Brown, an undeclared voter, said as she clutched a Haley 2024 yard sign freshly autographed by the candidate. “Haley is energized. I think she can do a lot for our country.”
Brown is a voter stuck in the middle, one of thousands of undeclared and independent residents who make up a plurality of the Granite State’s electorate and a critical part of Haley’s coalition. Her chances in New Hampshire – and by extension, the fate of her campaign – likely hinge on how many independents vote for her in the state’s primary Tuesday.

As of Friday, 344,335 voters in New Hampshire were registered as undeclared, making up nearly 40% of the electorate.
Haley’s campaign is targeting Republicans and undeclared voters from the suburbs to the seacoast, advisers said, particularly in precincts where Trump underperformed other Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu. Though former President Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, he lost the state in the general election in both 2016 and 2020.
A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley is backed by a majority – 58% – of registered undeclared voters, but the former president has the support of 67% of registered Republicans.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon, was backed by just 6% of New Hampshire GOP voters in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would have needed to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
A win in New Hampshire could offer Haley’s campaign the momentum, and donor money, necessary to compete in South Carolina on February 24 and the Super Tuesday states voting on March 5.
A loss, however, might hasten the speed at which the Republican Party coalesces around Trump.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who ended his own presidential bid in November, became the latest former candidate to endorse Trump at a rally in Concord on Friday. Haley dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that Trump was lining up “Washington insiders” despite vowing to drain the swamp.
“But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do,” Haley said.
As Trump campaigns in New Hampshire, the former president is trying to keep Republicans in line – and out of reach for Haley.
“Nikki Haley in particular is counting on the Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Portsmouth on Wednesday.
His rallying cry is false. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and the deadline for registering as a Republican or undeclared voter was October. Undeclared voters have the option to choose either a Democratic or Republican primary ballot on Election Day.

Greg Moore, a senior adviser for AFP Action, the political network backed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that has thrown its resources behind Haley, said Friday that the group’s data shows the former governor’s base includes conservative voters. AFP Action, which endorsed Haley in November, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire, Moore said.
“I think some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump,” Moore said. “I know that’s not true.”
What the former president may not know is that Haley’s rallies and town hall meetings in New Hampshire last week were filled with voters like Susan Rice of Rochester, who twice voted for Trump.
Rice, who owns a yarn business in New Hampshire and Maine, was invited to the White House in 2018 during the Trump administration for an event to showcase small-business leaders. She said she believed it was time for the country to move on.
“I’m a staunch Republican and I have been my entire life,” Rice said. “I think it’s time to have a woman as a president. I like her foreign policies and I like the fact that she has a good understanding of our southern border and what she wants to do for that.”
She said she was exhausted by Trump and excited by Haley’s potential to rebuild the Republican Party.
“I don’t necessarily worry about the court cases,” Rice said. “But it’s the baggage, and honestly, sometimes what comes out of his mouth and – how do I put this diplomatically – the name-calling, the putting other people down.”
Michael Lewis, a Hollis resident, said he supported the way Trump approached the economy, the border and America’s relationship with NATO, but he couldn’t vote for a presidential candidate “whose age is past life expectancy.”
He also expressed doubts that Trump will still be eligible to run for president in the general election.
“I think the sequence is there’s campaigning, then there’s the [Republican National] Convention, then there’s going to be the conviction of Donald Trump,” Lewis said. “There’s going to have to be an alternative. I think she’s the answer.”
Still, while some former Trump voters are open, even eager, to vote for Haley, the former president’s base in New Hampshire remains strong.
“MAGA is not going to be with her,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday.
That was the sentiment at the Saddle Up Saloon in Kingston on Friday afternoon, where GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio rallied a few dozen Trump supporters. In interviews, attendees mentioned several criticisms Haley’s rivals have leveled against her foreign policy views and her conservatism.
Sylvia, a Nashua voter at the event who declined to give her last name, said she would sit out the general election if Trump made Haley his running mate.
“She’s a RINO, she’s a war monger,” she said, using the acronym for “Republican in name only.” “I’m not for her at all.”
Bill Jackson, an 86-year-old from Hampton who plans to vote for Trump, said he believed Haley has support only among elitists and echoed the former president’s comments about Democratic crossover votes.
“She’s pro-war. She’s also pro-immigration, illegal immigration,” he said. “I mean, she said we’ve got to treat these people as equals. No, we don’t, they’re illegally coming into this country.”
Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have tried to paint Haley as weak on border security. Haley has responded by saying securing the border would be a top priority of her administration. She has characterized herself as a conservative and said her advocacy for a strong US foreign policy is meant to prevent war.
On the trail, Haley has expanded on the pitch she started making on the night of the Iowa caucuses – that she is the best chance voters have of preventing both Trump and President Joe Biden from winning a second term. She has highlighted polls that show her beating Biden in a general election by a wider margin than the GOP front-runner, and argued that she would help Republicans down ballot win House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
A Marist poll released Friday found Haley running near-even with Biden, 47% to 44%, in a New Hampshire general election matchup, while Trump trailed Biden by 7 points.
Haley has also sought to draw comparisons between Trump and Biden, from their ages to the amount of government spending they approved in office, and said both presidents come with “baggage.”
Her revamped stump speech also pushes back more aggressively against the Trump campaign’s characterization of parts of her record, including her position that the retirement age needs to be raised for people in their 20s and 30s. In a recent ad, Trump’s campaign incorrectly claimed Haley wants to limit Social Security for current beneficiaries.
Haley noted that Trump supported raising the Social Security age to 70. Trump supported raising the Social Security age in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” but wavered on whether to cut entitlements since running for president in 2016, CNN’s KFile reported last year.
“If he’s going to lie about me, we’re going to tell the truth about him,” Haley said in Hollis on Thursday. “You’re going to see a lot of things said, but at the end of the day it’s the drama, and vengeance, and the vindictiveness that we want to get out of the way.”
The message resonated with Nancy Protzmann, an undeclared voter who attended the Hollis event and said she’s long been looking for a candidate to back against Trump. As she left the venue, she said she plans to request a Republican ballot and vote for Haley.
“I will do anything in my power to make sure that Trump does not become our next president,” Protzmann said. “But I liked what she said – and I don’t want Biden either.”
Asked whether her decision was intended to be more of an affirmative vote for Haley or a roadblock for Trump, she said ideally both.
“I hope it will be a launching pad for her, because I do think she would be a good president,” Protzmann said. “And I certainly hope it will help block him.”

QITVWBMK27_7QMYRMO960L2PBC,DeSantis ends 2024 presidential campaign and endorses Trump,"By Steve Contorno and Kit Maher, CNN","7 minute read Updated 3:58 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/desantis-ends-2024-campaign/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who entered the Republican presidential primary as Donald Trump’s greatest threat, announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president.
His announcement, made in a video posted on X, comes after a disappointing second-place finish in last week’s Iowa Republican caucuses.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it, but I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,” DeSantis said.
He then touted his support for Trump: “While, I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.”
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement, because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,” he said.
His departure leaves former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as the lone Trump alternative in the race but without much time to consolidate support and catch up to the front-runner.
DeSantis’ decision came after days of conversations with donors. It became clear over the weekend that there was neither the rationale nor the financial support to continue his candidacy.
DeSantis and his wife Casey made the decision Sunday afternoon, surprising many of his rank-and-file staffers and supporters.
DeSantis called top donors personally and told them that he had woken up that morning and decided there was no path to winning and it was time to get out, two Republican donors with knowledge of the calls told CNN.
DeSantis told the donors that there was no reason to waste his time and money staying in the race. DeSantis said there was no path to victory with Trump in the race, recalling how he kept hearing from attendees at his events that, “if it wasn’t for Trump, I would vote for you.”
The two sources said DeSantis knows he is young and if he is to have a chance at winning the GOP presidential nomination in 2028, he needed to endorse Trump.
It’s a devastating blow to the promising career of a once-rising GOP star, and his failure to reach the lofty expectation of his candidacy has already sparked a wave of second-guessing from close allies and advisers. Some believe DeSantis took too long to attack former President Donald Trump. Others think his team underestimated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
More yet remain convinced that there was nothing DeSantis could have done to wrestle the party from Trump’s loyal and sizable followers.
“DeSantis has run the playbook to a T,” Steve Deace, a well-known conservative radio commentator and supporter of the Florida governor, told CNN in recent weeks. “It’s just as simple as: when they started indicting Donald Trump, people weren’t ready to move on from him. And for DeSantis, it wasn’t quite his time.”
For his part, DeSantis has blamed his performance on a host of challenges, including Iowa’s weather, conservative media’s loyalty to Trump and the unprecedented barrage of negative ads against him. One thing he hasn’t faulted was his main pitch to voters – his record of accomplishment in Florida – which he continued to feature in speech after speech until his final moments as a presidential candidate.
Last week’s outcome in Iowa proved an especially devastating blow. DeSantis had once vowed to win the state, then predicted he would perform well, claiming his ground game would reveal itself as a secret weapon. He instead finished nearly 30 points behind Trump and barely edged out Haley for second place, sapping his credibility along with the enthusiasm for him.
DeSantis vowed to fight on, but after Iowa, it was increasingly clear to many around him that his campaign had run its course.
Trump can now take credit for upending the political futures of three of the most prominent and promising Republican politicians in his adopted home state: DeSantis, former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (the latter two of whom he bested in the 2016 Republican presidential primary).
It is unclear what is next for DeSantis, who, at age 45, has three years remaining in his second term as governor before he is term-limited. In recent weeks, DeSantis has planted the seeds for a potential 2028 bid, claiming that some Trump supporters have already encouraged it.
“They were coming up to me saying, ‘We want you in 2028, we love you, man,’” the governor recently told reporters.
DeSantis had an inauspicious start on the path to White House contender. It wasn’t until his third term in the US House in 2017 that he began to make a name for himself as a loyal defender of Trump on Fox News. On the website then known as Twitter, Trump called DeSantis “a true FIGHTER!”
With Trump’s backing, DeSantis won the Florida governorship in 2018. DeSantis then spent the next four years charting a path distinct from his one-time ally. He found his lane as an unabashed and willing culture warrior who broke from the medical community during the coronavirus pandemic and dove into national controversies over immigration, education and LGTBQ issues, earning fawning media coverage from right-wing outlets along the way.
By the time of his 19-point reelection victory in 2022 – when a GOP red wave fizzled elsewhere and many Trump-backed candidates flamed out – a presidential campaign was all but certain. Republicans looking to move on from Trump saw a resume straight out of central casting: blue-collar roots, Little League star, a college athlete at Yale, Harvard law degree, Navy veteran and a photogenic young family.
Beyond that, DeSantis at that point had never lost a race.
“DeFuture,” declared the New York Post, the tabloid published by conservative media mogul Rupert Mudoch, the morning after the midterm election, with DeSantis and his wife Casey, a top confidant, splashed across the cover.
But DeSantis slow-walked his entrance into the race – there was first a book to sell and a legislative session to oversee – and, once in, he struggled to match those lofty expectations. More critically, DeSantis failed to convince other Republican presidential hopefuls that he and Trump stood alone atop the GOP and spent the 2023 summer running against a crowded field instead of the former president.
The campaign trail proved a challenging environment for DeSantis, who had grown accustomed to holding court and chastising media from behind a lectern. His political foes gleefully elevated his stiff and awkward interactions with voters. In eight months as a candidate, he struggled to articulate a coherent rationale for his candidacy and focused more often on his past accomplishments as a governor than his ideas for the future.
His campaign was also beset with cost overruns and shakeups that dogged him throughout the summer. A small group of loyal but inexperienced advisers in Tallahassee regularly clashed with the veteran GOP operatives who commanded his super PAC, led by strategist Jeff Roe. By the time Iowans caucused, the super PAC, Never Back Down, was on its fourth CEO, had undergone an exodus of staff and advisers and was no longer running ads.
Still, DeSantis remained a viable candidate until the voting started, a testament to a relentless appetite for campaign stops and media appearances. In Iowa, for example, he visited all 99 counties and had earned the support of the state’s popular Republican governor, Kim Reynolds.
But it was clear in the days after the Iowa caucuses, when he appeared tired and sounded dejected, that the grind of the campaign had taken its toll. DeSantis maintained, though, that he had no regrets about running.
“If I had been sitting on the sidelines, and Republicans end up losing in 2024, people then would have said, ‘Oh, well, you had the opportunity to do something, and you didn’t,’” he said in a recent interview. “So, any one can sit there and carp on the sidelines – get in the arena, and fight for what you believe in.”

R5TC9YJ195_H1C6WR2RUQJK1ZC,Media literacy is more than spotting fake news. How one librarian gives teens the tools to decide what to trust,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:13 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/us/teaching-media-literacy-in-schools/,"Along with the smell of old books and the shelves of trendy novels at the South Brunswick High School library are guides for accurately deciphering the digital world.
Poster after poster with “Smart Social Networking” tips and what “Good Digital Citizenship” looks like hang at this New Jersey campus, where school librarian Lisa Manganello has made it her mission to teach teenagers to navigate the vast – often deliberately confusing – landscape of online information.
“Media literacy has absolutely nothing to do with which side of the debate you’re on,” the 17-year veteran of this still-emerging academic subject told CNN. “And I often say to my students, I don’t care if you are conservative or if you are liberal, it really doesn’t make a difference to me.
“Whatever article you’re choosing, I want you to be able to look at it from a critical lens and really make a decision about whether or not this is a trustworthy article,” Manganello told CNN. “You can have an opinion on either side, but you should be able to validate that opinion with a fact-based article.”
Media literacy is the ability to decode media messages – including the systems in which they exist – assess their influence on thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and create media thoughtfully and conscientiously, according to Media Literacy Now, an advocacy group that tracks and drives the subject’s implementation in K-12 schools across the United States.
With lots of kids now getting their news from social media – where disinformation and content created by artificial intelligence run rampant – 18 states have some form of K-12 media literacy education on the books, according to Media Literacy Now. Of those, four – Delaware, Texas, New Jersey and, starting this year, California – mandate media literacy, with lesson standards now being crafted state by state.
Many US teens ‘almost constantly’ using YouTube, TikTok, new Pew Research report shows
Online misinformation, of course, can direct kids not only to messages that aren’t true but also to dangers like cyberbullying, negative body image and a path into substance abuse, the group says. And so the potential impact of teaching them how to interpret what they see online could be nothing short of “life-changing,” said Olga Polites, New Jersey chapter leader for Media Literacy Now.
When cars were invented, for instance, auto safety wasn’t widely talked about, seatbelts weren’t a priority and learning how to drive was a whole new landscape, she said.
“(Cell) phones are like cars,” Polites told CNN. “But we haven’t really taught people how to use them ethically, efficiently and responsibly.”
To do that, a media literacy lesson might include analyzing which emotions the wording of a mass media headline evoke. Or parsing the photo that runs alongside the text of a news piece. Or using “lateral reading” – lining up stories on the same topic in browser tabs to compare credibility, intent and biases – as Manganello did a few weeks ago at South Brunswick High School.
With a variety of news headlines displayed on her projector screen, the librarian asked 25 students in history teacher Jeff Johnson’s American government class the following:
“Te﻿ll me words that you see in these headlines that you think shows bias?”
“Revenge,” one student quickly said, though with a little hesitation in his voice.
“Ah, revenge!” Manganello replied.
The group, armed with personal laptops and seated four to a table, kept discussing: What might a more neutral word choice have been?
“I thought it was very interesting to think about how we get our information and how we interpret it because of what (the media is) telling us, especially the part where it was talking about the word choice that people use and how it can influence your opinions,” ninth grader Harrison Pekosz told CNN later.
In elementary and middle school, Harrison learned about identifying legitimate sources of information based on a web address ending with “.com” or “.org.”
“Now, it’s more in-depth, and I know there’s more to look at than just domain,” he said.
Soon, Manganello shifted the lesson to photos and asked students to identify whether an image attached to a news article was “flattering, neutral or unflattering.” The choice, she said, could help determine whether the piece as a whole is trustworthy – or not.
“Information literacy is the umbrella for all of the things that we teach in the library … to make sure that our students have all the tools they need to do both information gathering and to engage with media that could be online, social media, for research,” Manganello said. “Media literacy kind of falls under that information literacy banner.”
Beyond the library, Manganello works with teachers at South Brunswick High School throughout the year to incorporate information literacy into their lesson plans, from art history to science classes. She also speaks at educational conferences, where attendees have approached her to ask how they can get started implementing her work in their schools, she said.
On her own campus, Manganello’s goal is to see every student a few times a year, focusing on a new skill each time over their four years, she said. In the end, students have a kit of tools to tap into when they’re scanning the latest headlines – especially online.
Akshara Satheesh and Urja Kandale, both ninth graders at South Brunswick High School, get their news from TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat or Google’s News Discovery feed because of how simple it is to understand storylines, they told CNN.
And they’re not alone.
“We found that 75% of them get their information off of social media, many off of TikTok,” Manganello told CNN.
It’s not an unfathomable stat, considering a growing number of adult TikTok users in the US report getting their news on the short-video platform, according to 2023 data from the Pew Research Center.
That in itself isn’t necessarily a problem: Plenty of reputable news agencies share their reports on social media platforms.
Here’s the catch: 96% of high school students surveyed in in 2018 and 2019 failed to accurately judge the credibility of a piece of information online, Stanford University research found. And two-thirds couldn’t tell the difference between news articles and advertisements on the home page of US news agency.
“Students displayed a troubling tendency to accept websites at face value,” wrote the study’s authors.
In fact, more than 80% of middle school students a few years earlier believed an ad identified by the words “sponsored content” was a real news story, a Stanford survey published in 2016 found; some students even mentioned it was sponsored content but still believed it was a news article.
Teens should be trained before entering the world of social media, APA says
“Young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak,” those authors wrote.
The confusion derives – at least in part, experts say – from the fact that most students aren’t being taught how to use mass media critically, said Polites of Media Literacy Now in New Jersey.
“We’ve given (teens) so little guidance,” Polites said. “And there’s so much life-changing risk that comes with that.”
From Manganello’s lesson, Akshara and Urja’s major takeaways included narrowing their focus on key terms, they said.
“I’ve done stuff like this before,” Urja said, “but we didn’t dive deep.”
While Manganello’s program at South Brunswick High School is a great model, right now it’s the exception, said Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.
“We’re getting legislators to put their foot down and say, ‘We need to see some changes in our education system,’ but now it’s, ‘Where is the funding coming from?’” she said. “‘Where’s the support for teachers and their professional development? How are we really integrating this into our curriculum, across school(s), across a big area, across grade levels?’
“And that is a much broader, slower, more challenging conversation, because it’s expensive and time-consuming.”
New Jersey’s governor last year signed a law that requires the state Education Department to develop student learning standards in information literacy. And California starting this year requires media literacy instruction to be integrated into K-12 mathematics, science and history-social science curriculums when they’re revised, according to the bill.
But getting the frameworks and grade-specific lessons down in writing can take several drafts, even before public comment is sought and polished proposals presented to district leaders, said Elisabeth Yucis, associate director in the Professional Development and Instructional Issues Division at the New Jersey Education Association, an educators union.
Teachers are on the front lines of a battle to change how teens use social media
All in all, the process could take a while, she said.
Meanwhile, Johnson, the history teacher at South Brunswick, hopes in 10 years his students will be able to find clarity in what they’re thinking and saying because of the foundation Manganello is creating for them.
Johnson wants his students to learn to say, “‘Wait a minute, why am I feeling like this? Do I believe this?’” he said. “Or, ‘I just told somebody something happened, but did I even check that that actually happened or that that’s even a big deal to me? Like, why am I saying it’s a big deal?’”
And indeed, Harrison, the ninth grader, already is thinking about how important these lessons are for the future.
“Now that there are more people turning 18 and a lot of them are getting all of their information from social media … I think that will impact how they vote and will impact the country as a result,” he said.
It’s why Manganello has spent nearly two decades perfecting how she teaches media literacy.
“These are kids that are going to go out and do brilliant things,” the librarian said. “We need them to think about how they accept information in a smarter way because I think that will change the way we all do.”"
SQEYJOPJ6H_RUXRKZDKXK95CM9,Trump goes all in on attacking Nikki Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,"By Gregory Krieg, CNN","5 minute read Updated 9:29 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/trump-haley-new-hampshire/,"Former President Donald Trump spent the three-year anniversary of his White House departure trying to sweep away the few remaining Republican obstacles to his third consecutive nomination, hammering former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and warning supporters against complacency two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester, “because we have to send real unity as a message.”
But over more than 90 minutes, Trump delivered the vengeful message that he has made the focus of his campaign, moaning about the lost 2020 race; defending the January 6, 2021, rioters; pushing again for the Supreme Court to declare him and all presidents immune from prosecution; mocking President Joe Biden; and, with the most gusto, lashing out at Haley, his former UN ambassador and the candidate closest to him in Granite State primary polls.

Even before he spoke, Trump’s campaign beamed its message on a big screen above the stage with rotating slides attacking Haley over supposed ties to “Democrats, Wall Street & Globalists” and her positions on Social Security and other hot-button issues.
When he took the microphone, Trump kept up the barrage.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to run the radical Democratic campaign operation she’s running,” Trump said, referencing his rival’s appeal to some centrist and anti-Trump political groups and donors. “What the hell kind of Republican candidate is that?”
After running through a laundry list of policy criticisms, most pointedly Haley’s campaign pledge to raise the retirement age for younger people, delaying their access to Social Security payments, Trump jabbed back at Haley over her suggestion that he is too old to be president again – which followed an incident in which Trump confused her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it,” Haley, 52, said earlier Saturday of Trump, 77, at a rally in Keene, New Hampshire.
Trump shot back at the rally, claiming he’s recently taken a “cognitive test,” which he “aced,” before promising to “let you know when I go bad.”
After finishing third in Iowa behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley’s campaign is on the line in New Hampshire. A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters there support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley has the support of a majority — 58% — of registered undeclared voters, but the former president is backed by 67% of registered Republicans.

Granite State voting rules — and their potential to help Haley — were a frequent target for Trump on Saturday night, as the former president groused over the potential for those who don’t consider themselves Republicans or typically vote for the GOP to cast ballots in its presidential primary.
But he added a false flourish to that case, telling the audience that Democrats, too, can take part on the Republican contest. They cannot.
“Registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary, and registered Republicans cannot vote in the Democratic primary,” New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan told CNN earlier this week after Trump leveled a similar charge.
Trump also looked ahead to the next major clash in the race: South Carolina. It’s Haley’s home state, where she was twice elected governor, but Trump leads there in the polls and among influential GOP leaders – a handful of whom showed up in New Hampshire.
“We could be in our home state, but we chose to come up to New Hampshire for a reason,” Rep. Russell Fry said. Gov. Henry McMaster invoked the Spice Girls – really – to tell voters “what we want, what we really really want” is Trump.

“We’re going to be there in three weeks, so you know what I’m doing,” Trump said of his guests, adding, “I’m kissing ass.”
Again, it was Trump’s desires that took centerstage.
He repeated his contention that all US presidents, beginning with him, should have immunity from prosecution. This relatively new line of argument comes as Trump awaits a ruling from a federal appeals court regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In the meantime, he’s argued presidents should never face legal consequences for their actions.
The court hearing the claim has expressed skepticism, but Trump is continuing to make his case in public. On Saturday night, he invoked President Harry Truman’s use of the nuclear bomb in Japan in 1945 as a case study.
“Look at Harry Truman,” Trump said. “He wouldn’t have done, if you think Hiroshima, not exactly a nice act but it did end the Second World War probably, right? Nagasaki. He wouldn’t be doing that; he said, ‘I don’t want to do that because my opponents will indict me.’”
The US dropped atomic bombs on both cities toward the end of the war, killing at least 150,000 in Hiroshima alone, according to some estimates. Though the morality of the decision has been debated, no one sought to bring legal charges against Truman.
Trump had much less to say about DeSantis. He even made a point of noting how little he’d spoken about the Florida governor (before proceeding to mock his height at the prompting of a supporter). He had more kind words, though, for Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban.
“It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” Trump said of the strongman, happily reciting the nice things that Orban has recently said about him.

SQX1TTFXJD_E66M2SFD9LV8HGU,Here are the questions about accountability that remain after the DOJ Uvalde report,"By Ray Sanchez and Rachel Clarke, CNN","9 minute read Published 7:42 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/us/uvalde-school-shooting-doj-accountability/,"More than a year and half after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, a US Justice Department report detailing failures at every level of the law enforcement response may have a provided a small measure of hope for the victims’ families in their quest for accountability.
While the lengthy report released Thursday did not address their demands for a criminal investigation and possible charges against law enforcement officers involved in the botched operation, it seems that process indeed has begun.
A special grand jury was reportedly empaneled Friday to investigate what the nation’s top law enforcement official described as a disorganized and chaotic response by hundreds of local, state and federal agencies.
The timing appeared to be unrelated. A pool of potential grand jurors had previously been summoned to appear Friday, reported The Uvalde Leader-News. CNN has reached out to the local prosecutor and court officials for comment.
Read the FULL REPORT
“The community now has the kind of report necessary to make sure accountability occurs,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday. “I think it’s now up to the community, the state and local officials to make the appropriate determinations.”

A grand jury investigation would represent the first publicly known criminal proceeding related to the highly scrutinized response to the May 25, 2022, shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
The selection of a grand jury had been highly anticipated. But families of the victims have been frustrated by the delay in convening the panel.
“I feel like everyone’s just been pointing fingers at each other,” said Berlinda Irene Arreola, whose 10-year-old step granddaughter, Amerie Jo Garza, was killed at the school. “No one wants to take responsibility. Nobody wants to take accountability.”
District Attorney Christina Mitchell told the San Antonio Express-News the grand jury would review evidence related to the mass shooting, but declined comment on the focus of the investigation. Jurors are expected to spend at least six months investigating the case, according to The Uvalde Leader-News.
“Let the DA know we’re not going to go anywhere,” Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares was killed, told CNN Friday. “We’re going to stay here until charges are filed.”
The DOJ report is the fullest official accounting of what happened, though much had already been reported by CNN. Still, the assessment was limited in its scope.
“These families didn’t need a 400- or 500-page government report to learn that law enforcement failed them in a historic way,” Joshua Koskoff, an attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said Thursday.
The report does not make recommendations for punitive steps and its examination of the actions of federal officers at the scene is limited. The review was requested by the then-mayor of Uvalde, Don McLaughlin, who within weeks of the horror said he feared a “cover-up” and being shut out of other investigations amid changing narratives of what happened that day and who took on key decisions.
The Critical Incident Review said the continued gunfire, reports that a teacher had been shot, and a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman should all have prompted law enforcement officers to move to stop the bloodshed far sooner.
Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America’s ongoing scourge of campus shootings.

“Law enforcement can learn what happened in Uvalde to make sure something like this never happens ever again,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta told CNN Friday. “The first step of accountability – any basis for accountability – has to be truth and transparency, and that’s what we’ve tried to do.”
The DOJ said the victims “experienced unimaginable horror” and “witnessed unspeakable violence” as a result of the lack of courage and “cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training” on the part of law enforcement officials.
“The report concludes that had the law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices in an active shooter situation and gone right after the shooter to stop him, lives would have been saved and people would have survived,” Garland told reporters Thursday.
Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco was one of a handful of law enforcement officers named in the DOJ report, in which he was heavily criticized for not taking a leadership role. The report also confirmed CNN reporting that Nolasco knew the name of the gunman and that he had shot his grandmother before going to the school, but did not share that information.
“Sheriff Nolasco did not seek out or establish a command post, establish unified command, share the intelligence he learned from [the shooter’s] relatives, nor did he assign an intelligence officer to gather intelligence on the subject,” the DOJ report said.
“At one point, Sheriff Nolasco and UPD Acting Chief Pargas were within 10–15 feet of each other outside the exterior door of the northwest hallway; however, they were not coordinating with one another and continued to act independently.”
Then-school Police Chief Pete Arredondo, then-acting Uvalde Police Chief Mariano Pargas and Nolasco are singled out in the report for failing to lead. Arredondo was described by the Justice Department as the de facto on-scene commander.

Pargas resigned as acting police chief in November 2022 as the city was preparing to terminate him. A CNN report found he was aware students were alive in the classrooms and needed to be rescued but failed to organize help. Families of the victims have demanded that Pargas quit as a Uvalde county commissioner, a position he still holds.
CNN has reached out to Pargas for comment.
Arredondo, who was fired, has said he did not see himself as the incident commander and instead was “responding as a police officer.”
Nolasco should have questioned the decisions and lack of urgency shown by both Arredondo and Pargas toward entering the classrooms, the report said.
“I entrusted in the man with the gold badge,” Nolasco told CNN after the release of the report, referring to Arredondo. “I acted based on the information that was given to me.”
He told CNN he has already implemented some of the recommendations in the DOJ report, including increased training for his deputies.
Nolasco is running for reelection this year as county sheriff.
“We’re going to wait and see what the voters say. They have the last word,” he said.
Arreola said Thursday: “They have the audacity to run for reelection … knowing that they failed. And it’s there in black and white.”
State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said the reckonings had to go beyond the local officers, particularly to the state Department of Public Safety.
“There has been no accountability at the Department of Public Safety,” Gutierrez told CNN. “Nothing has been done to keep this from happening again.”
Asked about the possibility of the local justice system helping to deliver accountability, Gutierrez was scornful.
“This district attorney has had this case for 20 months,” he said. “There’s been nothing new. There’s no smoking gun. The shooter is dead. There’s no accomplices. There’s no nothing.”
He added, “Cops should have been indicted a long time ago for failure to render aid, for possibly criminal negligent homicide, so many different things. For 77 minutes those kids waited. … The errors that occurred were many. It wasn’t just against the local cops, the local police chief and the sheriff. We need to look at the Department of Public Safety and their head officers that were there on the scene that absolutely did nothing to safeguard these children.”

Some police officers have been convicted for their actions during encounters that resulted in death. But prosecutions and convictions of law enforcement personnel for failing to protect the public during mass shootings are uncommon.
Scot Peterson, the former school resource officer who stayed outside during the February 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was found not guilty last year of seven counts of felony child neglect, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury.
“That is going to be hard,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said of the likelihood of criminal charges related to the law enforcement response in Uvalde. “Being afraid is not a crime, having bad tactical judgment is not a crime, and neither is incompetence under pressure.”
President Joe Biden, who said Thursday he had not yet read the full report, added that he didn’t “know that there’s any criminal liability.”
The DOJ report also questioned the actions of the Texas Department of Public Safety. For instance, the initial crime scene investigation, which was the responsibility of the DPS, was hampered by too many people walking into the two classrooms.
Col. Steve McCraw, DPS director, told CNN in September 2022: “I’ll be the first to resign. I’ll gladly resign. I’ll tender my resignation to the governor if I think there is any culpability in the Department of Public Safety. Period.”
McCraw was responding at the time to minutes of a meeting obtained by CNN that quoted him telling highway patrol captains “no one is losing their jobs” over the inept law enforcement response.
A month later, McCraw told angry families of slaughtered Robb students calling for him to resign: “If DPS as an institution failed the families, failed the school, or failed the community of Uvalde, then absolutely, I need to go. But I can tell you this right now: DPS as an institution right now did not fail the community, plain and simple.”
In a statement Thursday, DPS thanked the Justice Department for its report. “As DPS Director Steven McCraw first stated in the weeks after the shooting, the law enforcement response that day was an abject failure, and this report’s observations underscore those failures,” the DPS said.
DPS has not responded to requests for comment on the findings in the Justice Department report.
Seven of 91 DPS officers who responded to Robb Elementary were referred for investigation to the agency’s inspector general for their actions the day of the massacre. At least two have left voluntarily. The department did move to fire a Ranger, but he is still on the payroll as he challenges the termination.

Separately, DPS and the county district attorney continue to fight a request by CNN and other media organizations to release public records related to what happened at Robb Elementary.
Gutierrez said accountability should also include stricter gun control legislation. He said the law enforcement officers were afraid of the power of the assault-style rifle used by the gunman, and bought legally days after his 18th birthday.
“Politicians need to stop being cowards. They need to see the videos that I’ve seen, they need to see what this gun does,” he said.
Politicians “need to fully and finally pass an assault weapons ban in this country so that we do not see this happen again to another child,” said Gutierrez, who is running in the Democratic primary to be the challenger to Republican Texas US Sen. Ted Cruz this fall.
Koskoff, the attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said: “The questions that are not answered in this report are significantly more important than the questions that are.”
On Wednesday night, the frustrated parents of Khloie Torres, who was 10 when she survived the 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary, walked out of a meeting with Garland and other families before it was over.
Ruben and Jamie Torres left the meeting after about an hour. They expressed disappointment at what they heard ahead of the official release the next day of the DOJ report. They hadn’t heard anything new, the parents said.
Veronica Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was killed in the shooting, said the families will not stop their demands for accountability.
“I think we’re going to continue fighting,” she said. “We’re going to continue fighting that some type of change is made in honor of our kids.”

T9TC7X8CB0_5JGISBRUFKHSKKE,Opinion: Our possibly short national nightmare,"Opinion by Richard Galant, CNN","12 minute read Updated 9:19 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/trump-biden-new-hampshire-column-galant/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
On August 9, 1974, the only unelected vice president in American history took the presidential oath of office at a White House ceremony. It was the day after President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.
“My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Gerald Ford said.
“Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.” In words that sound almost foreign to our ears in the 21st century, Ford added, “As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.”
Last week the true-crime docuseries that shot to the top of the list of Netflix shows in the US was “American Nightmare.” But it wasn’t that kind of nightmare, or Gerald Ford’s one, that presidential candidate Nikki Haley invoked Monday after her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
“Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,” the former UN ambassador said. She was referring to polls showing that the majority of Americans don’t want a rematch between President Joe Biden and the president he defeated in 2020, Donald Trump.
When the results of the New Hampshire primary are reported Tuesday, we’ll have a better sense of whether anyone can stand in the way of that dreaded rematch. If not, it won’t be as protracted a “national nightmare” as the two-year-long Watergate scandal that put Gerald Ford in the Oval Office. This year’s election is on November 5 — and the inauguration is only one year away. Though, depending on your point of view, the real nightmare could begin after the swearing-in.
Haley is walking a tightrope, trying to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status among Republicans without alienating his MAGA base. “There’s an outside chance she can pull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump’s perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “But there’s another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control… If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP’s second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.”

Haley has been wary of directly going after the former president’s many vulnerabilities, while obliquely arguing that the nation can’t risk having a president in or nearing his 80s and that “chaos follows” Trump, whether or not it is his fault.
“Her ability to build momentum over the course of the primary showcases her political talent and ability to attract college-educated Republicans tired of having to explain away their support for a president whose hair-trigger social media posts verge into the unhinged,” wrote Patrick T. Brown.
Daniel McCarthy isn’t buying into the idea that Haley has momentum: “Former President Donald Trump’s easy win in Iowa on Monday confirms that there really is no race for the Republican nomination this year. With a deep freeze discouraging turnout, the caucuses provided a hard test of voter enthusiasm. Trump’s rivals failed it.”
“A measure of the former president’s insurmountable strength within the party is that he not only beat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, he also overcame all of the institutional powers backing them — some of the most formidable interests in the GOP.”
On the Democratic side, Biden isn’t even on the ballot Tuesday and isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire, due to a dispute between state and national party officials over the primary’s timing.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a low-profile 54-year-old legislator from Minnesota, is running in New Hampshire, SE Cupp noted, and is polling more strongly there than around the nation. It’s a longshot, Cupp noted, but “if Biden’s poll numbers keep going in the wrong direction, if voters feel taken for granted or even overlooked by Democrats, if a symbolic win in New Hampshire gives voters a reason to look more closely at Dean Phillips, well he might give Biden a run for his money.”
Karen Finney is the great-great-great-great niece of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and great-great-great granddaughter of a freed slave from Virginia.
“Walking through the door of my grandmother’s home in North Carolina,” Finney wrote, “it was impossible to miss a portrait of Lee proudly displayed on the wall. At mealtimes, during what occasionally felt like indoctrination, she would admiringly describe our famous ancestor, ‘the General,’ as a benevolent slave owner and noble warrior.”
“As she explained it, Lee valiantly fought an unjust ‘War of Northern Aggression’ in defense of ‘states’ rights,’ often referred to as ‘The Lost Cause.’ The South had been defeated, my grandmother insisted, only because the Northern army had more resources and slavery really wasn’t so bad.”
In Finney’s view, the Lost Cause is the backdrop for Trump’s suggestion that the Civil War could have been “negotiated,” the rewriting of history in school curriculums under Florida Gov. DeSantis’ administration and Haley’s struggle over the question of whether America is, or ever was, a racist country.
“Beyond absurdly omitting slavery as the root cause of the War, she made matters worse while trying to clean up her comments during a recent CNN Town Hall, saying she just assumed that slavery was a ‘given’ since all children learn about it in school in the South.”

Trump’s remark that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of Americans evokes the words of Adolf Hitler in “Mein Kampf,” author Paul Moses pointed out. But he added that the concept goes further back — to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century.
In 1914, the year Edward Alsworth Ross became president of the American Sociological Association, he published a book warning that immigrants, Moses wrote, “would act on Americans’ standards for cleanliness, morality and education ‘like a slow poison.’ A nation that relies on immigration to maintain its population ‘deserves the extinction that surely awaits it,’ he wrote…The prejudice beneath Ross’ opinions was obvious, but his ideas were mainstream and respectable — he was considered a progressive reformer…”
“But Ross came to regret the implications of his ideas about supposedly superior and inferior races, writing shortly after World War II that ‘we never imagined the theory being made a hinge for German aggression to turn on.’ That’s what the phony claims of eugenics led to — Hitler’s ‘Final Solution,’ which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. It’s certainly worth having vigorous debates about immigration laws, but those who’ve been indifferent to or even supportive of Trump’s increasingly clear turn toward racist, eugenic ideas should confront what they’ve enabled.”
Republicans describe the immigration surge at the US southern border as an “invasion” that presents a national security threat. Yet, John Avlon wrote, Trump and some members of the House GOP, want to tank an emerging compromise in the Senate that would couple border security measures with aid to Ukraine.
“Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more threats from his far-right flank, who have been signaling that they will balk at any border security bill until a Republican is president.
“Right-wing resistance is entirely consistent with a Trump-ified GOP that is more willing to demagogue an issue than actually deal with it.”

Trump sat in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday while E. Jean Carroll testified in support of her defamation case against the former president. Last May, she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation when a jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her. Now Carroll is seeking at least $10 million in additional damages for Trump’s 2019 comments about her allegation.
As Danielle Campoamor wrote, “Carroll found herself facing down not only a man found liable for assaulting her, but also a former president and current presidential frontrunner — an unprecedented example of the power dynamics survivors face. While a victim of sexual assault receives death threats, her assailant receives endorsements and secures the Iowa caucus.”
“During Carroll’s testimony, Trump repeatedly shook his head, according to CNN reporters inside the courtroom, and could be heard ‘loudly saying things’ such as ‘it’s false,’ ‘she’s gotten her memory back,’ and, according to Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley, that the lawsuit is ‘a witch hunt’ and a ‘con job.’”
When the judge threatened to oust Trump from the courtroom, the former president said, “I would love it.”
The chaotic court proceeding is just one example of why the Supreme Court should clear the way for allowing television cameras at Trump’s forthcoming election subversion trial, argued Robert C. Gottlieb. “Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue to impugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display during Wednesday’s court proceedings will undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.”
“The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.”
The narrative of fast-worsening inequality over the past half century has been challenged in a new study by economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They used data to show that, compared to the 1960s, the pre-tax income of the top 1% has increased only by 2.6% and after accounting for taxes, the share of income going to the super-rich “hasn’t budged at all,” wrote Jordan McGillis. The study disputes a 2018 finding by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman that the top 1% has seen its share of national pre-tax income go from 12% to 20% since the 1980s.
McGillis says there’s something else going on that tends to exacerbate inequality. Among rich Americans, marriage rates remain high, but they’ve plummeted for less affluent people, creating more single-person households with lower levels of income. “This cleavage makes possible what the Brookings Institution’s Melissa Kearney describes as “two-parent privilege,” an emerging phenomenon through which well-off couples transmit educational and economic advantages to their children. Viewed from this angle, it should not surprise us that many Americans think the rich are galloping ever further ahead.”
Elise Gould and Josh Bivens have a different take. Using Social Security Administration data, they found that the “share of earnings for the bottom 90% fell 9.7 percentage points between 1979 and 2022, while the share of earnings for the top 5% grew 8.8 percentage points. The very top — the top 0.1% of wage earners — nearly tripled its share of total earnings from 1.6% in 1979 to 4.6% in 2022… All of this straightforward data on earnings clearly shows a huge rise in inequality of pay in the US economy.”
The US and the UK struck back at the Houthis, the Yemeni insurgent group that is targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but the lingering question was about how effective such a series of strikes can be. “We think of war as a last resort,” Elisabeth Kendall, head of Cambridge University’s Girton College told Peter Bergen. The Houthis “think of it as a way of life.”
“The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets,” Kendall said.
CNN Opinion senior editor Sheena McKenzie interviewed Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital, and asked him about the future for Palestinian children amid the war in Gaza.
“There is no future for them,” he said. “How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?”
“The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.” (Hear more from Sheena McKenzie on the Tug of War podcast.)
There is a lot of talk but very little real debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict on US college campuses, wrote Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University.
“Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who ‘Stand with Israel’ and those seeking ‘Justice for Palestine.’… Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.”
“The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.”
“It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority.”

When Holly Thomas was 12, she “received a large — unsolicited — Estee Lauder makeup sampler for Christmas. The box felt like a totem of my impending maturity, recognition that I would soon be allowed access to an as-yet out-of-reach club. I gave it pride of place on my bedroom table (swiftly rebranded as a “dresser” with the help of a soon-to-be filthy sarong), and before too long I was regularly being sent out of class, cheeks burning, to wash my contraband mascara off.”
“It wasn’t a particularly edifying phase, but neither was it very consequential. Today however, skin care is a far more serious business. Gone are the days of teens aimlessly browsing random drugstores by day and smudging their pillows with iridescent bronzer by night. Now, kids don’t just know how to cleanse properly, they’ve taken to beauty products with unprecedented zeal. Absurd though it sounds, that fervor is acutely ominous,” Thomas wrote.
“Dermatologists report children as young as nine, many of whom already maintain elaborate at-home skin care regimes coming to their offices for cosmetic consultations. Teens who’ve barely exited puberty are obsessing over the alleged ‘preventative’ anti-aging properties of Botox, and the internet is teeming with youngsters pleading for solutions to their ‘wrinkles.’ The fretting and groupthink involved bear all the hallmarks of a classic youthful infatuation. But this one comes with sinister undercurrents less familiar to the adults who went before them.”
“The most worrying thing about today’s skin care craze isn’t just that the financial and emotional buy-in are completely out of proportion to the “need” being addressed. They may set kids up for lasting damage. And thanks to the misinformation soup of social media, the gnarly, anxiety-provoking call is coming from inside the house.”"
TCYS66GBMK_B8UTAHFKJBQNJLK,CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire,"By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:50 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/new-hampshire-primary-poll-trump-haley-desantis/,"The race for the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary appears to be former President Donald Trump’s to lose, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire following Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa’s caucuses last week.
Trump holds 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stands at 39%. Both have gained supporters since the last CNN/UNH poll in early January – when Trump held 39% to Haley’s 32% – as the field of major contenders has shrunk. Both Trump and Haley now hold their highest level of support in UNH polling on the race since 2021. But Haley’s sharp gains since late last summer have not been enough to catch Trump, as the gap between them has once again widened to double digits.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president. He stood at just 6% in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
For Trump’s opponents, New Hampshire has long appeared to be the place in the early primary calendar that offered the best shot at knocking him off track in his bid for a third straight GOP presidential nomination. It was the only early state where polls consistently found Trump without majority support, and where voters often showed the most openness to his rivals. But this latest survey suggests that Trump’s popularity within the GOP base and the commitment of his supporters outweigh the appeal of his challengers.
New Hampshire’s traditional independent streak and more moderate pool of likely primary voters, when compared with other states whose nominating contests land ahead of Super Tuesday, are part of why some Trump rivals fixated on the state as the place to stand out. And Haley has won over those groups.
She holds 58% support among those who are registered as undeclared (New Hampshire’s term for independent voters) and plan to vote in the GOP primary, and 71% support among those who consider themselves ideologically moderate. She also stands ahead of Trump among voters who hold college degrees (50% Haley to 38% Trump). But each of these groups on its own makes up a minority of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire: 47% are registered undeclared, 33% are at least college graduates and just about 3 in 10 describe themselves as moderate.
Trump has largely consolidated his support among the larger flip sides of each of those groups. He has the backing of 67% of registered Republicans, 71% of conservatives and 55% of those who do not have a college degree. And among Trump’s supporters, 88% say they have definitely decided to support him compared with 74% of Haley supporters who are similarly locked in. That translates to 45% of the electorate being firmly decided Trump supporters, compared with just 30% who are equally decided Haley backers.
With just a few days to go before Tuesday’s primary, about 1 in 5 likely Republican primary voters overall say they have not yet locked in their choice. That group broadly backs Haley as of now: 51% support her, 28% supportTrump and 14% say they support DeSantis.
Broadly speaking, New Hampshire’s likely Republican primary voters expect Trump to win on Tuesday (70% say they think he will carry the day, though just 36% of Haley backers feel that way), and more say they would be satisfied were he to become the party’s presidential nominee than would feel that way about Haley or DeSantis (61% say they would be either enthusiastic or satisfied should Trump win the nomination, compared with 54% each saying the same about Haley or DeSantis).
And Trump continues to be viewed more favorably than either Haley or DeSantis within the primary electorate: 56% have a positive view of Trump, compared with 36% who feel that way about Haley and 28% about DeSantis. He is the only remaining candidate to have maintained a net positive favorability rating throughout the past year, while Haley ends the campaign for the Granite State in negative territory.
The state’s Republican primary electorate also has a broadly positive outlook on what Trump actually did as president. Looking back on his first term in office, 70% of likely Republican primary voters say that he did more to help the country than hurt it, while 28% say he did more to hurt and 2% that his time in office didn’t make much of a difference.
The survey asked whether Trump would attempt – and whether he would succeed at – six things he’s talked about doing during the campaign: building a wall along the US border with Mexico, appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” President Joe Biden and his family, dismantling the “deep state,” repealing Obamacare and replacing it with another health care law, bringing the war between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and reimposing a travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries.
Majorities in the GOP electorate say that if he wins, Trump would likely succeed in accomplishing four out of those six: building the wall (71% say he would definitely or probably succeed in doing so), ending the war between Ukraine and Russia (59%), reimposing the travel ban (56%) and appointing a prosecutor to go after the Biden family (53%). Far fewer see Trump as likely to succeed at dismantling the deep state (39%) or repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (34%).
Most New Hampshire residents agree with likely Republican voters that should Trump win the presidency, he is at least probably going to accomplish reimposing the travel ban (58%), appointing a special prosecutor to go after the Biden family (56%) and building the wall (52%). But there are deep partisan divisions in views on his prospects for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia; 71% of Republicans feel he will at least probably succeed in that effort, compared with 33% of independents and 8% of Democrats; 79% of Democrats say that Trump is unlikely to even try to bring the war to an end. And few of any partisan stripe feel he’s likely to repeal and replace the ACA (26% overall).
There is also a notable partisan divide over the chances that Trump will try or succeed in appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family. Nearly all Democrats think he will at least try (90%) compared with about two-thirds of independents and Republicans (63% each). Democrats are also most apt to say it is at least probable that he will succeed (64% say so), with only about half of Republicans (51%) or independents (47%) saying the same.
About two-thirds of likely primary voters on the Democratic side say they plan to write in Biden (63%). Biden did not file to be a candidate on the state’s primary ballot because the primary is in violation of the Democratic National Committee’s rules for the nomination process, but supporters have mounted a write-in effort on his behalf. Nearly all likely Democratic primary voters are aware of that effort; 91% said they had heard that Biden would not be on the ballot before taking the survey. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips holds 10% support in the poll, matching his high mark in CNN/UNH polling on the race, and author Marianne Williamson has 9% support, with 11% saying they would support someone else.
Nearly all Biden backers, 92%, say they have definitely decided to support him, compared with just 28% of those who are supporting another candidate. Most in the Democratic primary electorate say they would be at least satisfied with Biden as their party’s nominee (70% say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied), but enthusiasm for Biden among Democratic primary voters (31%) is lower than enthusiasm for Trump on the GOP side (46%).
Still, just 46% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that Biden would give the party its best chance to win in 2024, while 39% say someone else would give Democrats a better chance, and 15% say they’re not sure. There is little agreement among those who say someone else would be better around who that might be. Phillips is most frequently mentioned at 28%, but a wide range of other names also emerge.
Most likely Democratic primary voters say that in Biden’s time as president he has done more to help the country than hurt it (71% help, 16% hurt, 11% hasn’t made much difference).
But neither Biden nor Trump is seen by most New Hampshirites as helping the country during their respective presidencies. Overall, 55% of New Hampshire adults say that Trump hurt the country as president, and 51% say that Biden has. There isn’t much overlap between the two groups. Only 8% total say that both men did more to hurt than help, just 1% that both of them did more to help, 41% say that Trump helped and Biden hurt, 35% that Trump hurt and Biden helped, and 10% that Trump hurt while Biden hasn’t made much difference.
The CNN New Hampshire poll was conducted online January 16-19 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Results among the full sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults drawn from a probability-based panel have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. Likely Republican and Democratic primary voters were identified through survey questions about their intention to vote. Results among 1,210 likely Republican primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Results among 838 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

He was attempting to open a door, a spokesperson for the New York Police Department said.
The man admitted he was there to see Swift when police arrived, the source said. CNN has reached out to representatives for Taylor Swift for comment.
Police learned he had an active warrant and took him into custody on Saturday, the NYPD spokesperson said. Police arrested him on two open warrants from 2017 for failure to appear, the law enforcement source said.
The man has not been charged with any crimes in relation to trying to enter Swift’s townhouse, according to the law enforcement source, and there is no evidence he was attempting to enter her specific unit.
The Manhattan district attorney’s office said they did not have a record of the arrest and could not confirm any other information.

“We believe this was a small gathering that turned deadly,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said at an early morning news conference.
Investigators aren’t sure whether the suspected shooter or shooters were already inside the house, or if someone came uninvited to the house and began opening fire, Gonzalez said. There is also evidence of shots being fired outside the house along the street, he added.

ULT2DUHMSO_IENS79RL7UMCOGM,What voters in New Hampshire have to say about Nikki Haley and Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday’s primary,"By Arit John and Jeff Zeleny, CNN","7 minute read Updated 4:52 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/nikki-haley-new-hampshire-voters/,"Danielle Brown voted for John McCain in the 2000 New Hampshire Republican primary and for Barack Obama in the Democratic primary eight years later. On Tuesday, she intends to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to send a clear message to both parties.
“We need to have some new ideas and a new, younger generation coming in,” Brown, an undeclared voter, said as she clutched a Haley 2024 yard sign freshly autographed by the candidate. “Haley is energized. I think she can do a lot for our country.”
Brown is a voter stuck in the middle, one of thousands of undeclared and independent residents who make up a plurality of the Granite State’s electorate and a critical part of Haley’s coalition. Her chances in New Hampshire – and by extension, the fate of her campaign – likely hinge on how many independents vote for her in the state’s primary Tuesday.
Related article CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire
As of Friday, 344,335 voters in New Hampshire were registered as undeclared, making up nearly 40% of the electorate.
Haley’s campaign is targeting Republicans and undeclared voters from the suburbs to the seacoast, advisers said, particularly in precincts where Trump underperformed other Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu. Though former President Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, he lost the state in the general election in both 2016 and 2020.
A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley is backed by a majority – 58% – of registered undeclared voters, but the former president has the support of 67% of registered Republicans.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon, was backed by just 6% of New Hampshire GOP voters in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would have needed to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
A win in New Hampshire could offer Haley’s campaign the momentum, and donor money, necessary to compete in South Carolina on February 24 and the Super Tuesday states voting on March 5.
A loss, however, might hasten the speed at which the Republican Party coalesces around Trump.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who ended his own presidential bid in November, became the latest former candidate to endorse Trump at a rally in Concord on Friday. Haley dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that Trump was lining up “Washington insiders” despite vowing to drain the swamp.
“But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do,” Haley said.
As Trump campaigns in New Hampshire, the former president is trying to keep Republicans in line – and out of reach for Haley.
“Nikki Haley in particular is counting on the Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Portsmouth on Wednesday.
His rallying cry is false. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and the deadline for registering as a Republican or undeclared voter was October. Undeclared voters have the option to choose either a Democratic or Republican primary ballot on Election Day.

Greg Moore, a senior adviser for AFP Action, the political network backed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that has thrown its resources behind Haley, said Friday that the group’s data shows the former governor’s base includes conservative voters. AFP Action, which endorsed Haley in November, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire, Moore said.
“I think some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump,” Moore said. “I know that’s not true.”
What the former president may not know is that Haley’s rallies and town hall meetings in New Hampshire last week were filled with voters like Susan Rice of Rochester, who twice voted for Trump.
Rice, who owns a yarn business in New Hampshire and Maine, was invited to the White House in 2018 during the Trump administration for an event to showcase small-business leaders. She said she believed it was time for the country to move on.
“I’m a staunch Republican and I have been my entire life,” Rice said. “I think it’s time to have a woman as a president. I like her foreign policies and I like the fact that she has a good understanding of our southern border and what she wants to do for that.”
She said she was exhausted by Trump and excited by Haley’s potential to rebuild the Republican Party.
“I don’t necessarily worry about the court cases,” Rice said. “But it’s the baggage, and honestly, sometimes what comes out of his mouth and – how do I put this diplomatically – the name-calling, the putting other people down.”
Michael Lewis, a Hollis resident, said he supported the way Trump approached the economy, the border and America’s relationship with NATO, but he couldn’t vote for a presidential candidate “whose age is past life expectancy.”
He also expressed doubts that Trump will still be eligible to run for president in the general election.
“I think the sequence is there’s campaigning, then there’s the [Republican National] Convention, then there’s going to be the conviction of Donald Trump,” Lewis said. “There’s going to have to be an alternative. I think she’s the answer.”
Still, while some former Trump voters are open, even eager, to vote for Haley, the former president’s base in New Hampshire remains strong.
“MAGA is not going to be with her,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday.
That was the sentiment at the Saddle Up Saloon in Kingston on Friday afternoon, where GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio rallied a few dozen Trump supporters. In interviews, attendees mentioned several criticisms Haley’s rivals have leveled against her foreign policy views and her conservatism.
Sylvia, a Nashua voter at the event who declined to give her last name, said she would sit out the general election if Trump made Haley his running mate.
“She’s a RINO, she’s a war monger,” she said, using the acronym for “Republican in name only.” “I’m not for her at all.”
Bill Jackson, an 86-year-old from Hampton who plans to vote for Trump, said he believed Haley has support only among elitists and echoed the former president’s comments about Democratic crossover votes.
“She’s pro-war. She’s also pro-immigration, illegal immigration,” he said. “I mean, she said we’ve got to treat these people as equals. No, we don’t, they’re illegally coming into this country.”
Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have tried to paint Haley as weak on border security. Haley has responded by saying securing the border would be a top priority of her administration. She has characterized herself as a conservative and said her advocacy for a strong US foreign policy is meant to prevent war.
On the trail, Haley has expanded on the pitch she started making on the night of the Iowa caucuses – that she is the best chance voters have of preventing both Trump and President Joe Biden from winning a second term. She has highlighted polls that show her beating Biden in a general election by a wider margin than the GOP front-runner, and argued that she would help Republicans down ballot win House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
A Marist poll released Friday found Haley running near-even with Biden, 47% to 44%, in a New Hampshire general election matchup, while Trump trailed Biden by 7 points.
Haley has also sought to draw comparisons between Trump and Biden, from their ages to the amount of government spending they approved in office, and said both presidents come with “baggage.”
Her revamped stump speech also pushes back more aggressively against the Trump campaign’s characterization of parts of her record, including her position that the retirement age needs to be raised for people in their 20s and 30s. In a recent ad, Trump’s campaign incorrectly claimed Haley wants to limit Social Security for current beneficiaries.
Haley noted that Trump supported raising the Social Security age to 70. Trump supported raising the Social Security age in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” but wavered on whether to cut entitlements since running for president in 2016, CNN’s KFile reported last year.
“If he’s going to lie about me, we’re going to tell the truth about him,” Haley said in Hollis on Thursday. “You’re going to see a lot of things said, but at the end of the day it’s the drama, and vengeance, and the vindictiveness that we want to get out of the way.”
The message resonated with Nancy Protzmann, an undeclared voter who attended the Hollis event and said she’s long been looking for a candidate to back against Trump. As she left the venue, she said she plans to request a Republican ballot and vote for Haley.
“I will do anything in my power to make sure that Trump does not become our next president,” Protzmann said. “But I liked what she said – and I don’t want Biden either.”
Asked whether her decision was intended to be more of an affirmative vote for Haley or a roadblock for Trump, she said ideally both.
“I hope it will be a launching pad for her, because I do think she would be a good president,” Protzmann said. “And I certainly hope it will help block him.”

UO66YFNB9H_LOLYJQ3PQQWVZYN,Opinion: Here’s why voters in New Hampshire will be writing in Biden’s name on the ballot,Opinion by Maggie Hassan,"5 minute read Updated 6:44 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/new-hampshire-primary-dnc-biden-hassan/,"Editor’s Note: US Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, is in her second term representing New Hampshire. She served as governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
As we approach New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary on Tuesday, America’s democracy is more challenged than at any point during my lifetime. The threat of a second term for Donald Trump means that our country’s fundamental values and electoral system itself are on the ballot in 2024.
Despite the attempt to change the primary calendar, Granite Staters on Tuesday will write in President Joe Biden precisely because of our passion for citizen-led democracy and our commitment to protecting the future of our country.
This year, President Biden’s name will not be on the primary ballot over a dispute with the Democratic National Committee, which voted to change the date of the New Hampshire primary. It decided to disqualify the state from receiving any delegates after determining that South Carolina should be the first primary — but that has not stopped Granite Staters from organizing a write-in campaign and continuing our engagement with the democratic process.
Since its inception, the New Hampshire presidential primary has helped strengthen our democracy and elect better presidents. The “all-hands-on-deck” spirit of our state means we participate in town meetings, volunteer for our community and elect a 424-member volunteer citizen legislature to serve a population of 1.4 million.
Our commitment to civic participation is in part why the people of New Hampshire helped create the modern primary — Granite Staters were among the first in the nation who decided that instead of selecting party delegates in the backrooms, all voters across the state should have a say. We helped wrestle nominating contests from the grips of party bosses, holding our first in the nation primary — where voters choose party delegates — for the first time in 1920. In 1952, voters started directly selecting their preferred presidential nominee.

The New Hampshire primary has always helped strengthen our democracy. In our polarized political moment — where social media, algorithms and some partisan politicians sow discord and drive more Americans to the extremes — it has become challenging for voters to sort truth from misinformation. In order to help bridge this divide, voters need the opportunity to engage with candidates face-to-face and in real time.
In other larger states, campaigns are won and lost by massive ad buys or flashy rallies where candidates may never come face to face with a question from a voter, but the small size of our state provides candidates the opportunity to do things differently. Our primary provides an ideal proving ground for candidates to have direct, person-to-person interactions with the people who they wish to serve.
In our state, candidates can travel in just an hour or two from our largest cities that grapple with challenges like homelessness to our rural communities where the lack of high-speed internet continues to hold back families and the economy.
Successful candidates in our primary have to be prepared to win one conversation at a time, talking to voters of all ages, backgrounds and — particularly in a state where independents are a plurality of voters — all political stripes. Because New Hampshire’s government requires an unusually high degree of citizen engagement, direct access to elected officials is routine for most Granite Staters and we are not easily swayed or impressed by slick advertising or large entourages.
Related article Opinion: Trump’s Iowa win shows the Republican nomination is no contest
In our state, candidates who expend shoe leather and spend time listening have a shot against those who start the contest well known or with big war chests, which is why it is critical that New Hampshire goes first. It is also important to note that New Hampshire is not the only early state; while our state continues to grow in its racial diversity, especially among young people, the group of early primary states has strong racial and geographic diversity.
New Hampshire’s person-to-person style of campaigning also forces candidates to answer direct questions from the voters. Just last month we were reminded how skilled Granite Staters are at holding candidates to account when Nikki Haley was pressed about what was the cause of the American Civil War and she refused to say that it was caused by slavery. She later backpedaled her comments and said “of course the Civil War was about slavery.” These direct questions that get to the heart of a candidate’s character are just one of the ways that our primary helps produce stronger nominees.
In this time of polarization, having a primary that places a premium on direct conversations between candidates and citizens is invaluable; it is not only how citizens can hold candidates to account, but it gives us a chance to see how democracy works at its best. It bridges divisions and helps us see the priorities and heartaches that we have in common. New Hampshire’s commitment to empowering citizens — and in treating those who would lead us as “citizens in chief” — has made our first in the nation primary indispensable and our democracy stronger.
Granite Staters’ commitment to democracy is why we will continue to hold our primary and why we organized a write-in campaign to support President Biden.

The dangers of another Trump presidency are clear. As just one example, at a rally last November in Claremont, Trump echoed fascist dictators by calling his political opponents “vermin,” and he has continued to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
President Biden, on the other hand, is committed to protecting our democracy and to working on behalf of the American people — regardless of political party — to deliver results. At a time when many believed that bipartisanship was impossible, President Biden has demonstrated that our democracy can work, passing bipartisan legislation to lower costs, invest in manufacturing here at home and rebuild our infrastructure.
There are those who suggest that — given the DNC’s wrongheaded decision to forego New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary — Granite Staters should stay home, or refuse to vote for President Biden. We’re not going to do that. I know that New Hampshire Democrats and many independents will join me in writing in President Biden’s name on Tuesday because we understand the importance of this election for our country. We have long known that staying on the sidelines is not an option and we will put our country first."
UOZ0H08XJL_YGA094WCCH3CKZO,‘Very dangerous’: Zelensky on Trump’s claim he could end Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours,"By Andrew Carey and Victoria Butenko, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:12 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/20/europe/zelensky-trump-end-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/,"For the first time, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed publicly unequivocal concern over Donald Trump’s suggestion he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day if he returns to the White House.
Speaking to Britain’s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner’s boast as “very dangerous” – on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.
Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump’s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a “political message.”
But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, “makes me really quite stressed.”
Trump’s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”
Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, “They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.”
Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.
At Davos earlier this week, responding to a similar question from a journalist, the Ukrainian leader answered rhetorically, wondering how Trump would respond if Putin rolled through Ukraine - in a scenario where Trump removed all US support - and began threatening NATO members with invasion.
It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.
By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.

Ukraine’s ability to negotiate toward that result has been significantly weakened, at least in the short term, by the failure of the summer counteroffensive.
Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: “Nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.”
Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.
Turning to address the camera, he said, “Please, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.”
“Maybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,” Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer."
UPL0SQ0J3F_XG9E6OG1MP3JG58,Moscow blames Ukraine for strikes that killed at least 28 in Russian-controlled Donetsk; Kyiv denies attack,"By Darya Tarasova, Teele Rebane, Radina Gigova, Victoria Butenko, Josh Pennington, Andrew Carey and Maria Kostenko, CNN","4 minute read Updated 7:35 AM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/europe/ukraine-strikes-russian-controlled-donetsk-intl/,"Shelling killed at least 28 people and injured 30, including two children, near a market in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, according to Russian officials. Moscow blamed Ukraine for the attack, while Kyiv denied responsibility.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a market and shops in the city’s Kirovsky district were targeted with multiple launch rocket systems, with the shelling reportedly coming from the direction of Avdiivka. Kyiv “once again committed a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia,” the Russian ministry said. “There are a large number of victims.”
CNN is unable to independently verify this claim.
Ukraine’s armed forces said they were not responsible for the shelling attacks. “The Russians are spreading [mis-]information about the strike on a market in Donetsk. We responsibly declare that the forces under the control of the Tavria military formation did not engage in combat operations in this case,” a statement on the Facebook page of the armed forces’ Tavria command said.
“Russia must be held accountable for the lives of the Ukrainians taken,” it added.
Russia has responded with outrage to previous Ukrainian attacks but has been responsible for thousands of civilians deaths following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched an investigation and “all those involved and responsible for this and other terrorist attacks on our soil will suffer inevitable punishment,” the ministry said.
Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said that the attack came on the busiest day of the week for the area and that search teams were looking for fragments of weapons.
At least 27 civilians were killed and at least 25 were injured in the area of a market and shops in the Kirovsky district of the city of Donetsk, Pushilin said in a Telegram post.
Another man was also killed on Sunday in another part of Donetsk city as a result of shelling, Pushilin said. Five additional people were wounded in the city and elsewhere in Russian-occupied parts of the region on Sunday, he said.
Residential buildings, a school and shops in different Russian-occupied parts of the region were also damaged, he said.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the deadly attacks on Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk region, a UN spokesperson said on Sunday.
“The Secretary-General strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately,” the statement continued.
Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow said in 2022 it would recognize as Russian territory – an annexation process which is illegal under international law.
The region, which is partially but not fully controlled by Russian forces, is on the frontline of fighting in the east.
The Donetsk attack comes with the frontlines of the war largely static.
Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed to deliver major gains and its troops are now under pressure from Russia at several points along the 1,000 kilometer-long frontline.
Kyiv’s troops have withdrawn from the village of Krokhmalne in the northeast of the country, close to the border between Kharkiv and Luhansk regions – with an army spokesman saying on Ukrainian TV that its troops’ position have been moved to “where it is more advantageous for them to destroy the enemy.”
In another indication of increasing Russian pressure, Ukraine’s military says it expects to see Russia’s forces step up operations around the embattled town of Avdiivka, as well as nearby Nevelske and Pervomaiske – which all lie to the immediate northwest of Donetsk city.
“The enemy is regrouping, and we are preparing for an increase in their activity,” a Ukrainian army spokesperson said.
In recent months, Avdiivka has become a focus of Russia’s fight, in much the same way that Bakhmut was in the first half of 2023. The Ukrainian army spokesman said Russia now had about 40,000 Russian personnel in the area.
In a separate development, a Ukrainian defense source told CNN that Ukraine carried out a drone attack on a Russian oil terminal about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Saint Petersburg, the latest example of Ukraine’s capacity to strike deep inside Russia.
A night-time video posted by Leningrad regional boss Alexander Drozdenko showed what appeared to be a significant fire at the Novatek facility in Ust-Luga, which sits on the Gulf of Finland. Later videos showed fire-fighters tackling the blaze. Authorities said there were no injuries.
According to Novatek’s website, the Ust-Luga complex sees the processing of liquified natural gas products into various types of fuel, including naptha, jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoil.
The Ukrainian defense source said the products are used to supply, among others, the Russian military, adding: “The successful attack on this facility will complicate the enemy’s logistics.” .
The attack comes three days after a Ukrainian intelligence source claimed another drone operation targeting the St. Petersburg region. “This is a new stage,” the source told CNN. “Our targets are military facilities and oil depots.”
Elsewhere, Ukraine also carried out drone strikes in the Tula, Smolensk and Belgorod regions.

V86ORPL2EO_DN6AN2XT7CTGYT8,Ayodhya’s Muslims confront grief and anxiety as Ram Temple inauguration nears,"By Aishwarya S Iyer, CNN","6 minute read Updated 10:57 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/20/asia/ayodhyas-muslims-anxiety-ram-temple-inauguration-intl-hnk/,"Saffron flags are flying in the majority Hindu town of Ayodhya as excited locals prepare to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration of a new multimillion-dollar temple.
But like many of the town’s 500,000 Muslims, 65-year-old Maulana Badshah Khan says he’ll be staying at home.
He fears a repeat of the religious violence that erupted more than 30 years ago, when Hindu nationalists destroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, triggering riots across the country.
On Monday, Modi will officially open the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a lavish temple built on the same site that analysts say is a monument to Hindu nationalist ambition.
Khan says he believes the celebration is a clear sign of how Muslims are becoming marginalized under the leadership of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
“The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” said Khan.
“The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.”
More than 7,000 people have been invited to Ayodhya to attend the ceremony in person, including high-profile politicians who are flying in from across the vast country to take part. And tens of thousands of pious Hindus are thronging to the small town to place flowers and gifts inside the temple.
Amid these increasing crowds, there is apprehension among Ayodhya’s Muslims.
Azam Qadri, the 39-year-old head of a local religious body, said that those who lived through the 1992 violence fear the arrival of outsiders.
“Every time people come from outside there is trouble. One cannot afford to lose their precious belongings, savings, or identity papers anymore. It is not easy to restart your life again,” he said.
Haji Mahboob, who lost two relatives during the 1992 violence, said local Muslims are worried the emboldened crowds will chant provocative slogans against them.
“They will call for Muslims to be expelled from Ayodhya or demand a Hindu Rashtra (nation),” he said.
Mahboob said there is now a sense of hopelessness among his community.
Many Muslims believed that in 2019, when the Supreme Court granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, the controversy might come to an end, he said. But instead, emboldened Hindus began targeting even more mosques across the country, campaigning to tear those down too.
“The Hindus cannot stand us, they cannot see us, what can we do?” he said.
Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus.
Many states have passed legislation that critics say is rooted in Hindutva and discriminatory toward Muslims, including laws that make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry and banning the slaughter and transport of cows – an animal considered sacred to Hindus.
And one of Modi’s key promises to his voters was to build the Ram Temple on the desecrated mosque’s site, and he’s hoping its construction will firm his chances for a rare third election win this year.

Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of “The Demolition and the Verdict,” a book about the 1992 mosque demolition, said Modi’s decision to preside over Monday’s festivities is a sign of Hindu hegemony in India.
Modi’s involvement in the ceremony is indicative of how the line between the state and religion is becoming increasingly blurred, he said.
Mukhopadhyay added the sentiment among Muslims is not one of celebration. He has heard that Muslims are advising each other not to travel by train, not to drive cars alone and not to wear clothing that identifies them as Muslim.
“There is going to be immense sadness and there is also going to be tremendous fear (among India’s Muslims),” he said.
Speaking to CNN, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said Muslims are not being marginalized in India, and that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir is a “cause for celebration.”
“In terms of Prime Minister Modi’s government’s work, initiatives, and developmental agenda, not one scheme, program, or anything, distinguishes between Indian citizens on the basis of religion, caste, region,” he said.
In the years following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that worried Indian liberals, who feared more outbursts of sectarian violence.
That 2019 judgement that paved the way for the building of the Ram Mandir also allocated land for the town’s Muslims to build another mosque, some 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the Ram Mandir in a village called Dhannipur.
Mahboob, one of the petitioners who fought for the Babri mosque in the Supreme Court, said for most Muslims of Ayodhya, its construction does not hold emotional sway.
“If they built the mosque close to where Babri stood, we could have tried to convince ourselves that injustice was not happening to us. However, this land is so far away, and over that the construction has not even begun. So what do we say?”
Late last year, Arafat Shaikh – a member of the BJP – was appointed to lead the construction of the mosque. He told CNN that he had never stepped foot in Ayodhya before he took on the role.
He said the delays were due to disagreements about the design of the building but believes the new mosque will be unique as it will be the first in India with five minarets.
Amongst other ambitious plans, Shaikh says he wants additional land for educational institutions, a vegetarian kitchen, and a 21-foot-long Quran which will be painted saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism but one that has become increasingly politicized and appropriated by the Hindu-right.
Shaikh said the color was chosen because Gharib Nawaz, a famous Sufi saint, also revered saffron.
“It will bring the two communities closer,” he said.
Right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations say the temple’s opening is a symbol of a new Hindu nation.
“The Mughals tried to change us, then the English tried to change us, but the inauguration of the Ram Temple shows the world that our Hindu traditions, practices, and beliefs are still intact. New India will see a resurrection of the Hindu civilization,” said Vinod Bansal, spokesperson of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad group.
Mahant Jairam Das, the local head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the parent organization of the BJP, said he does not believe the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, instead claiming calls to build the structure were a “call for war.”
“Go to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, or a Muslim-dominated country. Why build a mosque like this in India?” he said.
For Hassan Ali, who was just nine when he spent two nights in a local police station trying to escape the 1992 violence, the sectarian fault lines are clearly visible.
“In 1992 there were many stories of local Hindus and Muslims helping each other. However now, there is a lot more poison that has been fed to people,” he said. “So one cannot tell anymore. One cannot tell what people have in their hearts.”"
VJYSMK84F1_73MS6UQL0L1MK2E,Opinion: Here’s why voters in New Hampshire will be writing in Biden’s name on the ballot,Opinion by Maggie Hassan,"5 minute read Updated 6:44 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/21/opinions/new-hampshire-primary-dnc-biden-hassan/,"Editor’s Note: US Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, is in her second term representing New Hampshire. She served as governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
As we approach New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary on Tuesday, America’s democracy is more challenged than at any point during my lifetime. The threat of a second term for Donald Trump means that our country’s fundamental values and electoral system itself are on the ballot in 2024.
Despite the attempt to change the primary calendar, Granite Staters on Tuesday will write in President Joe Biden precisely because of our passion for citizen-led democracy and our commitment to protecting the future of our country.
This year, President Biden’s name will not be on the primary ballot over a dispute with the Democratic National Committee, which voted to change the date of the New Hampshire primary. It decided to disqualify the state from receiving any delegates after determining that South Carolina should be the first primary — but that has not stopped Granite Staters from organizing a write-in campaign and continuing our engagement with the democratic process.
Since its inception, the New Hampshire presidential primary has helped strengthen our democracy and elect better presidents. The “all-hands-on-deck” spirit of our state means we participate in town meetings, volunteer for our community and elect a 424-member volunteer citizen legislature to serve a population of 1.4 million.
Our commitment to civic participation is in part why the people of New Hampshire helped create the modern primary — Granite Staters were among the first in the nation who decided that instead of selecting party delegates in the backrooms, all voters across the state should have a say. We helped wrestle nominating contests from the grips of party bosses, holding our first in the nation primary — where voters choose party delegates — for the first time in 1920. In 1952, voters started directly selecting their preferred presidential nominee.

The New Hampshire primary has always helped strengthen our democracy. In our polarized political moment — where social media, algorithms and some partisan politicians sow discord and drive more Americans to the extremes — it has become challenging for voters to sort truth from misinformation. In order to help bridge this divide, voters need the opportunity to engage with candidates face-to-face and in real time.
In other larger states, campaigns are won and lost by massive ad buys or flashy rallies where candidates may never come face to face with a question from a voter, but the small size of our state provides candidates the opportunity to do things differently. Our primary provides an ideal proving ground for candidates to have direct, person-to-person interactions with the people who they wish to serve.
In our state, candidates can travel in just an hour or two from our largest cities that grapple with challenges like homelessness to our rural communities where the lack of high-speed internet continues to hold back families and the economy.
Successful candidates in our primary have to be prepared to win one conversation at a time, talking to voters of all ages, backgrounds and — particularly in a state where independents are a plurality of voters — all political stripes. Because New Hampshire’s government requires an unusually high degree of citizen engagement, direct access to elected officials is routine for most Granite Staters and we are not easily swayed or impressed by slick advertising or large entourages.
Related article Opinion: Trump’s Iowa win shows the Republican nomination is no contest
In our state, candidates who expend shoe leather and spend time listening have a shot against those who start the contest well known or with big war chests, which is why it is critical that New Hampshire goes first. It is also important to note that New Hampshire is not the only early state; while our state continues to grow in its racial diversity, especially among young people, the group of early primary states has strong racial and geographic diversity.
New Hampshire’s person-to-person style of campaigning also forces candidates to answer direct questions from the voters. Just last month we were reminded how skilled Granite Staters are at holding candidates to account when Nikki Haley was pressed about what was the cause of the American Civil War and she refused to say that it was caused by slavery. She later backpedaled her comments and said “of course the Civil War was about slavery.” These direct questions that get to the heart of a candidate’s character are just one of the ways that our primary helps produce stronger nominees.
In this time of polarization, having a primary that places a premium on direct conversations between candidates and citizens is invaluable; it is not only how citizens can hold candidates to account, but it gives us a chance to see how democracy works at its best. It bridges divisions and helps us see the priorities and heartaches that we have in common. New Hampshire’s commitment to empowering citizens — and in treating those who would lead us as “citizens in chief” — has made our first in the nation primary indispensable and our democracy stronger.
Granite Staters’ commitment to democracy is why we will continue to hold our primary and why we organized a write-in campaign to support President Biden.

The dangers of another Trump presidency are clear. As just one example, at a rally last November in Claremont, Trump echoed fascist dictators by calling his political opponents “vermin,” and he has continued to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
President Biden, on the other hand, is committed to protecting our democracy and to working on behalf of the American people — regardless of political party — to deliver results. At a time when many believed that bipartisanship was impossible, President Biden has demonstrated that our democracy can work, passing bipartisan legislation to lower costs, invest in manufacturing here at home and rebuild our infrastructure.
There are those who suggest that — given the DNC’s wrongheaded decision to forego New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary — Granite Staters should stay home, or refuse to vote for President Biden. We’re not going to do that. I know that New Hampshire Democrats and many independents will join me in writing in President Biden’s name on Tuesday because we understand the importance of this election for our country. We have long known that staying on the sidelines is not an option and we will put our country first."
W0EXYHOVIB_CXX4PALD596SUNQ,Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution,"By Sandee LaMotte, CNN","9 minute read Updated 11:55 AM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/health/antibiotic-resistant-germs-phages-wellness/,"Cynthia Horton’s earaches are the stuff of nightmares.
“I can wake up from my sleep in horrible pain, like I’m having a root canal with no anesthesia,” she said. “When I sit up, my ear is often weeping with infection, even oozing blood.”
Already weakened by a lifelong battle with lupus, Horton’s immune system was devastated by rounds of radiation and chemotherapy after a 2003 surgery for a cancerous tumor in her ear.
Ear infections became the norm, usually eased by a round of antibiotics. But as the years passed, the bacteria in 61-year old Horton’s ear became resistant to antibiotics, often leaving her with little to no relief.
“These multi-drug-resistant superbugs can cause chronic infections in individuals for months to years to sometimes decades. It’s ridiculous just how virulent some of these bacteria get over time,” said Dwayne Roach, assistant professor of bacteriophages, infectious disease and immunology at San Diego State University.
Last year doctors offered to treat Horton’s infection with one of nature’s oldest predators — tiny tripod-looking viruses called phages designed to find, attack and gobble up bacteria.
The microscopic creatures have saved the lives of patients dying from superbug infections and are being used in clinical trials as a potential solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. In the United States alone, more than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year.
Such infections are a “urgent global public health threat,” killing 5 million people worldwide, according to 2019 statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” said infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee, codirector of the first dedicated phage therapy center in North America, the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, at UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Eager for a different solution to her recurrent ear infections, Horton was game. Samples of her drug-resistant bacteria were shipped from her doctor’s office in Pennsylvania to UC San Diego’s IPATH with the hopes that phage hunters there could find a match. What scientists discovered next, however, was unexpected.
The bacteria cultured from Horton’s ear were a perfect match to a rare superbug found in certain brands of over-the-counter eye drops that were robbing people of their vision and lives.
Suddenly, the search for a solution to Horton’s problem took on new meaning. Would the bacteria from her ear help scientists find phages that would treat the eye infections as well?
Severe cases of antibiotic-resistant eye infections began popping up in May 2022. By the following January, the CDC said at least 50 patients in 11 states had developed superbug infections after using preservative‐free artificial tears. By May 2023, the outbreak had spread to 18 states: Four people died, another four lost eyes, 14 suffered vision loss, and dozens more developed infections in other parts of the body.

“Only a fraction of patients actually had eye infections, which made the outbreak incredibly difficult to solve,” said epidemiologist Dr. Maroya Walters, who led the CDC’s artificial tears investigation.
“We saw people who were colonized by the organism develop urinary tract or respiratory tract infections months down the road, even though they were no longer using these drops,” Walters said. “One patient spread the infection to others in the health care facility.”
The culprit was a rare strain of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never been identified in the United States before the outbreak, the CDC said.
Horton had never used eye drops, yet the bacteria cultured from her ear were the same rare strain. Using those bacteria and other samples sent by the CDC, scientists at IPATH immediately went to work and identified more than a dozen phages that successfully attacked the deadly pathogen.
Scientists at the CDC were intrigued by the discovery, so much so that they mentioned the availability of the phage treatment for the superbug on the CDC website.
“It brought up this idea of when we have an outbreak that’s caused by bacteria with such limited treatment options, should we be thinking about these alternative therapies?” Walters said.
What is this little creature that can topple bacteria capable of withstanding all the drugs that modern science can muster? And more importantly, could phage treatment become a major player in the battle to end the superbug crisis?
Thanks to evolution, the gazillions of bacteria in the world today have a natural enemy: tiny viruses called bacteriophages genetically programmed for search-and-destroy missions. In this microscopic game of “The Terminator,” each set of phages is uniquely designed to find, attack and devour a specific type of pathogen.
“Each bacterial species, or even genotypes within it, can have a whole repertoire of phages that are attacking it, using a wide variety of methods to enter and debilitate the bacterial cell,” said Paul Turner, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University and microbiology faculty member at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
To counter the attack, bacteria employ various evasive maneuvers, such as shedding their outer skins to eliminate docking ports the phage use to enter, ravage and ultimately explode the pathogen into bits of bacterial goo.
That’s good news because the newly naked bacteria may lose their resistance to antibiotics, becoming once again vulnerable to elimination. The phage, however, is taken out of action, no longer able to fight.
To maximize success, specialists search for a variety of phages to tackle a particularly nasty superbug — at times creating a cocktail of microscopic warriors that can hopefully continue the attack when one is neutralized.
That’s what happened in 2016 to Strathdee’s husband, Tom Patterson, a retired professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego. Due to an infection with “Iraqibacter,” a drug-resistant bacterium found in the sands of Iraq, Patterson was in multi-organ failure and perilously close to death. In a race against time, Strathdee overcame incredible obstacles to find and deliver several cocktails of purified phages to Patterson’s doctors.
One of those cocktails contained a phage that “scared the bacteria so much that it dropped its outer capsule,” said Strathdee, an associate dean of global health sciences at UC San Diego and coauthor of “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug.”
“It was more afraid of the phage, if you will, than the antibiotic, and that allowed the antibiotic to work again. It was the one-two punch Tom needed,” Strathdee said. “Three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”
In labs around the country, phage scientists are taking research and discovery to the next level, or what Strathdee calls “phage 3.0.” Scientists in Turner’s Yale laboratory are busy mapping which phages and antibiotics are most symbiotic in the fight against a pathogen. Roach’s San Diego State lab is investigating the body’s immune response to phages while developing new phage purification techniques to prepare samples for intravenous use in patients.
Currently, clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of phages against intractable urinary tract infections, chronic constipation, joint infections, diabetic foot ulcers, tonsillitis and the persistent, reoccurring infections that occur in patients with cystic fibrosis. The chronic infections common in cystic fibrosis are typically due to various strains of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa — the same pathogen responsible for Horton’s ear infection and the artificial tears outbreak.
A number of labs are developing libraries of phages, stockpiled with strains found in nature that are known to be effective against a particular pathogen. In Texas, a new facility is taking that a step further — speeding up evolution by creating phages in the lab.
“Rather than just sourcing new phages from the environment, we have a bioreactor that in real time creates billions upon billions of phages,” said Anthony Maresso, associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
“Most of those phages won’t be active against the drug-resistant bacteria, but at some point there will be a rare variant that has been trained, so to speak, to attack the resistant bacteria, and we’ll add that to our arsenal,” Maresso said. “It’s a next-generation approach on phage libraries.”
Maresso’s lab published a study last year on the treatment of 12 patients with phages customized to each patient’s unique bacterial profile. It was a qualified success: The antibiotic-resistant bacteria in five patients were eradicated, while several more patients showed improvements.
“There’s a lot of approaches right now that are happening in parallel,” Roach said. “Do we engineer phages? Do we make a phage cocktail, and then how big is the cocktail? Is it two phages or 12 phages? Should phages be inhaled, applied topically or injected intravenously? There’s a lot of work underway on exactly how to best do this.”
To date, genetic manipulation of phages has been difficult due the streamlined nature of the creature: “Normal phages are optimized by evolution to be lean, mean, killing machines. There’s very little room in there for us to get in and change things,” said Elizabeth Villa, a professor of molecular biology at UC San Diego who studies a new form of phage called “jumbo” phages.
“Jumbo phages have very large genomes and come close to having a nucleus that encapsulates the genetic material, which protects them from some of the mechanisms bacteria use against phages to deactivate them,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who is codirector of IPATH.
“That also gives them room to be engineered to become more potent, so they’re very promising phages to be used therapeutically,” Schooley said.
Genetically engineering phages would allow scientists to target each person’s unique mix of antibiotic-resistant pathogens instead of searching sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria to find just the right phage for the job.
Along with phage libraries, genetic engineering is also a key to churning out phages in mass, to distribute on a wider scale. In Russia and the country of Georgia, where phage therapy has been used for decades, patients can buy phage cocktails off the shelf in pharmacies.
All this work has caught the attention of the CDC. In addition to using a phage cocktail to treat a superbug outbreak in real time, phages could also help fight a broader issue — the recolonization of the infected person with the same superbug, the CDC’s Walters said.
“The issue is that when patients have infections with these drug-resistant bacteria, they can still carry that organism in or on their bodies even after treatment,” Walters said. “They don’t show any signs or symptoms of illness, but they can get infections again, and they can also transmit the bacteria to other people.”
However, if phages could be used to “decolonize” a bacterial population inside a high-risk person, “patients could really decrease the likelihood of developing an infection and spreading to others, which is a big part of the problem,” Walters said.
“We were thinking about trying to develop a curated phage collection that would be active against a large number of certain resistant organisms,” she added. “Pseudomonas is a good place to start — there are more than 140 different species. But there are many other organisms that threaten us that we also need to tackle.”"

“At this time, we have no other definitive answers until further testing can be completed,” said the sheriff’s office in the Thursday news release. “These types of tests take a significant amount of time, and again, we ask for patience from the public as this investigation continues.”
“A thorough and detailed investigation is the top priority of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office,” the release went on. “Our hope is to positively identify the victim while remaining respectful of the victim and the victim’s family.”
The sheriff’s office did not indicate if a cause of death or the sex of the victim had been identified.
In the first news release, they reported “investigators believe this is an isolated incident, and there is no ongoing threat to the community.”
The remains were found at a home in Grand Junction, Colorado, about 200 miles west of Denver. The sheriff’s office confirmed to CNN in an email that the remains were found in a freezer in the home.
Sam Troester, who lives across the street from the home, told CNN affiliate KUSA workers in white hazmat suits first drew her attention to the investigation unfolding in her neighborhood.

The newspapers were returned to the publisher hours after being stolen from nearly all the racks across town, the newspaper notes.
The incident took place after the weekly edition of the Ouray County Plaindealer was published this week. The paper featured a front-page story about the arrest of three individuals in connection to an alleged May 2023 sexual assault at the home of Ouray Police Chief Jeff Wood.
CNN has reached out to Chief Wood and the Ouray Police Department for comment.
On Thursday morning, more than 200 copies of that newspaper were missing from vending racks around the town, according to the Plaindealer.
“I’m sorry that most of you locals who like to get your papers from the racks were not able to put your quarters in and receive your weekly news today,” co-publisher Erin McIntyre said in a statement to readers Thursday afternoon.
“It’s pretty clear that someone didn’t want the community to read the news this week,” McIntyre added in the statement.
The newspaper said they worked to get another round of the newspaper printed and redistributed around town.
By Thursday evening, the newspaper announced an individual confessed to taking the papers and returned them all in garbage bags to the newspaper’s office.
The suspect is “not a member or relative of local law enforcement and not associated with the defendants in the recent reported sexual assault,”  according to the Ouray County Sheriff’s Office.
The newspaper reported Saturday the suspect was cited on suspicion of petty theft.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the sexual assault case.
According to a statement from the city of Ouray, “no personnel investigations are being conducted in the Ouray Police Department regarding this (sexual assault) case.”
“Thank you for the outpouring of support we have received to help pay us to reprint the paper, and to those who also support our message that you can’t kill the public’s right to know by stealing a few hundred newspapers,” publishers of the Plaindealer said in a Friday update.
The Plaindealer announced it received more than $2,000 in donations since the theft was announced.

WVTMQ43EDM_CTNCJYZ5FV8JM4P,CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire,"By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:50 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/new-hampshire-primary-poll-trump-haley-desantis/,"The race for the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary appears to be former President Donald Trump’s to lose, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire following Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa’s caucuses last week.
Trump holds 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stands at 39%. Both have gained supporters since the last CNN/UNH poll in early January – when Trump held 39% to Haley’s 32% – as the field of major contenders has shrunk. Both Trump and Haley now hold their highest level of support in UNH polling on the race since 2021. But Haley’s sharp gains since late last summer have not been enough to catch Trump, as the gap between them has once again widened to double digits.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president. He stood at just 6% in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
For Trump’s opponents, New Hampshire has long appeared to be the place in the early primary calendar that offered the best shot at knocking him off track in his bid for a third straight GOP presidential nomination. It was the only early state where polls consistently found Trump without majority support, and where voters often showed the most openness to his rivals. But this latest survey suggests that Trump’s popularity within the GOP base and the commitment of his supporters outweigh the appeal of his challengers.
New Hampshire’s traditional independent streak and more moderate pool of likely primary voters, when compared with other states whose nominating contests land ahead of Super Tuesday, are part of why some Trump rivals fixated on the state as the place to stand out. And Haley has won over those groups.
She holds 58% support among those who are registered as undeclared (New Hampshire’s term for independent voters) and plan to vote in the GOP primary, and 71% support among those who consider themselves ideologically moderate. She also stands ahead of Trump among voters who hold college degrees (50% Haley to 38% Trump). But each of these groups on its own makes up a minority of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire: 47% are registered undeclared, 33% are at least college graduates and just about 3 in 10 describe themselves as moderate.
Trump has largely consolidated his support among the larger flip sides of each of those groups. He has the backing of 67% of registered Republicans, 71% of conservatives and 55% of those who do not have a college degree. And among Trump’s supporters, 88% say they have definitely decided to support him compared with 74% of Haley supporters who are similarly locked in. That translates to 45% of the electorate being firmly decided Trump supporters, compared with just 30% who are equally decided Haley backers.
With just a few days to go before Tuesday’s primary, about 1 in 5 likely Republican primary voters overall say they have not yet locked in their choice. That group broadly backs Haley as of now: 51% support her, 28% supportTrump and 14% say they support DeSantis.
Broadly speaking, New Hampshire’s likely Republican primary voters expect Trump to win on Tuesday (70% say they think he will carry the day, though just 36% of Haley backers feel that way), and more say they would be satisfied were he to become the party’s presidential nominee than would feel that way about Haley or DeSantis (61% say they would be either enthusiastic or satisfied should Trump win the nomination, compared with 54% each saying the same about Haley or DeSantis).
And Trump continues to be viewed more favorably than either Haley or DeSantis within the primary electorate: 56% have a positive view of Trump, compared with 36% who feel that way about Haley and 28% about DeSantis. He is the only remaining candidate to have maintained a net positive favorability rating throughout the past year, while Haley ends the campaign for the Granite State in negative territory.
The state’s Republican primary electorate also has a broadly positive outlook on what Trump actually did as president. Looking back on his first term in office, 70% of likely Republican primary voters say that he did more to help the country than hurt it, while 28% say he did more to hurt and 2% that his time in office didn’t make much of a difference.
The survey asked whether Trump would attempt – and whether he would succeed at – six things he’s talked about doing during the campaign: building a wall along the US border with Mexico, appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” President Joe Biden and his family, dismantling the “deep state,” repealing Obamacare and replacing it with another health care law, bringing the war between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and reimposing a travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries.
Majorities in the GOP electorate say that if he wins, Trump would likely succeed in accomplishing four out of those six: building the wall (71% say he would definitely or probably succeed in doing so), ending the war between Ukraine and Russia (59%), reimposing the travel ban (56%) and appointing a prosecutor to go after the Biden family (53%). Far fewer see Trump as likely to succeed at dismantling the deep state (39%) or repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (34%).
Most New Hampshire residents agree with likely Republican voters that should Trump win the presidency, he is at least probably going to accomplish reimposing the travel ban (58%), appointing a special prosecutor to go after the Biden family (56%) and building the wall (52%). But there are deep partisan divisions in views on his prospects for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia; 71% of Republicans feel he will at least probably succeed in that effort, compared with 33% of independents and 8% of Democrats; 79% of Democrats say that Trump is unlikely to even try to bring the war to an end. And few of any partisan stripe feel he’s likely to repeal and replace the ACA (26% overall).
There is also a notable partisan divide over the chances that Trump will try or succeed in appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family. Nearly all Democrats think he will at least try (90%) compared with about two-thirds of independents and Republicans (63% each). Democrats are also most apt to say it is at least probable that he will succeed (64% say so), with only about half of Republicans (51%) or independents (47%) saying the same.
About two-thirds of likely primary voters on the Democratic side say they plan to write in Biden (63%). Biden did not file to be a candidate on the state’s primary ballot because the primary is in violation of the Democratic National Committee’s rules for the nomination process, but supporters have mounted a write-in effort on his behalf. Nearly all likely Democratic primary voters are aware of that effort; 91% said they had heard that Biden would not be on the ballot before taking the survey. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips holds 10% support in the poll, matching his high mark in CNN/UNH polling on the race, and author Marianne Williamson has 9% support, with 11% saying they would support someone else.
Nearly all Biden backers, 92%, say they have definitely decided to support him, compared with just 28% of those who are supporting another candidate. Most in the Democratic primary electorate say they would be at least satisfied with Biden as their party’s nominee (70% say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied), but enthusiasm for Biden among Democratic primary voters (31%) is lower than enthusiasm for Trump on the GOP side (46%).
Still, just 46% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that Biden would give the party its best chance to win in 2024, while 39% say someone else would give Democrats a better chance, and 15% say they’re not sure. There is little agreement among those who say someone else would be better around who that might be. Phillips is most frequently mentioned at 28%, but a wide range of other names also emerge.
Most likely Democratic primary voters say that in Biden’s time as president he has done more to help the country than hurt it (71% help, 16% hurt, 11% hasn’t made much difference).
But neither Biden nor Trump is seen by most New Hampshirites as helping the country during their respective presidencies. Overall, 55% of New Hampshire adults say that Trump hurt the country as president, and 51% say that Biden has. There isn’t much overlap between the two groups. Only 8% total say that both men did more to hurt than help, just 1% that both of them did more to help, 41% say that Trump helped and Biden hurt, 35% that Trump hurt and Biden helped, and 10% that Trump hurt while Biden hasn’t made much difference.
The CNN New Hampshire poll was conducted online January 16-19 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Results among the full sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults drawn from a probability-based panel have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. Likely Republican and Democratic primary voters were identified through survey questions about their intention to vote. Results among 1,210 likely Republican primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Results among 838 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

XYYP643S2Y_66T52AD69P1SAEJ,Iran blames Israel for assassination of its military advisors in Damascus missile strike,"By Sarah El Sirgany, Adam Pourahmadi, Artemis Moshtaghian and Jonny Hallam, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:32 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/20/world/iran-israel-missile-damascus-military-intelligence-intl/,"At least five Iranian military advisors and a number of Syrian forces were killed in an Israeli missile strike on a building in Damascus on Saturday, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, in another sign of building hostilities in the Middle East as Israel’s war with Hamas enters its fourth month.
The alleged strike targeted the Mazzeh neighborhood in Syria’s capital, home to several diplomatic missions including the Iranian embassy, according to Syrian authorities.
Israel “launched an air attack from the Golan Heights at 10:20 a.m. local time that targeted a residential building in the Mazzeh neighborhood,” the Syrian Ministry of Defense alleged, adding that some missiles were shot down by national defense forces.
A number of buildings and nearby vehicles around the targeted building were damaged in the blast, Syria’s state broadcaster reported, with civil defense teams still searching for victims trapped under the rubble.
The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the incident, telling CNN, “We do not comment on foreign reports.”
One of the dead, Hojjatollah Omidvar, was described by Iran’s semi-official Student News Network as a deputy chief of the Quds Force intelligence unit in Syria – one of five branches of the Revolutionary Guards unit in charge of foreign operations.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) identified the four others killed as military advisors Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi. Their presence in Syria had been “at the official invitation of the Syrian government,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, noted in a statement on social media.
The attack in Damascus comes amid concerns that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza is spiraling into a regional war. In northern Iraq, an Iranian missile attack last week targeted what Tehran claimed to be a spy base for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. in Lebanon, militant group Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily confrontations with Israeli forces across the border. And from Yemen, Houthi rebels have launched a series of attacks on commercial ships and Western military vessels in the Red Sea.
Attacks by Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East won’t stop until Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza ends, Tehran’s top diplomat warned on Wednesday, echoing comments by several groups in Iran’s network of influence.
“If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.
Since Israel launched its ground and air campaign in Gaza, in response to Hamas’ bloody October 7 terror attacks, nearly 25,000 people have been killed in the blockaded Palestinian enclave – the majority of them women and children – according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.
The US, a key Israel ally, has also stepped in militarily, launching strikes in Yemen with the aim of degrading Houthi capabilities to harm the vital Red Sea shipping lane. In comments on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller emphasized that a larger conflagration could be avoided and highlighted a flurry of US diplomatic activity in the Middle East.
“We continue to engage in diplomatic efforts to try to make clear to everyone in the region that we don’t want to see the conflict escalated, that we don’t think it’s in any country’s interest to see the conflict escalated,” Miller said Wednesday.
But the path to de-escalation will be hard to find. Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday vowed to “punish” Israel for the Damascus missile strike. The killing was “another stain on the record of all governments who claim to be the advocates of human rights because it violated Syria’s airspace and trampled on human and international laws,” he said, in comments reported by Iranian state media.

YCKF46AXUG_QK7L8FS2QYDT0XJ,US personnel injured in attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq,"By Oren Liebermann, CNN","3 minute read Updated 12:09 PM EST, Mon January 22, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/20/politics/al-asad-air-base-iraq-us-personnel-injured/,"US personnel were injured in a ballistic missile attack on Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq on Saturday, two US officials said.
The attack was one of the largest-scale ballistic missile attacks to date that the US has seen carried out by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Monday. Two US service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries and have since returned to duty, she said.
US Central Command confirmed the attack Saturday evening.
Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets targeted the base and, while most were intercepted by the base’s air defenses, some made impact, the CENTCOM statement said.
The use of more powerful ballistic missiles, far rarer than rockets or one-way attack drones, comes at a time of growing tension in the region as the Israel-Hamas war passes 100 days.
US and coalition forces have faced increased threats from Iranian-backed Shia militias since the start of the war. As of Thursday, US and coalition forces had come under attack more than 143 times in Iraq and Syria since October 7; Saturday’s incident appears to be the second time ballistic missiles have been used to attack the US.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iranian-backed militia group, claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack.
In a statement, the group emphasized its commitment to resisting American “occupation forces” in the region and cited the attack as a response to what it referred to as the “Zionist entity’s massacres” against the Palestinian people in Gaza. The group did not provide any evidence for its claim.
In November, militants in Iraq fired close-range ballistic missiles at coalition forces, prompting the US to carry out airstrikes against facilities used by the Iranian-backed group Kataib Hezbollah, which has been responsible for many of the rocket and drone attacks against the coalition.
US forces in Iraq and Syria operate as part of the coalition to defeat ISIS. But the Iraqi government has called for international forces to ultimately leave the country after US strikes targeting Kataib Hezbollah facilities — which marked the first time the Biden administration had carried out strikes in Iraq since the war in Gaza began — caused tension with the Iraqi government.
“We believe that reorganizing the relationship through ending its presence will prevent more tensions and entanglement of internal and regional security issues,” Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told Reuters earlier this month.
The UN secretary-general’s special representative for Iraq has also warned that the region is at a “critical juncture” with the war in Gaza, saying in a statement that Iraq is at risk of being further drawn into the conflict.
“Despite the Government’s efforts to prevent the escalation of tensions, continued attacks — originating from within and outside of Iraq’s borders — stand to undo the hard-won stability of the country and the achievements it has made in recent years,” the statement said.
The Pentagon has maintained that the presence of its forces is still at the invitation of the Iraqi government and nothing has changed. National security adviser Jake Sullivan met with al-Sudani earlier this week in Davos, Switzerland, and the two discussed the “importance of sustaining a strong bilateral partnership,” the White House said in a readout.
The US, separately, is also facing threats in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have launched repeated attacks on international shipping lanes, including at least two strikes on US-owned vessels this week, leading some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the critical waterway.
The US has carried out a series of increasingly frequent strikes targeting Houthi assets and President Joe Biden said Thursday the strikes will continue, while conceding that the US strikes haven’t deterred the group’s attacks.

YVTZVBHR69_LMBZ07UXU1Z56DJ,CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire,"By Jennifer Agiesta, CNN","8 minute read Updated 4:50 PM EST, Sun January 21, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/21/politics/new-hampshire-primary-poll-trump-haley-desantis/,"The race for the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary appears to be former President Donald Trump’s to lose, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire following Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa’s caucuses last week.
Trump holds 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stands at 39%. Both have gained supporters since the last CNN/UNH poll in early January – when Trump held 39% to Haley’s 32% – as the field of major contenders has shrunk. Both Trump and Haley now hold their highest level of support in UNH polling on the race since 2021. But Haley’s sharp gains since late last summer have not been enough to catch Trump, as the gap between them has once again widened to double digits.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president. He stood at just 6% in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
For Trump’s opponents, New Hampshire has long appeared to be the place in the early primary calendar that offered the best shot at knocking him off track in his bid for a third straight GOP presidential nomination. It was the only early state where polls consistently found Trump without majority support, and where voters often showed the most openness to his rivals. But this latest survey suggests that Trump’s popularity within the GOP base and the commitment of his supporters outweigh the appeal of his challengers.
New Hampshire’s traditional independent streak and more moderate pool of likely primary voters, when compared with other states whose nominating contests land ahead of Super Tuesday, are part of why some Trump rivals fixated on the state as the place to stand out. And Haley has won over those groups.
She holds 58% support among those who are registered as undeclared (New Hampshire’s term for independent voters) and plan to vote in the GOP primary, and 71% support among those who consider themselves ideologically moderate. She also stands ahead of Trump among voters who hold college degrees (50% Haley to 38% Trump). But each of these groups on its own makes up a minority of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire: 47% are registered undeclared, 33% are at least college graduates and just about 3 in 10 describe themselves as moderate.
Trump has largely consolidated his support among the larger flip sides of each of those groups. He has the backing of 67% of registered Republicans, 71% of conservatives and 55% of those who do not have a college degree. And among Trump’s supporters, 88% say they have definitely decided to support him compared with 74% of Haley supporters who are similarly locked in. That translates to 45% of the electorate being firmly decided Trump supporters, compared with just 30% who are equally decided Haley backers.
With just a few days to go before Tuesday’s primary, about 1 in 5 likely Republican primary voters overall say they have not yet locked in their choice. That group broadly backs Haley as of now: 51% support her, 28% supportTrump and 14% say they support DeSantis.

Z6D87ODVLA_QXOBMHLO69E6EHB,‘Very dangerous’: Zelensky on Trump’s claim he could end Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours,"By Andrew Carey and Victoria Butenko, CNN","3 minute read Published 9:12 PM EST, Sat January 20, 2024",20240121,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/20/europe/zelensky-trump-end-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/,"For the first time, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed publicly unequivocal concern over Donald Trump’s suggestion he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day if he returns to the White House.
Speaking to Britain’s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner’s boast as “very dangerous” – on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.
Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump’s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a “political message.”
But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, “makes me really quite stressed.”
Trump’s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”
Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, “They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.”
Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.
At Davos earlier this week, responding to a similar question from a journalist, the Ukrainian leader answered rhetorically, wondering how Trump would respond if Putin rolled through Ukraine - in a scenario where Trump removed all US support - and began threatening NATO members with invasion.
It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.
By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.

Ukraine’s ability to negotiate toward that result has been significantly weakened, at least in the short term, by the failure of the summer counteroffensive.
Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: “Nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.”
Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.
Turning to address the camera, he said, “Please, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.”
“Maybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,” Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer."
