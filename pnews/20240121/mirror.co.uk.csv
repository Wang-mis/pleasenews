04QHR4H8GE_6FOZINSXMKMQSAN,Paddy McGuinness takes a break from bitter divorce proceedings as he enjoys luxury trip to Dubai,James BrinsfordSenior Showbiz Reporter,"15:06, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paddy-mcguinness-takes-break-bitter-31932132,"Paddy McGuinness has been taking time away from the upcoming divorce proceedings by sunning himself in Dubai ahead of the release of his mockumentary that will give a different view on his break-up from Christine McGuinness.
The comedian has been quiet on social media in recent weeks but has apologised to his followers for his ""radio silence"" during that time by sharing snaps of him soaking up the rays, with a beer in hand, a far cry from the winter snow back in the north east of England, where he lives.
Paddy was certainly making sure that he brought down the stress levels during his five days in Dubai, with him posting a photo of him relaxing in a swimming pool while another showed him stood with a friend, holding a can of beer, with the Dubai skyline rising up behind them.
Captioning the snaps, Paddy wrote on Instagram: ""Apologies for radio silence but I’m just back from enjoying 5 days of winter Sun in Dubai!!! Full report coming soon but it was gorgeous!"" It was met with plenty of messages of positivity from his fans, with one commenting: ""Oooh lovely place for winter sun""
The break comes after Paddy filmed a mockumentary which has left his estranged wife Christine ""devastated"" as she feels their divorce will be the butt of the jokes in the show. A friend told The Sun that she was ""completely broken over the divorce,"" and that Paddy had not let her know about his plans to write a comedic look at his life.
Comedian Josh Pugh, 34, plays a version of himself in the pilot, and said that an Airbnb had been used as Paddy's house for the filming. Speaking about comedy, Josh said: "" Paddy McGuinness is doing a spoof documentary of his life and in that documentary he is mentoring me as a stand-up. It’s about his divorce. It was a very strange couple of days.”
The divorce could get a little difficult with the couple both employing top lawyers to represent them as Christine looks for a multi-million pound settlement as well as keeping their £4 million family home, for her and their three children. She has instructed Catherine Bedford, who helped land a huge payout for Ant McPartlin's ex-wife Lisa Armstrong - securing her a reported £31 million from the ITV star presenter.

The stars, including winner Ellie Leach and EastEnders star Bobby Brazier were at the Malmaison Hotel in Birmingham, where bosses hired the entire mezzanine floor for a whopping £3,000.
All the celebrities that took part in the BBC dance show were treated to a dinner of steak and seabass before enjoying a free bar of cocktails and beer. And according to reports, the party was in full swing as they played songs from a playlist on a phone.
An onlooker told The Sun: ""They’d spent all evening dancing at the Arena but that didn’t stop them. The hotel bar had completely closed and all of the guests were in bed but they were still going at 3am."" And in true professional style, their late night did little to deter them from putting on a stellar performance the following day for the matinee show at 2.30pm and the evening show at 7pm.
One matinee audience member attested to the stars putting on a ""brilliant"" and ""professional"" performance. The cast included host Janette Manrara as well as judges Shirley Ballas, Craig Revel Horwood and Anton Du Beke. Among them were also Angela Rippon, along with her professional dance partner Kai Widdrington, Angela Scanlon with Carlos Gu, Annabel Croft with Graziano Di Prima, Krishnan Guru-Murthy with Jowita Przystal, and Layton Williams with Nikita Kuzmin.
Ellie, who was crowned winner last year along with her dance partner Vito Coppola, recently revealed that the delicate writing on her trophy had snapped off - but her dad came to her rescue and fixed it. She said: ""He took it into the shed, he brought it back, and now it is the centrepiece of the dining table.” She added: “I think after the tour, I will keep a pair of shoes as a little memory.”
Following the live shows, Ellie claimed to feel ""overwhelmed"" after the gruelling series. Taking to social media, she posted: ""I think that it is just a change, I don’t know what it is, obviously it is not something I am used to. Yesterday was an amazing experience and I am really, really excited to be doing the tour.”
During the series, Ellie and Vito became the subject of much speculation due to their close bond - with many claiming their chemistry was undeniable. But now, months on, the pair have confirmed the status of their close bond. Ahead of the Strictly Come Dancing Live tour, while speaking exclusively to The Mirror, Vito said: ""We have a great relationship and honestly when you just find people, not just me and Ellie but their family which I love. You just find these people that you think are going to stay in my life forever, in each others lives forever. And all the family and the dogs.""
Ellie added: ""And the dogs, yes Rufus!"" Vito continued: ""We are going no where, don't worry I am going to annoy you every single day, every week and every single year."" When asked by The Mirror if they mean as friends, Ellie replied: ""Yes,"" as Vito added: ""Yes as good friends."" The Mirror has contacted the BBC for a comment.

Kate, 42, was admitted to The London Clinic on Tuesday for planned abdominal surgery which was successful. The operation is expected to keep the royal off her feet from duties until at least Easter time. The exact procedure the future queen underwent is currently unknown.
The Princess will likely between two and three months recuperating, and is not expected to return to public duties until after Easter based on current medical advice. Prince William, 41, is also to pause official duties while his wife is in hospital and will combine being at Kate’s side with caring for their three children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte.
Aides for the pair have revealed their current mood has given rise to a new motto for the time being, according to the Sunday Times, of: “100 per cent family first, day job second.” The source added to the publication: “The kids are always at the centre of their universe. That will continue to be the case. They want to make sure they have as much normality as possible going forwards.""
The King, also set for a spell on the sidelines with a procedure on an enlarged prostate planned, is said to support his son’s commitment to his wife over royal duties - for the time being.
Kensington Palace’s statement this week when Kate went into hospital read: “Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic yesterday for planned abdominal surgery. The surgery was successful and it is expected she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery. Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.
“The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private.
“Kensington Palace will, therefore, only provide updates on Her Royal Highness’ progress when there is significant new information to share. The Princess of Wales wishes to apologise to all those concerned for the fact she has to postpone her upcoming engagements. She looks forward to reinstating as many as possible, as soon as possible.”"

They have gathered in Switzerland to consider Disease X, which is a hypothetical but unknown pathogen. The World Health Organization (WHO) said such a disease could result in 20 times more deaths than Covid-19 pandemic. It was described “as infectious as measles with the fatality rate of Ebola”.
Kate Bingham, a former chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, says Covid will be looked back on as a ""walk in the park"" because the condition is so serious.
She told the MailOnline: ""In a sense, we got lucky with Covid-19, even though it caused 20million or more deaths worldwide. The point is that the vast majority of people infected with the virus managed to recover.”
She added: ""Imagine Disease X is as infectious as measles with the fatality rate of Ebola [67 per cent]. Somewhere in the world, it’s replicating; sooner or later, somebody will start feeling sick. We need to take the first steps in dealing with the next pandemic right now - and that involves putting money on the table.”
WHO has compiled a list of viruses which could affect humans, known as the nine “priority pathogens”. They pose the ""greatest public health risk due to their epidemic potential"".
Ebola and Marburg were included in the priority diseases by the WHO. They are highly infectious viruses carried by bats which kill. A tick-borne virus Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is prominent in warmer climates, such as Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.
Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness which can cause internal bleeding and affect multiple organ system. Those who contract the bug have usually been exposed to food or items covered in rat urine or faeces. It is from the same family as Ebola, albeit not as deadly, but has become endemic in a number of West African countries.
Another condition on the watch list is Lassa Fever. Most people with illness make a full recovery, but some people can get severely ill. Fever physical fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, abdominal pains or sore throat are among the symptoms.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory caused by the coronavirus, which also caused Covid-19. It affects the airways in the lungs and ailments can include a headache, body aches, mild respiratory symptoms, possible diarrhoea, an eventual dry cough, and pneumonia.
It's passed on through respiratory droplets produced when a person with the virus coughs or sneezes, or by contact with objects or surfaces containing the virus. SARS showed an infection can quickly spread in its first reported outbreak in Asia in February 2003. A global outbreak in 2003 was contained, but a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick and 774 people died.
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), is passed to to humans via camels, which earned it the name camel flu. Cases are more common in the Arabic world, but they have emerged elsewhere including one case in the UK in 2018.
MERS was first found by scientists in Saudi Arabia in 2012, sparking more than 2,605 infections and 936 deaths. And the condition we are most familiar with is Covid-19, which was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The worldwide disease became a pandemic, which led to at least seven million deaths.
Nipah, which spreads from fruit bats or livestock has been tipped as the next pandemic. It swells the brain and has a fatality rate up to 75% Another concerning condition is Rift Valley fever (RVF) which affects domestic animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats.
Zika virus, meanwhile, is spread by mosquitoes in South and Central America, the Caribbean, the Pacific islands, Africa and Asia. Those with the virus infection, however, do not develop symptoms."

But over the Channel, consumption of frogs’ legs – usually sautéed with garlic and lemon juice or fried in breadcrumbs – peaks during the festive season.
Around 100 million frogs are killed each year just to supply the French market, the largest consumer. But millions more are killed for eating in Belgium and the Netherlands, where the dish is also popular. At least 25 million also ended up on dinner plates in the UK between 2000-2019, according to the most recent data.
Native frogs in the European Union are protected against capture and killing. But imports of wild caught frogs are still allowed. The NGOs Robin de Bois and Pro Wildlife have launched a campaign to get consumers to think twice before they buy frog legs, pointing to possible species extinction, animal cruelty and the unsanitary conditions in which they are transported.
They warn that while many might believe the frogs on their plate come from nearby ponds and swamps, instead, the vast majority are caught in the wild in Indonesia, Turkey and Vietnam.
The frogs are then amputated while alive with scissors, axes or knives – a horrific sight I recently witnessed in a Hanoi wet market.
Biologist Sandra Altherr from Pro Wildlife said: “Our campaign illustrates the many problems associated with a dish that is consumed carelessly but causes an ecological disaster with millions of animals suffering. Where frogs are missing as a natural insect control, the use of pesticides increases.”
This happened in India and Bangladesh in the 1980s before both countries banned frog exports. Experts have also warned that large-bodied frogs in Turkey might become extinct by 2030 as a result of the huge demand.
“Amphibians are highly susceptible to pollution, the climate crisis and deadly chytrid fungus,” added Sandra. “On top of this, the EU’s huge and ongoing hunger for frogs’ legs is decimating wild frog populations in an increasing number of countries.”
“The decline of many frog species is a global problem that is being greatly accelerated by just a handful of European nations. The capture and killing of native frogs is banned so we must not then support environmentally disastrous practices abroad.”"

Dermatologists have removed a mole from her body and sent it for tests, which came back confirming she had a malignant melanoma, which is the most serious form of skin cancer. The 64-year-old was hit with the shocking news just months after being treated for breast cancer. She's said to be in ""good spirits"" but ""distressed"" after being hit with a second cancer diagnosis in six months.
A spokesman for Sarah, Duchess of York said: “Following her diagnosis with an early form of breast cancer this summer, Sarah, Duchess of York has now been diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Her dermatologist asked that several moles were removed and analysed at the same time as the Duchess was undergoing reconstructive surgery following her mastectomy, and one of these has been identified as cancerous.
“She is undergoing further investigations to ensure that this has been caught in the early stages. Clearly, another diagnosis so soon after treatment for breast cancer has been distressing but the Duchess remains in good spirits.
“The Duchess wants to thank the entire medical team which has supported her, particularly her dermatologist whose vigilance ensured the illness was detected when it was. She believes her experience underlines the importance of checking the size, shape, colour and texture and emergence of new moles that can be a sign of melanoma.”
The Duchess is being treated by Dr Andrew Furness, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Catherine Borysiewicz, consultant dermatologist at the King Edward VII Hospital in London, and has been recuperating at the MAYRLIFE clinic in Austria, as first reported by The Sun. The Duchess's elder daughter HRH Princess Beatrice is patron of the British Skin Foundation and has worked with skin cancer patients.

Back in June, the Duchess of York's representatives told the Mirror that the royals experience ""underlines the importance of regular screening"" after the ""successful"" surgery at King Edward VII hospital in Marylebone, Central London.
The grandmother of three spent several days in the London hospital and told of her ""immense gratitude"" to the medical staff. A spokesman for the Duchess told Mirror at the time: ""Sarah, Duchess of York was recently diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer detected at a routine mammogram screening. She was advised she needed to undergo surgery which has taken place successfully."""

The Australian parent explained in the note why her son has ""unhealthy"" items to eat. The woman's son's autism means he struggles with some foods because of his ""sensory issues"", so she packs the foods she knows he can happily eat.
She put crisps, crackers, popcorn, sweetcorn, and apple in her son's lunchbox, but teachers were less than impressed and complained. While judgement about her parenting normally doesn't phase the mum, this time she drew the linee, The Sun previously reported.
So, the unnamed mum came up with a cunning way to make sure her son is happy while avoiding complaints from her son's teachers. On the blue lid of his lunch box, she wrote a message in the hope that his teachers would understand what she'd packed his lunch with this food.
In permanent marker, the message read: ""My lunch box may not look healthy, BUT it's all I will eat. Please be patient as I work through my sensory issues…""
The mum decided to share a photo of the message on Facebook, admitting that ""as awesome her my child is"", she sometimes ""struggles"" to put together hearty, healthy meals that he will eat at school. She added: ""He isn't able to quite articulate exactly why he never has a sandwich or wrap for lunch and prefers to munch on popcorn instead.""
She was inundated with comments from a number of supportive parents. One person said: ""As long as you don't take chocolate and lollies then I don't see why some things are such a problem.""
Another agreed: ""Looks healthy babe. I love your note, that's awesome, I'm going to borrow for my boy for kindy. I adore your advocacy for your child.""
""You have to do whatever works for you guys, my son is super fussy so I hear you sister"", a third added.

3KQATBMQ96_IW2LIYNG5V7Q0MH,E4 Hollyoaks fans 'solve' who really ran over Joel Dexter in 'new villain twist',Charlotte TuttonSenior TV Reporter,"09:00, 21 Jan 2024Updated09:18, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/hollyoaks-joel-die-abe-fielding-31929285,"Hollyoaks fans are convinced someone deliberately ran over Joel Dexter amid a new twist on the E4 soap.
Joel was left fighting for his life in a recent episode, as the firefighter was struck down by a speeding truck at the scene of a crash. A huge car pile-up left many characters injured, with Ella Richardson killed off in a tragic twist.
Her half-brother Joel was left critically injured and in a coma after he walked into the path of a speeding truck. Amid fears he would not regain consciousness, his loved ones kept a vigil at his bedside as they reeled from the events of that week.
But some fans were left suspicious over Joel's accident, amid a new character with a possible link to him joining the show. Upcoming scenes show Abe Fielding make his debut as the new love interest of Joel's ex and ""soulmate"" Cleo McQueen.
Amid Cleo and Joel's partner Leela Lomax fighting it out, scenes will show Abe learning of Cleo's history with Joel amid their own possible romance. Fans believe that spoilers have teased there is something sinister about Abe, and that he may be obsessed with Cleo.
This has led to some fans wondering whether Abe could have been the driver of the truck that hit Joel, and perhaps he tried to kill him. While it does seem that the truck was in fact a recovery vehicle helping out at the crash site, some viewers can't help but wonder if there is more to it.
Taking to social media, fans predicted Abe ran over Joel with one fan writing: ""I think it might be the new guy who’s come back for Cleo,"" as another said: ""I think it is Abe that ran over joel."" It comes after fans spotted a major clue that newcomer Abe shared a link to Joel, following the news Joel's mother Marie was returning to the show.
Given Joel's mum is returning very soon and her name is, or at least was previously, Marie Fielding, does this mean Abe is related to her and Joel given he has the same surname? Viewers certainly think so, with one writing: ""OH MY GOD GUYS HER LAST NAME IS FIELDING THATS ABE’S LAST NAME AKA CLEO’S NEW BOYFRIEND.""
Another posted, ahead of Rita Simons joining the show as Marie: ""Lord this means Abe and Joel are siblings… Cleo knows how to pick them."" A third fan theorised: ""are abe and joel siblings too? lord,"" as another wrote: ""My thoughts exactly! Both Joel's mum and Abe share the same surname. It's gotta be hasn't it."" Hollyoaks is yet to confirm the twist.

British Airways flight BA854 was forced to make an emergency landing at Heathrow an hour after taking off from the same airport at 7.25am today. The flight, which had been scheduled to land in Prague, in the Czech Republic, just after 10am, only made it as far as the town of Dover before it was forced to abort the trip and turn back toward London.
Fight path data from FlightRadar24 shows the plane began to turn shortly after it passed over Dover, turning around over the Strait of Dover and heading back to the UK.
Initially the planed seemed to be on course towards London City Airport but after last minute change of direction the aircraft returned to Heathrow, where it landed safely at at 8.41am.
Several fire engines rushed to meet the jet as it landed at Heathrow, video footage captured by a livestreaming service and shared to YouTube shows the emergency crews rushing to assist the aircraft.
A British Airways spokesperson blamed a ‘technical issue’ for the quick about-turn, though they did not specify what had caused the pilots to choose to return to Heathrow.
They told the Mirror: “We're sorry for the delay in our customers' journey after the aircraft returned to Heathrow as a precaution Our teams looked after them whilst they waited to board a replacement aircraft to continue their journey.”"
3Y7UMDXCAA_ZES6WI5YYDV9CNL,Mystery behind unusual 'snake worm' finally solved after experts left baffled for 16 years,Joseph GampAssistant News Editor,"10:59, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mystery-behind-unusual-snake-worm-31921482,"A team of scientists have solved the mystery of Alaska's ""snake worm"" after discovering a new species of fungus-eating fly - whose juveniles band together before slithering around like a long serpent-like being.
The snake worm mystery began more than 16 years ago in the summer of 2007, when Maggie Billington spotted thousands of tiny, wormlike larvae crawling across a road in a long line in the town of Ester. Ms Billington was a volunteer at the University of Alaska Museum of the North in Fairbanks at the time and documented the bizarre sighting and brought photos and samples to Derek Sikes, the museum's curator of insects.
In a statement, Mr Sikes said: ""I figured they must be fly larvae but had never heard of this snake worm phenomenon. I was dumbfounded. This was totally an X-Files case for me."" And now, Mr Sikes and his colleagues have identified the larvae in a new study, which was published in the journal Integrative Systematics: Stuttgart Contributions to Natural History, in December last year. The species, which they've named Sciara serpens, is one of several scarcely studied flies in which the larvae appear to mimic snakes.
The researchers claim the larvae take the shape of a snake to scare off birds and other would-be predators - or even to preserve moisture on dry ground by crawling over one another in a line. The new species belongs to the Sciaridae fly family, commonly called fungus gnats, because they feed on decaying organic matter. Many flies are hard to tell apart in their juvenile life stage, so Mr Sikes cared for larvae collected from a second snake worm sighting in 2007 until they morphed into their dark-winged fly form
The Alaskan fungus gnats raised by Sikes appeared to most closely resemble a European gnat called Sciara mirabilis, rather than previously identified North American species reported in Maryland and Arkansas. But it wasn't until 2021 that the team confirmed the gnat was a species new to science. Lead author Thalles Pereira, an insect researcher at the University of Alaska Museum of the North, examined the male gnats' genitalia under a powerful microscope and found notable differences in the shape, compared with those of its European relative.
While it might seem odd for an Alaskan gnat to have more in common with gnats in Europe than with its fellow North American species, the study authors noted that this follows a pattern among other insects in Alaska, such as grasshoppers and beetle. The variation of specie likely dates back to the Pleistocene era, or between 11,700 to 2.6million years ago).
During that time, Alaska was connected to Europe and Asia via the Bering Land Bridge, allowing insects to disperse from eastern Siberia to Alaska while giant ice sheets blocked off the rest of North America."
4FQG6BSC7F_NPUPF6JGG1BD2KR,'Glammed up' prison guards manipulated by lags as illegal affairs behind bars skyrocket,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"09:19, 21 Jan 2024Updated10:28, 22 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/glammed-up-prison-guards-manipulated-31930711,"""Criminally stupid austerity cuts"" have damaged the prison estate so badly manipulative prisoners are free to charm inexperienced female wardens, a criminal justice expert has warned.
Whistle-blowers have painted an alarming picture of life inside Britain's prisons where standards have slipped so much that inexperienced teenage guards and ""glammed up"" wardens are rushed through a training process which leaves them ill-equipped to properly deal with cunning criminals.
Prison officer numbers were cut 30% between 2010 and 2013, the Howard League reports, with many experienced guards tempted to leave the profession by generous redundancy pay-outs. The prison estate lost 70,000 years of experience from 2010 to 2018, when the number of wardens with three years under their belt was almost cut in three, Labour claimed.
After Covid departures further gutted the sector, those left face a mammoth task. Professor Ian Acheson, a former prison governor, claims the tough working environment and huge loss of experience is leaving female recruits at risk of being manipulated by prisoners.
His warning follows several high profile sex scandals involving lags and wardens including one guard who had intercourse with an inmate in a store cupboard and the case of Ruth Shmylo, who was cleared of misconduct in public officer charges after having phone sex with a drug dealer out of fear of ""repercussions"" to her and her family, the BBC reported.
Professor Acheson argued the scale of the problem could be far worse than the public realises as many offending officers are quietly disciplined for their romances, stopping their cases getting to court.
""I'm told by prison insiders that for every officer detected, many more are quietly required to resign without sanction. That will skew the already alarming figures,"" he told Mail Online.
He warned that ""teenagers in uniform, inadequately screened and poorly trained"" were an increasingly large part of the workforce which has been hammered by years of Tory cuts.
""Emergency recruitment has thrown barely trained youngsters into the maw of disordered and violent prisons across the country. This sets the scene for exploitation and corruption by experienced offenders,"" he added, directly linking ""criminally stupid austerity cuts"" to ""rising number of female officers who enter sexual relationships with prisoners.""
Craig Wylde, 41, a former guard at high security HMP Durham prison, suggested standards among wardens were slipping. He claimed he had seen some young female recruits turn up to work in full makeup wearing false eyelashes and bangle earrings.
Although they are made to remove the eyelashes and earrings, they are sent on their rounds looking glammed up, Mr Wylde said.
In recent years known cases of inappropriate relationships between female wardens and inmates include phone sex, sex in cells, sending lewd pictures over message and smuggling goods for their locked-up beaus.
One officer had sex with a prisoner in his cell at Maidstone Prison and went on to have his baby. She received a suspended jail term in 2022.
Ministry of Justice data published last year showed a marked rise in prison officers caught having affairs with inmates. They hit a record high, with 36 warders sacked for them since 2019, the Telegraph reported. At HMP Berwyn in north Wales, 18 female staff were found to have had relationships with inmates since the prison opened in 2017.
Ayshea Louise Gunn, 27, was jailed after her four-month fling with inmate Khuram Razaq was discovered at the prison. The pair exchanged inappropriate videos and pictures, some of which were streamed over the internet. At the same prison guard Emily Watson became infatuated with John McGee, who was serving eight years for death by dangerous driving.
She gave an inmate oral sex in his cell and had full intercourse with him on one occasion, leading her to be jailed for 12 months, the Daily Post reported.
Joanne Hunter was locked up having kissed and sent explicit pictures of herself to the prisoner who she ""thought was in love with her"" at Forest Bank prison in Salford, also smuggling cannabis into the jail for the lag.
Some 31 female prison officers and five male warders were dismissed for misconduct in this period. The figures do not cover the 14 private prisons run by companies such as G4S, Serco and Sodexo.
The numbers coincide with a rise in the percentage of the workforce that is female, to 42.1% as of last September. That follows a 28% increase in five years. The latest totals showed 16,199 females were employed, compared to 22,309 male.
Mass departures during Covid coupled with some interviews held on Zoom and cutting of the training period from 12 to eight weeks has led to a lowering of standards, some prison experts claim.
Vanessa Frake, former prison governor at Wormwood Scrubs and author of The Governor: My Life Inside Britain’s Most Notorious Prisons, said a properly trained prison officer was very unlikely to be manipulated into having a relationship with a lag.
“Prisoners are very good at watching for vulnerabilities. They will start with the chat and see how far they can push it. If they’re told to bug off and keep it clean, then it’s end of [story]. But it’s when they’re not [that inappropriate relationships can happen], and it can start very subtly,"" she told the Telegraph.
She added: ""It appears men are targeting women and looking for that vulnerability. These are predatory men, they’ve been predatory outside so there’s nothing stopping them being predatory inside.
""They might believe it’s an authentic romantic relationship because the manipulation by the prisoner makes you feel it’s genuine and true, whereas it’s just a form of corruption.”
A spokesperson for the Prison Service told the Mirror: ""“The overwhelming majority of Prison Service staff are hardworking and honest and their professionalism and expertise should not be called into question because of the illegal actions of the small number who aren’t.
“We are doing more than ever to catch the minority who break the rules including bolstering our Counter-Corruption Unit with 140 new staff and strengthening our vetting processes to root out misconduct.”"

The Defence Secretary was challenged over whether the UK is ready for war, with defence spending below its target of 2.5% of GDP. Asked when the UK will meet the target, he told the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: ""There is a trajectory upwards. I can't give you the exact date because we've always said it's as the economic conditions allow. But the point is we're working to a plan.""
It comes after a former chief of the general staff of the British Army warned this week the UK risks a repeat of the 1930s unless more is invested in its armed forces. General Lord Dannatt hit out at the shrinking size of the army, which he said has fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today ""and falling fast"".
Writing in The Times, he drew parallels with the 1930s when the ""woeful"" state of the UK's armed forces failed to deter Hitler. ""There is a serious danger of history repeating itself,"" he said. Pointing to rising geopolitical uncertainty, he said: ""If our armed forces are not strong enough to deter future aggression from Moscow or Beijing it will not be a small war to contend with but a major one.""
Lord Dannatt said pay and conditions should be ""urgently reviewed"" and ""a pay rise to attract recruits and to retain current trained personnel should be a priority, as should addressing the appalling quality of some armed forces accommodation"".
Under Government proposals, the size of the regular army will be cut from a commitment of 82,000 troops to 73,000 by 2025. Mr Shapps has said the size of the British Army will not dip below 73,000 under the Conservatives, disputing projections that it could eventually sink to 50,000.
He told Sky's Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips: ""It's not projected to go down to 50,000. It's actually, specifically, to 73,000 plus the reserves."" Asked whether under the Tories' watch, the size of the army would not fall below 73,000, Mr Shapps said: ""That's correct."" He added: ""It isn't a question of how many men and women you have on the ground only, it's about how lethal your armed forces are.""
In his first major speech as Defence Secretary last week, Mr Shapps said the UK is facing a ""pre-war world"". He admitted the ""peace dividend"" that allowed successive governments to ease spending on defence is over, as he set out the risks posed by countries including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as well as terrorist groups in an increasingly dangerous world.
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper would not commit to Labour spending 3% of GDP a year on defence if elected. She told Trevor Phillips On Sky News: ""Decisions for future spending if Labour wins the election would be for a Labour chancellor and in opposition is for Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, but we have been clear about the importance of our national security. National security is the bedrock on which everything else in the country and everybody's wellbeing is built and so of course that includes supporting our Armed Forces and making sure that they have the investment and the support that they need."""

Over the last 10 seasons, the popular dating show has catapulted many contestants into TV stardom, with the likes of Molly-Mae Hague and Wes Nelson finding fame after participating. But after experiencing life in the limelight, a lot of former Love Island stars have decided to steer away from the cameras and return to their 'normal jobs'.
Here's a look at the former contestants who waved goodbye to the Love Island life and instead went back to their normal jobs following their time on the show.
Greg O'Shea won the show in 2019 with his then-girlfriend Amber Gill, but he always had his eyes firmly set on going back to his original job as a professional rugby player.
The Love Island star played for Ireland in the Olympics in 2021 and recently launched his own online fitness brand, where he does online exercise classes with fans.
Speaking to the Mirror, the heartthrob said that he 'couldn't think of anything worse' than doing nightclub appearances and flogging products on social media to 'get ahead'.
Marketing executive Georgia Townend may have only appeared on Love Island for 24 hours in 2021 - but she made quite the impression. She revealed that she went on the show to 'genuinely find love' and after setting her sights on Hugo, but ended up being disappointed.
After her short-lived time on the show, Georgia said that she was going back to her 'normal job' in Lidl. On her first day back to work, Georgia posted a gorgeous snap of herself posing next to a Lidl poster inside the office. The former Love Island star said her 'quick checkout' from the villa landed her back in her favourite place.
Dr Alex George appeared on the show in 2018, but after dipping his toe into the life of notoriety, he decided to go back to his medical career of being a NHS doctor at Lewisham Hospital.
Since then, Alex worked as a frontline worker throughout the coronavirus pandemic In 2021, Dr Alex was appointed as the UK Youth Mental Health Ambassador within the Department for Education by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The former Love Island star is continuing to work hard to raise awareness for suicide prevention following the tragic death of his beloved brother Llyr who took his own life at the age of 19.
Anna Vakili also went back to work after finding fame on Love Island in 2019, where she returned to work as a pharmacist to help in the fight against coronavirus. She had previously quit her job to appear on the ITV2 dating show and had no intention of returning until Covid swept the nation.
On her first day back amid the pandemic, Anna took to Instagram to reveal why she made the decision to go back to her roots after she spent five long years training to become a pharmacist.
""First day back working as a Pharmacist since leaving Love Island. It’s been almost a whole year! Wow can’t believe how fast it’s gone,"" Anna penned. “Wasn’t really planning on registering yet but with everything that’s going on it felt wrong not to. We can all fight this together. Stay safe. Stay home. Save lives.”
The 31-year-old starred in the second series of Love Island, but was a trained elderly and palliative carer before signing up for reality TV. She, like Alex, pledged her support to the Covid effort when she returned to her former day job.
""I can’t sit at home on my own anymore knowing I have training within the sector,” she tweeted at the time. “If I can give something more than what I’m doing – then I am satisfied."" Malin gave birth to a baby girl in 2022 after previously being struck by tragedy when her daughter Consy died just weeks after she was born.
Rachel Fenton, who fame on Love Island series two, returned to working as an orthopaedic clinical nurse specialist after the villa. In 2021, the 29-year-old shared a photo as she received her Covid vaccine, after battling coronavirus twice.

The monarch was absent from Sunday's Church service in Sandringham, which he usually attends every week. Charles is preparing for a planned operation to treat an enlarged prostate next week. Royal fans and photographers gathered at St Mary Magdalene Church this morning in the hopes of getting a glimpse of the monarch, but the 75-year-old did not appear.
On Friday, the King was pictured leaving his Birkhall estate in Aberdeen with Queen Camilla, where the pair had been staying. They spent much of the Covid lockdowns at the estate and their honeymoon following their marriage in 2005.
Following the Scottish trip, the royal duo travelled to Sandringham, where Charles will rest before his surgery. On Thursday, the Queen said Charles is ""looking forward to getting back to work"" as she visited Aberdeen's Art Gallery.
On Wednesday, Buckingham Palace announced the monarch was due for a planned operation for an enlarged prostate next week. The statement read: ""In common with thousands of men each year, The King has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate.
""His Majesty's condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure. The King's public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation."" It is understood Charles wished to make his diagnosis public in order to encourage more men to get checked for the condition.
The Mirror reported on Saturday that Harry and Meghan have given their support to the King and Princess of Wales following their health scares. It came after Kate spent her fifth day in hospital after major abdominal surgery.
The move, which will be considered an olive branch, comes nearly two months after Charles, 75, and Kate, 42, were publicly named in an alleged race row over the skin colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s eldest child Archie, four.
A source said: “The King and the Princess of Wales have received support from Prince Harry and Meghan regarding their health. The Duke and Duchess contacted both parties in different ways to pass on their concern and best wishes.”
Buckingham Palace is said to have tried to privately inform all senior members of the Royal Family, including Harry, 39, and Meghan, 42, before it was made public on Wednesday. But it is understood courtiers had to put out a public statement “relatively quickly” as the King was forced to cancel imminent public engagements.
The announcement was therefore made at 7.25am California time, fuelling reports the Duke may have seen news alerts before any private message. The Princess of Wales was said to be “doing well” last night but she is expected to remain in The London Clinic for up to 10 more days. Her illness has not been revealed but Kensington Palace confirmed it was not cancer."

The man, identified only as A.V, was waiting for his plane at London's Gatwick Airport when he allegedly posted a message on the social network claiming to be a member of the Taliban and saying he had planted a bomb. The threat led to a full-scale emergency operation and the flight being intercepted on its way to Menorca in the Balearics by a Spanish Air Force fighter jet.
The incident happened on July 3, 2022 but the man, who was 18 at the time, is due to be tried on Monday. The Prosecutor's Office is asking the Central Criminal Court of the National Court to fine him 22,500 euros and to compensate the Ministry of Defence with another 94,782 euros for the expenses of sending up the Eurofighter fighter. The jet escorted the plane, with 142 passengers on board, into the holiday airport.
The prosecutor says the man was at Gatwick Airport at the check-in desk when he sent a message through Snapchat to the group of friends with whom he was flying. The message contained a photograph of himself with the phrase ""on the way to fly the plane (I am a member of the Taliban)"".
This message was captured by the United Kingdom security services when the plane was flying over French airspace and they notified the Spanish authorities.
The Palma control tower informed the head of coordination at the Menorca airport that the flight from Gatwick was being escorted by a Spanish Air Force fighter, a Eurofighter, due to a bomb threat.
Once on the ground, after a thorough inspection, the Civil Guard verified that it was a false alarm. However, the author of the threats was arrested for public disorder.
The Civil Guard had to activate a special operation made up of specialists in explosives deactivation, dog handlers and members of the Fiscal and Border Patrol and Citizen Security. During the thorough inspection of the aircraft, a security perimeter was established. They also had to check all luggage.
Once the Civil Guard specialists determined that the bomb threat was false, the agents identified the author of the message on a social network. This subject was one of the passengers, who was traveling with five companions.
The British man was arrested for a crime of public disorder.
The operation of the Menorca airport was not altered. It was not necessary to close the airspace or divert flights to other airports in the archipelago, Aena said at the time.
It is not clear whether the man has to appear in person or whether he has already entered a plea."

Pearl Butterworth, who has waived her right to anonymity to tell her story for the first time, hit out after a damning report found hundreds of schoolgirls suffered life-changing abuse under the top cop’s watch, when he was in charge of Greater Manchester Police between 2008 and 2015.
Mum-of-four Pearl, 54, was abused even earlier, in the 1980s, and fell pregnant with her abuser’s baby when she was just 15 years old. She says Sir Peter must be punished for failing to act. Pearl said: “Sir Peter’s knighthood should be returned immediately.""
""He received the award for services to policing, but he failed to protect hundreds of children whose lives were ruined as a result. It’s a disgrace.” Her call is backed by campaigner and Rochdale whistleblower Maggie Oliver.
The former GMP Detective Constable said she raised the alarm when she worked with him in the early 2000s, adding: “I warned Sir Peter Fahy in writing about the scale of the problem. “I told him we were neglecting these children... but I was fobbed off. He has always just provided empty words. He needs to be held accountable.”
Pearl was among dozens of girls preyed on by paedophile gangs in Rochdale. Some were just 12 when they were plied with alcohol, cash and food in return for sex. But their abusers enjoyed free rein due to failures by the police and council officials.
Pearl was 14 and living in a children’s home when she was targeted by predators. But she said her cries for help were ignored by staff.
She said: “They knew I was sexually active at 14 as I was coming back at 2am covered in love bites. But it was allowed to continue, no questions asked. I even told staff a man wanted to take naked photos of me. But nothing happened. I just wanted it to stop and the authorities could have done something – but they chose not to. Nobody would listen. If I had been listened to 40 years ago, hundreds of kids would have been spared this nightmare.”
The report, led by protection specialist Malcolm Newsam, found “compelling evidence” of widespread, organised sexual abuse of children.
It said police and children’s social care managers were aware of abuse between 2004 and 2013 in Rochdale but failed to give it sufficient priority. Pearl, who now lives in nearby Ramsbottom, found the courage to approach police in 2016 but says the experience left her broken.
She said: “They were horrible and made me feel as though I was lying and inventing it for the money.” In 2010 GMP launched Operation Span to investigate the abuse claims and, so far, 42 men have been convicted for molesting 13 children.
But the report, out earlier this week, found there are still 96 men, judged a potential risk to youngsters, still at large. Pearl took Rochdale Council to court in 2020 for failing to protect her – but strict rules on reporting historic abuse meant she was 30 years too late. The judge said the length of time that had passed made it difficult to ensure recollections were accurate.
She is now battling to rebuild her life, but admitted: “I find it very difficult to love, I can’t trust people and have never been able to hold down a job because of the flashbacks
“I’ve self-harmed and abused drugs and alcohol as an escape.” Despite assurances from the force that abuse cases are handled differently now, Pearl said: “I wouldn’t trust GMP as far as I could throw them.
“I think it’s happening even more now. Rochdale has always been a hotspot so why would it just stop? But I want people to know they can speak up. And they won’t be alone.” Rochdale Council leader Neil Emmott said it is deeply sorry staff had not recognised the “very serious failures” that affected children’s lives.
GMP chief constable Stephen Watson said: “It remains a matter of profound regret victims were failed.”"
6WR67BEDWF_IKKRBWDDLCA0M22,'Four Labour defeats in a row are a reminder to take absolutely nothing for granted',Kevin MaguireAssociate Editor,"22:09, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/four-labour-defeats-row-reminder-31934750,"Walk up the famous yellow staircase in No10 and you will notice how few portraits of former Prime Ministers peering from the walls are of the Labour party.
There are only six, a mere half a dozen, since the first, Ramsay MacDonald, moved into Downing Street 100 years ago today. The Conservatives have had five since 2016 alone so Keir Starmer would be creating his own bit of history should he, as is widely expected this year, become Labour’s seventh after MacDonald, Attlee, Wilson, Callaghan, Blair and Brown.
Though it has provided the PM for only 33 of the past 100 years, Labour has achieved much that is golden and enduring, headed by Clement Attlee’s precious gift of the NHS. Yet it also helps explain Labour’s gnawing nervousness despite opinion polls and the bookies showing Starmer is red-hot favourite to be Britain’s next Prime Minister.
Four defeats on the trot are grim reminders to take nothing, absolutely nothing, for granted. Ahead of Starmer there are dozens of Wilson’s “long weeks” during which fortunes can fall as well as rise. Nobody in Britain would still be paying tax if we enjoyed reductions every time a Tory Government that talked about cutting rates actually did so.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s Budget on March 6, however, will be in one of those long weeks, arguably the last one, as the response to Tory election bribes might seal the deal for Labour or revive Conservative fortunes.
My impression is what’s left to play for is only the scale of Starmer’s victory, as voters show exactly how fed up they are with the incompetent and sleazy Conservatives. Shadow Cabinet members whisper that Starmer repeatedly warns against corrosive complacency even as the party’s team meet civil servants to discuss how they would implement Labour’s programme.
In the Scottish fishing port of Lossiemouth at the weekend, I listened to tributes to MacDonald, an illegitimate son of a farm labourer and brought up in terrible poverty. MacDonald wasn’t really ready to govern in January 1924 and had no majority. He had to govern with fewer seats than the Conservatives, later that year losing an election due to the infamous Zinoviev letter smear trick.
But he demonstrated Labour weren’t “wild men” incapable of running Britain, implementing a house-building initiative that saved 500,000 families from slums.
MacDonald was back in No10 in 1929. His great betrayal of 1931, forming a coalition National Government with mostly Conservative ministers, is for another day. Starmer setting his sights on at least two terms and 10 years if, or probably when, he triumphs in 2024 is an increasingly confident leader making up for his party’s lost time."

The 77-year-old responded to the heckler by telling security: ""Get him out."" He then quipped that he would only be a dictator for ""only one day"" if he gets re-elected in December. Another man, dressed in KKK attire, was also removed before he could mingle with the crowd.
Trump has often questioned President Joe Biden's mental sharpness due to his age. Defending his own cognitive abilities, he boasted about acing a dementia test while he was president.
""I don't mind being 80, but I'm 77. That's a big difference,"" he said, adding: ""I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago.""
Trump was joined at a rally by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and other senior officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker. US Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry also appeared on stage with Trump.

""Almost every politician from South Carolina is endorsing me,"" Trump announced. The South Carolinians encouraged voters to support Trump in New Hampshire before the contest moves to their state next month.
""If you do that and you win by a big margin here, we'll finish the job in South Carolina,"" said Murrell Smith, the speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives.
This is another setback for Haley, who hopes her appeal among independent and unaffiliated voters will give her a strong enough finish in New Hampshire to turn the race into a two-person contest against Trump.
At another campaign event, Trump went on a puzzling tirade, claiming he's being indicted by 'Democrats, communists, Marxists, and fascists' in New York. He told his cheering fans: ""I'm being indicted for you,"" and said he was ""proud"" to be sued.
""I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you. Our enemies want to take away my freedom because I'll never let them take away your freedom... and in the end, they're not after my freedom, they're after your freedom,"" Trump rambled, trying to drum up support for his claim that all his legal troubles are 'witch hunts.'""
Trump also posted on Truth Social yesterday morning to remind people about a ""BIG REALLY TONIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE."" Trump has been leading in the polls, with Haley, a former South Carolina governor, seeming to be his strongest competitor.
Trump further tweeted, ""Nikki 'Birdbrain' Haley is losing BIG in the polls against Crooked Joe. I am beating him all over the place. She is WEAK ON THE BORDER, I AM THE STRONGEST BORDER PRESIDENT, EVER. That's all you have to know!!!

The 19-year-old actress, who came to prominence as Kelly Neelan in ITV soap Coronation Street, shared a photo of herself in a bikini as she stood waist deep in water among rocks and in front of a stunning waterfall.
It looks like she was letting the stresses and strains of recent weeks wash away in a place that looks like an idyllic retreat from the rat race. She had previously posted photos of her holiday in Costa Rica.
Millie played orphan Ruby Sunday in the BBC sci-fi series with showrunner Russell T Davies saying that the decision to not continue with the character was made last year, after Millie had finished filming her first run.
She made her Doctor Who debut just last month, on screen, so fans of the show were shocked that she was being replaced so soon.Now Millie, 19, will not appear in the 2024 Christmas special later this year and will make only a handful of appearances across Ncuti’s second series as the Doctor during 2025.
The eight episodes she has filmed already will air from May, the BBC has announced. It has been reported that new companion, Varada, has already began filming scenes at the studios in Cardiff. One insider told The Mirror: ""Russell is keeping things moving and isn’t letting the grass grow, that’s for sure.""
Millie quit Coronation Street in 2022 after three years on the cobbles and was announced as companion Ruby later that year. After landing the role of Ruby, she said she was “beyond honoured”, describing it as “a dream come true” and calling Ncuti “fabulous”. At the time, she declared: “I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me.”
Ncuti was full of praise for Millie when it was announced that she would be his first companion in Doctor Who. He said at the time: ""She is full of talent, strength, she has a cheeky sparkle in her eye and is sharp as a razor. From the moment she walked into the room she captured all of our attention with her effervescence and then solidified that attention with the sheer torque of her talent. This adventure is going to be so wild and so fun, I cannot WAIT to sail the universe with Millie!""
There will be changes for the upcoming 14th series of Doctor Who as it’s the first one under the new deal with Disney, which has meant a cash injection allowing for bigger budgets and better special effects.

8HA8EZPPDS_TNNMWNU9CD86V7A,St Petersburg explosion: Blast rocks Russian gas terminal 'after drones seen in area',Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"10:02, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/st-petersburg-explosion-blast-rocks-31931044,"A gas terminal has burst into flames in Russia following a suspected Ukrainian drone strike.
At least two drones were spotted flying towards the city before the fire broke out at the gas plant, Fontanka, a St Petersburg-based news outlet, said. It follows two other attacks on Russian fuel infrastructure in recent days.
The fire had been contained and there were no reports of injuries, the State-owned RIA Novosti news agency said. Ukrainian officials have rarely admitted using drones to strike targets on Russian soil since their country was invaded two years ago.
Local residents said they heard a drone followed by several explosions at Ust-Luga, close to Russia's border with Estonia, Russian news outlet Shot said. There were three large international tankers near the fire, but it is not thought that these were damaged in the strike.
It comes after 13 people were killed and 10 injured by shelling in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, according to Alexei Kulemzin, the city's Russian-installed mayor.
On Friday a Ukrainian drone struck an oil storage depot in western Russia, causing a massive blaze, officials said, as Kyiv’s forces apparently extended their attacks on Russian soil ahead of the war’s two-year anniversary.
Four oil reservoirs with a total capacity of 6,000 1.6 million gallons were set on fire when the drone reached Klintsy, a city of some 70,000 people located about 40 miles from the Ukrainian border, according to the local governor and state news agency Tass.
The strike apparently was the latest in a recently intensified effort by Ukraine to unnerve Russians and undermine President Vladimir Putin’s claim that life in Russia is going on as normal before its March 17 presidential election.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to hit more targets inside Russian border regions this year. Russia’s air defenses are concentrated in occupied regions of Ukraine, Kyiv officials say, leaving more distant targets inside Russia more vulnerable as Ukrainian forces develop longer-range drones.
The Russian city of Belgorod, also near the Ukrainian border, canceled its traditional Orthodox Epiphany festivities on Friday due to the threat of Ukrainian drone strikes. It was the first time major public events were known to have been called off in Russia due to the drone threat.
Ukrainian national media, quoting an official in Ukraine’s Intelligence Service, said Ukrainian drones on Friday also attacked a gunpowder mill in Tambov, about 370 miles south of Moscow.
In another strike, the Russian Defence Ministry said a Ukrainian drone was downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday. The drone wreckage fell on the grounds of a St. Petersburg Oil Terminal on the city’s southern edge.
Russia's defence ministry said it shot down three Ukrainian drones in Smolensk Region, close to its border with Ukraine, on Saturday night.
Russian forces have retaliated to Ukrainian strikes with intense counterfire. At the beginning of the year a huge barrage of missiles rained down on multiple Ukrainian cities after strikes the other way reportedly killed 25 civilians.
Ukraine has warned that its army is facing ammunition shortages, calling on allies in the West to help them replenish supplies. It has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year."

In other social media pictures, he is behind the wheel of a red Ferrari and posing at sea with a big fish.
A video showed his birthday celebrations on a private jet, and one of his superyachts with its own beauty salon featured in a Channel 5 show. He bought Mohamed Al-Fayed’s yacht where Princess Diana was pictured days before her tragic death in August 1997.
The Nigerian-born Lebanese entrepreneur, who names his yachts Bash after his initials, admitted at one point his life became a bit “Wolf of Wall Street” – a reference to the 2013 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as hedonistic businessman Jordan Belfort. In May, Mr Haidar, whose nationality on Companies House is listed as Irish, reportedly bought a five-bedroom property behind Sloane Square in Central London for £20million. In 2023, he gave the Conservative party £323,780 and donated £75,000 to hopeful Tory London mayoral candidate Moz Hossain.
Electoral Commission stats show Mr Haidar also gave a non-cash gift, worth £10,000, to fund advertising to Tory MP Lee Anderson in November. Mr Anderson, dubbed 30p Lee over his comments about foodbank users, quit as Tory deputy chair on Tuesday over Mr Sunak’s Rwanda Bill. Dad-of-three Mr Haidar, said to have lived on the breadline for part of his upbringing, grew his fortune with telecoms firm Channel IT, which now operates in 19 countries.
The businessman told Boat International guide last year: “Passion does not make you money. Need makes you money.” The guide’s report said: “After setting up Intercomm, things got a bit, in his words, ‘Wolf of Wall Street’. There were no sinking boats… but there were parties in Marbella and an 18-metre boat.” A Tory spokesman said: “Donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them."""

The Duke of Sussex attended the ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, where his work as a British Army veteran and pilot was recognised. The 39-year-old completed two tours of Afghanistan as a forward air controller and an Apache helicopter pilot, having flown countless training missions in the UK, US and Australia.
He served for 10 years in the military, rising to the rank of Captain, and later founded the Invictus Games - a sporting event for wounded military personnel and veterans. Harry takes his place alongside other aviation and aerospace ""legends"" including Buzz Aldrin, Jeff Bezos, Tom Cruise, Neil Armstrong, Harrison Ford, Morgan Freeman and Elon Musk.

While at the event, Harry posed for a selfie with Prince Mario-Max Schaumburg-Lippe, who claims to be a distant cousin of the British Royal Family. But his regal roots have been questioned by the head of his ""family"" Prince Alexander of Schaumburg-Lippe, who told the The Mail on Sunday: ""It's very painful for me, this guy has been harvesting our name for his personal gain.""
He warned that Prince Harry ""cannot stoop lower"" than appearing beside the ex-Big Brother contestant and TV shopping channel host in public, adding: ""I would advise him to stay away from this man."" Mario-Max, who claims he has the right to use the royal title after he was adopted by a distant relative of the family when he was 23 years old, has been dubbed the ""King of Trash TV"" in the German press for appearing on the local version of Big Brother.
He also promotes products on shopping channels including a so-called ""wealth elixir"". He is also a regular visitor to America, where he has posed for photos with celebrities such as Ivana Trump and Paris Hilton.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
Speaking about meeting Harry at the award ceremony, Mario-Max, who appeared on the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, told The Mail on Sunday: ""We had a personal conversation and he was fabulous, very humble, very sweet. It filled me with joy."" He congratulated Harry on his award, writing on Instagram: ""Congratulations To HRH Prince Harry for his very much deserved Living Legends of Aviation Award...Well Done.""
But after he posted a photo with Harry, Mario-Max received many negative comments with one saying: ""I'm embarrassed for both of you. This must be a joke."" Another person added: ""So cringe. Two irrelevant middle-aged men without serious pursuit using their titles to grift in superficial Hollywood.""
Harry, who was sporting a black velvet tuxedo, was inducted alongside US Navy pilot Fred George and former world speed record holder Steve Hinton, as well as Lauren Sanchez - who is engaged to Amazon founder Bezos. The event's website also praised the duke for his work with charities and organisations including Travalyst, Sentebale, African Parks and WellChild.
A statement on its website said: ""Prince Harry is a humanitarian, military veteran, mental wellness advocate and environmentalist. He has dedicated his life to advancing causes that he is passionate about and that bring about permanent change for people and places."""
9J247RC4DX_004NZMV5RNB15X2,Parents of murdered mum demand answers after her eventual killer was bailed to her home,Jennifer HylandReporter,"10:44, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/parents-murdered-mum-demand-answers-31931163,"The heartbroken parents of a woman murdered by her partner have asked why he was allowed to serve bail at her home.
Claire Inglis' heartbroken mum and dad are calling for an investigation following the horrifying incident, in which Christopher McGowan murdered the 28-year-old at her home where she lived with her little boy. They've sent a heartfelt letter to the top boss asking for a public inquiry, the Daily Record reported.
Her mum and dad, Ian, 60, and Fiona, 62, from Stirling, said: ""He should never have been there. We honestly believe if he hadn't been granted bail, Claire would still be here. If that decision had been different, we could still call our daughter up and hear her voice.
""Most importantly, her son would still have his mother to hold him, tell him she loves him and she would be here to tuck him into bed at night. We need to know why she was put in that position, we want to know who made that decision to grant him bail and why?
""Please, First Minister, instruct the Scottish Ministers to hold a public inquiry into Claire's death so we can finally get the answers we seek. Make sure this doesn't happen again.""
After being convicted of Claire's cruel murder, McGowan will be locked up for at least 23 years. The 28-year-old killer burned his partner with a lighter during an assault before torturing her after claiming she had “fallen down the stairs”.
A court heard how McGowan - a convicted domestic abuser - left his victim suffering more than 76 injuries during the attack which left her with bleeding inside her skull and extensive injuries to her neck. Jurors took less than two hours to find his guilty of the mother's murder.
The court heard how the victim, described as a ""beautiful, amazing young mum"", had announced on Facebook in Autumn 2021 that she was ""in a relationship"" with McGowan, a painter and decorator with previous convictions for violence. He had been released from prison, where he had been remanded on charges including dangerous driving following a high-speed police pursuit, a few weeks before the fatal attack.
Chief Executive of Women's Aid, Dr Marsha Scott, said she echoed ""the call for answers voiced by Claire Inglis' parents in their call for justice."" She said: ""We assume Scottish Government justice officials asked these questions when Claire was murdered, and we urge justice officials to respond as a matter of priority with the answers to Claire's parents' questions and, even more important, how systems and processes around bail will change to protect those affected by domestic abuse.
""We struggle to understand why the Government was adamant about loosening the requirements for bail in the recently passed Bail and Release from Custody Bill, given the abundant evidence that existing protections aren't sufficient.""
Russell Findlay, who speaks for the Scottish Conservatives on justice matters, said Claire's mum and dad deserved answers, but had had ""the door slammed in their faces. Three months ago when I asked the First Minister to instruct an independent inquiry on their behalf, he wrongly stated that this was a judicial matter which he could not interfere with. The truth is he can and should instruct a review. His government's justice agencies have the information Ian and Fiona are seeking at their fingertips,"" the spokesperson said.
In response to Findlay's questions in November, Yousaf said he would raise the matter with Scotland's highest law officials. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ""Our sympathies continue to be with Mr and Mrs Inglis and Claire's wider family and friends for the tragic loss of Claire's life.""
""The First Minister conveyed the concerns raised by the parents of Claire Inglis, about decisions made in relation to bail in this case to the Lord President and the Lord Advocate and responses have been received which have been passed on so they can be provided to Claire's parents.""
""Decisions on whether to grant bail are for the independent courts based on the facts and circumstances of the case before them and when granting bail, the court can decide to ban a person accused of domestic abuse from residing at an address where a woman or children live.""
""In addition, the new bail test in the Bail and Release Act will, for the first time, makes clear that the court should specifically consider victim safety, including both physical and psychological harm, when making decisions on bail.""

Considered once a major rival to Trump in the Republican primaries, DeSantis made the announcement that he's out of the running for the 2024 presidential election just two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Initially seen as a contender who could challenge Donald Trump, the conservative Floridian was defeated by Nikki Haley at the Iowa caucus and is currently trailing her in New Hampshire polls.
While Trump and Haley are busy fighting for supremacy in New Hampshire with numerous rallies and campaign events, DeSantis decided to bypass it and head for South Carolina - though things didn't go as he planned.

Campaign finance records reveal that MAGA Inc. spent over $23 million on advertisements against DeSantis, while the super PAC supporting Nikki Haley, the former U.N. Ambassador, put substantial efforts into defeating DeSantis in Iowa, as NBC reported.
DeSantis announced his withdrawal from the race in a video posted on X, previously known as Twitter, accompanied by a quote from Winston Churchill: ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" - Winston Churchill

In the newly released video, DeSantis opened up about his campaign and why he decided to join public service. He said government spending is sky-high and it's time to bring it down, whilst also protecting ""America's children from being indoctrinated.""

His rival Nikki Haley, on the other hand, has plunged a lot of time and cash into a New Hampshire campaign, attracting so much attention that Donald Trump spent all morning badmouthing her over Truth Social, the conservatives' own version of Twitter. However, DeSantis skipped this key primary opting to focus on South Carolina instead.
But even with the money and effort channeled into South Carolina, their top politicians have already pledged support to Trump well before their primary vote.
Over the weekend, leaders like McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette journeyed to New Hampshire joining Trump at a rally. Sen. Tim Scott, who hails from South Carolina too, backed Trump at another event in New Hampshire the previous night.
Despite the funds splashed by Trump's campaign and being labelled 'DeSanctimonious' - slurs thrown by his opponents which seemed to have derailed his once-intimidating political career.
The ambitious governor had entered the 2024 presidential race with several plus points in his bid against Trump, and early primary polls did suggest DeSantis was in a pretty robust position to take on just that.
He and his supporters gathered a political fortune of over $100 million, and he had a notable record on issues that matter to many conservatives, such as abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.

A9YCVS6ZXK_VCDH9YL3EB77FLU,Sleep expert's 'gentle pressure' trick can help you fall asleep much quicker,Ariane Sohrabi-ShirazSenior Lifestyle Writer,"08:00, 21 Jan 2024Updated08:03, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/sleep-experts-gentle-pressure-trick-31901592,"If your sleep schedule is all over the place at the moment, the answer to your struggles could be as simple as applying gentle pressure to a specific area of your body.
January is a the worst month for getting proper sleep, with Google searches revealing people aren't happy. Search terms such as 'insomnia,' 'why can't I sleep,' 'sleep music' and 'sleep remedies' all peak in January, according to research by botanical experts Cannabotech.
One reason for this is actually Dry January, as although sleep generally improves after a while, it can be quite rough at the beginning. Lisa Artis of The Sleep Charity, a charity partner of sleep tech firm Simba, explained: ""For those taking on Dry January, in the short term, people may find they experience sleep difficulties - in particular, drifting off and staying asleep. If they don’t try to get into new good sleep habits, this could lead to insomnia.""
The NHS recommends that adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night, so it's important to do what we can to get that much-needed rest. But it's not always easy.
Luckily, Lisa has shared a trick that can help you to get to sleep much quicker - and it involves applying gentle pressure to a specific body part. She explained: ""Before bedtime, indulge in a warm water foot soak to redirect attention away from sleep-related anxieties. Applying gentle pressure to acupuncture points, like the base of the skull or the inner wrist, can help to stimulate relaxation and support the transition into sleep.""
If you're still struggling with insomnia, Lisa recommends adopting a 'Zero Gravity' sleep position. The sleep expert explained: ""NASA scientists discovered that the position not only minimises strain on the spine but also enhances blood circulation, reduces inflammation, and fosters a more comfortable sleep experience.
""Inspired by the neutral body posture assumed by astronauts during space travel, the position involves elevating the legs and slightly reclining the upper body, resulting in a posture that simulates the sensation of weightlessness. Achieve the position by lying flat on your back and raising both your head and feet with pillows slightly above your heart level, so the spine is neutrally aligned.""

AAPL9S9F6D_29RHJ3Z8BYRV71B,On-the-run prisoner with gun down his trousers tried to sell drugs to undercover cop,Adam Everett,"09:44, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/run-prisoner-gun-down-trousers-31930975,"An absconded prisoner was caught with a 'lethal weapon down his trousers' then tried to sell 'super strength' coke to police.
Paul Gallagher, who was on the run for nearly two years, was caught with a gun down his trousers in a taxi before trying to broker a cocaine deal with undercover police in Dixy Chicken. Gallagher walked out of jail with less than a year left to serve on his sentence and was found 22 months later in a pub with only a toothbrush and £6 cash on him.
Gallagher was handed five years in 2011 after a routine stop of a taxi led to the delivery of a gun and ammunition being halted, the Liverpool Echo reports. He was a passenger in the vehicle and tried to give a fake name when Matrix officers stopped the vehicle on Suffield Road in Kirkdale shortly before midnight
Gallagher was said to have ""appeared nervous"" and was seen adjusting the waistband of his trousers and ""trying to distract the officers"". David Evans, prosecuting, described how it was then discovered when he was conveyed into custody that his pants were ""holding a lethal weapon"".
Defence counsel Desmond Lennon told the court that his client had been ""given little option but to deliver the weapon because of drugs debts"". Gallagher, then of Swindon Road in Kirkdale, was locked up after admitting possession of a prohibited weapon and ammunition. Having been released in December 2013, he then found himself back in court again in 2020. By now aged 35, he was part of a gang who sold ""super strength"" 93% cocaine, as well as heroin with a purity of 59%, to undercover police.
Operation Finberry saw £21,000 of cocaine, £98,000 of heroin and £200,000 of cannabis recovered between 2014 and 2015. But Gallagher, who told a covert officer that he could source kilos of cocaine and heroin during a meeting at Dixy Chicken on Smithdown Road, was not apprehended until years later.
And when finally caught in Liverpool city centre on Valentine's Day in 2020, he claimed that he did not recall his past actions and insisted under interview: ""I don't deal in anything unlawful. I'm a lawful man."" Gallagher, by now of Kestrel Dene in Fazakerley, added: ""I've been smoking pot for 20 years. My memory is f***ed. I've never, ever supplied drugs. It's not my thing.""
Liverpool Crown Court heard that he and other gang members were ensnared by an undercover officer, codenamed ""Raj"". Nicola Daley, prosecuting, outlined how Gallagher claimed over the phone that he could do ""3oz at 9 each"" - three ounces of heroin for £2,700 - which could be ""one and one"", or bulked out by 100%.
He subsequently directed a courier to supply the secret PC with drugs. The officer handed over £1,500 for 28.5g of cocaine, which had a purity of 79% and was valued at up to £2,850.
Gallagher and Raj then met at the chicken shop, when the former spoke of being able to supply a kilo of cocaine for £41,000 and priced kilos of heroin at £21,000 apiece. Another of his deliveries consisted of 27.8g of 55% pure cocaine, worth £2,780.
Following a series of raids targeting the organised crime group, police visited his parents' homes and that of a sibling but were unable to trace him. A public appeal over his whereabouts in 2018 yielded no results, and he remained at large until the early part of this decade.
Gallagher, who was described as having a ""managerial function"", later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine. He accepted having met Raj at Dixy Chicken but said he had done so as he ""went down to rob him"" when he ""came down to buy a kilo of lemo"", and also claimed to have amnesia and memory loss.
Ged Doran, appearing on his behalf on this occasion, said his client's actions were ""fairly unsophisticated"" and that he had ""tried to keep Raj sweet, but failed magnificently"". The defence barrister added: ""The undercover officer Raj very quickly decides and identifies Mr Gallagher is not a serious drug dealer.""
Judge Brian Cummings KC said that Gallagher had been involved in the ""brokering"" of drug deals and played a ""significant role"" in the operation. He was jailed for five years and seven months.
The same court heard last week that Gallagher, of no fixed address, had been serving this sentence at HMP Kirkham in Lancashire when he walked out ""without lawful authority"" on January 13 2022. Having been due for release on licence in December of that year, he ""failed to return to complete his sentence"".
Paul Blasbery, prosecuting, described how he would only be arrested shortly after 5pm on November 29 last year in the Font on Arrad Street in Liverpool city centre. The fugitive made no comment under interview, but gave a prepared statement in which he admitted to detectives that he had absconded shortly after the death of his brother Keith and had been ""struggling to deal with his passing and his mental health"", as well as lockdown measures within the prison.
Gallagher has a total of 12 previous convictions for 30 offences. Rebecca Smith, defending, told the court: ""The defendant impulsively walked out of prison and didn't return."
AIQ48RKIOJ_4N9IGGAHYDLVTE4,Major explosion could cause 'fountains of diamonds' to erupt from the Earth's crust,Graeme MurrayNews Reporter,"08:08, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/major-explosion-could-cause-fountains-31903662,"A major explosion could see ""fountains of diamonds"" erupt from the Earth's crust during a geological event.
Research by Thomas Gernon, a professor of Earth and climate science at the University of Southampton, suggests supercontinents could split and send diamonds flying form the centre of the Earth. The precious stones form 150 kilometres below our feet, but the professor predicts they will be sent skywards by 'kimberlite' eruptions at 133 kilometres an hour sparking enormous explosions on the planet's surface according the the study which is published in the journal Nature.
Gernon and his researchers analysed kimberlites - rock which contains diamonds - and found eruptions regularly happen millions of years later when plates start to pull apart. An example happened around 25 million years after the supercontinent Gondwana started breaking up into what is now Africa and South America.
The pulling apart of the plates leads to rock from the upper mantle and lower crust to mix and flow against each other, causing instability and ultimately leading to the eruptions. This also sees rock, water and carbon dioxide combining with minerals like diamonds. And when they mix they create explosive rushes towards the surface of the Earth. The research team hope their work could help find unexplored diamond deposits.
Gernon said: ""The diamonds have been sat at the base of the continents for hundreds of millions or even billions of years. There must be some stimulus that just drives them suddenly, because these eruptions themselves are really powerful, really explosive.""
The Mirror reported in 2019 how scientists discovered a tiny speck of rock inside a diamond s made from a mineral never before seen on Earth. It is thought to have formed at a depth of about 105 miles below the surface and was retrieved from South Africa's Koffiefontein diamond mine. The opaque, dark green speck of rock inside has an unusual chemical signature, sparking questions about the composition of Earth's mantle. It was named goldschmidtite in honour of the founder of modern geochemistry Victor Moritz Goldschmidt.
Researchers said it offered a unique record of chemistry from a long time ago, inside the deep, ancient parts of the planet. Nicole Meyer, a PHD student from the University of Alberta discovered the mineral. She said: ""Goldschmidtite has high concentrations of niobium, potassium, and the rare earth elements lanthanum and cerium, whereas the rest of the mantle is dominated by other elements, such as magnesium and iron.”
She added: ""For potassium and niobium to constitute a major proportion of this mineral, it must have formed under exceptional processes that concentrated these unusual elements."" The mantle is the thick layer of hot, solid rock between the Earth's crust and its molten iron core. It starts about 20 miles below the surface and is about 1800 miles thick."

Prince William and Kate Middleton 's youngest son was born on April 23, 2018, and the proud new parents named him Louis Arthur Charles. His name is a popular one in the royal family's history and both Prince William and Prince George have it as a middle name, in honour of Prince Charles 's mentor Lord Louis Mountbatten, who died in an IRA bombing in 1979.
The middle name Charles is a tribute to Louis' grandfather, the Prince of Wales. And much like his older siblings, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Louis doesn't have a surname and is formally known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge. However, Louis' HRH title was uncertain thanks to a longstanding rule put in place by King George V. In 1917, he set out guidance on which royals were allowed to have titles. It was decided then that only those closest to the top of the line of succession would be automatically granted titles.
King George V decided that only the sovereign's children would automatically become a Prince or Princess, as well as any grandchildren born through the male line. But great-grandchildren were not included. But Her Majesty, The Queen overturned this for all of William and Kate's children - and f she hadn't made that change, Louis would have been known as Master Louis Cambridge or Master Louis Windsor.
But further rows were sparked when the rule change didn't include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's children, which the Duchess of Sussex revealed in her infamous interview with Oprah Winfrey.
During the 2021 interview, Meghan told the US talk show host: ""They were saying they didn't want him to be a Prince or Princess, which would be different from protocol, and that he wasn't going to receive security. This went on for the last few months of our pregnancy where I was going, hold on for a second. They said [he's not going to get security], because he's not going to be a Prince.
""Okay, well, he needs to be safe so we're not saying don't make him a Prince or Princess, but if you're saying the title is what's going to affect that protection, we haven't created this monster machine around us in terms of clickbait and tabloid fodder you've allowed that to happen which means our son needs to be safe."" But experts have denied Meghan's claims that it was ""different to protocol""."

Indian-owned Tata Steel UK last week confirmed devastating plans to axe up to 2,800 British jobs. Most will go at its Port Talbot plant in South Wales with the closure of its two blast furnaces this year.
The Government is handing Tata £500million of taxpayers’ money to help pay for a new electric arc furnace at the site, but it is not due to be completed until 2027 and will need far fewer workers. Tata complained that it was losing nearly £1.5million a day in the UK. Yet accounts for its Mumbai-based parent company, Tata Steel Limited, show the global business is flying.
It made an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) profit of £3bn last year, analysis by union Unite shows.
Tata gave £1.4bn to shareholders from 2019 to 2023, and had reserves of £1.6bn at the end of the last financial year. Unite chief Sharon Graham said: “Tata’s pleas of poverty have been exposed as a sham. They are making money hand over fist and will only profit from bringing in more Indian and Dutch steel to the UK if we cut capacity.

“It is unbelievable the Government is going along with this. Rather than demanding the investment comes with jobs guarantees, they are giving Tata half a billion of taxpayers’ money to slash its workforce and flood the UK with foreign steel.” Tata Steel said: “As a listed company on the Mumbai stock exchange, our financial results are available on our website.”
Bosses pointed to losses of almost £135m at Tata Steel UK between July and September. That is on top of £162m of losses in the year to last March. Yet in the previous year the business made a £193m profit. Unite claims Tata has invested far less in its UK steel operations than in its European sites.
Tata is owned by Tata Sons, formerly led by Ratan Tata, 86. The empire includes Jaguar Land Rover. The closing of Port Talbot’s blast furnaces is partly to tackle pollution. Tata is pledging over £130m to help workers who will lose their jobs.
The Mirror has been campaigning since 2015 to Save our Steel."

According to palace sources, as Charlotte is the eldest of Princess Diana's granddaughters she'll get first pick when it comes to which heirlooms she inherits, with Lilibet the second of her son's daughters. In 2021, an insider close to both the Cambridges and the Spencers revealed that when charlotte comes of age, the eight-year-old will have ""the pick of the palace jewels.""
The most coveted item - the Spencer Tiara - is currently being looked after by Diana's younger brother, Earl Charles Spencer, who lives at the family's Althorp House. Speaking about the heirloom to GoodToKnow, the royal source claimed: ""William is close with his uncle and has asked if his mother's namesake tiara can be given to Charlotte someday."" They continued: ""William is quite aware the Earl has daughters of his own, but the two have agreed that Diana’s iconic piece belongs to her first granddaughter.""
Meanwhile a second insider also told NewIdea that Charlotte was ""giddy with excitement"" over inheriting the heirloom. They said: ""Lotte [sic] knows all about her 'Granny Diana' – after all, Diana is one of her middle names. She’s also seen pictures of her wearing the tiara. Charlotte is more than aware that she’s a princess, and she’s already got plastic tiaras and gowns to play dress-ups in. It’s very cute.""
The famous Spencer Tiara wore by Diana on her wedding to now-King Charles in 1981 was designed by Garrard in the 1930s, and was forged using other pieces of jewellery the Spencer family owned. Of those, the tiara's heart-shaped centre piece was a wedding gift to Diana's grandmother from Lady Sarah Isabella Spencer - an aunt of the 7th Earl of Spencer.
The tiara was also partly made out of a a wedding gift given in 1919 from Lady Sarah Spencer to Lady Cynthia Hamilton, Diana's grandmother, for her marriage to Viscount Althorp. The jaw dropping headpiece had been in the Spencer family for almost a century before the royal wedding, and had been worn at the weddings of her two older sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes.
As well as the coveted Spencer Tiara, Princess Charlotte is expected to inherit some of the Queen's priceless Crown Jewels. New Idea's royal insider even predicted that the six-year-old will receive the Vladimir Tiara that holds emeralds from the Queen’s grandmother, Queen Mary, which is worth in the region of £10million."

In the late 18th century, Tobermory in the Inner Hebrides emerged as an important port and now takes the crown as the main town on Mull. Tourism chiefs described its buildings as the main draw for visitors. But the small Scottish town rose to fame as the location for the children's series 'Balamory', which was inspired by its attractive features.
Hotels and guesthouses are a short distance from its main street, which presents ample Instagram opportunities because of its colourful seafront. The bustling harbour is busy with fishing and sailing boats, as well as the ferry to and from Kilchoan in Ardnamurchan. It's also a popular wedding location for anyone seeking an alternative venue from the main cities.

It was part of the defeated Armada of 1588, and was fleeing a fleet of English vessels, before choosing to anchor in Tobermory for provisions. But the ship caught fire, and gunpowder exploded after a dispute about a debt. The galleon was said to have been carrying 'millions of gold coins' when she sunk, but any significant treasure has yet to be found.
As the only distillery in Mull, Tobermory Distillery should be on all visitors' lists. Countless restaurants and hotels serve up fresh Mull seafood which would've just been caught by fisherman in the harbour. The Isle of Mull and Iona has also become a wildlife watching haven, and tourist chiefs claimed thousands of visitors visit the area to spot Golden and White-tailed Eagles.
The seas are known to be a vital feeding area for whales, dolphins and basking sharks. And the picture-postcard island capital is a good base for wildlife watching on the Isle of Mull.
Skye and Frisa are the islands' most famous White-tailed Eagles in the world and are used in dozens of TV broadcasts and documentaries. Their re-introduction has been hugely successful, leading to breeding pairs being seen throughout the length and breadth of the island, as well as Tobermory.
Explore Tobermory said: ""A great opportunity exists to come and see the White-tailed Eagles who begin to lay their eggs from early March onwards. Incubation takes place after the first egg is laid and lasts for an average of 38 days. Both sexes share responsibility for sitting on the eggs, although the bulk of the incubation duty is carried out by the female."""

On December 14 Norfolk Police attended the home in Allan Bedford Crescent in relation to a missing persons enquiry. The incident has been referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) due to police contact at the address.
At 6am on Friday, January 19, a man at the address called the police but no officers were deployed at the time. The incident has led to a second referral by the constabulary to the IOPC.
An hour later, at 7am on Friday, a concerned member of the public called the police. Officers attended and forced entry into the home at 7.15am and discovered the bodies of a man, 45, a woman, 36 and two children aged 12 and seven. Police have confirmed the man and two children lived at the address while the woman, although related, was visiting and not a permanent resident at the address.
Formal identification is yet to take place although they have been named locally as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, his daughter Jasmin and her sister whose name is not yet known. The woman’s identity is also unknown currently.
A police cordon also remains in place and a post mortem was due to take place today on the man and woman to establish their causes of death. A post mortem on the children is due for Wednesday.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said: “We’ve spoken to witnesses and neighbours, carried out house-to-house enquiries, examined local CCTV and completed initial scene investigations. As a result of this, we’re not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
“Post-mortem examinations will be carried out tomorrow for the man and woman (Sunday 21 January) and on Wednesday (24 January) for the two girls. While I can confirm all four people were found with injuries, we will not be disclosing any further information until these examinations have taken place and the cause of death has been established.
“This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved and it is clear from the reaction it’s caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community. We’ve had uniformed officers patrolling the area today and these will continue tomorrow.”
Detectives have been carrying out house to house enquiries, speaking with witnesses and are continuing to exam local CCTV footage.Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have been in the Allan Bedford Crescent area earlier this morning and who may have seen or heard anything that could assist our enquiries. Anyone with any information is asked to get in touch via the following channels, quoting crime reference NC-19012024-39."

Roda Osman, 33, claimed she was attacked on September 3 but she has been charged with felony theft by deception - an offence that could lead to up to 10 years in prison.
The men, in a dark car, showed up as Osman's friend was in the front and Osman got in the back with another man. The friend heard Osman yell, ""Why you hit me?"" at one of the guys. There wasn't a fight before, and the friend said she didn't think Osman was actually hit with a brick.
The accused man ran off quickly. Osman went live on Instagram while her friend told her to call the police. On September 19, the police learned from Osman that they started at the O2 Lounge and then went to Liquid Lounge. After leaving, Osman called an Uber but got into the wrong car, thinking it was her ride.
Osman first said the suspect hit her with a brick and named him as Olan Douglas. But then she said the attack happened at Liquid Lounge. Soon after, the police checked CCTV and spotted Douglas.

Despite being accused of theft, Osmal stood her ground on Thursday, insisting the assault did occur. She claimed to The Daily Beast that the Houston police were retaliating against her for pushing for the arrest of the person she says attacked her: ""They're trying to act like there's a quota on how many times you can be assaulted.""
She added: ""It's like you can only be assaulted once every five years. Yes, I was assaulted in 2020, and there's proof of that... They're saying, 'Oh she got attacked in 2020, and now she says she got attacked again, so she must be lying.""
She also said: ""A victim who gets hit over the head shouldn't have to remember all the details. Nobody seems to have any empathy for me. I was assaulted, I was treated for a concussion, I am suffering panic attacks... All that should matter is that a man assaulted me with a deadly weapon.""
Osmal, a doctoral student, maintains her innocence and expressed to Fox News Digital how the accusations have left her ""heartbroken"", adding: ""I'm not guilty...as a person who suffered from a head injury from blunt force trauma and went online five minutes later for my own safety, I'm not obligated to remember every single detail correctly.
""That is unprecedented, and it's dangerous to victim-blame in that way, and to also hold me to a standard that is not legal."" She added, ""I didn't see the weapon he hit me with. [A brick] is what it felt like. And that was the only weapon that I saw when I opened my eyes and I looked up...so that's what I believe the weapon of choice was.""
Three years ago, Osman was reportedly involved in a similar assault, raising a significant amount through GoFundMe. The page set up after last month's alleged attack has since been removed as fraudulent.
Charges have been previously brought against the woman in the Virgin Islands, Minnesota, and Texas. She's currently out on bail for felony assault and domestic violence charges. The Harris County District Attorney's Office is requesting a $50,000 (£40,000) bail for the new theft by deception charge.
GoFundMe's spokesperson stated: ""GoFundMe has zero tolerance for the misuse of our platform and cooperates with law enforcement investigations of those accused of wrongdoing. The fundraiser has been removed from the platform, all donors have been refunded, and Roda Osman has been banned from using the platform for any future fundraisers.""

EKQKI6YWX5_7C4T6QND2QMVEWF,James Cleverly warned not to repeat Suella Braverman mistakes after review backfires,Sophie HuskissonPolitical Correspondent,"18:00, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/james-cleverly-warned-not-repeat-31931466,"James Cleverly must not repeat the same “tropes and terminology” as Suella Braverman, the head of the police racism watchdog has said.
In an interview with the Mirror, Nick Glynn told the Home Secretary to recognise “his words have immense power and influence” as he warned that police officers are “not immune” to being influenced by harmful narratives. He gave the example of Ms Braverman describing illegal migration as an “invasion”, as well as her interference in pro-Palestine protests, which she described as “hate marches”.
“I know what it’s like as a Police Commander to keep the balance right and it’s hard. The Home Secretary’s job should not be making that more difficult for policing,” he said. “They should be being as supportive, or as quiet as appropriate, and to let them get on with treading that very difficult path and keeping that balance.”
It comes as the official police inspectorate warned that top politicians are trying to influence police operations by putting senior officers under pressure earlier this month. The review into “woke” policing was ordered by Ms Braverman as she was concerned about police ""pandering to politically correct causes"". But the review backfired, instead criticising politicians themselves.
Mr Glynn, who is interim-chair of the Independent Scrutiny and Oversight Board (ISOB), is holding police forces accountable to the Police Race Action Plan, which was set up in June 2020 after the murder of George Floyd in the US by a white policeman. Nearly four years on, he criticised a “lack of progress” specifically in relation to the police’s use of power. This can include anything from stop and search and strip searches to the use of pepper spray, handcuffs, tasers or firearms.
He said the Home Office doesn’t give any “direct funding” with all efforts coming from police budgets. “What we do see from the Home Office, and the two previous Home Secretaries, is criticism of things like a Police Race Action Plan and use of terms like ‘woke’ and other similar tropes that are used to denigrate it and to criticise this kind of work and sowing division instead of saying things that recognise that things can be improved and helping things along,” he said. “So hopefully James Cleverly will change that course but we’ll wait and see, I’m not so sure that will happen.”
Gavin Stephens, the head of Britain’s police chiefs, took the unprecedented move to admit he believes policing is “institutionally racist”. Meanwhile Ms Braverman refused to use the term even after an independent report by Dame Louise Casey found “institutional racism, sexism and homophobia in the Met"". The ex-Home Secretary branded it “an ambiguous, contested and politically charged term that is much misused and risks making it harder for officers to win back the trust of communities”.
Mr Glynn said having the Home Office get behind the Police Race Action Plan would help tackle “inconsistent activity and progress” across the 44 different police forces and British Transport Police. “I think if the Home Office funded this work it would add to the strength of the fact this work needs to be done and this work is supported because across 44 police forces, there is varying support for the plan,” he said.
“Some Police Constables have come out and said: ‘Yes, policing is institutionally racist and this is absolutely necessary.’ And other chiefs have said: ‘It doesn’t exist.’ Or other chiefs have said: ‘The terminology is unhelpful.’ So for the Home Office to take the lead from that perspective and back it up with funding I think would help those police forces and communities to see some benefit.”
Asked how he feels about Ms Braverman’s language, including her descriptions of illegal migration as a “hurricane” and an “invasion”, in an interview with the Times in November, Mr Cleverly said: “I’m not focused quite as much on describing it, I’m going to spend time dealing with it. Don’t talk tough, be tough. I am a player on the pitch. It’s not my job to try and think about creative ways of describing a situation. It is my job to deal with a situation.”
A Home Office spokesman said: “The Police Race Action Plan is independently led by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and College of Policing. We have been clear in saying that more needs to be done in policing to ensure everyone is treated fairly and without prejudice, regardless of their race or background.
“Following the recruitment of 20,000 additional officers in England and Wales, we now have the most diverse police force in history and we will be introducing additional safeguards on suspicionless stop and search to strengthen the trust between the police and local communities.”"

CCTV footage from inside the shop, in Santiago, Chile, showed the thief trying to leave the shop with a bag full of stolen goodies. But his escape route was blocked by a stubborn security guard, who quickly wheeled some trollies in between them to stop the shoplifter escaping.
Just as it looked like the thief might've found a way through the blockade, a worker appears out of nowhere, and casually threw a Coca-Cola bottle toward the shoplifter from several yards away. The footage showed the bottle smashing the crook on the side of the head, causing him to faceplant straight onto the floor.
The security guard then grabbed his chance and apprehended the man on while he was on the floor. He was reportedly later turned over to the authorities. Several people were quick to congratulate the shop worker for his tremendous aim.
Diego commented: “He even saved the bottle, it didn’t break. Everything went perfectly.” Felipe wrote: “The best Coca-Cola advert. Give him his award,"" while Ramón added: “That guy is good for the big leagues.”
Meanwhile, a brave shopper managed to foil a shoplifters raid on a Boots by wrestling him to the floor and sitting on him, back in 2016. Former boxer Kenny weighs 16 stone, and spent five minutes battling the 36-year-old thief.
Kenny said: “I grabbed him and threw him to the floor and all these products starting falling out of his coat, electric tooth brushes and razors.
“I’m 16-stone and a pretty hefty fellow. If somebody looks at me they know not to mess with me. I threw him down and just sat on him. He was trying to break free, punching my arm and smacking my chest. I kept telling him ‘you’re not getting away!’”"

The Australian actress, 31, and Welsh actor Ioan, 50, announced their engagement on Saturday night, just over seven months on from the Titanic star being declared legally divorced from his first wife Alice Evans.
Bianca and Ioan, who began dating shortly after his bitter split from Alice, both shared a joint post on Instagram, with a snap revealing Bianca's new engagement ring. ""The most precious thing happened…"" the newly-engaged couple captioned the shot as they shared their happy news with fans.
Speaking in April last year, Bianca gave a glimpse inside their romance and admitted the Fantastic Four actor had been ""her rock"" since she told him about her multiple sclerosis diagnosis.
Bianca, who most recently appeared in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis, was told by doctors she had MS at the age of 25 in October 2018, previously explaining the diagnosis was ""very aggressive in nature, it came on hard and fast. I was at work in accounting and I tried to pick up a pen and I couldn't.""
The NHS described MS as ""condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance."" Bianca told fans in 2022 how she currently suffers with occasionally going blind in one eye and has nerve damage along the right side of her body.
""There was an initial shock, I can't really describe how I felt, I've never been able to put it into words, this is why I haven't spoken about it in the last three years as I don't quite know what to say,"" Bianca said of her diagnosis when speaking with her Instagram followers in 2022.
She went on to add: ""It has been the most confronting this to be dealt in life. It's not something a 25 year old would have ever expected. I then put the pen in my other hand to try to write and I just couldn't. 'I was sent to the emergency room and from there everything changed. Within the next few weeks I couldn't walk anymore, the entire right side of my body was completed whacked out. I had to start a journey I wasn't ready for. You're never ready for a diagnosis like this.
In a piece for The Telegraph in April last year, Bianca shared that she told her now-fiance Ioan, or 'Yo' as she calls him, about her MS and even gave him a ""get out of jail free"" card if it was too much for him. Recalling telling her future husband about her health condition, Bianca wrote: ""Yo (Ioan) didn't hesitate for a second, listing all of the reasons he was in love with me and why he was here to stay, and that no MS diagnosis or scary future would deter him.""
Continue to discuss her relationship and how Ioan comforts her during health battles, Bianca also mentioned: ""When things are hard I sob to Yo about not feeling strong enough to face what is ahead of me, alongside the guilt I feel that he has entered into such a complicated journey.""
Newly-engaged couple Bianca and Ioan first announced their relationship on Instagram in October 2021, with Ioan filing for divorce from his wife of 14 years Alice, citing ""irreconcilable differences"". Ioan and Alice met on the set of 102 Dalmatians in 2000 and tied the knot seven years later in Mexico. They have two daughters; Ella, 12, and Elise, 8, but split after 13 years of marriage in January 2021. A messy divorce followed, with the former couple finally declared legally divorced last year.

Carlos Gu has been competing on the BBC show since he joined in 2022. The 31-year-old was welcomed onto the series alongside Vito Coppola, Lauren Oakley and Michelle Tsiakkas. He was paired with Molly Rainford for his first series where they made it through to the final. They ended as runners-up and Carlos returned for the 2023 series.
The professional dancer was paired with TV presenter Angela Scanlon, but they were voted out in week 10. Carlos and Angela were full of emotion as they exited the show, but have recently reunited for the Strictly Come Dancing tour. As the latest series came to a close, Carlos has revealed if he will be making a comeback to Strictly later this year.
He told The Mirror: ""Fingers crossed, you know. I hope I will."" Angela urged: ""Yes he will, come on!"" Carlos left fans heartbroken after he performed the Argentine Tango to Back To Black by Amy Winehouse during his time with Angela on the show. The duo left the judges seriously impressed, scoring an incredible three 10s and one 8, totalling 38 points.
Carlos and Angela, 39, spoke to host Claudia Winkleman, where Carlos broke down in tears. The emotional professional dancer said: ""I'm so proud of her! I'm so happy the judges gave the comment to her like that, she's been down actually quite a few weeks and that, I'm just really happy"" to which a touched Angela wiped his tears away.
The duo then received their 38 points score to which Carlos broke down in tears again with Claudia insisting: ""No, I don't want you to cry!"" with Carlos admitting: ""I'm not, I'm tears of happiness!"" While both Angela and Carlos were left in tears as they were eliminated after their Cha Cha to ‘I Will Survive’ by Gloria Gaynor.
Speaking about her exit Angela said at the time: ""It’s been honestly incredible, I’m gutted, really gutted that it’s finished now, but it has been the most wonderful experience."" She added that Carlos had ""supported me and picked me up and made me laugh so much"" and claimed that he is ""such an incredible guy.""
The couple took to the dancefloor for the final time, but it seemed as though it was too much for Carlos who was visibly upset. When Angela pulled him into an embrace Carlos had to let go of her hand to wipe away his tears. Fans noticed his tears and they soon ran to social media to express their upset. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, one person said: ""Carlos spinning through his tears has ended me."" Another person commented: ""Angela and Carlos, what a lovely partnership. Carlos crying while dancing has broken me."" A third viewer said: ""No you're not allowed to make Carlos cry. group hug immediately!""

The 31-year-old, who rose to fame on the fourth series of the ITV2 programme. Jack won the ITV2 dating show in 2018 with then-girlfriend Dani Dyer, and the couple split the £50,000 cash prize after they were crowned winners. In the last year, he hit headlines after he was involved in a series of arrests for driving under the influence of drugs.
He recently completed a secret stint in rehab to get his life back under control. The reality star was given a 36-month driving ban and given 60 hours of community service in October 2023 after admitting two counts of drug driving. He later revealed he had a “purpose” again after getting his life back on track.
And now, Jack was pictured completing his community service at a Sue Ryder shop in Kent. In pictures obtained by The Sun, the star was smiling at customers while working behind the till of the charity shop, where he works between 9.30am and 4pm.
A passerby had positive things to say about the TV personality and told The Sun : ""I walked by a few times throughout the day and saw him sitting down with a cup of tea quite a bit. He was friendly and smiley and chatting with customers."" In pictures obtained by the publication, Jack looked relaxed as he rocked a £135 Fila tracksuit.
While leaving the store, he also wore an £845 coat, a £30 Hugo Boss hat, a £1,930 Louis Vuitton holdall and a £509 Gucci bag. In November, it was revealed Jack returned to selling pens, with him admitting he had ""never been happier"". Before appearing on Love Island, the star worked at AJ Office Supplies in London selling pens.
Years later, he made the decision to return to his roots after confessing he’s been on a downward spiral since he shot to stardom more than four years ago. The star said he's working as an account manager, dealing with big-name clients, and said he was in the process of “building myself up”. He added: “I'm trying to get myself back on top.”
Jack said it was “amazing” being back working with the same people he knew when he was 17 at AJ Office Supplies, and now, he’s “excited for the future”. He candidly revealed he was “worried about people thinking I’m a failure”, and hopes to get back into TV one day in the future. “I want to have one of the biggest stationary companies in the whole of the UK one day,” he gleefully shared.

The Pitch Perfect actress, 43, uses her social media to share updates about her health and lifestyle. During the pandemic, she talked about her 'year of health' and wowed fans when she showed off the results of her lifestyle overhaul, which saw her sharing her workouts and healthy meals.
Earlier this week, the Australian star posted a boomerang of herself in a jacuzzi as she told fans: ""Working really hard has meant that, coz of all the stress, I’ve gained 14kg’s (30 pounds)! It makes me feel bad about myself…it shouldn’t…but it does. I’m really proud of the work I’ve been doing on new movies and my memoir, it’s just been a LOT and I’ve lost focus on my healthy lifestyle.
""Anyone else going through the same thing? (Update: I woke up this morning and read all your comments - they bring a tear to my eye. Thanks, everyone!""
Fans immediately rushed to the comment section to share positive messages. After reading some of the comments, she took to her Instagram Stories to post a screenshot of one of the lovely messages she received from a fan. The message read: ""Your body is the least interesting thing about you! Don't be so hard on yourself. From a fellow fatty.""
Rebel responded to it with: ""Love messages like this, thank you."" Other followers also shared words of wisdom, with one user saying: ""Losing weight is the easy bit… keeping it off is the biggest battle."" Another posted: ""You are great and you look even better. Don’t let the doubt in. See you soon Wonder Woman.""
A few years ago, Rebel underwent a massive health kick in her life that saw her shed a whopping 5.5 stone. After shedding the weight, Rebel gushed over how the transformation left her feeling ""so much healthier"". Speaking on the Life Uncut podcast in January 2022, Rebel said she been a ""normal size"" when she was younger, but in her twenties gained weight after she was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome).
She then went on to add that most comedians ""often have something physical about them that's abnormal"" – which is why they take up comedy. ""Those people tend to go better in comedy,"" she said, ""so I turned what was turned into a lot of agents as a disadvantage into my advantage.""

Michael Small, known as Craig was brutally murdered by masked men outside a chicken shop on Harrow Road, Wembley. As Craig stood outside waiting for his meal, at around 8.10pm on Friday July 5 2019, a masked man ran along the pavement towards him.
The man was less than a metre from Craig when he fired the fatal bullet. A second bullet was fired as Craig collapsed to the floor, narrowly missing him, MyLondon reports. Craig was pronounced dead in hospital at 9pm. He was 32 years old. Detective Superintendent Helen Rance, from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command who led the investigation said: “Craig’s murder was the tragic culmination of a series of reprisal attacks linked to gang activity.
“Craig was targeted, his murder planned and brutally carried out in the streets of Wembley. Craig’s death is thoroughly senseless and serves as a tragic reminder of the utter futility of gang violence – it achieves nothing other than devastating families and unleashing more violence on London’s streets.”
After the shooting, eyewitness accounts given to police reported seeing the gunman run around the corner and get into a waiting car. Detectives later learned it was Courtney Ellis waiting in the driver’s seat of a blue Mini using false registration plates.
Immediately after killing Craig, Ellis and the gunman drove to Bridge Road in Wembley. At the location, the gunman attempted to fire at the windscreen of a parked white Mercedes toward the intended victim. CCTV recovered by detectives showed that the gun failed to fire.
Detectives spent hours analysing CCTV footage to track the journey of a Mini that eyewitnesses had reported seeing the gunman get into after shooting Craig.
It was subsequently tracked to key locations. The sun visors of both driver and passenger were lowered in an attempt to hide their identities. Detectives identified a number of unregistered phones used by Ellis and Kyei in the lead-up to Craig’s murder.
Police examined the phones and laptops recovered from their home addresses which were used to establish a longstanding relationship between Ellis and Kyei. Photos, voice notes, and WhatsApp messages confirmed the link between the men as well as references to previous episodes of violence. When questioned by detectives, Ellis and Kyei denied any involvement in the murder.
Craig’s mother, Carol Campbell said: “Not a minute goes by where Craig is still not at the forefront of our minds. His murder has totally destroyed what’s left of us as a family. Craig was a father of three young children and his loss to us all is immeasurable. A caring and kind man taken from us all with no justification. That fact is a burden we will have to carry until the day we die.
“We will never truly move on from what happened to Craig but would like to take a moment to thank the investigation team who have worked tirelessly to secure justice for Craig. I’d particularly like to mention Detective Superintendent Helen Rance and Detective Sergeant Terry Goodsman who both went above and beyond in this investigation for us, as well as Detective Constable Chris Lipson, our original Family Liaison officer. The three of them showed me that not all police officers are the same.”
Det Supt Rance continued: “It has been a long road to get to today’s verdict. Craig’s family have had to endure two trials and I can underestimate the immense difficulty they have been through over the past four years. They remained dignified but are utterly broken and devastated by his death.
“Over the course of this investigation, mobile phone data was key to establishing the movement of these two men both on the day Craig was murdered and their actions over the following days. There was significant planning that went into this attack, which officers were able to unpick with careful viewing of CCTV and connecting this to mobile data to prove to the jury these men were responsible for the planning, carrying out and careful disposal of the vehicle used in Craig’s shooting.”
“One key thing that we have not been able to overcome is the wall of silence about the identity of the gunman. Given the level of planning that went into Craig’s murder, the gunman’s identity will be known to others however so far there has been steadfast refusal to share this with police. If you have any information to identify him, please speak to police, or anonymously via to Crimestoppers to help us find the person responsible for firing the bullet that killed Craig.”
Following a nine- week trial at the Old Bailey, which started on October 17 2023, Courtney Ellis, 38 (19.02.85) of Mafeking Avenue, Brentford, was found guilty of the murder of Michael Small, known as Craig, in an apparent escalation of gang tensions.
He was also found guilty of attempted murder of a different man and perverting the course of justice.
Christopher Kyei, 37 (11.11.86) of Lower Road, Chorleywood, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice at the same trial. Both will be sentenced at the same court on February 2.
If you have any information that could help police please call 101 and give CAD 9128/5 July 2019 or Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111."

Angela Rogers thought she had found true love with Mohamed Ibrahim, who made worldwide headlines when he married Iris. But their relationship – which began weeks after Mohamed’s split from Iris – quickly soured when she found he had been messaging a widow aged 69.
Mum-of-11 Angela, 61, admitted splurging £5,000 on their romance after Mohamed, more than 22 years her junior, wooed her with supermarket flowers before they had “the best sex ever”. She said he pestered her for cash to finalise his divorce from Iris and proposed twice – without buying a ring.
But Angela kicked the chancer out when she discovered he had been messaging another woman. She says: “He’s a freeloader who clearly has a thing about older women. I don’t want to see him hurting anyone else.”
Divorcée Iris stunned This Morning viewers in 2021, sharing graphic details about her sex life with Mohamed. The pair married in November 2020 after meeting through Facebook the previous year but spent two years apart before he got a UK visa.
After splitting last July, Mohamed, from Cairo, moved out of Iris’s bungalow in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Within weeks he was courting Angela, who had befriended him two years earlier – also on Facebook – after reading his story. She says: “I knew he was the Egyptian toyboy. I did think what was a 37-year-old doing with an 83-year-old?”
After realising he and Iris had split, Angela contacted Mohamed to say she hoped he was OK. She reveals: “Next thing he’s asking to video call me. I sent him my number and he called me from a pub. He said he was depressed and lonely. He kept telling me I was beautiful and asking if we could meet. I thought as we’d been talking on Facebook for two years then it wasn’t like he was a complete stranger. I realise that seems stupid now. So I told him I had a spare room and he could come and visit. I’d been single for 14 years. He’s the biggest mistake I ever made.”
They met in person when Mohamed travelled 225 miles by train from Somerset to Angela’s home in Leeds. She says: “When we met he picked me up and swung me round. He was shouting, ‘My Queen, my girl, my girl’. I’m quite a shy person, the station was really busy and everyone was looking. Then he asked me to hold his cigarette while he went into Marks & Spencer. He came out with 24 white roses and a carton of mixed grapes for me. It was lovely.” Back at her flat she rustled up spaghetti bolognese and they watched a movie before she showed him the spare room. But that wasn’t where he stayed. “I’m ashamed to say, for some reason, he ended up in my bed,” she admits.
Mohamed returned home the next day – but kept calling. Blushing, Angela says: “He was telling me I was beautiful and then he said we’d had the best sex he’d ever had in his life.” After five weeks of visits, Mohamed got down on one knee and proposed on a footbridge over the A64 York Road in Leeds.
Angela said: “He didn’t have a ring, but he still asked me to marry him. I said no. He seemed upset and asked why. I said because we hadn’t been together that long. He’s also still married to Iris.” Besotted Angela moved into a flat with Mohamed after a couple of months – for which she says she paid £1,800 for new furniture.
She adds: “He never seemed to put his hand in his pocket. If we had fish and chips, I’d pay. We went for a day out to Scarborough and I paid £37 for our Sunday dinner. He didn’t even buy his own cigs. I bought him clothes, trainers, aftershave. I paid his bus fares and for his meals. I didn’t want to say anything. I’m too soft for my own good.”
She said he also asked her for £800 so he could pay for his divorce from Iris – but she refused. When he proposed again in October, Angela said yes – although Mohamed still had not bought a ring. She said: “He kept telling me he loved me. He could be so charming. He was very convincing – I believed every word he said. When we went out, he’d hold my hand. I liked the way he treated me.”
As the relationship continued, she packed her fiancé sandwiches to take to his job at Iceland as a security guard and the pair video-called his family in Egypt. Angela says: “They were all telling me they loved me and I was beautiful.”
Meanwhile, Angela claims, Mohamed kept borrowing money, saying he’d pay her back. At one point she gave him £550, she says, after he told her his dad was seriously ill in Egypt and he needed to visit him.
A couple of days later, Mohamed rang late at night. She says: “He said it was good news – the doctor had called and his dad had made a miracle recovery.” He returned sooner than expected and repaid £300 but in November her bubble burst when she got a Facebook message from another woman after posting a photo of her and her beloved.
She reveals: “It said something like, ‘WTF, why are you in a picture with Mohamed?’ I replied saying, ‘Because we’re together’. She told me he’d been messaging her. It looks like his hobby is messaging older women. She was a 69-year-old widow.”
Angela confronted Mohamed, who, she claims, became angry. She says: “He was saying ‘Why are you putting pictures of me on Facebook’. He was shouting, swearing. I felt upset, disgusted, heartbroken.” Eventually, she told Mohamed she wanted him to leave. When he kept calling, she blocked his number.
Angela says: “One day I asked him to tell me the truth. Why did he marry an 83-year-old woman? Did he love her or did he want a visa? He put his fingers down his throat and made a gagging noise. He said he’d been in the UK with Iris for two weeks before he found out she had false teeth. He used her like he used me.” After Angela’s split, she messaged Iris, who she says is “really nice”.
Angela fears Mohamed – who she says is now working as a welder – is using women in the UK as he desperately wants to extend his visa, which runs out this June.
She adds: “I was really upset but I’m healed now and I’m going to stay single. I’m speaking because I don’t want any more ladies to fall for his lies. He’ll do anything to get his visa renewed. I hope and pray he gets deported back to Cairo so no other pensioner can be conned by him.”
This week, Mohamed declined to address the accusations. He said he had been renting a room, claiming Angela was trying to gain fame in his name. In a video on social media he said he had shared a house with her in Leeds. He said in one clip: “I moved to the north after I separated with this woman for a few weeks. But I’m back again in my area.”
In another he urged women who follow him on social media to “leave me alone”. He said: “Some idiots, some trollers want to be famous on my back. This message is for all women and girls who follow me. Leave me alone.”"
JOEYSNLJUW_7XW1TKR3UCAKT6Y,Donald Trump 'honored' as Ron DeSantis drops out of 2024 race and endorses him,Yelena MandenbergNews Reporter,"23:01, 21 Jan 2024Updated23:16, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-honored-ron-desantis-31935108,"Donald Trump said he's ""honored"" after Ron DeSantis backed him when he quit the 2024 Presidential Race.
Just an hour after DeSantis left, leaving Trump and Nikki Haley to fight it out, Trump, who didn't like DeSantis and spent loads to beat him, said he was ""honored"" that DeSantis supported him when he left the race.
Trump's team said: ""With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump's victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates.""
They also said: ""It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.""

Even though Trump often calls DeSantis 'DeSanctimonious,' he took the high road and accepted the support nicely - for now.
When asked if he thought he'd win after DeSantis dropped out, Trump just shrugged and smiled while everyone cheered 'USA! USA!'
DeSantis shared a video saying he's done with his campaign but even though he and Trump don't always agree, Trump would be better than Joe Biden.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis shared on X, previously known as Twitter.
Earlier, it seemed like Trump had foreseen his rival's departure in a post on Truth Social. ""I should get 100% of the vote because it is a CAUCUS,"" Trump penned, before using the chance to criticise his opponents. ""After looking at the Polls, Ron and Nikki both dropped out. Then, off to South Carolina, where we will WIN BIG!""
Trump's messages can sometimes be hard to understand. He was suggesting that DeSantis and Haley would quit after the next primary - which almost came true when DeSantis announced he'd be leaving before the New Hampshire primary, backing Trump instead.
DeSantis was always trailing behind Trump in the polls, but his hopes were likely dashed after the Iowa caucus. After coming third, DeSantis chose to skip campaigning in New Hampshire and head to South Carolina - but things didn't go as planned.
Despite the effort and campaign in South Carolina, their main political leaders have already endorsed Trump, well ahead of their primary.
On Saturday, McMaster and Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette were among the South Carolina leaders heading to New Hampshire to appear with Trump at a rally there. Sen. Tim Scott, another South Carolinian, endorsed Trump at a New Hampshire event on Friday night.
Between the money spent by Trump's campaign and earning the nickname 'DeSanctimonious' - his opponent's attacks seem to have derailed the once intimidating politician.

The popular ITV star, 61, took to social media to reveal she was left 'terrified' that something was really wrong after she suddenly lost all hearing in her right ear 'minutes' before she went live on on air on Friday's instalment of Loose Women
Explaing her health scare on Instagram, Kaye said: ""I was absolutely terrified, I thought, 'Oh my god, what has gone wrong? On Friday when I was doing Loose Women, minutes before we went in air, my right ear just went dead. I put my earpiece in, there was no sound I couldn't hear a thing.""
Kaye pushed through the show, not mentioning her health scare to viewers but became increasingly worried when she got home to Glasgow and her hearing still had not returned.
The Loose Women star explained that as she became more concerned, she started to google her symptoms after losing all hearing in one ear so suddenly. Kaye went to sleep but woke up the next morning and went straight to the hospital where she was looked after by the 'dedicated' nurses.
Kaye explained she was then sent for an audiogram at a nearby Boots hearing centre. However, she was left utterly mortified when she discovered the reason behind her sudden hearing loss. The TV star revealed that the audiologist pulled out a huge lump of wax, which was affecting her hearing.
""I mean I am embarrassed to say this because, honestly, my head was going to some terrible terrible tumour, I am very melodramatic,"" Kaye told her followers. ""Paula pulled out the biggest bit of wax you have ever seen.""
Thankfully, the TV star has nothing to worry about, and her hearing came back immediately after undergoing to process.

KEOMIH2R5W_7SQHP0PLRCUMNR9,'I thought my symptoms were too much coffee but truth was far worse',Neil Shaw,"13:56, 21 Jan 2024Updated14:01, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-diagnosed-rare-chronic-condition-31931921,"A woman who thought her shaking hands were due to too much coffee was left stunned when she was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND).
Nicola McFarlane first noticed symptoms in 2022 after getting a tingling, shaking feeling throughout her body. She also had a slight loss of function in her hands when they were cold. The 47-year-old had started a new job at the time so put the changes down to the extra stress and drinking more coffee.
But in 2023 she began to notice a significant loss of strength in her hands and so sought medical attention. Neurologists nearly immediately diagnosed her with MND. Nicola said: ""I went to the doctor because I'd started to notice muscle wastage in my hands and of course, I'd done some Googling. I was having trouble with fine motor skills. I also noticed that when I was in bed and trying to fall asleep, I'd notice tingles all over my body.
""At the time, I put it down to having just started a new job and drinking too much coffee. I got referred to neurology within two weeks and they diagnosed me with MND in ten minutes.
""It was like getting hit by a train. There's not really anything that can prepare you for being told you have MND. Motor neurone disease, or MND, is a rare condition that damages the nervous system over time, resulting in difficulties walking, speaking and breathing as the condition progresses.""
Nicola, a passionate horse rider and nature enthusiast, found it hard to come to terms with her diagnosis and the changes it would bring to her life. She found solace in the My Nam5's Doddie Foundation a charity set up by Scottish rugby star and MND patient George ""Doddie"" Weir.
Doddie shared his diagnosis in 2017 and established his charity that same year. The main goal of the organisation is to fund research into the disease, hoping to eventually find a cure. Despite Doddie's death in 2022, his charity's work and his dream of eradicating the disease continue to inspire many, including Nicola.
""After my diagnosis, I was in a very dark place, but thinking of Doddie and everything he achieved helped lift me out of it. It wasn't until a month or so after I was diagnosed, I read a quote from Doddie Weir, which said 'this is the hand of cards I've been dealt and I've just got to crack on with it,'"" Nicola said.
""That really resonated with me. I think that his attitude and achievements, even with the mental and physical impact of the disease, gave me a lot of strength. I drew huge amounts of inspiration from Doddie. When he was diagnosed, his attitude was: why isn't there a treatment or a cure?""
""When you do have MND, you just want some hope of treatment.""
Nicola is teaming up with the My Nam5's Doddie Foundation to share her story and encourage people to join in the charity's annual Doddie Aid fundraising event. The campaign invites people all over the UK to sign up via the Doddie Aid app and log as many miles as they can, whether it's running, jumping, swimming or even walking the dog.
In the past two years, the event has raised over £4 million through more than 8 million miles, with profits going towards research for a cure for MND - a cause that Nicola says gives her strength on tough days. ""When I was diagnosed, I really didn't know if I'd still be alive by Christmas,"" she confessed.
""I'm still alive and very grateful that I still have independence and that I'm living my life. There's a lack of awareness about the disease and it's been underfunded - but this is a primarily research focused charity, and that gave me some hope.""
She also addressed a common misconception about the disease. ""There seems to be a misconception that only old people get MND. It does seem to be more common in older men, but women absolutely get it and it's not as rare as people think,"" she added.
""It's seen as rare because people tend to die quite quickly when they get it. I think social media is full of images of people in their last stages of MND but when you're first diagnosed, you're not at that stage. You've still got time, although it varies.
""I think that I have quality of life I'm still working full-time and I'm not ready for palliative care, although that will come. I try and take one day at a time, and not look too far into the future, because I'll just get massively overwhelmed and terrified.
""It is a disease marked by loss. My whole life revolved around horse-riding, camping, wild swimming, being outdoors and being active. It's about adaptation and finding things that you can still do and enjoy. It's very difficult.
""Some days are a lot harder than others to be present and not be overwhelmed by thoughts of the future. When people with MND are diagnosed, they're told there's no treatment and no hope. Without people getting involved, donating, and raising awareness, there won't be money for clinical trials.""
Nicola is determined to continue raising awareness about MND, with the support of her friends and partner Paul van Baardwijk. Paul Thompson, director of fundraising at My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, added: ""The outpouring of emotion and support since Nicola told her story to help launch this year's Doddie Aid has been something to behold. She reminds us all why we are doing this.""
""Doddie dedicated his final years to pushing forward the MND cause, and we owe it to him, Nicola, and everybody living with the disease to continue his legacy and not stop until we live in a world free of MND.
""Doddie Aid is off to an amazing start this year, and the wave of support from the general public as well as some of the most famous names in the world is nothing short of inspiring. It shows Doddie's enduring impact and the strength of will he ignited in the public to help in our mission to rid the world of MND.""
""The money raised from Doddie Aid goes towards research into effective treatments that may one day lead to a cure for MND. There's still plenty of time to sign up for this year's event, and everybody who does is playing a part in securing Doddie's legacy. Signing up for Doddie Aid is still the best way to do your bit for Doddie.""

The gruesome-looking beast was found lying among the vegetation in an advanced state of decomposition. It appears to have four limbs, an elongated head, and a row of sharp teeth. The beast’s remains were found washed up on Pico de Oro Beach, located southwest of Cancun in Mexico and the dead critter also seems to have had a coat of fur.
Its remains were found washed up on a beach south west of Cancun in Mexico. A team of astonished fishermen found the dead creature and images of the corpse were widely shared on social media, sparking fear among locals. But experts have since calmed concerns after they pointed out the decomposing animal has all the characteristics of a seal.
The men who found the body also said that they believed the rotting life form was a pinniped. It is unclear if the local authorities arrived to remove the carcass from the popular beach or whether they took samples to confirm the species and its exact cause of death.
In 2006, a weird sea creature left locals baffled after it washed up on the shore of a beach in the same country. The odd-looking 'animal' was discovered on passers-by on Bonfil Beach in Acapulco. It was around 13 feet long and confused beach-goers. The speculation about what it was led to some bizarre theories, and locals flocked to the beach to take a closer look
The strange creature was poked with sticks as locals lifted up huge flaps of saggy skin and seemed to make holes in its body. Authorities admitted that they didn't know what the discovery was, but said it didn't have a 'bad smell', which would suggest decay. Rosa Camacho, co-ordinator of the Civil Guard and Fire Brigade said: ""We have no idea what type of animal this is, but I do know that it does not smell bad or have a fetid aroma.""
It was suggested that the creature was a giant squid or a whale, and others even suggested it was an alien from the sea. Authorities were baffled by its appearance and could not say what it actually was.
In another strange discovery, a beachgoer was left puzzling over an 'alien-like' sea creature that was washed up on the shore in Australia. The man was enjoying a day out at Dundee Beach near Darwin, when he noticed the bright blue sea animal in the sand. A picture, posted on Reddit by user 'im_peterrific', shows the bizarre life form with short, glossy tentacles and a shiny centre which could be compared to a disco ball."
KUV3P0AE8S_NM9SN265267XMTY,Military experts reveal 3 things Europe must do immediately to stop Putin starting WW3,Milo BoydTravel Reporter,"11:50, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/military-experts-reveal-3-things-31931306,"Military experts have suggested three things Europe could do to bring about the defeat of Russia.
As the war in Ukraine approaches its third year, with an unknown but huge number of civilians and soldiers having lost their lives, the question of how to bring the conflict to an end remains a live one. The two countries' forces appear locked in a stalemate after a counter-offensive by Ukrainian soldiers failed to truly break through Russian lines and as both sides continue to make drone and missile strikes on the others' territory.
While the horror and human cost of the war may be further from the minds of those in the West after an attritional and miserable two years of fighting, it is a daily hell for those who live close to the front lines in Eastern Ukraine.
Military analysts have given their insights into how European countries might help Ukraine defeat the Russian forces, stopping dictator Vladimir Putin from enacting further offensives that could lead to the break out of a third world war. The experts offered three militaristic solutions: Strengthening NATO, increasing funding to Ukraine and shoring up cyber forces.
General Sir Richard Barrons, former Joint Forces chief, has warned that Putin poses ""the biggest risk to our security"" in the UK. This week Admiral Rob Bauer, who chairs the bloc's Military Committee, said people should get ready for conscription within the next two decades in NATO countries.
Many NATO nations, although not directly involved in the war, are supplying Kyiv with non-lethal support but also weapons, ammunition, warplanes and tanks. Countries such as the UK and the US have been actively involved in helping to train Ukraine’s troops.
In the months before Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022, NATO began beefing up security on its eastern flank with Russia and Ukraine. This will be the alliance's biggest build up since the Cold War and it is aimed at deterring Russia from targeting a member country.
In total, NATO's combined armies make up more than 3.3 million military personnel and a budget of almost £1 trillion. General Barrons argues this is not enough and that more money should be spent by member states to bolster the force and act as a block to Russian soldiers if they continue West.
He told the Sun that Putin's military will ""turn to face NATO when they aren't quite so focused on Ukraine"", adding: ""This is why countries like Estonia, which has been very generous, argue that if every European country provided 0.5 per cent of GDP to Ukraine, it would easily overmatch Russia."" General Barrons said Ukraine needed £50billion in external funding a year to continue fighting.
Estonian colonel Andrus Merilo said that every country was at risk from the Russian military if Putin's forces are not stopped in Ukraine. British tank commander Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said the leader thought of himself as a modern Peter the Great and would continue surging Westward if not stopped.
General Barrons has argued that Ukraine needs more weapons from the West if it is going to defeat Russia rather than just keep the forces at bay.
""For Ukraine to defeat its much larger opponent it has to acquire the military capability to defeat it on the battlefield. This includes striking into Russia,"" he said.
This week UK PM Rishi Sunak announced another £2.5billion in aid for Ukraine, which will help to fund long range missiles, ammunition and an air defence system.
General Barrons argued the EU could give more to Ukraine, while the country's biggest backer by far - the US - may be unable to keep up its support as Democrat and Republican lawmakers find themselves at loggerheads over the issue.
With Russia having tripled its defence spending this year, the military man argued the UK should similarly bump up its forces. Last week Foreign Secretary Grant Shapps said the world was in a ""pre-war"" stage and that British forces would be bolstered. He said that the UK plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of our GDP when it's affordable.
General Barrons said Russian expansionism is the ""biggest risk to our security"" and that military spending by the UK and other NATO countries should reflect this. Colonel Bretton-Gordon said ammo stocks in the West needed to be increased after two years in which supplying Ukraine has diminished supplies significantly.
The UK has been the victim of a number of cyber attacks by hacking groups linked to the Russian state in recent years. Whether personal data hacks on the NHS or widespread propaganda efforts online, the sophisticated form of cyber warfare has had a real impact on Britain.
General Barrons argued that cyber security defences needed to be bolstered, to protect British infrastructure and to stop the corrosive impact of mistruth online. He warned that democracies with free presses were easier to undermine and damage the social fabric of than nations where information is more tightly controlled.
""We are dealing with a toxic mix of new threats that can manifest in new, very harmful ways: missiles, cyber, AI-run weapon systems, and drones,"" he said."
LD0EP135KF_AUD7VBMEKRH8CQQ,Mum rushes off to do the school run and realises she left her kids at home,Niamh KirkLifestyle Writer,"10:00, 21 Jan 2024Updated10:16, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/mum-rushes-school-run-realises-31913773,"Every parent will know the stress of the school run each morning, making sure your child has remembered everything from their homework to their lunch - so it's not unusual to forget a thing here and there.
While parents do their best to try and help them get to school on time, one mum couldn't believe when she did the school run, and forgot the most important thing - her children. She looked back and realised the passenger seats were empty, and was driving to the school, without her children, and hilariously shared her error in a video. As she was in hysterics, the mum said: ""I'm driving to school without my kids. I'm taking the kids to school and I don't even have them in the car.""
""I have to go back and pick them up. I can't believe I left my kids,"" she said and added: ""I got in the car and left. Oh my god I'm such an idiot, I was half asleep this morning. Where are my kids?""
It seemed as if she was in autopilot that one morning as she admitted she was ""half asleep"" and didn't realise she'd left her children behind. The mum, thought to be from the US, turned around to head home and found her two boys stood outside the house waiting for her, with one of them asking: ""You went all the way?"", as reported by The Sun in 2020.
The clip was reposted on Twitter, with the caption 'She really drove her kids to school but her kids weren't in the car I can't stop laughing', racking up more than three million views. It tickled many others, as one replied: ""She said hmm you guys are pretty quiet this morning,"" while a second wrote: ""The definition of 'I'm leaving in 5 minutes, with or without you'.""
A third said ""When you be on autopilot..it's ridiculous the s*** you miss lmaoo,"" and another added: ""I like that you can tell that this isn't staged! She's a real mom who was real tired who real life just got in and started driving. Hope she had a good rest of her day.""

Footage apparently showing the crash site, with wreckage on a snowfield, was broadcast on Russian state and independent media.
It is feared that six people who were aboard have been killed in the crash. Two Russian passengers - one male, one female - were aboard the plane, along with four crew members, say reports. The aircraft is believed to have been operating as an air ambulance, and two of the crew were paramedics.
The AviaSpotter Telegram channel named those on board as Anatoly Evsyukov and Anna Evsyukova, along with the crew named as Dmitry Belyakov, Arkady Grachev, Igor Syvorotkin and Pavel Popov.
Some reports claimed the crew had alerted air traffic control that they were running low on fuel before both engines subsequently failed.According to the country’s Federal Air Transport Agency the aircraft is registered in Russia and it is said to belong to ATLETIK-GRUPP LLC, based in Lyubertsy, Moscow region, and a private individual.
The plane reported a fuel problem at 19:05 local time on Saturday and was seeking to land in Tajikistan on an unscheduled stop, according to Shot media in Russia. One engine failed at 19:19, and the other ten minutes later.The plane disappeared from radar at about 19:30 local time, 35 miles from Kulob airport in Tajikistan.
It reportedly crashed in the remote, mountainous Badakhshan province in northeastern Afghanistan. The head of the company Ekaterina Agapova said: “Nothing is known yet, now I’m trying to understand the situation and understand what happened. There is no confirmed data yet.”
The footage appears to show smoke rising from the crash site at least 12 hours after the incident, which would have happened in darkness. The crash is apparently the first since Russian planes were subject to sanctions following Vladimir Putin ’s invasion of Ukraine. This has caused multiple emergency landings due to lack of spare parts and maintenance involving Western suppliers.
However it is unclear that the sanctions would have been imposed on an air ambulance. This is reported to be the ninth incident with a Russian plane since the beginning of the year and the eighth to occur during a flight in the last nine days."
MUXUWS8LX4_0MKCJNIQ1XDGXVI,'Draw' condensation from large rooms with 'effective' £1.80 ingredient experts swear by,Gemma StrongLifestyle Writer,"12:00, 21 Jan 2024Updated12:37, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/draw-condensation-large-rooms-effective-31890685,"Condensation is a real problem in the winter months. It can damage windows and furniture, and also cause mould to grow - which can lead to a whole host of health problems, including asthma.
Condensation builds up on our windows when there is too much moisture in the air. This often occurs when the cold outside air  meets our heated homes, causing a build-up of water droplets to appear on the inside of our windows - especially in the bedroom.
Thankfully there are a number of ways to tackle the problem. And one method costs as little as £1.80 and promises to draw in damp from large rooms.
Window experts from Plan-It Windows reccomend using rock salt to draw in excess water from big spaces, saying: ""In more spacious areas, rock salt can be an effective alternative. It absorbs a larger volume of moisture, making it suitable for bigger rooms where condensation is a concern.""
It's certainly a cost-effective option. Tesco sells a 500g box of Tidman's Course Rock Salt for as little as £1.80. The experts also recommend using an excellent natural dehumidifier - baking soda. Placing bowls of baking soda on windowsills can significantly reduce moisture.
You'll notice that it hardens over time, which means it's doing its job, and is ""excellent for smaller rooms, absorbing humidity and helping to prevent condensation,"" the Mail reports.
And what about the bathroom? Steamy showers will certainly contribute to a condensation problem and reducing humidity from showers can greatly impact indoor moisture levels.
""We suggest using moderately warm water and keeping showers brief,"" the experts say. ""Always ventilate the bathroom post-shower by opening a window or using an extractor fan to disperse the moist air.""
According to the NHS, if you have damp and mould in your home you're more likely to have respiratory problems, respiratory infections, allergies or asthma. Damp and mould can also affect the immune system. Moulds produce allergens (substances that can cause an allergic reaction), irritants and, sometimes, toxic substances.
Inhaling or touching mould spores may cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and skin rash. Moulds can also cause asthma attacks. Some people are more susceptible, including babies and children, older children, those with existing skin problems, such as atopic eczema, those with respiratory problems, such as allergies and asthma and those with a weakened immune system, such as those having chemotherapy.

Dermatologists removed a mole from her body and sent it for tests, which came back confirming she had a malignant melanoma - the most serious form of skin cancer. It came just six months after being treated for breast cancer. She's said to be in ""good spirits"" but ""distressed"" after being hit with a second cancer diagnosis in six months.
Skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer to be diagnosed in the UK, but there are still plenty of people that are unaware they're at risk. You should regularly check your skin for the key signs of cancer - particularly if you've been spending more time outdoors.
The sun and ultraviolet radiation and damage the skin, and subsequently, lead to skin cancer. Diagnosing skin cancer early is crucial for treatment, which is why everybody should know what signs to look out for.
Regularly examining your skin is the easiest way to know if you're at risk. You should particularly be looking out for changes to any existing moles. Speak to a doctor or dermatologist if you're unsure about the growths on your skin.
""Regular examination of the skin for any new or unusual growths, or changes in the size, shape or colour of an existing spot, is key to finding and treating skin cancers early,"" said the Cancer Treatment Centers of America.
""If you find anything suspicious, you should discuss it with your primary care physician or a dermatologist. While many skin cancers develop in areas exposed to the sun, they may also develop in areas that are usually hidden from the sun. It is important to examine all of these areas. In addition to examining the legs, trunk, arms, face and neck, it is important to look for signs of skin cancer in the areas between the toes, underneath nails, palms of the hands and soles of the feet, genitals and even the eyes.""
More than 150,000 people are diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer every year in the UK. But the number could be much higher, because it's often left undiagnosed.
Melanoma, the more severe type of skin cancer, affects around 13,500 people every year. Speak to a doctor if you're worried about the signs or symptoms of skin cancer."

There's four exits on the show, as four different characters have reasons to be out of Walford for an unspecified amount of time. There's also two new romances, both of which send shockwaves across the Square.
One of which leads to a showdown with the pair's exes, while one family is furious with some big news. There's worrying scenes ahead too, as a dark twist sees rapist Dean Wicks possibly striking again.
There's also panic ahead for The Six after the Christmas Day murder, as Nish Panesar claims his memory has returned. Here are the biggest moments airing next week on he show...
EastEnders viewers will see two unlikely residents possibly get together in upcoming scenes on the BBC soap. Two residents agree to a date with romance possibly on the horizon, just weeks on from both of them being embroiled in marriage splits. In a twist we did not see coming, Nish Panesar and Kat Slater get closer after recent events.
Nish's wife Suki finally left him for her partner Eve Unwin after his controlling and abusive behaviour led to dramatic scenes. After years of hiding her true self, Suki ended her marriage to Nish and gave things a go with Eve, which obviously didn't go down well with her husband.
But with Suki having the support of Walford residents and her family, it seems next week Nish realises he's on his own and there's no going back. Meanwhile Kat calls it quits with her partner Phil Mitchell it seems, after his infidelity is exposed in upcoming scenes.
Kat learns of Phil sleeping with Emma Harding last year, leaving her distraught. It seems in the fallout she's avoiding Phil, and could seek comfort in Nish.
Spoilers reveal that Priya advises Nish to get on with his life as Suki is never coming back. So Nish asks Kat out on a date, but she reveals she's not ready for dating after her split.
When Stacey Slater finds out her cousin's been offered a date with Nish, she is determined to stop her and reveals what he did to her best friend Eve. Kat soon marches over to confront Nish to demand answers, but she softens when he shares his version of events.
She ends up agreeing to a date and the pair head to Walford East, where things get awkward as Phil spots them together. Phil makes harsh jibes at Kat, leaving her hurt, so she flees the date with Nish soon following her.
EastEnders airs concerning scenes next week on the BBC soap, as Gina Knight sees Dean Wick's true colours after their romance is exposed. The pair have grown closer recently with Gina backing rapist Dean, despite Walford residents knowing he attacked Linda Carter in 2014. He also attempted to rape girlfriend Roxy Mitchell after this, before he left the show in 2016.
Residents were sickened last year when Dean returned to the show, and he repeatedly claimed to be innocent. He even set up Linda to make her say that he had not raped her, but residents saw right through this.
Except Linda's stepsister Gina did not, and she's made it clear she believes Dean over her. In spoilers for next week's episodes, it's revealed the pair are in a secret relationship with them seen kissing. But Dean decides to cause drama when Gina makes it clear she wants no one to know about them.
After his attempts to manipulate her fail, he outs their romance to the whole pub including Gina's shocked family. Later in the week the pair ignore the people against their romance and decide to have a romantic night in, despite warnings to Gina.
However, the date takes a dark turn when Gina finally sees Dean’s true colours. What happens, and will she finally call things off with the character?
EastEnders will air four departures next week on the BBC soap, with new opportunities and worrying news ahead. Four different characters are set to leave Walford, including one resident who will at some point make a permanent exit from the show.
While it's thought all four characters who leave next week will be back soon, there's a chance that only three of the four characters will be back on screen. That's because one of the names was confirmed to be leaving the soap after over 15 years a few months ago, while they remain on screen for the time being.
So might the exit next week see her gone for good already? As for the other three, some family news and a business opportunity see them all departing Walford for some time away, but they are thought to be returning.
That said, it has not been specified how long they will be gone for or when they will be back. The characters making swift exits after Martin Fowler, Whitney Dean, Kim Fox and Howie Danes.
EastEnders' The Six could find themselves in danger in upcoming scenes as Nish Panesar reveals his memory is returning after the deadly Christmas Day twist. The character has been in a coma for weeks ever since he was hit over the head with a glass bottle by Denise Fox.
On Christmas Day, Nish's actions including his plot to kill wife Suki's lover Eve Unwin finally came to light, resulting in a deadly showdown. Suki had vowed to leave Nish after he attacked her, before he turned on his own family. With the help of Kathy Beale, Stacey Slater, Sharon Watts, Denise and Linda Carter, Suki vowed to end her marriage for once and for all.
Fans know that Nish headed to the pub to confront Suki, and when she asked for a divorce and things didn't go his way he turned violent. As he dragged her towards the doors no doubt ready to take his revenge, The Six battled to stop him hurting Suki and Denise attacked him.
He was declared dead only for Suki to revive him, and Nish was left in a coma in hospital. In upcoming scenes, Nish begins to get suspicious after hearing Suki and Linda having a clandestine conversation about the café. During a day of probing, Nish gleans enough information from Denise and Linda to realise they are hiding something.
And it's not long until Suki's blood runs cold when Nish explains his memory is returning. Later, Nish tells Suki that she needs to sign over all their businesses to him or he'll go to the police. Later, some of the women meet for a panicked conversation about how to handle Nish, and they agree that Suki must agree to his demands to protect them. Does Nish really remember what happened and what will Suki do?

QUX6VX1ARI_GUBCPONR6ZG7SM9,Experts share the worst thing you can do in the morning for your sleep cycle,Yelena MandenbergNews Reporter,"20:46, 21 Jan 2024Updated23:04, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/experts-share-worst-thing-you-31934557,"A sleep doctor has warned that what you do in the morning could be causing your insomnia at night.
Staying in bed for anything other than sleep and intimacy can leave you feeling groggy and tired, disrupting your circadian rhythm. Dr. Chester Wu, a psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist, said: ""I try not to linger in bed because I definitely feel like that causes me to feel more lazy or groggy."" He added that health behaviours in the morning reinforce a strong circadian rhythm, promoting wakefulness during the day and sleepiness at night.
Many other sleep doctors agree with this advice. Chelsie Rohrscheib, a neuroscientist and sleep expert, said: ""I never stay in bed and do activities that aren't related to sleep and intimacy. This means when I wake up, I get out of bed immediately and go somewhere else in my house,""
""This helps to maintain my brain's association that the bedroom is only a place of rest, which promotes high-quality sleep,"" Rohrscheib continued.

Instead of laying in bed, doctors recommend getting some sunlight and water in after waking up. If you have outdoor space and the weather permits, try going outside with some water in the mornings and see how you feel after a few weeks.
Rohrscheib says: ""Light during the day is very important for keeping our circadian rhythm well-regulated. Studies have shown that a lack of sunlight exposure can reduce the quality of your sleep, contribute to insomnia, and negatively impact mood.""
Of course, exercise is the next best thing you should do after getting out of bed. That doesn't mean you have to do something strenuous - but at least some light stretching and movements to get your heart rate up.
Dr. Chris Winter, a neurologist and sleep health expert says, ""getting active quickly is a fantastic way to signal to your brain that the day has begun.""
""The exercise does not have to be particularly intense. I start my day off by walking my dogs every day or walking with my wife to work,"" he continued.
Doctors have suggested that making your bed in the morning can help wake you up and napping during the day should be avoided as it may make you less tired at night times.

Finley Daniel is perhaps the youngest little Wizard to be accepted into Hogwarts after his parents transformed his nursery into a magical boudoir even more impressive than Dumbledore's abode. Casey and Kaycee Daniel showed off their masterpiece, which took months of planning and required a professional 3D artist.
The nursery - which could easily be mistaken for one of J.K Rowling's books - features a Hogwarts crest, owls, and (of course) Dobby the house elf. In 2020, the parents, from Morton, Illinois, posted their creation online - and received praise from hundreds of Harry Potter fans.
Mrs Daniel shared a look at the magical room on Facebook, revealing it took months of planning to put it all together. She said: ""Our Harry Potter nursery is finally complete after several months of planning! I absolutely love the way everything turned out! As I sit here rocking our little man to sleep, it's like I am in Hogwarts!""
The family worked with Nate Baranowski to create a stunning wall mural, which is the focus point of the room and looks like a window at the fictional school of witchcraft and wizardry. The mural scene looks out over the rest of Hogwarts, showing turrets and towers, the iconic Whomping Willow tree and the Great Lake.

And it's not the only piece of artwork in the room, there are also incredible paintings of Dobby the house elf, the Hogwarts Express and Professor Dumbledore. As well as this, all four of the Hogwarts house flags are flying proudly in the room, with one for Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Slytherin.
It's not yet clear which house the budding little wizard who inhabits the room will be in, it seems he's got a few more years before taking a visit to see the Sorting Hat. But people on social media went wild for the nursery.
One person said: ""I want this for my room, and I'm an adult! Haha."" Another commented: ""This is fabulous. Love the window especially!""
""This is the best thing I've ever seen,"" proclaimed a third. Someone else replied: ""This is amazing, over the top, but sooooo cute!"" While a different user added: ""This is so clever!"" Others began making plans to have more kids just so they could decorate a room like this.

RGQUIYLB0F_7FROIPY3GD3VY9V,UK's most unreliable train operators revealed - how does your local service rank?,Joe SmithNews Reporter,"10:07, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uks-most-unreliable-train-operators-31917752,"The state of the railways in the UK means that when booking a train it often feels like a leap of faith these days - with no way to know if your journey will arrive on time or even at all.
Some major rail operators are late more than half of the time, according to new data on passenger rail performance, while others see high numbers of cancelled trains.
New research carried out by accident compensation experts at Claims.co.uk has revealed which train operators on the network have the highest percentage of cancelled or significantly late trains and here we have ranked them from worst to best.
The analysis looked at over 20 train operators and their performance between 2018 and 2022 to find which operators had the most delayed or cancelled services.
TransPennine Express was shown to be the operator most likely to experience delays throughout the year. The data shows that 7.95% of all TransPennine Express trains experienced cancellations or were significantly delayed between 2018 and 2022.
The operator, which serves routes across North England, including Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow, is also late nearly half the time, with only 57% of trains arriving on time - 18% below the average percentage of on-time trains across all operators.
In at number two is nationwide operator Avanti West Coast - as the second-most likely to experience cancellations or significant delays. The data revealed that between 2018 and 2022, 7.58% of all trains were disrupted.
Avanti West Coast also gets the dubious title of operator with the most delayed trains with only 43.5% of trains being on time. This means that if you booked a trip with Avanti West Coast during the study period, more likely than not, it was delayed. That figure is a whopping 38% below the average percentage of on-time trains across all operators.
London North Eastern Railway is ranked as the third operator most likely to experience delays with 6.81% of all trains being cancelled or significantly late between 2018-2022. Only 62.9% of all trains were on time between 2018 and 2022 putting it among the top five operators with the most delays.
The fourth operator most likely to experience disruptions was the Caledonian Sleeper, which runs night trains between London and Scotland. Cancellations or significant delays hit 6.76% of their trains between 2018 and 2022. Out of all the operators, Caledonian Sleeper had the highest percentage of on-time trains. The data shoes that 85.4% of trains were on time between 2018 and 2022, 22% above the average.
Govia Thameslink Railway and West Midlands Trains tied for fifth place, both had 5.77% of trains between 2018 and 2022 experiencing cancellations. Govia Thameslink Railway performed slightly better when it came to the percentage of on-time trains (65.7%) compared to West Midlands Trains (65.2%).
Filling out the top ten operators with the highest percentage of cancelled or significantly late trains are CrossCountry in sixth place with 4.88%; TfW Rail in seventh place with 4.80%; Northern Trains in eighth place with 4.44%; South Western Railway in ninth place with 4.43% and, Southeastern in tenth place with 3.5%.
A spokesperson for Claims.co.uk said: “Numerous factors can explain why trains end up delayed or cancelled; these range from infrastructure issues to weather and seasonal issues”.
‌“TrannsPennine Express ranked as the operator most likely to experience cancellations and delays. The data revealed train faults were this operator's most common cause of delays. Train faults are issues that result in the train being unfit for service; this could range from doors being unable to lock or PA system faults, which prevent instructions from being given out in an emergency. Between 2018 and 2022, TransPennine Express experienced 1,075 train faults.”
""It is always best to plan journeys, and if possible, travel slightly earlier as a contingency if trains are delayed or cancelled."""

A Ryanair flight heading for Dublin from Manchester had to change its course on Sunday afternoon. Instead of landing at Dublin International Airport, which had already warned about possible flight cancellations and delays, the plane landed nearly 500 miles away at Paris Beauvais-Tille Airport.
Some flights had to abort landings and fly hundreds of miles away to touch down safely. The UK was covered in severe wind warnings due to the storm, with people being advised not to travel due to the risk of 90mph gusts hitting the country. Air traffic control restrictions led to some flight cancellations at airports across the UK.
National Air Traffic Services (Nats) said: ""Due to adverse weather conditions across the UK, temporary air traffic restrictions are in place. Restrictions of this sort are only every applied to maintain safety. Our teams are working closely with airports and airlines to minimise disruption. Passengers should check the status of their flight with their airline.""

FlightRadar24 data revealed the paths of several flights on Sunday. Others had to fly almost 500 miles away from their destination due to the 'dangerous' winds.
A Ryanair flight from Birmingham to Dublin was forced to divert to Manchester. A passenger on board, Joe Fenny, shared his terrifying experience on Twitter, saying: ""The storm has caused massive winds in Dublin, they tried to land but the plane was genuinely swinging back and forth, it felt like stuff was hitting the sides of the plane."" He added: ""Genuinely one of the scariest experiences of my life. First time I've applauded a pilot. I could have kissed the bloke when we hit the tarmac in Manc.""
Another Ryanair flight, this time from Gdansk to Leeds, had to circle over Yorkshire multiple times before being diverted to Manchester Airport. It landed around 1pm.
A British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Belfast City also had to perform a dramatic diversion due to strong wind gusts. After circling over Northern Ireland, the flight aborted its landing and instead diverted to Manchester Airport, landing just before 6pm.
Earlier that day, Manchester Airport stated there was no 'impact to operations' due to the weather warning. They advised passengers to contact their airline for more information about their flights.
Manchester Airport said in a statement: ""An amber weather warning is in place today for high winds. There is no impact to airport operations. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for up-to-date flight information. Road and rail services may be impacted. Plan ahead and allow extra time and care for your journey to the airport.""

RO67O4FTM2_WKWY3WEL7524TQI,Water bosses trouser £25million in bonuses despite sewage dumping scandal,Sophie HuskissonPolitical Correspondent,"22:30, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/water-bosses-trouser-25million-bonuses-31932524,"Water company bosses have awarded themselves over £25million in bonuses and benefits despite dumping sewage in rivers, lakes and seas.
Nine water chief executives have been paid a staggering £10million in bonuses, £14million in incentives and £603,580 in benefits since 2019, according to analysis by Labour. At the same time, water companies plan to hike customers’ bills by an extra £156 a year by 2030 to plug a financial gap and reduce sewage discharges.
If it gets into Government, Labour plans to give the water regulator Ofwat new powers to ban the payment of bonuses to water bosses who are illegally polluting our rivers, lakes and seas with toxic sewage. By expanding Ofwat’s regulatory powers, water companies who fail to meet environmental standards on sewage pollution will face tough sanctions to ensure they cannot profit from law-breaking, the party said.
Labour said that under its new plans Ofwat could have blocked six out of nine water bosses' bonuses last year because of severe levels of illegal pollution. Last Autumn, the Government was found to have potentially broken the law by not keeping water companies in check.
The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said guidelines ""possibly allow untreated sewage discharges to occur more regularly than intended by the law"", while water firms go unpunished. Ministers were accused of letting perpetrators get away with ""environmental vandalism on an industrial scale"".
Shadow Environment Secretary Steve Reed said: “This Conservative Government has wilfully turned a blind eye to corruption at the heart of the water industry. The result is stinking, toxic sewage destroying our countryside, and consumers facing higher bills while failing water bosses pocket millions in bonuses.
“Labour will put failing water companies under special measures. We will strengthen regulation so law-breaking water bosses face criminal charges, and give the regulator new powers to block the payment of any bonuses until water bosses have cleaned up their filth.”
He added: “With Labour, the polluter - not the public - will pay.”"

But even if you've bribed your dogs with endless amounts of treats and words of reassurance, almost nothing can stop them shaking their wet fur all over the house to get dry. For Christina Thygesen, her furry friend Alfie was guilty of soaking the house after being washed, and something had to give.
The woman, from Stevenage, wanted to re-decorate her entire home back in 2020. However, she knew if Alfie, now 15 years old, kept shaking himself dry there would be little point. However, she found a genius solution that only set her back £3.50.
So how did she do it? Well, she decided to buy Alfie his very own dressing gown, complete with a little hood. Thygesen shared her top tip in a post on the Facebook group, Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK, writing: ""My dog likes to rub up against walls and doors when he's had a shower, so I thought I would get him a dressing gown.""
She found a 'cute' rope in the baby section of her local Tesco for just £3.50. The dog owner then posted a photo of Alfie modelling his new Christmas-themed loungewear - and he looks too cute!

Speaking to The Mirror, Christina explained that Alfie doesn't mind wearing his dressing gown - despite what his face may say in the photo. She added: ""He's 12 years old and has grown a bit more grumpy with age, which is why he doesn't always look happy, but he would only be in the dressing gown for about five to 10 minutes anyway, which gives us enough time for a cuddle.""
So there you have it folks, no dogs were made to feel unhappy in order to keep the house clean and tidy!

Mark Elton travelled from Melbourne to Perth to perform at the city's Fringe Festival, checking his hand-crafted $13,000AU (£6,750) instrument in as oversized baggage with stickers marked 'fragile' on the case, he explained on an Instagram post.
When the veteran musician opened the bag at his destination, he noticed large cracks in the wood. Mark took to social media to explain what happened.
""Hey @qantas! Thanks for a very depressing start to my month of shows at @fringeworldperth 2024,' he posted along with images of the damage. ""After flying Melbourne/Perth today I opened my flight case and found my beautiful Double Bass smashed beyond repair after obviously being dropped from a considerable height by your baggage people.
""After many years of being a club member and choosing to fly with @qantas I'm hoping you'll support me through this major emotional and financial setback.""
Musicians quickly rushed to support Mark, with WA Symphony Orchestra double bassist and luthier Andrew Tait loaning him an instrument so he could play the month of shows he had lined up.
Qantas responded to the double bassist's complaint and checked CCTV, saying there was no sign that the instrument had been damaged in transit. The airline did offer a goodwill payment.
In a statement a spokesperson for the company said: ""We know how important it is to handle all luggage with care, including musical instruments,' Qantas said in a statement. ""We are concerned to hear that the double bass has been damaged and we have been actively investigating what has happened with our ground handling partners since we were first notified on Tuesday.""
Musicians regularly face the difficult question of how they should transport their instruments when playing overseas or far from home. Last year a virtuoso violinist had to take an eight-hour bus after he was stopped from carrying his immensely valuable instrument onto a plane.
Janusz Wawrowski from Konin, Poland was carrying an original Stradivarius violin when he was denied boarding on a LOT Polish Airlines flight. The musician had declined to check the 337-year-old violin in the luggage hold, wanting to keep the instrument by his side at all times.
Considering it was valued at over £4.15million, it is fairly easy to understand why. Janusz was traveling from Vilnius International Airport following a performance with the Lithuanian National Symphony Orchestra at the time.
Airline officials told him he would not be able to get onto the aircraft with the violin. He is the only person allowed to carry the violin under the contract of his ownership of it.
The musician told Simple Flying that ground staff at the airport said he'd have to put the violin in the hold or stay in Vilnius. The current guidance on the LOT website states passengers are allowed to bring one carry-on baggage up to 8kg with a total dimension not longer than 118 cm."
TRSRMYD28Z_CQR2O8K0UQUQFAE,Storm Isha: Tornado warning confirmed for UK - exactly where is at risk of 'strong' twisters,Ryan FaheyNews Reporter,"16:19, 21 Jan 2024Updated09:38, 22 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/storm-isha-tornado-warning-confirmed-31932893,"A tornado warning has been issued as wind speeds are expected to reach 90mph in some parts of the country.
The storm is set to strike later this evening and to last into the early hours of tomorrow morning. The Met Office upgraded a weather warning on Sunday to amber, which includes a ""danger to life"" advisory. The warning covers most of the UK.
The Met Office said: ""Storm Isha will bring a spell of very strong winds during Sunday evening and into Monday. Disruption to travel and utilities is likely."" People travelling by rail, sea and air will also face disruptions, including closures, cancellations and delays. Some rail operators issued a ""do not travel"" warning on Sunday.
Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “We’re expecting widespread gales to affect the UK, amber warnings are in place for large parts of the country. There’s the potential for danger-to-life and damaging winds potentially leading to some power cuts in places, some large waves around coastal regions could bring some debris onto roads and trees could come down.”
He added: “We have a wind warning in place across the whole of the UK, it’s pretty unusual for the whole of the country to be under a blanket wind warning.” Damage to homes and buildings, falling trees, power cuts, flying debris, large waves and even some flooding in places should also be expected, forecasters warn. And on Sunday, The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) have issued a 'Tornado Watch' for parts of the UK.
The 'Tornado Watch', denoted by the area highlighted in red, covers all of Northern Ireland and Ireland, most of Scotland and some areas of northern England. It says there 'is the risk of a few tornadoes' including a 'strong tornado', reports the Manchester Evening News.
On its website, it says: ""Across the Tornado Watch area, a potent mid-level trough and speed max (500 hPa mid-level jet max of ~120 knots) will overspread the frontal zone, and induce a powerful low-level jet in advance of the front (850 hPa flow of ~90 knots).
Have your travel plans been affected by Storm Isha? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.
""This will produce exceptional low-level shear values across the area, especially across the RoI and N Ireland, e.g. 0-1km SREH values of over 700 J/Kg, and 0-3km values of around 1000 J/Kg. There will also be some modest instability, which the strong shear should augment, allowing the chance of rotating structures, including shallow supercells, to develop, as well as a broken line of convection exhibiting QLCS charateristics.
""In and close to the watch area, there is the risk of a few tornadoes, and the potent shear means a strong tornado is possible, especially across the RoI and N Ireland. Additionally, the very strong low-level flow will be mixed to the surface in stronger cores, bringing the risk of gusts of 70-80mph, and perhaps 90-100mph in a few spots, even inland. Any supercell which can develop may produce hail, which could reach severe levels, and a few CG lightning strikes are possible too, especially across the RoI and N Ireland.""
TORRO also says a 'Convective Discussion' is in place for all of England and Wales, highlighted in yellow. It says: ""Across the Convective Discussion area, the cold front will move through overnight into Monday morning. The main upper forcing will be mostly to the north and north-west of the area, but some upper forcing will still be present, and a short-wave may cross the area overnight too.
""One or two broken lines of rain will spread across the area, bringing the risk of strong wind gusts (70-80mph), given the very strong 850 hPa flow. Additionally, one or two tornadoes are possible, especially with any rotating structures within the QLCS. Overall, this risk seems lower than within the tornado watch, hence the issuance of a discussion."""

Two young girls, a 36-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man were found dead in a house on Friday morning. Today, a post-mortem examination was carried out for the man and woman by Home Office officials.
It was found that the woman and the male both died as a result of stab wounds to the neck. The girls' post-mortems will take place on Wednesday. Last night, following extensive enquiries detectives confirmed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
Formal identification is yet to take place and the next of kin is being kept informed of developments and supported by specialist officers. However, local reports say that the man has been identified as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, an engineer said to work in the property trade. Police said Bartlomiej - who was reportedly married - and the two girls lived together at the property but the woman was a visitor.
The family were understood to have been active members of the community. Images on his Facebook page show the dad with two young girls and his partner. It isn't yet clear who the woman, the fourth body found in the home, was.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said: “Following this latest development we remain satisfied no one else was involved in this incident.
“This latest information will only add to the distress and shock felt by members of the local community and it’s why, from the outset, we’ve been determined to carry out detailed and methodical enquiries to make sure we fully understand how this incident has happened.
“I would like to thank the community for their support and for the many people who have called offering information. We continue to work through this and will get back to everyone who has been in touch. The police cordon remains in place at the scene and we will continue to have a presence in the area tomorrow.”
The incident has been referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) due to police contact at the address on 14 December, relating to a missing person enquiry, and in relation to a 999 call made from a man at the address prior to the incident, which didn’t result in the deployment of officers.
The IOPC will assess the circumstances of the call and determine the appropriate level of investigation required. As a result, no further information relating to the circumstances of this call will be released at this time."
UBCIK0X094_QF82CB7WUKBPX4V,ITV2 Love Island star says he's 'finished' as brutal lie exposed to Islanders,Charlotte TuttonSenior TV Reporter,"22:36, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/itv2-love-island-star-says-31933451,"Love Island's Mitchel Taylor found himself in the bad books of the girls in the villa once more on Sunday night.
Viewers declared Messy Mitch had struck again, as some even called for him to leave the show. After seeing how things would go with Liberty Poole, he left her confused in the latest episode after his two chats with new girl Arabella Chi.
Liberty didn't know where she stood, despite telling Chris Taylor she was keen to be open with him too, not wanting to put all her time into one person - while she didn't know for sure she was their number one. After sharing with the girls that Mitch had not spoken to her all day despite her choosing him in the recoupling, she decided to confront him.
Wanting to know whether she should be more open or of Mitch was still focusing on her, Liberty wanted answers as to whether he was more keen on the new girl than her. Mitch claimed she was still his number one, and that he didn't see it working with Arabella.
Liberty walked off though, not sure he was being honest with her - but she wasn't expecting what Demi Jones was about to drop. As Liberty confided in Demi, Demi told her she deserved better and that he was likely messing her about - with the girls remembering he was 'Messy Mitch'.
Demi then dropped the bombshell that before the recoupling, Mitch had told her that she was his number one. Liberty was horrified and felt played, so once again headed over to Mitch to ask him if this was true.
It was written all over his face as he said: ""Oh f***ing hell... I did do that. I'm finished."" Liberty told him to ""p**s off"", before storming into the villa to have a cry. Mitch pulled an awkward face, while viewers at home couldn't believe he was making the same mistakes all over again.
It follows an explosive twist on Friday night as Arabella was announced as a new bombshell, leaving the girls worried in the villa. It was an explosive episode with the first recoupling of the series, where Luis confronted Mitchel for 'game playing' amid their love triangle with Demi.
Later in the episode, the Islanders all took part in a pre-loved punk party. However, the party was short-lived as the boys received an explosive text in the villa, saying they had been invited to Arabella's afterparty at the hideaway terrace.
Reacting to the news, Georgia Harrison told the girls: ""I know Arabella, none of us are safe, absolutely not!"" In a VT, Arabella, 32, teased: ""I've been fortunate enough to be able to hangout in Hollywood circles but I still have not found love. I'm Arabella, I was on series five of Love Island. I might have recently of come out of a relationship but I'm ready to meet the man of my dreams so get me back in that villa!""
Taking to Twitter, now X, viewers were quick to predict who Arabella could be going after in the villa or which boys could be pursuing her. One person said: ""Toby is totally going after Arabella. I really feel for Georgia S. #LoveIsland #LoveIslandAllStars!"", a different account put: ""When Arabella goes for Callum and Molly gets jealous #LoveIsland #LoveIslandAllStars"" while a different show watcher added: ""Arabella goes for Callum and makes molly jealous #loveisland #LoveIslandAllStars.""

UGUK6H4PTT_FJEFUISGSG80AFT,Woman saw doctor with shortness of breath and had 'extremely unusual' 32kg tumour removed,Matt AthertonDeputy News Editor,"07:12, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/woman-saw-doctor-shortness-breath-31908824,"A woman had a giant 32kg tumour removed from her ovary, after developing shortness of breath and a general feeling of heaviness.
The 24-year-old patient spoke to a doctor after developing a number of unusual symptoms - including weight loss. It was later revealed that she had an oversized growth in her ovary, which had also attached to her intestine and organ connective tissues.
Doctors decided to operate straight away, as she could develop more serious health problems if the tumour was left alone. After a long and gruelling procedure, doctors at the University Women's Clinic in Magdeburg, Germany, successfully removed the growth.
Dr Atanas Ignatov, who worked on the case, said the growth was a cystadenoma, which is a type of benign tumour that develops from ovarian tissues.
He said: “A tumour of this size is extremely unusual, as women usually seek medical help at an early stage. The patient was afraid of the operation and therefore suppressed the tumour.
“I would like to emphasise that affected women should not be afraid. They are in the best hands with us. Our clinic is geared towards providing highly specialised medical assistance. Early detection is the key to successful treatment and we support our patients in this important aspect of preventive healthcare.”
The patient didn't have any complications after the surgery, and she was even allowed to leave hospital a week later.
A cystadenoma is incredibly rare, as they're usually spotted during scans for something else. In this case, the tumour was allowed to grow over a long period of time without being noticed.
The prognosis is usually excellent, but on rarer occasions, it can lead to ovarian torsion or a cyst rupture.
In most cases, ovarian cysts disappear by themselves within a few months, and a follow-up ultrasound should confirm that. They also shouldn't prevent you from getting pregnant in later life, although it can make it harder to conceive."
V6DYMPJMP0_UFXXRMCXPDBZY7W,Inside Kate Middleton's recovery at royal cottage as Prince William does the school run,Antony Clements-ThrowerNews Reporter,"10:50, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/inside-kate-middletons-recovery-royal-31931344,"Details on life for the Princess of Wales during her convalescence after abdominal surgery have been revealed.
Kate, 42, will remain at the London Clinic, where she had her operation on Tuesday, for at least another week as she recovers. Once she is well enough, the 42-year-old will return to her Adelaide Cottage home in Windsor until she resumes her Royal duties around Easter time. Prince William is set to be by her side as he also takes a break from his responsibilities to tend to his wife.
The couple have previously shared the dropping off and picking up of their three children from school, with the responsibility now falling on the heir to the throne to do both. He will be assisted at home by the couple’s nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, according to the Sunday Times.
Kate is close to her family, and her parents Carole and Michael Middleton and siblings Pippa Matthews and James Middleton are set to rally round and help support her recovery at the Waleses’ home in Windsor. The time convalescing will be a shock to the system for the future queen as her diary is usually chock full of meetings, calls, school runs, official engagements and exercise. Kensington Palace has already confirmed it has contacted the Princess’ 30 charities and patronages to postpone all events for the time being.
The princess is likely to spend between two and three months recuperating and is not expected to return to public duties until after Easter based on current medical advice, the Palace said. There will now be no international travel for the Prince and Princess in the coming months. Kate marked her birthday just over a week ago, with the monarchy’s official social media accounts sharing a new behind-the-scenes photo of the Princess at the King’s coronation.
Kate usually enjoys good health but was previously admitted to hospital while pregnant after suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – severe morning sickness. Like the rest of the Royal Family, she has had a busy, turbulent past couple of years, with the Platinum Jubilee and the late Queen’s death in 2022, and the coronation in 2023, as well as adjusting to her new role as the Princess of Wales.
A statement from Kensington Palace on its social media pages read: “Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic yesterday for planned abdominal surgery. The surgery was successful and it is expected she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery. Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.
“The Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate. She hopes the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private.”"

The plane kept flying over the Lowcountry region after the pilot was forced to eject during the ""mishap"" in September, according to military authorities. The pilot survived after parachuting down to a residential neighbourhood in North Charleston but a search was launched to track down the jet which disappeared on September 17, 2023.
Despite the pilot ejecting, the jet continued to travel until it disappeared from view, with officials then scrambling to try and track down its location. The search effort for the plane included a call to 911, much to the surprise of the dispatcher who answered.

Audio files obtained by ABC News earlier this month show the moment a major from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort spoke to a Williamsburg County 911 dispatcher. ""I believe we potentially have an aircraft that went down in Williamsburg County earlier today,"" the major said.
The dispatcher asked: ""You believe you have an aircraft that went down in Williamsburg County?"" To which the major replied: ""That is correct. We are trying to look for it and we are coming up dry so far.""
On the day of the crash, the Marine Corps was able to provide coordinates of the area where they believed the jet went down. It was not previously clear whether the F-35's transponder was working during the incident.
A medical crew was assigned to the incident but was later told to stand down as officials learnt the pilot was safe. But the location of the jet was still unknown.
There was reportedly confusion among emergency services as it was unclear where the remains of the jet could have been. One official said: ""If it's military and they've got a helicopter, they'll find it quicker than us. They've got more resources than we do.""
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.
A separate audio file released in September showed another 911 call made by a confused neighbour who told a dispatcher a pilot was in his home after landing in his backyard. The homeowner said: ""We got a pilot in the house, and I guess he landed in my backyard, and we're trying to see if we could get an ambulance to the house, please.""
The dispatcher initially sounded confused and said: ""I'm sorry, what happened?"" The pilot then spoke to 911 and said he was feeling ""ok"" after descending around 2,000 with a parachute, but said his back hurt.
The aviator said: ""Ma'am, a military jet crashed. I'm the pilot. We need to get rescue rolling. I'm not sure where the airplane is. It would have crash-landed somewhere. I ejected.""
A field of debris was found in a rural area near the border of Williamsburg and Florence counties - more than 75 miles from the area where the pilot landed - the day after the jet went missing. It is not yet known what caused the incident, and it is estimated that the crash led to a roughly $100million (£78million) loss. In September, the Marine Corps announced the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing would conduct an investigation into the incident, saying it would likely continue for several months."
XQFRS6SJWG_QRFOP0HL24857FS,Donald Trump boasts 'I should get 100% of the vote' ripping into 'disloyal' Nikki Haley,Yelena MandenbergNews Reporter,"21:52, 21 Jan 2024Updated21:54, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-boasts-i-should-31934793,"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump took to Truth Social today to declare his bitterness over Nikki Haley's campaign success in New Hampshire.
Trump proclaimed on social media that the New Hampshire primary win was all but definite before looking ahead to the next primary scheduled in Nevada.
""I should get 100% of the vote because it is a CAUCUS,"" wrote Trump - before using the opportunity to tear down his opponents. ""After looking at the Polls, Ron and Nikki both dropped out. Then, off to South Carolina, where we will WIN BIG!""
While Trump's messages are occasionally difficult to decipher, it looks like Trump is predicting his opponents will drop out after the next primary - which turned out to be almost accurate, as Ron DeSantis announced today that he'd be dropping out before the New Hampshire primary, and endorsing Trump.

The former president then spent the rest of the morning issuing a series of tweets insulting his opponents and claiming that 'disloyal' Haley can't win.
""Fox has given up on DeSanctimonious, but fighting like hell, one last chance, to save Birdbrain (""I will never run against President Trump, he was a GREAT PRESIDENT""). It won't happen, she doesn't have what it takes. Also, very Disloyal!!!"" wrote Trump on Truth Social, hours before DeSantis dropped out.
While Haley has focused her campaign in New Hampshire on a variety of promises for the conservative legislature, she's been polling well in the state. But Trump managed to find a variety of polls where he was ahead.
""BIRDBRAIN HAS BEEN LYING ABOUT THIS, AND MANY OTHER THINGS, FOR WEEKS. SHE CAN'T BEAT THE DEMS,"" Trump wrote over a graphic poll that showed Trump polling over Joe Biden at 49 percent, and Biden out-polling Haley by just two points.
For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US
Clapping back at Trump's campaigning, Nikki Haley has been heard questioning whether Trump is mentally capable of serving as president again after he repeatedly seemed to confuse her with former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a campaign speech.
As she campaigned in Keene, New Hampshire, Haley referenced Trump's speech the night before, in which he mistakenly asserted that Haley was in charge of Capitol security on January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building seeking to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Biden continued to post about Haley anyway, continuing with the message: ""Haley can't win!"" All of the polls Trump posted have him beating everyone by several points.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Sunday found that a majority of registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary - 67% - said they planned to vote for Trump. But a majority of those registered as undeclared - 58% - said they support Haley.
The poll, taken Tuesday through Friday, also found more registered Republicans in the state view Haley unfavorably (47%) than favorably (31%). Trump, meanwhile is viewed favorably by 76% of registered Republicans and unfavorably by just 16%."

The iconic glamour model, 56, was reportedly on a British Airways flight from London to Munich when she allegedly had a disagreement with another passenger.
It's claimed the plane was ready for take-off on the runway but had to be turned around at Heathrow after Page 3 legend Sam allegedly caused a scene, according to sources.
Passengers were reportedly asked to disembark and were accommodated in a hotel before continuing their journey the next day, according to reports. It's claimed Sam is deeply sorry following the alleged incident and has apologised.
Police confirmed to The Sun that a woman in her 50s was arrested on suspicion of being drunk on an aircraft and has been bailed until March. According to the same publication, Sam has expressed her deep regret for any inconvenience caused and is cooperating with the investigation. The Mirror has approached a representative for Sam for comment.
Sam, who rose to fame as a glamour model in the 1980s before becoming a pop star, married her partner of six years Linda Oslen in 2022, with a lavish ceremony in Essex. The former Celebrity Big Brother star and Linda announced their engagement in March 2020, four years after they first struck up a romance in 2016.
During an appearance on Loose Women, Sam revealed that it was Linda who proposed, after panellist Frankie Bridge asked Sam if she was surprised when it happened. ""Kind of, I did hint!"" Sam admitted, before adding: ""I mean I’m getting on a bit now. When I met her, I knew I was completely in love with her and wanted to be with her forever.""
Recalling the moment she first dropped some wedding hints to her now-wife, Sam added: ""I was doing a concert in Slovakia and we stayed in a 16th century castle and I said, ‘wouldn’t it be lovely to get married here?’ She waited until Valentine’s Day 2020 to ask me to be her wife. She got down on one knee and it was all very traditional, I cried, she cried.
Prior to embarking on a relationship with Linda, Sam spent 12-years with her former manager and long-term partner Myra Stratton, until her then-fiancée passed away from cancer in 2015. Last year, Sam suffered another devastating loss when her sister Vanessa passed away suddenly from a heart attack at the age of 50.
In her 2017 autobiography, Forever, Sam shared how close she was to Vanessa, who once saved her from their alcoholic father Pat. Sam recalled: ""I thought he was going to kill me and begged him to stop. When I tried to get up he kicked me so hard in the stomach it winded me and he wouldn't stop.""

I'm A Celebrity's King of the Jungle, Sam, and former Love Islander, Zara, have been dating since 2019. After a brief split a year later following Zara's cheating admission, the couple's relationship has gone from strength to strength.
With no nuptials on the horizon, however, 31-year old Sam recently splashed the cash on an expensive Cartier ring. The recipient wasn't Zara, 27, though, but in fact Sam's close pal and confidant, Pete Wicks, who travelled to Australia to support him during his time in the jungle.
Acknowledging 36-year old Pete's friendship, Sam told the Sun: ""I bought Pete a Cartier ring, because he's just done so much for me."" Of Zara, however, he confessed: ""I'm so happy being with the person I know I'm going to spend the rest of my life with, I don't see any sort of rush at all.""
Sam continued: ""We speak about marriage a lot, but there's no pressure to put a ring on it."" After her time on Strictly Come Dancing came to a premature end in October, Zara was unexpectedly available to join Sam Down Under too. However, after chatting to her beau, she was told he was more than happy with just ex-TOWIE star Pete making the long-haul flight with him.
Zara explained to Fleur East's Hits Radio Breakfast Show: ""When I left Strictly I was like 'Shall I pack my case?' and he went 'Oh no it's already been arranged Pete is coming'."" She continued: ""When I suggested maybe Pete and I could both go, he said, 'No, just Pete!' Maybe I can get Pete to take a cardboard cut-out of me …
""But you know what it's fine, absolutely fine. I've got all the time in the world to live with him and see him. If he wants Pete at the end of that bridge I respect and appreciate that - also I can't wait to see that hug.""
Earlier this month, meanwhile, it was revealed Sam and Pete are set to take over a huge role from Roman Kemp at this year’s National Television Awards.

The veteran politician received the generous severance package after he spent just 82 days as Deputy Commons Leader under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. But now it has emerged he should never have been given the money as he was over the age of 65.
Government accounts show Mr Bone received a severance payment of £5,593 when he mysteriously was removed from his post at the end of September 2022, part-way through Ms Truss’s short time in power. The package, equivalent to three months’ pay, was actually more than the £4,986 be earned in wages in his short time in the job.
But the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 states that departing ministers are only entitled the cash if they under the age of 65. Mr Bone was 69 at the time.
Labour’s Emily Thornberry, who uncovered the severance pay blunder, said: ""This government never runs out of new ways to screw up. It was bad enough that they thought Peter Bone deserved three months severance from the taxpayer for less than twelve weeks work. It was even worse when we all found out why he'd lost his job. But to hear that he wasn't legally-entitled to the money in the first place just takes the biscuit.
Mr Bone was booted out of the Commons in December by his constituents in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, after he had been given a six-week ban from Parliament for bullying and sexual misconduct against a member of staff. A Commons sleaze watchdog found he repeatedly asked his researcher to give him massages, thrown pens at him and exposed himself when they were away on a work trip.
In one shocking incident, Mr Bone is alleged to have struck the aide on the back of his head and told him: “You’re having a thick day and I thought that would help”. The victim made a complaint to the Conservative Party in November 2017, but after four years it had still not been resolved so he turned to the parliamentary authorities to investigate in October 2021.
Mr Bone was appointed by Mr Johnson as Deputy Leader of the House of Commons in July 2022 even though he was subject of the probe. Parliament's Independent Expert (IEP) Panel ruled that Mr Bone had engaged in “a wilful pattern of bullying”, which “also included an unwanted incident of sexual misconduct, when the complainant was trapped in a room with the respondent in a hotel in Madrid”.
Following his suspension, a by-election was triggered after his constituents backed a recall petition. Mr Bone’s partner Helen Harrison has been selected as the Tory candidate and he has been canvassing for her. She has said she’s “proud” to have him as part of her campaign team.
Ms Thornberry added: “I hope the people of Wellingborough will send a message on February 15 that they are sick of the incompetence, sick of the waste, and sick of this government. They have a chance to vote for change with Labour, and this mind-blowing mistake shows it can't come fast enough.""
The Cabinet Office declined to comment."
YZENUE8TBW_ZYZHCNGFQFCKH34,Seven new Prince William and Kate Middleton bombshells from Harry low blow to Coronation demand,Jennifer NewtonRoyal Features Writer,"10:00, 21 Jan 2024Updated10:16, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/seven-new-prince-william-kate-31901890,"It may be a brand new biography of King Charles that goes inside his first moments as monarch and his historic Coronation.
But Charles III. New King. New Court. The Inside Story by royal expert and historian Robert Hardman also has a series of new bombshell claims about the King and Queen-in-waiting, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The book, which hits shelves earlier this week, before the news that Kate is in hospital following abdominal surgery, also sheds light on the Waleses - from what they did when the late Queen died to how they've been dealing with the drama related to their estranged relatives Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Here we look at some of the most eye-raising revelations in the book when it comes to the couple...
As the Queen's final hours neared, family members raced to Balmoral to be at her side, including William and Harry. However, two members of the Royal Family, who did not travel to Scotland were the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex. In his memoir Spare, Harry suggests Meghan was asked to stay away in the same way Kate was.
However, the reason Kate did not travel, Mr Hardman has revealed, was the decision of Kate, not the King. The book says she deemed it necessary to stay behind and prepare her three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis for their new school start rather than travel up to Scotland to be with the late Queen.
The book quotes an insider as saying: ""It was by luck rather than judgement, but it made it a lot easier to tell Harry that he was coming alone."" Harry had been in the UK with Meghan at the time, and alleged in his biography he texted Prince William about travel arrangements, to which his brother did not reply. ""Clearly, Prince William did not regard this as the appropriate moment for the intensely difficult conversation he needed to have with his brother"", the book adds.
In another part of the book, it claims that Charles and William held detailed discussions on the day the late Queen died but decided they couldn't include Harry. After he first became King, Mr Hardman claims one of the new monarch's first decisions was to sit down with his eldest son hours after his beloved mother had passed.
He writes that in previous years, Harry would have also been involved in the talks but with tensions so high between Harry and his father and brother, it was decided it was for the best he sat out the conversation. The book states: ""That evening, the couple [Charles and Camilla] would be joined for dinner by the new Prince of Wales, who would also stay at Birkhall. The King needed to have vital but discreet discussions with his elder son. In years gone by, such a moment would automatically have included his younger son, too.
""But not any more. This was clearly not an occasion for an opening up of hearts and minds with Prince Harry, particularly if he was still taking notes for his forthcoming book. Charles III needed a clear head and no distractions.""
In the days after the late Queen's death, royal fans pondered if it would bring estranged William and Harry back together. And a glimmer of hope came when they conducted a walkabout together at Windsor just days after their grandmother died. They were joined by their wives Kate and Meghan and the group put on a united front as they spoke to wellwisher and inspected the floral tributes. A source close to William told Mr Hardman that he organised the outing in about two hours.
And they added that even though William knew it might be awkward due to the tension between him and his brother, he thought it was appropriate after the Queen's passing. However, a member of the Wales team said neither William and Catherine nor Harry and Meghan found it easy.
The author writes in the biography that crowds were ""astonished"" to see the Sussexes and the Waleses get out of a black Land Rover together - with William at the wheel. One of his advisers tells the writer: ""It was very much William's idea. He had organised it in about two hours flat. He had been giving it a lot of thought and he said: 'I know it's awkward but isn't it right in the context of my grandmother's death?' I know he asked a couple of other people, too.""
Meanwhile, the new royal book also claims the Waleses offered Harry and Meghan a 'small gesture' of an olive branch after an emotional night at Buckingham Palace. It reportedly came in the days after the death of the late Queen when all members of the Royal Family converged on the palace after the former monarch's coffin was taken there before being processed to Westminster Hall the following day for the lying in state.
The Firm awaited the arrival of the coffin before an informal supper, throwing together the two warring couples. However according to the new biography, William and Kate offered a small olive branch, which would have gained the approval of Elizabeth II.
He explains: ""Inside the palace, all members of the Royal Family were there to welcome the Queen back to royal headquarters for the last time, followed by an informal supper. Afterwards, the Prince and Princess of Wales suggested that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should attach their car to their police escort for the journey back to Windsor since they were all going the same way.
""It was only a small gesture (they would not be sharing a car) and nowhere near any sort of reconciliation. However, the late Queen would have approved.""
Elsewhere, the book examines how Charles had to contend with Harry and Meghan's Netflix series as well as the memoir Spare in the early days of his reign. Both William and Charles came under fire in the series, with William accused of ""screaming and shouting"" and Charles of 'lying' at a high-profile summit.
However, according to a pal, Harry's pointed snipe at the Princess of Wales was the ""lowest of the low"" for William, according to a pal. In one of the earlier episodes of the docuseries, Harry said there is a temptation in the royal family to marry someone who ""fits the mould"".
Speaking in the first episode of the Netflix documentary, he said: ""I think for so many people in the family, especially obviously the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mould as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with.""
And according to the book, friends of the Royal Family believed it was clear he was talking about William and Kate. One tells the author: ""On top of all the other breaches of trust, here was Harry making a blatant attack on Catherine. For William, this was the lowest of the low.""
Meanwhile, the book covers the Coronation in great detail, including how the guestlist of almost 2,000 people was drawn in. And it claims that William made a ""direct request"" that the Kate's family the Middletons be in attendance and seated in a pretty high-profile position.
Mr Hardman notes that this was in direct contrast to some of the old guard of the extended Royal Family, with the Queen Mother's family - the Bowes Lyons - having only two members there to represent them.
The author also points out in the book that the Mountbattens - Prince Philip's family - were only represented by Countess Mountbatten, with other relatives left off the guest list entirely. Even Lady Pamela Hicks, one of the former members of the Royal Household under the late Queen, did not attend. However, Michael and Carole Middleton, as well as Kate's two siblings - James and Pippa - were invited and attended the big day that officially marked the start of the new reign.
The end of the book looks towards what William's reign as King may look like - and it suggests that he could end up being the first King not to lead the Church of England in five centuries.
When he becomes King, like his father Charles, he would usually take on the role of Supreme Governor of the Church of England automatically. However, like the vast majority of Brits, William is not a regular worshipper, many of whom are increasingly turning their backs on the historic organisations.
Mr Hardman writes that within royal circles there were already some talks over what would happen with William and the church. The future King is said to greatly respect the church and enjoy attending services at Christmas and Easter but doesn't regularly attend.
This has led to reported speculation as to whether he may consider not taking on the formal role held by the country's monarchs dating back to Henry VIII. Mr Hardman write: ""In royal circles, it is no secret that he does not share the King's sense of the spiritual, let alone the late Queen's unshakeable devotion to the Anglican church.""
A senior Palace figure reportedly added: ""His father is very spiritual and happy to talk about faith but the Prince is not. He doesn't go to church every Sunday, but then nor do the large majority of the country. He might go at Christmas and Easter but that's it. He very much respects the institutions but he is not instinctively comfortable in a faith environment."""
ZLZJ5SKAE2_RX1VFSNCBCR6CBL,Vladimir Putin plots North Korea trip to establish 'International Order' with Kim Jong un,Ryan FaheyNews Reporter,"16:39, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-plots-north-korea-31932780,"Vladimir Putin plans to visit North Korea to establish and international order with the Hermit Kingdom.
The Russian President expressed his willingness to visit the North at an unspecified ""early date"" as the countries continue to align in the face of their separate, intensifying confrontations with the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Ministry highlighted Putin's intent for a visit following North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui's meetings with Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week. The ministry said in a statement published by state media that the two countries agreed to further strategic and tactical cooperation with Russia to establish a ""new multi-polarised international order,"" a reference to their efforts to build a united front against Washington.
Putin had already confirmed his willingness to visit the capital, Pyongyang, at a convenient time during his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Russia's Far East in September. One of the few world leaders openly supporting Putin's war on Ukraine, Kim has been actively boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in an attempt to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing, as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.
In a separate statement on Sunday, the North's Foreign Ministry condemned the U.N. Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country's latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. The ministry said the test-firing on Jan. 14 was among the country's regular activities to improve its defense capabilities and that it didn't pose a threat to its neighbors.
South Korea on Thursday urged the Security Council ""to break the silence"" over North Korea's escalating missile tests and threats. Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia's war on Ukraine.
The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms cooperation, in which the North provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Kim's forces. Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.
North Korea's Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a ""strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order.""
Russia expressed ""deep thanks"" to North Korea for its ""full support"" over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said. It said Choe and the Russian officials expressed ""serious concern"" over the United States' expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea's sovereignty and security interests.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim in recent months used Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up his weapons tests and military demonstrations. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence plans built around nuclear-capable U.S. assets.
In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan last week, as it continued to blame its rivals for tensions in the region.
Choe's visit to Moscow came as Kim continues to use domestic political events to issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict.
At Pyongyang's rubber-stamp parliament last week, Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with war-divided rival South Korea and ordered the rewriting of the North's constitution to cement the South as its most hostile foreign adversary. He accused South Korea of acting as ""top-class stooges"" of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.
Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its status as a nuclear weapons state."
ZSLAVDPGQ8_IWDCWT1XLZYL34M,ITV2 Love Island viewers say 'it doesn't add up' as Molly Smith fumes over ex Callum Jones,Charlotte TuttonSenior TV Reporter,"21:53, 21 Jan 2024",20240121,mirror.co.uk,https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/molly-callum-love-island-split-31933470,"Love Island viewers didn't really understand how a chat between exes Molly Smith and Callum Jones turned into a row on the ITV2 series.
Some viewers even questioned if a comment by Molly hinted she and Callum were secretly still together, amid speculation from fans. Molly ended up storming off as things got awkward between the pair, resulting in some of the girls racing after her to comfort her.
While she seemed emotional, she soon fumed over Callum's comments claiming he was being confusing, and that he failed to see the issue. But Callum had no idea what he'd done wrong, or how their conversation escalated so quickly.
The pair were discussing whether they wanted to get to know other people, or try and fix things after their split just months ago. Callum was telling Molly that he felt like he was doing all the work when it came to having chats or making gestures, with him unclear where Molly's head was at.
He pointed out that she picked him in the recoupling, before claiming she had not bothered to speak to him since. But Molly told him she was still exploring things with others to see what was right for her, keen for him to do the same with the girls.
She then told him, and the girls, that if he wanted to pursue her solely, he needed to be clearer - telling him he was confusing things. Callum thought it was Molly that needed to be clearer though, with him telling her she wasn't trying enough and was confusing him.
Molly ended up storming off, and twice later she was in tears over the situation. Viewers watching at home though were pretty confused about where the row came from.
While some backed Callum, others felt Molly was in the right as viewers tried to figure out whether the pair were still in love with each other, or if they had no intention of getting back together. Taking to X, one viewer said: ""I'm actually sort of with Callum on that .. I'm confused why Molly's gone off like that. What am I misunderstanding?""
Another said: ""Ngl i dont even know why Molly and Callum are arguing rn."" A third fan posted: ""Molly, how can Callum want you back as a safe option, but then you picked him in the recoupling? It's like, what's going on there? It doesn't quite add up.""
Then, Molly made a comment about being unsure over Callum's intentions, leading to a viewer believing the plan was to reunite on the show. One viewer said: ""‘If he came back to rekindle something… in the hopes I’d be here’ quick backtracking from Molly hahaha they’re definitely still together.""
It follows an explosive twist on Friday night as Arabella Chi was announced as a new bombshell, leaving the girls worried in the villa. It was an explosive episode with the first recoupling of the series, where Luis Morrison confronted Mitchel Taylor for 'game playing' amid their love triangle with Demi Jones.
Later in the episode, the Islanders all took part in a pre-loved punk party. However, the party was short-lived as the boys received an explosive text in the villa, saying they had been invited to Arabella's afterparty at the hideaway terrace.
Reacting to the news, Georgia Harrison told the girls: ""I know Arabella, none of us are safe, absolutely not!"" In a VT, Arabella, 32, teased: ""I've been fortunate enough to be able to hangout in Hollywood circles but I still have not found love. I'm Arabella, I was on series five of Love Island. I might have recently of come out of a relationship but I'm ready to meet the man of my dreams so get me back in that villa!""
Taking to Twitter, now X, viewers were quick to predict who Arabella could be going after in the villa or which boys could be pursuing her. One person said: ""Toby is totally going after Arabella. I really feel for Georgia S. #LoveIsland #LoveIslandAllStars!"", a different account put: ""When Arabella goes for Callum and Molly gets jealous #LoveIsland #LoveIslandAllStars"" while a different show watcher added: ""Arabella goes for Callum and makes molly jealous #loveisland #LoveIslandAllStars.""
