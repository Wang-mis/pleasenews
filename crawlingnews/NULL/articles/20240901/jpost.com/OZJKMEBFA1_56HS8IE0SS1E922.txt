Roman Gofman, returned Sunday from Moscow, where he held talks about ways to advance a Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal.Russia has not been an active part of the hostage negotiations, which have been held and mediated by Qatar and Egypt with the help of the United States.Hamas, the main terror group holding the captives, is an Iranian proxy group. Russia has ties with Iran and has quietly engaged in the past in back-channel diplomacy on Israel’s behalf.  Strained ties between Jerusalem and MoscowTies between Jerusalem and Moscow have been strained in the last years due to the Russian-Ukrainian war, and it has been actively critical of Israel and its actions in Gaza.Moscow has also taken seriously the issue of its dual citizens who have been held captives, one of whom, Alexander Lobanov, was among the six hostages Hamas killed three days ago and whose bodies were returned Sunday to Israel.Russia’s Ambassador Anatoly Viktorov posted on X that Moscow deeply regrets that Lobanov was among those victims.“We mourn together with the entire family and loved ones of Alexander Lobanov, especially his mother and father, with whom we have been in constant contact all this time,” he wrote, as he expressed his condolences to the families of the six captives.

Viktorov echoed Moscow’s position regarding the imperative of an immediate Gaza ceasefire.“The position of Russia remains unchanged – not further escalation, but only the earliest possible cessation of hostilities adequately responds to the solution of all pressing humanitarian issues, including the release of all hostages being held in the Gaza Strip,” he said.Netanyahu spoke with Lobanov’s parents, Oksana and Grigory, and apologized to them, the Prime Minister’s Office said.
