Israel is braced to receive a non-negotiable Gaza hostage deal on the table from mediating countries Qatar, Egypt and the United States.“I think that what will happen in the end” is that “there will be a kind of take it or leave” deal which US President Joe Biden would put forward “together with the Egyptians and the Qataris,” Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairman Yuli Edelstein told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday morning.“Then we will have to take a decision” because “it won’t be negotiable again,” he said.  Edelstein speculated that his latest draft could more likely be authored by Qatar and Egypt and might include terms less favorable to Israel, when compared to the bridging proposal the US had put on the table in August.“We are now pretty much on the same page with the Americans. “I think that there will be a Qatari, Egyptian proposal that will be put on the table together with Biden, or coordinated with Biden.Likud MK Yuli Edelstein and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

Edelstein spoke in the aftermath of the return to Israel of six hostages executed by Hamas over the week and as talks for a deal which the US had once described as the “final game,” conversations had failed to immediately produce a final agreement.Edelstein acknowledged that “We have to get out of the situation where we are stuck and do something. I'm not getting into specific details of why, what, or how, but I think that it's not helpful to be stuck for such a long time.”Mossad Chief David Barnea, who has been one of the key figures in the Israeli negotiating team, was in Doha on Monday and spoke with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Thani about a deal for the return of the remaining 101 hostages in Gaza, of which 66 are esteemed to be alive.
